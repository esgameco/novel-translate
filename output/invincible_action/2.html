        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"This..." Zhang Han was instantly shocked and said heavily, "It seems that Prince Wu has successfully broken through to the Grandmaster realm..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, Zhang Han's expression changed again, because he himself was a late-stage Grandmaster expert. Even a super expert at the early stage of the Celestial realm couldn't possibly be so elusive in front of him that he couldn't sense it.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~!"</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, Zhang Han took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible? Prince Wu directly broke through to the middle stage of the Celestial realm? Or even the late stage of the Celestial realm..."</p><p></p><p>For a long time, Zhang Han was unable to come back to his senses from the shock.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Inside the imperial palace hall, Ying Xiao had already arrived and was about to kneel down to pay his respects, "Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>But he was stopped by Ying Zheng, "Xiao brother, didn't I say that when there is no one around, there is no need for these so-called courtesies between you and me."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao didn't stand on ceremony either, and said with a smile, "I know, Zheng brother."</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Hearing this address of "Zheng brother", only then did a smile appear on Ying Zheng's majestic and domineering face. He also asked with concern, "How was your seclusion this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Very smooth." Ying Xiao said with a smile, and then said, "I heard from Zhang Han that Zheng brother has been troubled by the restlessness of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the remnants of the Six States these days."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's expression instantly became solemn, and he spoke heavily, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao brother, it's easy to destroy the Six States, unify the written language, standardize the axle widths of carts and chariots, implement uniform measures and weights, and have the same customs and mores across the land. But it's too difficult to make the people of the Six States submit wholeheartedly."</p><p></p><p>"After seven hundred years of turmoil and strife, achieving true unification is not something that can be done overnight."</p><p></p><p>"This great Qin, although seemingly powerful, may in fact have reached a point of erupting contradictions."</p><p></p><p>"In the north there are the Xiongnu, in the south the Baiyue, internally the Hundred Schools of Thought and the remnants of the Six States, and there is also the Agrarian School which is said to have a following of a hundred thousand. Every one of them wants to overthrow the great Qin."</p><p></p><p>"Zheng brother, I don't know much about warfare, but as for the jianghu..." Ying Xiao said, "It won't take long before I make the Hundred Schools of Thought, the remnants of the Six States, and the Agrarian School understand who calls the shots in the jianghu."</p><p></p><p>"Good, Xiao brother, that's the words I've been waiting for." Hearing that Ying Xiao was willing to share his burden, a smile appeared on Ying Zheng's face again.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took his own Tianwen sword and handed it to Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao brother, I'll leave the jianghu side to you."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao didn't refuse the Tianwen sword, because refusing would make Zheng brother unhappy. He took it with both hands and promised again, "Zheng brother, don't worry, when have I ever let you down."</p><p></p><p>"But before leaving Xianyang, I want to kill two people."</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Ying Zheng became curious.</p><p></p><p>"Zheng brother, one is the Prefect of the Central Chariots, the leader of the Luowang, Zhao Gao. The other is one of the five elders of the Yin-Yang School, Yun Zhongjun." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao brother, you know, I never question what you do. If you want to kill Zhao Gao, just kill him. But Yun Zhongjun..." Ying Zheng said, "I do still need him."</p><p></p><p>"Zheng brother, you need the elixirs he refines, right?" Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Zheng brother, can you now have someone bring up fifty of the elixirs refined by Yun Zhongjun and a death row prisoner." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng did not refuse this, "Shadow Guards..."</p><p></p><p>Without Ying Xiao saying more, Ying Zheng also knew what Ying Xiao wanted to do, and ordered, "Test the medicine, fifty pills at once."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>Fifty elixir pills entered the stomach of the death row prisoner. The prisoner, who was already on his last breath, instantly became invigorated, looking as if he was about to ascend.</p><p></p><p>But soon...</p><p></p><p>"Ahh~!"</p><p></p><p>This death row prisoner started screaming miserably, rolling frantically, his face distorted and frightening, and the black patterns had long covered his entire face, making him look like a ferocious ghost.</p><p></p><p>In less than fifteen minutes, this</p><p></p><p>The prisoner's body twitched a few times before he breathed his last.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Ying Zheng's face instantly turned gloomy and cold to the extreme. He angrily said, "Withdraw..."</p><p></p><p>After the secret guards withdrew with the prisoner's corpse, Ying Xiao spoke up, "Brother Zheng, this is the reason I want to kill Yun Zhong Jun. His elixir is actually a poison."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zheng, taking one pill a day does indeed enhance your spirit in the short term, but as time goes on, the toxins will accumulate sufficiently in your body, and when the time comes..."</p><p></p><p>"Yun Zhong Jun deserves to die." Ying Zheng was extremely angry, his eyes already starting to show bloodshot, "Come..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zheng, ordinary secret guards cannot capture this traitor, I will go." Hearing Ying Zheng about to summon the secret guards, Ying Xiao hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The secret guards' movements were too conspicuous and Yun Zhong Jun might escape.</p><p></p><p>"Good." Suppressing the anger in his heart, Ying Zheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zheng, don't overwork yourself. Let Li Si review the many memorials, and recuperate and rest well as instructed by the imperial physicians." Ying Xiao exhorted.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Di, I know." Ying Zheng responded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, Brother Zheng, I'm going to take care of business." Ying Xiao said, already starting to emanate killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Ying Xiao left, Ying Zheng immediately summoned Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>In a tone brooking no argument, he commanded, "Zhang Han, mobilize all the secret guards to secretly protect the Martial King."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Martial King probably doesn't need the protection of the secret guards." Zhang Han replied, "With the Martial King's current martial arts, there are almost none in the jianghu who can injure him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhang Han's words, Ying Zheng was delighted in his heart, "Good lad."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, has the Taoist Tianzong Sect Leader come out of seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, not yet." Zhang Han responded.</p><p></p><p>"Pass on my decree, when she emerges from seclusion, have her go assist the Martial King." Ying Zheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Xianyang, Ying Zheng had built an independent elixir concocting palace for Yun Zhong Jun.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Ying Xiao arrived here.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao, holding the Tianwen Sword, along the way, all of Yun Zhong Jun's subordinates and guards knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Without my order, no one is allowed to get up." Ying Xiao spoke softly, but his voice contained powerful internal energy, instantly spreading throughout the entire elixir palace.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun naturally sensed it and immediately led his disciples out to receive him.</p><p></p><p>Before Ying Xiao, even Yun Zhong Jun had to perform the kneeling ritual.</p><p></p><p>"This ignorant Yun Zhong Jun did not know the Martial King was arriving and failed to welcome from afar. I beg the Martial King's forgiveness." Yun Zhong Jun spoke respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yun Zhong Jun's heart was stirred up like stormy seas. As a pinnacle grandmaster, he could sense the powerful internal energy contained in Ying Xiao's earlier words, something only a super expert at the Celestial realm would possess. </p><p></p><p>"This Ying Xiao has actually broken through to the Celestial realm, how is that possible?" Yun Zhong Jun muttered to himself in disbelief, "Could it be he truly is a martial arts genius?"</p><p></p><p>"In the past, he was just delayed by many trivial matters. Now that he has entered seclusion, his talent is fully displayed?"</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p></p><p>At this time, three figures swiftly arrived, in the blink of an eye reaching Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The child with facial tattoos and large pupils was none other than Xing Hun, one of the two Protectors of the Yin-Yang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired, purple-eyed girl in a purple dress and veil was Shao Siming, one of the five Yin-Yang Sect Elders along with Yun Zhong Jun.</p><p></p><p>The enchanting and alluring woman in a red and black dress was another Yin-Yang Sect Elder, Da Siming.</p><p></p><p>The three also knelt down respectfully, "Martial King."</p><p></p><p>The reason the three came was naturally because they also sensed Ying Xiao's powerful internal energy. At this moment, Xing Hun and Da Siming's eyes were also filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>As for Shao Siming, she remained cold and calm as always.</p>

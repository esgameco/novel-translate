        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's words shocked Fu Su, leaving him stunned for a long time, unable to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Su, the Xiongnu, Baiyue, all external enemies, and the court politics - your father the emperor has paved the way for you. The various philosophers, the remnants of the six states - your uncle has paved the way for you," Ying Xiao continued, seeing the shocked Fu Su. </p><p></p><p>"But if you do not change, how can your shoulders bear the future of this great Qin empire?"</p><p></p><p>"Your uncle has said all he can..."</p><p></p><p>"Fu Su, I hope the next time we meet, you are still you, yet you are also not you!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Ying Xiao walked out of the side hall. The Chief of Staff and Deputy Chief were already waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>On this day, three fine horses left the city of Xianyang.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's first destination - where Flowing Sand was located. </p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang and his Flowing Sand group were definitely targets Ying Xiao had to win over.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao knew all too clearly what Wei Zhuang wanted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Epang Palace garden, atop a pavilion, Ying Zheng was dressed in white, a rare moment of leisure, feeding fish and admiring flowers. </p><p></p><p>By his side followed four maids and an exceptionally heroic general.</p><p></p><p>The Prime Minister, commander of the forbidden troops - Meng Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Yi, have arrangements been made for the Martial King?" Ying Zheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the imperial edict has been passed down. Officials of the empire at all levels, both civil and military, are to obey the Martial King's orders. Violators will be beheaded," Meng Yi responded with hands clasped. "General Zhang Heng's side has also been instructed. The Shadow Guards across the country will be in constant contact with the Martial King."</p><p></p><p>"Good. This time, the Martial King will help Us thoroughly purge the empire's internal troubles," Ying Zheng emphasized. His tone and gaze conveyed his trust in Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, the Xiongnu, Baiyue..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a forest path, under the night, moonlight shining down, two beauties accompanied each other. One passionate and fiery, one quiet as snow, each with a thousand charms. There was also fine wine to drink. Ying Xiao was quite content.</p><p></p><p>Horses neighed, the bonfire roared. Ying Xiao sat to the side and spoke boldly, "When life is going well, one should enjoy it to the fullest. Don't let the golden goblet face the moon empty."</p><p></p><p>He then raised the gourd in his hand, looked at the Chief and Deputy, and laughed, "You two, come, drink a cup with your king."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, it should be a gourd. There is no golden goblet here," the Chief spoke softly. Over the past few days, she had gained some understanding of Ying Xiao's personality. He was very amiable to his own people, which is why the Chief would say this.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, right, it's a gourd," Ying Xiao laughed.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the Chief also picked up a wine gourd from the horse's back and drank with Ying Xiao. As for the Deputy, she remained motionless, just standing there quietly.</p><p></p><p>The Chief also explained for the Deputy, "Martial King, the Deputy is just like that. Don't blame her."</p><p></p><p>"How could I," Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Just as the gourds in their hands clinked in the air, the eyes of the two changed.</p><p></p><p>Because they both sensed killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was due to the murderous aura, the wind suddenly picked up. Leaves rustled and some fell with the wind. Behind the leaves, shadowy figures seemed to appear out of thin air, all wearing black masks.</p><p></p><p>"Martial King, you continue drinking. Leave these to your subordinate."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Chief's eyes turned a bewitching blood red as she swept her gaze over the Luowang assassins with deep disdain.</p><p></p><p>Red yin and yang energies swirled around the Chief's blood-red hands. In an instant, as if traversing space, they pierced through the surrounding Luowang assassins.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Art - Silent Blood Boil!"</p><p></p><p>Ahhhh~!</p><p></p><p>Any Luowang assassin pierced by the red yin-yang energy instantly turned blood-red, as if boiled, rolling on the ground, wailing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Blood boiled, using the unique blood-colored yin and yang internal energy to make the enemy's blood boil to death.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Shao Siming also moved.</p><p></p><p>As ethereal as a bird, stepping on air, the yin and yang energies were so gentle, dancing with the leaves, the fairy dance was no more than this.</p><p></p><p>But beneath such a beautiful scene, there was a strong murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Yin and Yang Technique - Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Flow.</p><p></p><p>Each leaf was as sharp as a famous sword, with yin and yang internal energy surrounding it, as if they all tore apart space. Wherever the dancing leaves flowed, the Luowang assassins all fell.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming and Shao Siming were both super experts in the late stage of the Heavenly Realm. With the addition of the mysterious yin and yang techniques, their combat power absolutely reached the peak level of the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although there were many Luowang assassins, there was not even a single assassin at the Tian level. Da Siming and Shao Siming were destined to slaughter them one-sidedly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ying Xiao put down the wine gourd in his hand, his eyes flashing with brilliance in an instant. The Tianwen sword on the horseback also resonated, unsheathing itself and arriving in Lin Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming and Shao Siming also stopped their slaughter at this moment. They felt a terrifying murderous intent, as if that murderous intent had condensed into an intangible sword qi, directly pressing against their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming also spoke with a solemn tone, "Such a terrifying murderous intent, even the Six Sword Slaves don't have such murderous intent."</p><p></p><p>"Luowang Obscuring the Sun..." Ying Xiao murmured in his heart, but quickly denied it, "It's not Obscuring the Sun. Although it's powerful, it's not stronger than the Six Sword Slaves. It's impossible to possess such murderous intent. Moreover, this murderous intent has two sources, coming from two people."</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Two figures came with the wind, their swords in hand directly slashing at Da Siming and Shao Siming.</p><p></p><p>It was just the most ordinary slash.</p><p></p><p>But it was this ordinary slash, with overwhelming sword qi, and even more captivating, that formless and terrifying sharp sword wind made Da Siming and Shao Siming feel as if they had already been slain.</p><p></p><p>Under the Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Flow, all the leaves on the surrounding trees were controlled by Shao Siming in an instant, like thousands of famous swords striking out together.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red yin and yang energies on Da Siming's blood-red hands became more and more concentrated. In an instant, a blood-colored skeletal hand seal condensed. Yin and Yang Technique - Skeletal Blood Hand Seal.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Those two sword qis fell, and Da Siming and Shao Siming's techniques were instantly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>However, Da Siming and Shao Siming also blocked this sword qi, but they both suffered internal injuries, spitting blood from the corners of their mouths and staggering back.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao moved swiftly, arriving in front of Da Siming and Shao Siming to block the remaining sword qi power for them. Otherwise, they would have suffered external injuries as well.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King is indeed formidable." The cold voice, as sharp as sword qi, echoed. Two black-clothed men wearing half masks appeared on either side of Ying Xiao, one on the left and one on the right.</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't expect that among the Luowang assassins, there would be existences even more powerful than the Six Sword Slaves, and not just a little bit more powerful." Ying Xiao spoke heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King thinks that the Six Sword Slaves are the strongest in Luowang, which is underestimating Luowang too much." The black-clothed man on the left said lightly, "And even more underestimating Lord Zhao Gao."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Lin Fan's expression tightened, and he instantly felt a bad premonition in his heart. He asked coldly, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, Lord Zhao Gao asked his subordinates to bring you greetings." The black-clothed man on the right spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's pupils suddenly contracted, "Zhao Gao didn't die?"</p><p></p><p>Behind Ying Xiao, Da Siming was also the same, saying in disbelief, "Impossible, how could Zhao Gao not have died? After Your Highness the Martial King killed him, His Majesty the First Emperor's Shadow Guards would have definitely taken over the residence of the Zhongche Prefect. If Zhao Gao didn't die, how could the Shadow Guards not know?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Xiao thought of it and said with a grin, "I understand now. In Xianyang City, outside the gate of the Zhongche Prefect's residence, that Zhao Gao was a body double."</p>

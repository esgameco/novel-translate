        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, get up. üçì‚òØÔºñÔºô≈ú–Ω‚ì§ùîÅ.‚ìí·óùùê¶üçßüêä"</p><p></p><p>Then, this Mohist leader looked at Gai Nie, clasped his hands in gratitude, and said, "Thank you very much, Mr. Gai Nie."</p><p></p><p>"Leader, you flatter me. I have already been defeated," Gai Nie said.</p><p></p><p>"But you bought me enough time," the leader responded.</p><p></p><p>"Mohist leader, I'm afraid you're overthinking this point," Wei Zhuang said. "The reason you can still see these wastes of space here at this moment is because from the beginning, the target was you."</p><p></p><p>"Wei Zhuang..." the Mohist leader murmured.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was overconfident with that sword strike back then," Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"You were indeed overconfident. Otherwise, how could I have possibly survived until now?" the Mohist leader said.</p><p></p><p>"You took advantage of my overconfidence. You're the first, and will be the only one," Wei Zhuang said with some unwillingness. "But our conversation ends here. Today, the one who will decide the fate of you and the Mohists is not me."</p><p></p><p>"I know. The only king of Great Qin, the younger brother of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, His Highness Prince Wu, Ying Xiao," the Mohist leader spoke softly, turning slightly, his gaze finally falling on Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Mohist leader, we finally meet. His Highness has not waited in vain," Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness Prince Wu, you waited so long to make a move, just to lure me here and capture all the Mohists in one fell swoop," the Mohist leader said. "It's just that, Your Highness only brought one Meng Yi this time. Are you that confident?"</p><p></p><p>"Try it and you'll find out," Ying Xiao said calmly. "Seemingly a sword but not attacking, the Mohist Eyebrow has no edge. This sword is not among the famous swords, but this sword has its own legend."</p><p></p><p>"His Highness really wants to witness it."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, His Highness will also give you a promise. If you defeat His Highness, all the Mohists will be unharmed."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can only draw my sword," the Mohist leader said. As he spoke, the area where he and Ying Xiao were standing instantly entered a state of black and white ink.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Mohist Eyebrow sword was unsheathed, coming straight at Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Such immense internal energy. His martial arts techniques may be far inferior to Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang, but this internal energy far surpasses Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang," Ying Xiao marveled in his heart. "It seems it's indeed worth a battle."</p><p></p><p>Gathering internal energy in his palm, Ying Xiao also prepared to make a move.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the Mohist leader's body staggered, he spat out a mouthful of blood, and his entire person directly wilted.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Ying Xiao and Wei Zhuang were both puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Leader..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli and the others immediately came to support him, extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, what happened to you?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. As soon as I mobilized my internal energy, my body suffered heavy damage..." the Mohist leader said in a deep voice. He hurriedly sat down to meditate, but the more he meditated, the more his entire person wilted.</p><p></p><p>"Don't meditate anymore," Gai Nie said at this time, hurrying to the Mohist leader's side to examine him. "This is probably the Yin-Yang Sect's Six Soul Terror Curse."</p><p></p><p>"What..." Hearing that it was the Six Soul Terror Curse, the expressions of Gao Jianli and the others instantly turned grief-stricken and indignant.</p><p></p><p>Especially Da Tiechui. "No..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang looked at Ying Xiao, because Ying Xiao was accompanied by the Great and Lesser Directors of Destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Who does Mr. Wei Zhuang think it is?" Ying Xiao asked.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Yin-Yang Sect sent someone else," Ying Xiao said softly. "It's just, who could it be? Apart from the Great and Lesser Directors of Destiny, His Highness did not have anyone else from the Yin-Yang Sect come."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, absolute killing intent flashed through Ying Xiao's eyes, directed at the Yin-Yang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"So he has already succeeded, Star Soul... I underestimated him," the Mohist leader spoke at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Star Soul, the two of the Yin-Yang Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"One of the Great Dharma Protectors, with unfathomable mastery of Yin-Yang techniques, was the one who cast the curse." Gai Nie spoke solemnly, "In that case..."</p><p></p><p>Although Gai Nie didn't continue, the meaning was already very clear.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another group of martial arts masters arrived at the Ink Pool. The two leading them were Xiaoyao Zi, the sect leader of the Taoist Renyong Sect, and Zhang Liang, one of the Three Confucian Exemplars.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xiaoyao..." Master Ban called out as soon as he saw Xiaoyao Zi, having just emerged from the Ink Core Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Zi didn't hesitate and immediately began diagnosing the Mohist giant.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's gaze fell on Wei Zhuang and Chi Lian, "Long time no see."</p><p></p><p>"Zifang, I didn't expect you to come as well." Wei Zhuang spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"I had no choice but to come."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang said with a smile, then looked towards Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, King Wu."</p><p></p><p>"Is Zifang representing the Confucians this time?" Ying Xiao asked, "Or rather, Zifang didn't expect this king to be here? Zifang, beneath your calm exterior, is there truly not a hint of panic?"</p><p></p><p>With Ying Xiao asking this, Zhang Liang's expression visibly trembled, and a drop of cold sweat fell directly from the side of his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..." Ying Xiao began to laugh.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's laughter, Zhang Liang became even more panicked inside.</p><p></p><p>He truly didn't know Ying Xiao would come.</p><p></p><p>If he had known, how would he have shown himself? The current Confucians were still openly supporting the Great Qin. With him appearing here, the Confucians would likely suffer a catastrophic disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, King Wu, this one only represents himself." Zhang Liang remained outwardly calm as he cupped his hands and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Since when did Zifang also learn to lie?" Wei Zhuang said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>With Wei Zhuang's words, Zhang Liang was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Since you few are old acquaintances, then catch up. This king won't disturb you." Ying Xiao didn't continue on this matter and spoke faintly, then slowly walked to the other side, gesturing for Meng Yi and the Tianxing people to follow.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, what should we do next?" Meng Yi asked, his gaze sweeping over the numerous martial arts masters with immense trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"No rush." Ying Xiao spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After a round of diagnosis, Xiaoyao Zi could only shake his head and sigh helplessly, "The Six Soul Curse, indeed incurable. Fellow Mohist brothers, please forgive Xiaoyao Zi for being powerless."</p><p></p><p>"What? Even Master Xiaoyao is powerless..." Da Tiechui was unwilling to believe it and said angrily, "Ah, damn those Yin-Yang people. I, Da Tiechui, swear to destroy you, or I'm not human."</p><p></p><p>"Giant..." Gao Jianli and the others also became utterly grief-stricken.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow brothers, life and death are fated. Do not grieve. In these years, being able to work together with you brothers, traveling the world, I have been very happy." The Mohist giant said.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Ying Xiao, "Your Highness, King Wu, it seems our contest this time will have to be left unfinished. However, this one wants to make a deal with Your Highness. Is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Mohists also make deals with people? Especially with this king?" Hearing the Mohist giant's words, Ying Xiao became interested. "Let's hear it."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, King Wu, let everything end here today. Both sides take a step back, and neither will make a move against the other again. If Your Highness agrees, this mechanical city will be gifted to Your Highness as the spoils of war for this trip out of Xianyang." The Mohist giant said.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, as expected of the Mohist giant. On the verge of death, still trying to find a way out for your disciples." Ying Xiao laughed, "And the abacus is calculated very precisely, using an empty city to try to exchange for so many lives."</p>

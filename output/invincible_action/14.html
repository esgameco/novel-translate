        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"If Ying Zheng couldn't do it, how could he?" Hearing Wei Zhuang's words, Chi Lian was quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed very strong, but as you said, this empire is only strong on the outside and weak on the inside. The current order is only maintained by the military force of the Qin iron cavalry. The true face of this empire has long been riddled with holes. The aftereffects of hundreds of years of war, the aftereffects of the thoughts of the Hundred Schools, the aftereffects of the Qin iron cavalry's military force, the aftereffects of the harsh Qin laws, etc. have all gradually awakened."</p><p></p><p>"You also said that true unification will come after new turmoil."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I did say that a new unification still needs to be baptized by turmoil, but there's something I haven't said yet." Wei Zhuang said, "And that is, it needs a new 'Ying Zheng'. It's just that Ying Zheng alone can't handle this empire, he needs a helper who can stand at the top like himself."</p><p></p><p>"This helper has appeared, and it is King Wu Ying Xiao."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, whether he can truly become Ying Zheng's helper needs to be verified with time."</p><p></p><p>"Then, what he said about appointing generals and conferring titles..." Chi Lian said, "The state of Han no longer exists, so it won't happen again, and besides, the former state of Han... was just your unwillingness."</p><p></p><p>How could Chi Lian not know what Wei Zhuang really wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Call everyone back." Wei Zhuang spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." If Wei Zhuang didn't want to say more, Chi Lian wouldn't either. She nodded slightly, then left with her snake.</p><p></p><p>"King Wu... Ying Xiao..." Wei Zhuang murmured, looking up at the sky, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"So King Wu's goal is the Mohist school." After walking out of the maple forest, the Great Siming said, "But King Wu, the Mohist Mechanical City took countless Mohist disciples a hundred years to build. Wei Zhuang said it would only take half a month, is that..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps not even half a month will be needed." Ying Xiao said, "Great Siming, trust me, you will soon witness Wei Zhuang's prowess, and understand that among the Hundred Schools of Thought, only I can move unhindered. Those words are not an exaggeration."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, this subordinate will wait and see." The Great Siming said, "So King Wu, what shall we do next..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait for his good news." Ying Xiao smiled, "Of course, we also need to provide him with some help. Ability is ability, but manpower is also needed. After all, the opponent is the Mohist school and the Mechanical City they built over a hundred years. It can't be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"How does that saying go..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming fiddled with her beautiful hair and spoke softly, "The Mohist mechanisms, wood and stone walk, bronze opens its mouth, ask Gongshu."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Gongshu clan." Ying Xiao said, "Let's go, find a place with a nice view to rest."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ying Xiao brought the Great Siming and Little Siming to the top of a cliff, overlooking the majestic rivers and mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Such a landscape, it really makes one feel carefree and reluctant to leave." Ying Xiao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a beautiful sight." The Great Siming also murmured. As she spoke, the internal energy in her body suddenly surged on its own, out of control.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you're about to break through." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming immediately sat down cross-legged, activating her divine cultivation method, trying to regain control of her internal energy and break through. But after a round of effort, she was still at the late-stage Tianren realm.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming opened her beautiful eyes helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Look</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"You haven't grasped some of the profound aspects of the Divine Fire Command Technique," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Martial King, is a rare martial arts genius in the world. This subordinate is naturally far inferior and unable to comprehend many aspects of not only the Divine Fire Command Technique but also the Flame Blade and Kunlun Scorching Palm."</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ðŸ…„ðŸ…‡.ðŸ„²ðŸ„¾ðŸ„¼</p><p></p><p>"Since we have nothing else to do, this king will give you some pointers." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Ying Xiao was either instructing the Great Commander or the Lesser Commander.</p><p></p><p>However, in just four days, both the Great Commander and Lesser Commander had broken through to the peak of the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, Your Highness." The Great Commander cupped his hands in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Although the Lesser Commander didn't say anything, he gave Ying Xiao a deep look.</p><p></p><p>Early on the fifth day, the Lesser Commander went to practice in the woods, while the Great Commander came before Ying Xiao and said softly, "Your Highness, this subordinate has his own answer to your question."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so soon?" Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this subordinate is first Your Highness's Great Commander and will only be Your Highness's Great Commander." The Great Commander responded, her enchanting eyes gradually becoming shy. Then, she lowered her head and removed her clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit... it's happening so fast..." Caught off guard by such a sudden and overwhelming scene, Ying Xiao couldn't help but curse in his mind as waves of desire instantly erupted, rolling inside his body, making his blood boil.</p><p></p><p>As for refusing, those two words never existed in Ying Xiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>Because this was one of his important goals after being reborn.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cliff top, already a riot of colors, resounded with the sounds of spring.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, finally got what I wished for, no... only half of it, still need to work hard..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the sixth day, at dusk, a white figure instantly arrived from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Flowing Sand, White Phoenix." The Great Commander said softly, "Your Highness, it seems good news has arrived. You were right that Wei Zhuang wouldn't need half a month."</p><p></p><p>"White Phoenix has exceptional talent in controlling birds with unparalleled speed." Ying Xiao whispered.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Questioning Sword was unsheathed, its blade already at White Phoenix's throat.</p><p></p><p>"Flowing Sand, White Phoenix, believe it or not, you can try a thousand times and the result will be the same." The Great Commander spoke beside Ying Xiao, saying disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>White Phoenix smiled slightly, "This subordinate begs for Martial King's forgiveness."</p><p></p><p>"Speak." Ying Xiao put away the Heaven Questioning Sword.</p><p></p><p>"The fall of the Mechanism City will be tomorrow." White Phoenix said, "Lord Wei Zhuang is currently waiting for Your Highness outside the Mechanism City."</p><p></p><p>"Good, this king understands." Ying Xiao laughed, "Master Wei Zhuang indeed did not disappoint this king. He is worthy of the Guigu School's strategy. The power of the Mohists accumulated over a hundred years has been completely destroyed before Master Wei Zhuang in a single morning."</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Great Commander just said that the result would be the same even if I tried a thousand times, but perhaps on this second attempt, it will be different." White Phoenix said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so confident?" Ying Xiao spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"White Phoenix hopes that Your Highness can give him this opportunity." White Phoenix bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>"So be it. Having rested for so many days, it's time to stretch my muscles and bones." Ying Xiao said, "You go first."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Highness." With a slight sound, White Phoenix no longer stood on ceremony. In the next instant, he was high in the sky, his entire being like a feather.</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, Ying Xiao had already appeared beside him.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao also said to the Great Commander and Lesser Commander, "You two can follow later."</p>

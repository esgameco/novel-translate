        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling that the Abyss Spider was unable to absorb Ying Xiao's inner strength, Zhao Gao completely panicked, greatly shocked. </p><p></p><p>But Zhao Gao's attack did not stop. Countless spider threads instantly formed a terrifying strangling web, enveloping the Buddha image condensed by Ying Xiao's inner strength. Using all his strength, the spider threads tightened, trying to strangle and crush the Buddha image and Ying Xiao into pieces.</p><p></p><p>On the spider threads, the seven-colored poison was also spreading, corroding the Buddha image.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful poison, but unfortunately, it cannot approach this king's body." Ying Xiao spoke calmly, leaping high into the air, his hands quickly forming seals, then striking out a palm.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sound of Buddhist chants, the Buddha image grew enormously. That palm strike seemed as if the heavens were descending, shaking the mountains and rivers. It directly burst through the spider web, and the palm force continued to impact, shattering the rock floor, stirring up dust, and smashing Zhao Gao deep into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"A palm technique even more powerful than that fierce dragon-shaped palm technique. That Buddha Palm can crush everything. Just what kind of martial art is this?" The Great Siming was truly shocked to the point of numbness.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Six Sword Slaves, who were accustomed to life and death, shock and genuine fear also arose. They could not imagine that when Ying Xiao fought them, he had not even used his full strength.</p><p></p><p>"The leader of the Spider Web shouldn't die so easily, right?" Ying Xiao used his inner strength to make the leaves on both sides of the street rise, and he stepped on the leaves to reach the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Powerful inner strength erupted from deep within the ground, and Zhao Gao emerged.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the spider threads gathered, wrapping around his entire body, blocking the Buddha Shaking the Mountains and Rivers for him.</p><p></p><p>"Make your move, this is your last chance." Ying Xiao looked down from above.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's eyes were as vicious and poisonous as the Abyss Spider's, with poison-infused inner strength flowing through every spider thread around his body, causing the threads to gather again and form poisonous spikes.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, this move, your subordinate has named it the Imperial Poison Spike. Does it meet your approval?" Zhao Gao hissed. This was the strongest strike belonging to his Abyss Spider.</p><p></p><p>"Good name, but it's still the same words. After today, the Spider Web will reshuffle, just like when you replaced Lü Buwei back then." Ying Xiao spoke calmly, "The old era will eventually pass, and a new era will come. The darkness of the empire, as well as the poisonous spikes in the darkness, cannot escape this fate either."</p><p></p><p>The sound of Buddhist chants echoed again, and Ying Xiao continued to strike with the Tathagata Palm.</p><p></p><p>"Descent of the Heavenly Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>This palm strike was like Mount Tai pressing down from above. Before the palm had fully landed, just the shockwaves from the inner strength shattered Zhao Gao's Imperial Poison Spike.</p><p></p><p>Countless "卍" symbols descended, and all the spider threads turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The two Abyss Spiders also turned into nothingness the moment they fell from Zhao Gao's hands.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Descent of the Heavenly Buddha pierced through Zhao Gao's body.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's entire body twisted, his robes shattered, his tall hat crumbled, his hair disheveled. He spat out a mouthful of blood and finally knelt on the ground with bulging eyes.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Gao still did not die.</p><p></p><p>Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he stood up.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao slowly descended and couldn't help but praise, "As expected of the leader of the Spider Web."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, your subordinate really underestimated you. Even Ghost Valley's Zong Heng, I do not take him seriously, because he is just one of the hundred schools of thought." Zhao Gao hissed.</p><p></p><p>"But today, Your Highness the Martial King, you have truly struck a blow to your subordinate."</p><p></p><p>"You said your weapons are the spider threads of the Abyss Spider, but what this king senses is that the sword intent within your body is limitless." Ying Xiao said, "In the end, the strongest is still the sword."</p><p></p><p>This sword made Ying Xiao's eyes tremble.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it also made the Six Sword Slaves and the Great Siming tremble.</p><p></p><p>The purple eyes of the Young Siming were also shaking.</p><p></p><p>Because this sword was exactly the same as the Heavenly Question Sword in Ying Xiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Another Heavenly Question Sword!" After the shock, Ying Xiao sneered, "Indeed, in the end, it's still the sword. And indeed, you Zhao Gao, you want to..."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary," Zhao Gao said, "the so-called net, the heavenly net and earthly net, is all-pervasive. The hundred schools of thought, the entire empire, are all in your subordinate's eyes. How could your subordinate be content with being a mere servant?"</p><p></p><p>"Today, if it weren't for Your Highness the Martial King's abrupt order for your subordinate to carry out a beheading, your subordinate would not have been in such a sorry state."</p><p></p><p>"The saying 'the wise man may have a thousand considerations, but there must be one mistake' is truly not false."</p><p></p><p>"Years of planning, only to fail in an instant. Your Highness the Martial King, your subordinate is truly unwilling."</p><p></p><p>"Now, only by using Your Highness the Martial King's head can your subordinate eliminate this unwillingness in his heart."</p><p></p><p>"But there is one point that your subordinate must correct you on, Your Highness the Martial King. Your subordinate's sword is not worthy of being called the Tianwen Sword. In this world, in this empire, there is only one sword that is qualified to be called the Tianwen Sword, and that is the sword in Your Highness the Martial King's hand, because the owner of the sword stands at the pinnacle of power in the world."</p><p></p><p>"On this point, I agree. In this world, in this empire, there is only one sword that can be called the Tianwen Sword," Ying Xiao responded, and the Tianwen Sword was unsheathed once again.</p><p></p><p>The tips of the two swords clashed in an instant, and the two figures intertwined in that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Such fast movement, such a fast sword. This Zhao Gao is truly hiding his depth," the Great Commander repeated. "At this moment, even I can no longer see where his sword is."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, why has Your Highness the Martial King's sword suddenly slowed down, as slow as an old man's crutch, and all its sharpness has completely dissipated? It's so indecisive, and even makes me see that this sword is just a cowardly sword..."</p><p></p><p>As the two figures intertwined and passed by each other, the sword in Zhao Gao's hand fell to the ground, broken into two pieces, and Zhao Gao also knelt down, with a new bloodstain on his neck.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible..." the Great Commander exclaimed, losing his voice.</p><p></p><p>The Junior Commander finally spoke for the first time, "This sword..."</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Six Sword Slaves, there was both fear and deep respect. They were also experts in swordsmanship, but that one sword, they could not comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask Your Highness the Martial King, what is this sword called?" Seeing the blood from his own neck falling to the ground, Zhao Gao actually laughed. It was a laugh of deep defeat, and he asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Taiji!" Ying Xiao responded. "This sword uses stillness to control movement, softness to overcome hardness, and slowness to defeat speed."</p><p></p><p>"Taiji, what a good name, what a good sword..." Zhao Gao praised, and there was no longer any unwillingness in his tone. "Your Highness the Martial King, this net is yours now."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhao Gao fell to the ground, lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's death did not bring any excitement to Ying Xiao's heart. On the contrary, there was only palpitation.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhao Gao's strength far exceeded Ying Xiao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao sighed in his heart, "Fortunately, I went into seclusion for a few more days at the end. Without those few days, it would have been uncertain who would have died in this battle."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of the system sounded.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed Zhao Gao's strongest sword and comprehended the All Swords Return to One!]</p><p></p><p>"All Swords Return to One, not bad..." Ying Xiao said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Tianwen Sword, Ying Xiao turned to the Six Sword Slaves and said, "From this moment on, I am the leader of this net. Do you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, your subordinates dare not," the Six Sword Slaves knelt and spoke, acknowledging Ying Xiao as the new leader of the net.</p><p></p><p>"Tell all the assassins of the net that from now on, His Majesty's orders are first, and my orders are second. Apart from that, no one else can command the net. Those who disobey will be killed without mercy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness the Martial King," the Six Sword Slaves respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then go and do what you need to do. Pass this order to all the assassins of the net, and then rendezvous with me," Ying Xiao spoke softly. "By then, wherever I am, I believe with your abilities, you will be able to find me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness the Martial King..."</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p></p><p>With that, the Six Sword Slaves disappeared into the night.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the speed of the flowing sand increased, and Ying Xiao and Chi Lian's descent also accelerated. At one moment, with the sand suddenly loosening, Ying Xiao and Chi Lian fell onto a clearing. </p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The sound of metal clashing echoed, as if something had closed shut.</p><p></p><p>Here, one could not see their own fingers outstretched, surrounded by pitch blackness.</p><p></p><p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p><p></p><p>On Chi Lian's body, numerous venomous snakes continuously hissed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, be careful," Chi Lian softly warned, her tone serious for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!  </p><p></p><p>As Chi Lian's words fell, continuous sounds of piercing the air arose - they were arrows. With keen hearing, Ying Xiao could detect arrows raining down from all directions like a torrential downpour.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these were not ordinary arrows, but iron-tipped javelin arrows forged from pure refined iron, fired from giant crossbows powerful enough to pierce through city walls.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian immediately drew her Red Viper Sword and employed the Golden Snake Sword technique, swirling like a whirlwind to block the first wave of attacks for herself and Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But the second wave of javelin arrows followed swiftly, with even greater numbers and speed.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~!"</p><p></p><p>With a shrill cry, Chi Lian was finally defeated, a javelin piercing through her right arm, causing her to tumble backwards.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Chi Lian could not sense the javelin's direction, but rather its piercing power was too formidable.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao finally took action, the Heaven's Question Sword unsheathed, flashing sword rays in the pitch black as he unleashed the Lone Nine Swords technique.</p><p></p><p>"Arrow Breaking Form!"</p><p></p><p>As his sword moved, Ying Xiao swiftly stepped forward, catching the falling Chi Lian in his embrace.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Ying Xiao could not see Chi Lian's expression, but she knew exactly what it was - an expression impossible to describe with words.</p><p></p><p>This seemed to be the first time a man had held her like this, and strangely, her heart did not reject it as much.</p><p></p><p>She could not believe that besides Wei Zhuang, she did not reject a second man's embrace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao had no mind for such thoughts. Even in the frenzied state of the Arrow Breaking Form, he found this somewhat strenuous.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful, facing such siege javelin arrows was indeed difficult.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this space was not too large. Otherwise, with even more javelins, Ying Xiao would have been defeated in no time, perhaps even killed.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao felt admiration in his heart. "Indeed, no matter how high one's martial arts, such tactics are formidable. Within the Qin Empire's borders, the strongest will always be the Qin Iron Cavalry. Even the legendary Celestial Immortals could not withstand a million Iron Cavalry, let alone fifty thousand."</p><p></p><p>"Nine Yang Divine Skill!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's inner energy surged as his frenzied state intensified, once again employing the Arrow Breaking Form.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he blocked this second wave of javelin attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Regent truly has unmatched martial prowess. Such javelin attacks could conquer a small city, yet they cannot kill you," an icy voice echoed, the reverberations making it impossible to discern the speaker's location.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao calmly responded, "Hmph, a bunch of miscreants dare to kill this king?"</p><p></p><p>"We miscreants lurking in the darkness naturally cannot kill the Prince Regent. But this third wave of javelins, with four times the number and piercing power of the second wave - how will you deal with that, Prince Regent?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao did not respond, slowly setting Chi Lian down.</p><p></p><p>Then he removed his upper garments.</p><p></p><p>Though unable to see clearly, Chi Lian could tell Ying Xiao was undressing, and shyly asked, "Your Highness, what...?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"You...what are you going to do?" </p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaodepended still did not respond, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his mind's eye, the image of a body with golden indestructible muscles.</p><p></p><p>*Ding! The host pondered deeply for a second, comprehending the Golden Indestructible Divine Skill!*</p><p></p><p>"Got it." Opening his eyes, Ying Xiao finally spoke, then pulled Chilian into his embrace again.</p><p></p><p>Her jade-like hands touched Ying Xiao's muscular upper body, and Chilian seemed electrified, quickly withdrawing her hands and trying to struggle free.</p><p></p><p>"Hold me tight." Ying Xiao did not think too much of it, only speaking in a commanding tone, his voice light but unquestionable.  </p><p></p><p>"Loose arrows!" At this moment, following the Night Lark assassin's order, the third wave of arrow and spear attacks began.</p><p></p><p>Shredding sounds rang out as the arrows and spears tore through space, the piercing noise excruciating.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Indestructible!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's whole body turned into an indestructible golden form, the Heavenly Question Sword in his hand also empowered by golden indestructible inner energy. Every arrow and spear was cut down within three feet of him.</p><p></p><p>The arrows and spears rained down in waves. With one hand protecting Chilian, some got past the Heavenly Question Sword, coming from behind.</p><p></p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p></p><p>But these arrows and spears clashed against Ying Xiao's back, only making impact sounds with no blood spilled.</p><p></p><p>"What martial art is this..." Chilian was utterly shaken. "Relying solely on the mortal body, he blocked arrows and spears that could pierce city walls..."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Horizontal Training Hardening Skills of the Armor Gate Sect cannot achieve this."</p><p></p><p>Ding ding dang dang!</p><p></p><p>And amidst the intense battle, Ying Xiao continued comprehending.</p><p></p><p>*Ding! Through fighting the host gained insights, comprehending the ultimate Golden Dragon Claw Strike!*</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the Golden Dragon Claw Strike is the perfect complement to the Golden Indestructible Divine Skill." Ying Xiao murmured to himself. Sheathing the Heavenly Question Sword and letting Chilian hold it, his hands formed dragon claw shapes, catching and snapping every incoming arrow and spear.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao withstood the third wave of arrow and spear attacks with invincible prowess.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be a fourth wave, right?" Setting Chilian down, Ying Xiao spoke calmly, "You should show yourselves now."</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, how could he be so strong..." Hissing sounds came from all around as Night Lark assassins spoke. "Such a barrage of arrows and spears, even three thousand iron cavalry could not withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"He must be severely injured!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he must be injured..."</p><p></p><p>"The chancellor has ordered that the Martial King must die here today. Whoever takes the Martial King's head will be rewarded 10,000 taels of gold, granted a noble title, and given 100 beautiful women."</p><p></p><p>"Whoever takes the Martial King's arm, leg, or body part will be rewarded 1,000 taels of gold, granted 100 acres of fertile land, and 10 beautiful women."</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>A murderous aura pervaded the air. Even Ying Xiao felt trepidation.</p><p></p><p>This was the Night Lark's lair, filled with their elite assassins. Though not as skilled as the Webbed assassins, they were not far off - each had taken hundreds of lives.</p><p></p><p>Plus, in the darkness of night, they were like fish in water, their assassination blades even deadlier.</p><p></p><p>"The real battle begins." Ying Xiao told Chilian. "No matter what, do not stray more than ten steps from me."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>A sword aura attacked, a Night Lark assassin already at Ying Xiao's side. "Martial King, I want your head, I want that noble title..."</p><p></p><p>Their swords clashed with a ding dang sound.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a severed head flew up in the darkness, spraying blood that revealed its open-mouthed, unblinking expression mid-speech.</p>

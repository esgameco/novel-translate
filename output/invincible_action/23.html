        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Great Iron Hammer, Little Gao, Snow Woman, to you all, I owe an apology. ‚ò∫üêØ‚ûÖÔºô‡∏£ùêáùïåùï©.ùìíùì∏ùì∂üí≤üêâ"</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu is not wrong, the one who should have been assassinated was Yan Chunjun..."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yan Dan left completely. </p><p></p><p>Towards Yan Dan, Xiang Xiao naturally wanted to kill him, because truly, he really disliked this person.</p><p></p><p>But it's still that same saying, he couldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, now that he had brought these Mohist leaders under his control, he could not kill even more so. These Mohist leaders still had great use for Xiang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, not killing Yan Dan was absolutely a punishment for Yan Dan, or even a heavier punishment - to let him see the true Zheng Ge, let him see the true Great Qin, let him see the true realm under heaven. </p><p></p><p>In the future one day, he would find that there was no place for him to exist under this heaven, and his so-called dreams would be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xiang Xiao also could not let Yan Dan leave alone, but it was inappropriate to dispatch the Celestial Executioners to follow him, and they couldn't watch him either. So Xiang Xiao had prepared a countermeasure long ago.</p><p></p><p>That was to also let Gai Nie return to Xianyang.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Ge did indeed need an expert like Gai Nie to protect him.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Gai, this prince needs you to immediately return to Xianyang as well, I wonder if that's possible?" Xiang Xiao said to Gai Nie, "Because the Shadow Guards are not opponents for the Luo Wang assassins, above the Celestial rank there are even elder-level assassins."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed..." Gai Nie said heavily, "I had guessed before that Luo Wang had even stronger assassins, but had no evidence to report to His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"How strong are the elders?" Wei Zhuang asked curiously.  </p><p></p><p>"Able to kill six Sword Slaves in an instant," Xiang Xiao responded.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's expression instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu, this matter should not be delayed. This subject will set off immediately, and can go together with Yan Dan," said Gai Nie, as the successor of Guiguzheng, how could he not understand Xiang Xiao's intention, so he also mentioned Yan Dan.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then I'll trouble Mr. Gai Nie with His Majesty's safety," Xiang Xiao said with cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all..." Gai Nie hurriedly responded, "Only, Prince, that child..."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Gai Nie can just bring him along," Xiang Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to Prince Wu..."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Wei Zhuang, you can send off your martial brother then," At this time, Xiang Xiao also said to Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang nodded slightly, following Gai Nie out of the Mohist Pool.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhuang, what did the Prince mean by having you come out?" After leaving the Mohist Pool, Gai Nie immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gai, although there is one thing I don't want to admit, but I also have to admit it - in sword talent, I am a bit inferior to you, and this bit is the difference between heaven and earth," Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"In today's battle, I should have lost."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Gai Nie didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"You should have noticed that my Traversing Sword art is not the Guiguzheng Traversing Sword art. Even our teacher may not be able to reach this level of Traversing Sword art," Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Prince Wu transmitted it to you?" Gai Nie said gravely.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"King of Thieves, Dao Tao, so how about you, do you want to stay here forever, or..." Inside the Mohist Pool, Xiang Xiao asked Dao Tao.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe...Prince Wu, your words 'the emperor breaks the law and is punished as a commoner' really shook this subject," Dao Tao laughed. "Moreover, with Miss Rong, Little Gao, Snow Woman..."</p><p></p><p>"So this subject also has no reason to refuse you. It's just that this subject also wants to ask you for a promise."</p><p></p><p>"This prince's light body skills?" Xiang Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be a copyrighted section from a novel. However, I can summarize the main points without reproducing the copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a scene where a character named Ying Xiaodian is observing and learning martial arts skills from several other characters - a thief named Dao Bi, a man named Da Tiechu√≠ who uses a thunder hammer technique, a woman named Xue N√º who plays a flute, and a man named Gao Jianl√¨ who practices sword techniques. </p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaodian seems to have an extraordinary ability to comprehend and replicate these skills just by observing them being performed. The excerpt mentions him "comprehending" or "realizing" the essence of the various techniques like wind leg skill, thunder hammer skill, an ocean melody played on the flute, and a proud cold sword technique.</p><p></p><p>There are also some hints that Ying Xiaodian may have ulterior motives regarding the relationships between Gao Jianl√¨, Xue N√º and himself. But I cannot quote or reproduce the specific copyrighted text related to those suggestions.</p><p></p><p>I hope this general summary is still useful without infringing on any copyrights. Let me know if you need any clarification on the points I could convey.</p>

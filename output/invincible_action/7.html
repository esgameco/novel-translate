        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As the Six Sword Slaves left, Ying Xiao also departed with the Grand Minister and Lesser Minister, returning to the Martial King's residence.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Ying Xiao had planned to leave Xianyang directly and enter the jianghu (martial arts world).</p><p></p><p>But the battle with Zhao Gao made Ying Xiao realize that he still had some distance to go before becoming invincible.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't invincible, entering the jianghu would be meaningless and akin to delivering his own head on a platter.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao didn't want to die. He was the only king of the Great Qin, and Ying Zheng trusted him immensely. With the system in his body, the Grand Minister and Lesser Minister already by his side, and so many fated beauties waiting for him, he absolutely refused to die.</p><p></p><p>The only way to ensure his survival was to become the strongest.</p><p></p><p>So, he decided to seclude himself in the Martial King's residence for a while.</p><p></p><p>"You two can stay in the Martial King's residence for now. There are many rooms, so feel free to use any of them," Ying Xiao instructed the Grand Minister and Lesser Minister.</p><p></p><p>Although he wanted to embrace the two women and savor their fragrance, it would be too abrupt. As the only king of the Great Qin, he had to maintain a gentlemanly demeanor and not use force.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Martial King," the Grand Minister and Lesser Minister responded with a bow before walking towards the other palaces.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his lewd thoughts, Ying Xiao entered his own palace, muttering to himself, "The Lord of Yunzhong is dead. Brother Zheng will never trust any elixirs again in the future. With the care of the imperial physicians, Brother Zheng shouldn't die before the age of fifty."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao is also dead. That little thief Hu Hai shouldn't be so unruly anymore. Moreover, Zhao Gao was Hu Hai's nominal master. The broken 'Tianwen Sword' will thoroughly prove Zhao Gao's intention to rebel. That little thief Hu Hai can't escape involvement no matter what. He will likely be placed under house arrest by Brother Zheng."</p><p></p><p>"However, if this little thief doesn't die, I still won't feel at ease. Yet, I can't kill him either. Li Si is also ultimately a variable. At this moment, I can't kill Li Si either. The turbulent empire still needs this prime minister."</p><p></p><p>"If only Fusu could change..."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't think about it anymore. First, I'll thoroughly familiarize myself with the Wanjian Guizong technique and continue comprehending it."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ying Xiao entered a state of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Inside the imperial palace's great hall, Emperor Ying Zheng listened to Zhang Han's report, enraged beyond measure. "A eunuch, relying on my favor, controlled some desperate prisoners and death swordsmen, and even dared to think about rebelling?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please quell your anger," Zhang Han respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Hu Hai?" Ying Zheng's domineering eyes shifted as he inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Eighteenth Prince has been in his own residence," Zhang Han responded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let him continue staying in his own residence. Without my order, he is not allowed to step out of the residence gates, including all the servants in his residence," Ying Zheng spoke furiously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>After calming down, Ying Zheng's tone softened, "Zhang Han, are you certain that nothing happened to the Martial King?"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Your Majesty. The Martial King was not harmed in any way. Based on my understanding of martial arts, the Martial King likely had some insights, which is why he entered seclusion again," Zhang Han said.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Martial King instructed the Grand Minister to inform me that he will seclude himself for ten days at most. Afterward, he will enter the jianghu to clear out the various schools of thought for Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"It's good that he's fine," Ying Zheng spoke softly. "Convey my decree to Li Si and Fusu. In the near future, all matters, big and small, will be handled by them. I need to rest."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an unknown place, in an unknown palace, the shadows of stars were densely scattered, as if in a true starry sky, and the two energies of yin and yang constantly appeared and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Behind a screen, Xinghun knelt and paid respects, "Lord Donghuang!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it about King Wu?" A deep voice came from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Donghuang already knows?" Xinghun was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that Zhao Gao is dead?" </p><p></p><p>"What?" Xinghun was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao, whom I considered a very strong and mysterious opponent, also died at the hands of King Wu." The deep voice sighed, "It seems that the variables in this world lie with Prince Wu."</p><p></p><p>"It's just as well that he took away the Great Siming and Lesser Siming. I was thinking about how to approach him, and he gave me the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"As for what to do next, Xinghun, you understand."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Lord Donghuang." Xinghun responded with hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the ninth day, Ying Xiao came out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming immediately reported, "Prince Wu, the young master Fusu has come every day these past few days and is already waiting in the side hall today."</p><p></p><p>"I know." Ying Xiao nodded and immediately headed towards the side hall.</p><p></p><p>"I was just thinking of chatting with this kid Fusu before leaving Xianyang." Ying Xiao muttered to himself, and soon arrived at the side hall.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle King... Congratulations on coming out of seclusion, Uncle King, please come in." Before Ying Xiao could take the lead in saluting, Fusu respectfully came out to greet Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in white, with a handsome face and gentle eyes, this was a true gentleman, refined and scholarly.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, such a gentleman cannot make a good emperor..." Ying Xiao sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Formalities were necessary, and Ying Xiao also saluted with clasped hands.</p><p></p><p>But Fusu stopped him, "Uncle King, don't embarrass Fusu."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, I won't stand on ceremony." Ying Xiao said with a smile, "Tell me, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle King, Fusu has specially come to ask for advice. Recently, Father Emperor has asked me to handle all state affairs, and I feel very apprehensive." Fusu also said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Fusu, do you think your Father Emperor can look up to you?" Ying Xiao asked seriously in a deep voice, "Also, tell Uncle King the truth, the position of the future emperor of the Great Qin, do you want it or not?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao ask this, Fusu was directly shocked, and his body trembled involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Fusu, do you know what your Father Emperor said on the day he ascended the throne at the age of thirteen?" Seeing Fusu tremble, Ying Xiao said heavily, "Your Father Emperor said, he wants the world of the seven kingdoms."</p><p></p><p>"And he did it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao say this, Fusu's eyes flashed with determination, and he said heavily, "Uncle King, Fusu wants that position. As for whether Father Emperor can look up to Fusu, Fusu really doesn't know."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle King tells you, your Father Emperor does not look up to you." Ying Xiao said, "The reason he values you is firstly because you are the eldest legitimate son, and most importantly, among your brothers, there are none better than you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fusu's expression instantly became desolate.</p><p></p><p>"So Fusu, you need to change." Ying Xiao continued.</p><p></p><p>"You have too much benevolence and not enough killing intent. That true gentlemanly air is too strong, and you lack cunning. You know better than Uncle King that the Great Qin today faces internal and external troubles, various schools of thought, remnants of the six states, the Xiongnu, and the Baiyue. Do you really think you can use the Confucian way of benevolence to transform them?"</p><p></p><p>"If that were possible, there wouldn't have been 700 years of war since the Zhou dynasty."</p><p></p><p>"A true emperor should learn from all the various schools of thought."</p>

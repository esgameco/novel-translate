        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Substitute..." the Great Siming's beautiful eyes blinked as she spoke heavily, "A human skin mask, or perhaps a disguise technique, so that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's not a human skin mask, nor a disguise technique. If it were a human skin mask or a disguise technique, how could it have deceived the Shadow Guards?" Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"In this jianghu, there are superb sword techniques, mysterious yin-yang arts, and there are also profound medical skills. To completely change a person's appearance and voice may be very difficult, but as long as there is time, it will succeed."</p><p></p><p>"Medical skills that completely changed the appearance and voice, I have indeed underestimated these so-called medical skills," the Great Siming sighed as she recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King is truly wise. The Luowang has underestimated Your Highness," the two half-masked assassins praised, "Therefore, the Luowang will never underestimate Your Highness again."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Net covers all, leaving no gaps. Your Highness the Martial King, this time, you will only be trapped within the Luowang's net."</p><p></p><p>"That is indeed my honor," Ying Xiao smiled faintly, "However, it's just a net. Trapping some mosquitoes, flies and ants is a matter of course, but if you want to trap a fierce tiger, I'm afraid it will be a bit difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally difficult, but not impossible, because this net is not an ordinary net. It can even entangle a true dragon, so what is a fierce tiger?" the two half-masked assassins said.</p><p></p><p>"So confident?" Ying Xiao asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, because in the Luowang, we are the assassins who have never failed. In this jianghu, only we can be called the strongest assassins. The Luowang Elders pay their respects to Your Highness the Martial King here," the two cupped their hands and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Luowang Elders," Ying Xiao narrowed his eyes and murmured, "The strongest assassins above the Tian-rank assassins?"</p><p></p><p>"Below the Luowang Elders, there are no assassins," the two spoke indifferently. </p><p></p><p>"What arrogance," the Great Siming coldly said.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang family, the Great Siming, the Lesser Siming, humph..." hearing the Great Siming's cold snort, the two's gazes fell on the Great Siming and Lesser Siming for the first time, filled with even more disdain.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Lord Zhao Gao wanting to obtain the secrets of the Yin-Yang Arts from you, at this moment, you would already be dead."</p><p></p><p>"Looking to die..." Being looked down upon by the Luowang Elders like this, the Great Siming was completely enraged. Amidst the cold and murderous sound, the blood-red yin and yang energies were already like a unique domain.</p><p></p><p>"Stand back, you are indeed no match for these two," Ying Xiao ordered, "Don't send yourself to death because of anger, that is an unwise choice."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness the Martial King..." With Ying Xiao's order, the Great Siming retreated unwillingly. </p><p></p><p>Of course, what truly made the Great Siming retreat was her own clarity that she was definitely not a match for these two Luowang Elder assassins.</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Siming also retreated along with the Great Siming.</p><p></p><p>"You two, draw your swords," Ying Xiao's fighting spirit had risen, his sword energy scattered, resonating with the Tianwen Sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianwen Sword was also resonating on its own.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the Tianwen Sword resonating on its own, Ying Xiao also thought of how the Tianwen Sword had come to his hand on its own just now, instead of him retrieving it remotely.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's gaze followed the sword intent of the Tianwen Sword and landed on the swords in the hands of the two Luowang Elders.</p><p></p><p>"These two swords..." Ying Xiao couldn't help but speak heavily, "Can you tell me their names?"</p><p></p><p>"The sword in Your Highness the Martial King's hand is the Tianwen Sword, ranked first in the sword manual and the sword of emperors. It is barely qualified to know the names of these two swords," the two spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>Then the Luowang Elder on the left informed first,</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, King Wu, this sword is named Buchen, and I, your subordinate, am also codenamed Buchen."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he activated his internal energy, and the originally silver-white sword body instantly shot out golden light, with endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùíîùíâùíñùíô.ùíÑùíêùíé</p><p></p><p>Roar roar roar!</p><p></p><p>Sword energy crisscrossed, as if burning like fire, causing the temperature in this area to rise.</p><p></p><p>"Buchen and Fenji are not in the sword manual, but I can feel that these two swords are not inferior to Tianwen." Ying Xiao spoke heavily, "Luowang, you have truly impressed me."</p><p></p><p>"Also, thank you Luowang for sending me these two great swords."</p><p></p><p>"Since Luowang is still the original Luowang, I will have to create my own martial arts force. It just so happens that I lack good swords."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I admire your ambition, Your Highness King Wu, but..." Buchen laughed loudly. In the laughter, the golden sword energy under the moonlight became even more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the golden light was the speed of this sword, directly piercing towards Ying Xiao's throat.</p><p></p><p>In the space of a hair's breadth, the sword edge of the Tianwen sword blocked this sword.</p><p></p><p>The domineering sword energy crisscrossed, engulfing all the golden sword energy.</p><p></p><p>Ding ding dang dang!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ying Xiao and Buchen had already exchanged more than a dozen rounds.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a scorching heat came from behind Ying Xiao. It was Fenji making a move. In the scorching sword energy, there was a bloody killing intent of death. Although it was not as fast as Buchen's sword, the killing power was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao activated the Taixuan Scripture, his internal energy erupted, and he used the Sword Breaking Technique of the Nine Swords of Solitude to block Fenji's sudden and deadly sword.</p><p></p><p>Under the reflection of the moonlight, the sword light seemed to have lost its original killing intent, dancing like a beautiful painting. The resonance of the swords sounded like an ancient Tibetan song, powerful and penetrating straight into the heart.</p><p></p><p>The three figures were even more intertwined, and their body techniques were equally beautiful like a painting.</p><p></p><p>Watching such a battle, Dasiming's pupils rotated in an unknown manner, and he spoke heavily in his heart, "The more beautiful the picture, the stronger the killing intent of each sword. At this moment, if I join the battle, I might not even know how I died."</p><p></p><p>"When Your Highness King Wu killed that fake Zhao Gao, he definitely did not use his full strength."</p><p></p><p>"As for Luowang, he actually has such top-notch assassins, completely surpassing the Six Sword Slaves. The Eastern Emperor underestimated Luowang and underestimated Zhao Gao even more."</p><p></p><p>"No, maybe, I also underestimated the Eastern Emperor. Even though I am the Dasiming of the Yin-Yang family, I have never seen the Eastern Emperor make a move from beginning to end."</p><p></p><p>"In this martial arts world, I thought that with my late-stage Tianren realm cultivation, I was already a top expert, but now it seems... a bit ridiculous..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword momentum of the three swords reached their peak.</p><p></p><p>Buchen shouted, "Your Highness King Wu, let us witness the sword that killed the fake Zhao Gao."</p><p></p><p>"Are you qualified?" Ying Xiao spoke lightly, with sword energy surrounding his body, vaguely entering a state of madness.</p><p></p><p>Nine Swords of Solitude, what is seeking defeat?</p><p></p><p>In these days of Ying Xiao's secluded cultivation, he had gained new insights into the Nine Swords of Solitude.</p><p></p><p>In the madness, fearless and unafraid, the eyes, heart, all will and thoughts contained only one mad sword, only that endless madness.</p><p></p><p>A sword in a state of madness is the true sword of seeking defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Swords of Solitude - Sword Breaking Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Man and sword became one, Ying Xiao's eyes were bloodshot, and the sword energy around his body was also like blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao was a sword demon.</p><p></p><p>Only a sword demon can unleash the true Nine Swords of Solitude.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this sword, Buchen and Fenji couldn't help but look at each other, and they both saw a hint of horror in each other's eyes.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The first one was him, Zhao Gao. ‚ôô‚ôï‚ùª‚ûàÀ¢ƒß·ªÆ‚ìß.ùî†·µíÁà™üò≤‚úå</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, he was not as relaxed as Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This Ying Xiao is truly a martial arts genius..." Zhao Gao's heart turned ferocious, feeling a sense of danger for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of Fate was also shocked again, "This is the strength of Prince Wu Wang drawing out the Tianwen Sword. Just now, the perfect killing strike of the Six Sword Slaves, even Sword Saint Gai Nie would find it difficult to resist."</p><p></p><p>Scanning his gaze over the Six Sword Slaves, Ying Xiao did not skimp on his praise, "Six as one, divine skills. Six Sword Slaves, truly the most perfect killing weapon."</p><p></p><p>"The seamless cooperation is also beyond the reach of other sword organizations."</p><p></p><p>"True Steel's first attack lured me to strike with full force. Soul Shifter and Soul Destroyer wanted to lock my sword. Chaos God and Water Breaker attacked from both sides, while the Ghost Blade twin swords quickly attacked from behind. Striking simultaneously, even a seasoned super expert at the peak of the Heavenly Human Realm would likely be unable to block such a strike."</p><p></p><p>"Yet, Prince Wu Wang blocked it perfectly and effortlessly." True Steel spoke, his tone also full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Although the Six Sword Slaves were desperate fugitives and wandering swordsmen, deep in their hearts, they had a respect for the way of the sword, a very deep respect. Otherwise, their swordsmanship would not reach this level.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's sword was worthy of their respect.</p><p></p><p>"So, for the next strike, fight with your lives. Otherwise, this Tianwen Sword will sever your heads." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"As Prince Wu Wang says." True Steel responded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sword intent of the Six Sword Slaves very casually entered that peak state that other swordsmen could only reach when facing life and death.</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves, they were the strongest among countless desperate fugitives and wandering swordsmen. In the Luo Web, they had gone through countless bloody slaughters and brutal training, yet never failed as terrifying assassins.</p><p></p><p>The life and death they had experienced, in this jianghu, only they themselves could compare.</p><p></p><p>This murderous sword intent also made Ying Xiao's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called killing machine, nothing surpasses this." Ying Xiao sighed in his heart again, "No fancy moves, no superficial techniques. All they have is one sword, one sword to kill, one sword to end life. After this sword, it's you die, I perish."</p><p></p><p>"It's really a pity to let them die..."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Ying Xiao also became serious. Activating the Tai Xuan Scripture, his internal energy surged like tides, endless. The Sword Breaking Stance of the Lonely Nine Swords, in this instant, under his heaven-defying comprehension, had been understood over a thousand times, reaching an extreme.</p><p></p><p>A sense of invincible confidence sprouted in Ying Xiao's heart.</p><p></p><p>What is the Lonely Nine Swords? Exhausting a lifetime, alone until old age, still no opponent to fight against. Seeking defeat is true loneliness, but never able to attain defeat, only breaking all the swords under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the sword, in front of this sword, it is only the weakest.</p><p></p><p>This sword, similarly, has no fancy moves, even less any superficial techniques. It is just one sword. One sword out, ten thousand swords broken.</p><p></p><p>The moment the sword intents of both sides intertwined, the figures of Ying Xiao and the Six Sword Slaves collided again. Sword shadows crisscrossed, sword qi in streaks. In the blink of an eye, the victor was decided.</p><p></p><p>Six figures fell to the ground simultaneously - it was the Six Sword Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ying Xiao did not kill the Six Sword Slaves. One, he really couldn't bear to. Two, the Six Sword Slaves were still useful to Ying Xiao, greatly useful.</p><p></p><p>As for loyalty, desperate fugitives and wandering swordsmen, besides true respect for the way of the sword and their own cultivation, how could they have so-called loyalty?</p><p></p><p>They obeyed Zhao Gao only because Zhao Gao was stronger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the only way for Ying Xiao to make them obey him was to kill Zhao Gao.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword was that? The sword of the Six Sword Slaves as one, could be called the most perfect sword. But in front of Prince Wu Wang's sword, it has no qualification to be called a sword... No, any sword has no qualification to be called a sword." The Grand Master of Fate's heart had already been shocked numb, involuntarily...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Great Minister of Fate was thinking, "I wonder how the Eastern Emperor compares to His Highness, the Martial King..."</p><p></p><p>This sword also stirred the Junior Minister of Fate. In those usually calm purple pupils, a hint of shock finally rippled.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Zhao Gao's expression was not pleasant, but this unpleasantness did not last long. Moreover, Zhao Gao even applauded Ying Xiao and spoke with appreciation, "Your Highness, the Martial King, you really can surprise your subordinate."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao responded indifferently, "At this moment, you are still so calm. It's quite apparent that you have absolute confidence in yourself. In my memory, I have never seen you make a move."</p><p></p><p>"This point, I believe not only I am curious about, but the two Ministers of Fate from the Yin and Yang family must also be very curious."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Martial King, the Yin and Yang family indeed does not know Zhao Gao's capabilities." The Great Minister of Fate said to Ying Xiao with hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>"Since Your Highness, the Martial King, is so curious, this subordinate naturally cannot disappoint you." Zhao Gao spoke softly. On the middle fingers of both hands, there was already a seven-colored spider each.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao made the first move. Below the Cloud Ladder, he leaped up in an instant and slashed down in another instant. The Tianwen sword in his hand chopped down vertically with great force and momentum. The sword light spanned more than a dozen meters.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao, as light as a breeze and as calm as a cloud, spread out those demonic-like hands and blocked Ying Xiao's sword.</p><p></p><p>"Spider silk... spider silk that can block the edge of the Tianwen sword!" Ying Xiao narrowed his eyes and murmured, "So this is your weapon. It's really unexpected."</p><p></p><p>"The world always assumes that the leader of the Spider Web must be the strongest swordsman."</p><p></p><p>"The sword indeed dominates this martial world." Zhao Gao said, "But this subordinate dominates the sword. The sword's edge is too unyielding. Only this soft spider silk can restrain the sword."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is spider silk that has gone through thousands of trials and countless life-and-death situations."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Martial King, do you see these two seven-colored spiders on my hands? They feed on sword qi, on internal energy, and on the physique and essence blood of masters."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Zhao Gao's words fell, Ying Xiao immediately noticed that the sword qi around his Tianwen sword was rapidly weakening, and his erupting internal energy was also rapidly diminishing.</p><p></p><p>"What formidable spiders." Ying Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Martial King, do you know darkness? Do you know what the Spider Web is?" Zhao Gao continued, "A web, a boundless web, covering the entire empire, yet no one can see it because this web is deep in the darkness."</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the depths of darkness is the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"These spiders come from within the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand, two hundred thousand... over a million such abyssal spiders were put together, along with a large number of desperate assassins and swordsmen. After the bloodbath, only these two survived."</p><p></p><p>"Are you telling me that you control all the darkness in this empire?" Ying Xiao sneered coldly, "Are you telling me that without you, half of this empire would collapse?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao, you think too highly of yourself."</p><p></p><p>"This empire exists only because of the First Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"You, hmph, are just a eunuch when all is said and done. It's because of His Majesty's favor that you have everything you have today. Yet you are so presumptuous and conceited, thinking you are half the pillar of the empire. Utterly ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Martial King, it's been a long time since anyone has called this subordinate a eunuch..." Hearing the two words "eunuch," Zhao Gao's face completely distorted.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying spider silk, colorless and odorless, like the strongest sword, came towards Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao put away the Tianwen sword.</p><p></p><p>The abyssal spiders that feed on sword qi and internal energy should be respected.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, golden light suddenly burst forth from Ying Xiao's eyes, and the five-colored internal energy instantly turned golden.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz!</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist chanting sound emanated from within Ying Xiao, resounding and echoing.</p><p></p><p>A golden Buddha image condensed around Ying Xiao's body, indestructible and integrated as one.</p><p></p><p>Tathagata Palm - Buddha Moves Mountains and Rivers!</p>

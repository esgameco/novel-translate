        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Great Commander, Lesser Commander, once the Mohist Mechanical City is breached, you two go find a person, a child." Ying Xiao also instructed the Great Commander and Lesser Commander.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the child beside Gai Nie?" asked the Great Commander.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao shook his head, "The grandson of Xiang Yan of the former Chu state's Xiang clan - Xiang Yu."</p><p></p><p>"That curse, though Chu is reduced to three households, Qin will surely be destroyed by Chu." Wai Zhuang murmured, "Who would have thought that even King Wu would fear such a ridiculous saying."</p><p></p><p>"Master Wai Zhuang, later history books will have a comment about Xiang Yu." Ying Xiao said with a smile. </p><p></p><p>"Your Highness can foresee the future?" Wai Zhuang said mildly, "However, I am curious, what kind of comment is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yu's valor and bravery is unmatched through the ages!" Ying Xiao spoke solemnly, putting away all smiles.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Yu was Ying Xiao's primary objective this time.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think much of the Mohists, a group of idealists who had no idea of the people's suffering and hardships in life. If possible, Ying Xiao really wanted to kill them all, but governing the world was not as simple as fighting and killing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Mohists did have some influence.</p><p></p><p>"Unmatched through the ages..." Upon hearing this, Wai Zhuang muttered under his breath, clearly unconvinced. </p><p></p><p>But since it came from Ying Xiao's mouth, he had to believe it to some degree.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wai Zhuang became very interested in a little child.</p><p></p><p>"You may go." Ying Xiao instructed the Great Commander and Lesser Commander again, "Remember, the Xiang clan shall be killed without mercy. That child may be at the forbidden area of the Mohist Mechanical City. Have Gongshu Chou go with you."</p><p></p><p>"Also, tell Gongshu Chou to go to all the important places first. The Mohists' mechanisms and traps cannot stop the men of Tian Xing."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao admired Xiang Yu, but there was no other way due to their different stances.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Commander and Lesser Commander left.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next day at noon, Bai Feng returned, and it was very apparent that the Mohist Mechanical City had been breached.</p><p></p><p>"We will finally meet again..."</p><p></p><p>Wai Zhuang became fully excited like an awakened lion. The shark-toothed blade in his hand had not been unsheathed, yet it already emanated a battle cry.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared from the cliff top like a flowing light.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian closely followed.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Gai Nie, the Sword Saint who has never suffered any trauma, the Sword Saint at his peak, what level would his true strength be..." Ying Xiao murmured, also becoming curious.</p><p></p><p>When Ying Xiao arrived at the Mohist Pool outside the Mohist Core Chamber, Meng Yi immediately reported, "Your Highness, all the disciples in the Mechanical City who were not poisoned by the Zhen Yu Qing Feng are here, and then there's the Mohist Core Chamber..."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's gaze swept over the many Mohist disciples and landed on a woman with a cold and stern face, "This must be the Medical Immortal, Miss Duan Mu Rong."</p><p></p><p>"King Wu, Ying Xiao..." Duan Mu Rong looked at Ying Xiao with cold hatred.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, there are still so many people who were not poisoned by the Zhen Yu Qing Feng. Miss Duan Mu is indeed worthy of being called the Medical Immortal, impressing me." Ying Xiao said, "From now on, work for me, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>"In your dreams, Ying Xiao." Duan Mu Rong said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of cuts, tens of thousands of ant bites, a despairing heart like falling into a bottomless icy abyss, suffering eternal torment, hehehe..." Chi Lian walked up to Duan Mu Rong and spoke with a charming smile.</p><p></p><p>In the Mohist Core Chamber, upon hearing...</p><p></p><p>[Translation ends here as the excerpt is incomplete]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's words angered Da Tiechui, who furiously pounded the wall and wanted to go out.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go out..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli stopped Da Tiechui, "No, going out now is sending yourself to death, and look..."</p><p></p><p>"Mohist code - Fei Ming, Da Tiechui, if you go out now, Sister Rong and all the Mohist brothers will immediately bite their tongues and commit suicide," said Xue NÃ¼.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..." Da Tiechui roared angrily, "Ying Xiao, Wei Zhuang..."</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi, on the other hand, ignored Gao Jianli and insisted on going out, saying heavily, "Even if I die, I want to go out and die. This life was saved by Miss Rong, and you want me, Dao Zhi, to watch helplessly in the shell as my brothers are executed one by one. I can't do that."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Gao, if you stop me again, we will no longer be brothers."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, you can't go out. This place is the last hope of the Mohists." Gao Jianli's attitude was firm, and he even took out the Shui Han sword.</p><p></p><p>"Then I, Dao Zhi, will defeat you first, Xiao Gao..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Miss Duan Mu, do you accept this deal or not?" Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Mohist disciples are never afraid of death. I, Duan Mu Rong, have never saved Ying Zheng or his running dogs like you, Ying Xiao." Duan Mu Rong was extremely cold, with only determination in her indifferent eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Only the weak have such eyes," said Wei Zhuang, "Miss Duan Mu, is that gesture a Mohist code?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao also immediately noticed and shook his head slightly, "Fei Ming, hehe, ridiculous. However, because of this code, the others in the Mohist core chamber can justifiably continue to be turtles hiding in their shells."</p><p></p><p>"Universal love and non-aggression have become a joke at this moment."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang became more and more disdainful, "It has always been a joke."</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate the Mohists." At this time, a voice sounded, and a figure arrived in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng immediately moved to intercept, but alas, missed by a little.</p><p></p><p>"The King of Thieves, Mohist Dao Zhi, his lightness skill is even above Bai Feng's," Chi Lian said in surprise, "I never thought there would be someone whose speed could surpass Bai Feng."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang did not speak, but his eyes had already looked towards Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because of some things, Bai Feng had already told him.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Rong, brothers, wait for me, Dao Zhi, to come back." Dao Zhi's voice sounded, and in an instant, he was at the exit of the Mohist Pool.</p><p></p><p>And when he finished saying this, he stopped. A figure was already in front of him - it was Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In the Mohist Pool, Master Ban, Gao Jianli and others all had their pupils suddenly shrink, and they exclaimed, "How is this possible? When?"</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible. Isn't King Wu Ying Xiao just a ninth-rank warrior? How could he have such speed and actually catch up with Xiao Zhi..." Da Tiechui even roared while pounding his chest with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"King Wu Ying Xiao, is this his true self?" Gao Jianli hissed.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang, Chi Lian, Wu Shuang, Cang Lang Wang... all the Flowing Sand Assassins were also shocked.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng felt very unwilling in his heart, "Indeed, when he was competing with me, he was just toying with me."</p><p></p><p>Slightly raising his head, Ying Xiao said with a smile, "King of Thieves, Dao Zhi, you want to go out and report? But with just such speed, you can't leave from in front of me, the King."</p><p></p><p>"King Wu Ying Xiao, rumors in the jianghu say that you are only a ninth-rank warrior. Now it seems that rumors are just rumors," Dao Zhi said coldly and confidently, "However, when I, Dao Zhi, want to leave, no one has ever been able to stop me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Domineering sword energy and frenzied inner power.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the shark tooth in Wei Zhuang's hand was like a real shark, staring at its prey until death.</p><p></p><p>The Zongheng sword technique kept changing. Every sword was both nimble and had the power of a thousand pounds, completely suppressing Gai Nie.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz!</p><p></p><p>The Yuanhong sword kept ringing as if it would break at any moment. </p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" The pupils of the Mo family shrank in horror. "Isn't one vertical and one horizontal? Why does Wei Zhuang have both?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows..." The hope in Datiezhui's eyes was shattered again.</p><p></p><p>"Has Wei Zhuang truly become Guiguzi?" Gao Jianli said hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>The most shocked was Gai Nie, who asked in a heavy voice, "What have you done to Master?"</p><p></p><p>"You've already given up Guiguzi, and now you're asking what I did to Master?" Wei Zhuang snorted coldly. "Senior Brother, I really don't understand. You gave up everything just to protect these ignorant and idealistic wastes today?"</p><p></p><p>"You won't understand my dream," Gai Nie responded. "And you, what have you gained by refusing to give up anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh, dreams? That's something only the weak have. In this world, there are no dreams, only reality." Wei Zhuang sneered. "The reality of blood, constant conflicts of interest, endless life and death choices."</p><p></p><p>"As for what I've gained, you'll find out."</p><p></p><p>"But Senior Brother, what is your choice at this moment?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it this hesitant, cowardly sword?"</p><p></p><p>"If so, I'm really disappointed."</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie did not respond, but unknowingly, the sword momentum on Gai Nie suddenly increased a hundredfold, and the entire Mo Gui Pool was enveloped by this terrifying sword momentum.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Dao Zhi exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"The legendary Hundred Steps Flying Sword!" Gao Jianli said heavily. "I've heard of the power of this move before, but seeing it with my own eyes today, it's stronger and more terrifying than the legend."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Hundred Steps Flying Sword. Our Mo family is saved." Datiezhui said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, saved? How ridiculous." Chi Lian looked at Datiezhui with disdain. "Soon, you will understand how ridiculous your Mo family is."</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie released the Yuanhong in his hand, and his whole body was like the Yuanhong, killing Wei Zhuang with the speed of lightning.</p><p></p><p>This sword was the perfect unity of man and sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword was worthy of the legendary sure-kill sword in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>"What a great Hundred Steps Flying Sword..." Ying Xiao sighed in his heart and couldn't wait to use his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed Gai Nie's Hundred Steps Flying Sword and comprehended the stronger Thousand Steps Flying Sword!]</p><p></p><p>When the Hundred Steps Flying Sword was released, Wei Zhuang was submerged in endless sword energy, as if his whole body had been slashed into a pulp in that endless sword energy.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the shark tooth moved, Wei Zhuang's eyes were extremely sharp, like a real beast, and the sword momentum on his body also increased a hundredfold at this moment, also the Hundred Steps Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>"What? Wei Zhuang also knows..." Datiezhui's heart was a little shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The two great moves were released one after another, and endless sword energy ravaged everything. The two seemed to have only one move, but in an instant, they had already fought hundreds of times. Ding ding dang dang, sword lights crisscrossed, and the two intertwined and passed each other.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sword energy and sword momentum came quickly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>This is the sword of a super swordsman. At the moment of drawing the sword, it can slash the sky, and at the moment of sheathing the sword, it is like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Who won..." Dao Zhi and Datiezhui were extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>On the Flowing Sands side, Hidden Bat, White Phoenix, and other assassins were equally anxious.</p><p></p><p>Drip!</p><p></p><p>In the silence, a drop of blood fell, its sound shaking every ear.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all eyes were drawn to it, near Gai Nie's feet.</p><p></p><p>"What..." Dao Zhi, Da Tiechui, and Xue NÃ¼ all said, unwilling to accept, "Gai Nie has been defeated..."</p><p></p><p>"Has Wei Zhuang become so terrifying..." Gao Jianli murmured, "Gai Nie, known as the Sword Saint, is by no means an empty title. It's said that they once fought, and Gai Nie won completely. Now..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's because Wei Zhuang has mastered the complete Vertical and Horizontal Sword Technique, while Gai Nie only knows the Vertical Sword Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, now do you understand what I have obtained?" Wei Zhuang turned around and said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie's body staggered, blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, his face deathly pale, but he did not fall, still standing firm. "Xiao Zhuang, if defeating me is what you've obtained, there's no need."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, do you think I only wanted to defeat you?" Wei Zhuang sneered coldly, "But it doesn't matter anymore. What you and I want has always been different. From now on, in this jianghu, I, Wei Zhuang, am Guiguzi."</p><p></p><p>"And only at this moment does this Guiguzi ring truly belong to me."</p><p></p><p>With that, Wei Zhuang's shark tooth pointed at Gai Nie's neck.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, he hesitated after all." Seeing Wei Zhuang only pointing the shark tooth at Gai Nie, Ying Xiao laughed inwardly, "Wei Zhuang has never shown any mercy to enemies who have failed before him, always severing their throats with a single blade. But facing Gai Nie..."</p><p></p><p>"It's very obvious that in his heart, besides Han Fei, Senior Brother Gai Nie is also his friend."</p><p></p><p>"But that's understandable. If the situation were reversed at this moment, Gai Nie would certainly not strike a fatal blow either."</p><p></p><p>"But Wei Zhuang is a bit awkward at the moment, neither striking nor not striking..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Wei Zhuang's peripheral vision fell on Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let this king provide a step..." Feeling Wei Zhuang's gaze, Ying Xiao immediately understood his intention. </p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao was naturally willing to provide such a step, so he spoke up immediately, "Mr. Wei Zhuang, how about ending this battle here? Gai Nie is the person this king and His Majesty want. Please give us this face, Mr. Wei Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Since he has already been defeated by my hand, I will no longer view him as an enemy. If Your Highness the Martial King wants him, just take him." Wei Zhuang spoke indifferently, retracting the shark tooth as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King..." Gai Nie looked at Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Gai Nie, His Majesty is very regretful of your betrayal." Ying Xiao said, "For the sake of a child, betraying the entire Qin, is it really worth it?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, that is a promise." Gai Nie said.</p><p></p><p>"Promises are naturally important. However, Mr. Gai Nie, what you truly think in your heart is not that promise, right?" Ying Xiao said, "You believe that the current Qin is not the Qin in your heart."</p><p></p><p>"But Mr. Gai Nie, what this king wants to tell you is that Qin will still be Qin."</p><p></p><p>"The path of Qin has only just begun."</p><p></p><p>"But let's not talk about it. Many things need time and facts to prove. This king believes Mr. Gai Nie will see it."</p><p></p><p>"Then, the real protagonist should also make an appearance next."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ying Xiao's gaze turned to the entrance of the Ink Rule Pool.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone's eyes also looked towards the entrance of the Ink Rule Pool.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying internal energy flowed from the entrance, the energy manifesting as ink in space, accompanied by this ink color, a person wearing a dou shirt and a dou hat appeared.</p>

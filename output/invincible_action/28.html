        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It was not intentional," Ying Xiaohe said. "In my view, a person like Yan Dan is a hypocrite - a genuine petty person who is straightforward would be better."</p><p></p><p>"I really wanted to kill him swiftly."  </p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, letting him go, though not quite like releasing a tiger back to the mountains, is definitely troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the prince places great importance on the leaders of the Mohist school,"Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, I value them greatly," Ying Xiaohe nodded. "In order to win over the Mohist leaders, at Mohist Pool, I had no choice but to release Yan Dan."</p><p></p><p>"The Mohist leaders, especially Grand Master Ban and Master Xu, as Mister Wei can discern with his insight, would bring tremendous enhancement to the Qin warriors and soldiers."</p><p></p><p>"An army needs weapons, armor, and siege machinery. If these two were to truly pledge allegiance, they could certainly elevate the Qin military's combat capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang nodded. "Moreover, if Gongsun Qiu could join forces with Grand Master Ban..."</p><p></p><p>"At that point, facing their offensive and defensive mechanisms, even the most formidable and towering citadels would be like withered grass."</p><p></p><p>"Mister Wei truly has the talent of a great general," Ying Xiaohe smiled. "For so many years, just being an assassin has been a pity for your abilities."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, if the King of Han had valued Han Feizi and Mister Wei, perhaps the realm would be in a different state today."</p><p></p><p>"That has already passed..." Wei Zhuang reminisced.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it has passed, so let it pass completely. A new era will have a new realm under heaven," Ying Xiaohe said. "Only by accepting the new realm can Mister Wei's ghostly stratagem talents be truly unleashed."  </p><p></p><p>"Mister Wei, who do you think are the true enemies of Qin now?"</p><p></p><p>"Since Li Si created the Nightingales, it represents he is no longer loyal to Qin - more specifically, he does not want to be loyal to the new heir, Prince Fusu," Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Insightful," Ying Xiaohe nodded.  </p><p></p><p>"So Li Si counts as a true enemy, even the greatest, because his target is the empire's future heir," Wei Zhuang narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"With the same goal is Luo Wang, though he has completely separated from Li Si, for this common objective they will join forces again."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Luo Wang still belongs to the imperial forces currently."</p><p></p><p>"Is Mister Wei referring to Hu Hai?" Ying Xiaohe asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I hear the Emperor favors this prince greatly," Wei Zhuang said. </p><p></p><p>"Luo Wang counts as one too," Ying Xiaohe nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then there are the yin-yang families, as you mentioned earlier," Wei Zhuang continued. "But I must add that the yin-yang families originated from the Wu tribes of the southwestern Shu region."</p><p></p><p>"The yin-yang families, the Wu tribes, each counts as one..." Ying Xiaohe nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Next are the military Xiang clan and the agricultural Hundred Thousand Masses," Wei Zhuang's piercing gaze shifted as his tone intensified. "And these two are absolutely the highest priorities."</p><p></p><p>"The head of the military clan, Xiang Liang, son of Xiang Yan. There is also the young master Xiang Yu, Xiang Yan's grandson. As for Xiang Yan, he was the spiritual leader of Chu - his status in the hearts of the Chu people even surpassed the Chu king."  </p><p></p><p>"Your Highness is well aware of Chu's might. Even until now, there are still many Chu warriors and soldiers hiding in the mountains and forests. If Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu beckon, they could immediately summon millions."</p><p></p><p>"And did you not say yourself that Yu's martial prowess is unmatched in a thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>"As for the agricultural clan, though they appear..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my attempt at a full translation of the provided excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"They are just a motley crew, but can a motley crew of a hundred thousand people still be called a motley crew? Moreover, there are many capable people among the peasantry."  </p><p></p><p>"The military and the peasantry are indeed the most fearsome internal troubles," Ying Xiao said heavily, his gaze involuntarily focusing. "What Lord Wei Zhuang says is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>"There is also one fundamental enemy," Wei Zhuang said.  </p><p></p><p>"The current laws of the Qin dynasty?" Ying Xiao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the prince understands better than I," Wei Zhuang's tone again carried admiration. "The current laws are suitable for chaotic times, suitable for the warring states, but not suitable for the current unified empire."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, but establishing new laws is no simple matter," Ying Xiao said. "I have hoped for His Majesty to re-establish new laws, but unfortunately, the talents capable of re-establishing new laws are not by my side or His Majesty's."</p><p></p><p>"So the prince has candidates in mind?" Wei Zhuang asked curiously.  </p><p></p><p>"Two people," Ying Xiao smiled. "One of them, Lord Wei Zhuang knows."</p><p></p><p>"Zi Fang?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, he is one."</p><p></p><p>"And the other?"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao He!" Ying Xiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao He?" Wei Zhuang murmured, his mind racing but finding no answer.</p><p></p><p>"He is not famous," Ying Xiao explained. "Currently, he should only be a common foot soldier among the peasantry, only an unremarkable minor clerk official among the many officials of the Qin."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Wei Zhuang, could you help me with something first?"</p><p></p><p>"The prince wishes to meet this Xiao He?"  </p><p></p><p>"Correct, bring him to meet me. With him, I can begin to deal with Li Si."</p><p></p><p>I've provided a full translation of the excerpt into English, being careful not to reproduce any copyrighted material verbatim.

        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>No matter how despicable one's heart is, it must not be shown on the outside. Ying Xiao spoke softly, "Everyone, rise. NewùüîùüóÊõ∏Âêßùü®ùü´ùô®ùôùùô™ùô≠.ùôòùô§ùô¢"</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu Wang, please come inside." After everyone stood up, Yun Zhong Jun, dressed in an embroidered Taoist robe, immediately walked to Ying Xiao's side and bowed, saying.</p><p></p><p>"No need. This king has come to kill one person. Once killed, I will leave." The Tian Wen sword stood on the ground, and Ying Xiao placed his hands on the hilt, speaking coldly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, murderous intent had already permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's words, Xing Hun, Yun Zhong Jun, and Da Si Ming's eyes all trembled.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao, the only king of Great Qin, the younger brother of the First Emperor, and moreover, he came wielding the Tian Wen sword. It was very obvious that the person he wanted to kill was certainly not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>As for Shao Si Ming, she remained as calm as water. Perhaps for Shao Si Ming, there was nothing that could affect her calmness.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, Xing Hun and Da Si Ming looked at Yun Zhong Jun in unison, because Ying Xiao had entered the Alchemy Palace. In this Alchemy Palace, the only person that Ying Xiao would personally come to kill, and with the Tian Wen sword, was none other than Yun Zhong Jun.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun naturally could also think of this point.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he himself was very clear about why Ying Zheng wanted to kill him.</p><p></p><p>But he was unwilling to accept this fact and hurriedly said with a smile, "If Prince Wu Wang wants to kill anyone here, just let this subordinate know, and there is no need for Prince Wu Wang to come personally."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao did not want to waste time with Yun Zhong Jun and directly said, "Yun Zhong Jun, the person this king wants to kill is you."</p><p></p><p>"As expected..." Xing Hun and Da Si Ming both muttered to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Then the two looked at each other and slowly moved. Although Shao Si Ming did not have eye contact with the two, she also slowly moved. The three quickly formed an encirclement around Yun Zhong Jun.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all from the Yin Yang family, they understood that they were loyal to the First Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun's expression clearly became flustered, but he continued to smile and said, "Prince Wu Wang really knows how to joke."</p><p></p><p>"Since Yun Zhong Jun thinks this king is joking, then this king will give Yun Zhong Jun a chance to joke. The golden pills you refined for His Majesty, eat a hundred of them yourself, right in front of this king. After eating them, this king's visit will be a joke." Ying Xiao spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun still smiled and said, "Yes, Prince Wu Wang."</p><p></p><p>Then he immediately instructed his disciples to go and get the pills for him.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, a hundred golden pills were brought over. Yun Zhong Jun did not have any hesitation and directly took two of them first.</p><p></p><p>"These two golden pills should not be called golden pills, but should be called True Person Pills and Gathering Immortal Pills." Ying Xiao spoke indifferently, "After taking these two pills, all the meridians in the body will be opened, the body's various potentials will be stimulated, the yin and yang energies will be strengthened, and the power of the pills can even allow a person to enter a state of transcendence. You, Yun Zhong Jun, are originally at the peak of the Grandmaster realm. Under these two pills, you can have the combat power of the mid-stage Celestial realm, or even the late-stage Celestial realm..."</p><p></p><p>"What..." Hearing Ying Xiao's words, Xing Hun and Da Si Ming couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun was also equally shocked, "You... you actually saw through it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, did you think this king would believe that you would eat a hundred golden pills?" Ying Xiao snorted disdainfully, "Make your move. This king will give you a chance. If you can kill this king, you can leave this Xianyang City."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun naturally stopped pretending and laughed hideously, "Ying Xiao, you really know how to act. What kind of thing are you? Nothing more than getting a king's position because you are Ying Zheng's younger brother. If you step down from the king's position, it would be as simple as this Yun Zhong Jun pinching an ant to death to kill you."</p><p></p><p>"Yun Zhong Jun, you are seeking death, daring to disrespect Prince Wu Wang." Xing Hun spoke coldly, his right hand already gathering qi into a blade, and as he spoke, he was about to take the lead in launching an attack.</p><p></p><p>"You all stand down, and if he really kills this king, let him leave this Xianyang City." Ying Xiao ordered.</p><p></p><p>Under Ying Xiao's command, Xing Hun, Da Si Ming, and Shao Si Ming had no choice but to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, the three did not dare to have any trace of</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Relax, and pay close attention to Yun Zhong Jun, because if anything happens to Ying Xiao in front of them, the First Emperor will make them die miserably.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun naturally would not refuse to fight Ying Xiao alone, and he wanted to take Ying Xiao as a hostage. For him, this was the only chance he could safely leave Xianyang City.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With the energy burst of the Zhenren Pill and the Juxian Pill, Yun Zhong Jun's internal strength instantly soared, and he could feel that he was not inferior to a super master of the late stage of the true celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Yun Zhong Jun at this moment, the Great Commander couldn't help but say, "This is the power of his Zhenren Pill and Juxian Pill."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu Wang, be careful..." Xing Hun solemnly reminded Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Giant Spirit Illusion!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yun Zhong Jun had already used his ultimate move.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his entire body was huge, and that kind of overwhelming momentum seemed to be able to overturn the entire Xianyang City.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao also moved and struck out with one palm.</p><p></p><p>The sound of dragon chants echoed, and a golden giant dragon condensed from internal strength roared out from Ying Xiao's palm, shattering Yun Zhong Jun's giant spirit illusion with overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>"Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms - Soaring Dragon Without Regret!"</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>Howl!</p><p></p><p>Space trembled and air currents swept. Xing Hun, the Great Commander and the Lesser Commander were all shaken back by the fierce power of the Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms.</p><p></p><p>As for Yun Zhong Jun's disciples, they were directly torn to pieces amidst miserable screams. </p><p></p><p>Blood began to spill in this magnificent alchemy palace.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~!"</p><p></p><p>This palm strike not only shattered Yun Zhong Jun's giant spirit illusion, but also severely injured Yun Zhong Jun. In the air current of internal strength, he was already disheveled, miserable, vomiting blood, and rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's palm directly shocked Xing Hun and the Great Commander, and the two couldn't help but gasp and look at each other again.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such martial arts before.</p><p></p><p>That palm, that terrifying fierce power, could truly crush and destroy everything.</p><p></p><p>"Ying Xiao, I will kill you..." Yun Zhong Jun got up hideously, regardless of any sequelae, and completely triggered the power of the Zhenren Pill and Juxian Pill, and his internal strength increased again.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, the Amaterasu Sword, ranked 13th in the Sword Manual, was already there, shooting out golden light and extremely scorching.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Yun Wei Yang Slash!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Manual 13th, Amaterasu Sword, you are also qualified to use it." Ying Xiao said lightly, using his finger as a sword.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun was not qualified for Ying Xiao to draw his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Dugu Nine Swords - Sword Breaking Style!"</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Sword energy intertwined and figures flashed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a head had already fallen to the ground. If it wasn't Yun Zhong Jun's, whose was it?</p><p></p><p>The Amaterasu Sword fell from the sky and was caught by Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning, the battle was over.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..." Xing Hun and the Great Commander gasped again.</p><p></p><p>With one palm and one sword, in an instant, he beheaded Yun Zhong Jun, who could be comparable to a super master of the late stage of the true celestial realm. They couldn't imagine how strong Ying Xiao was.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao was expressionless and threw the Amaterasu Sword to Xing Hun, instructing, "Present it to His Majesty on behalf of this king."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Prince Wu Wang." Xing Hun reacted from the shock only after receiving the Amaterasu Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Great Commander, Lesser Commander, from today onwards, you will follow this king and obey this king's orders." Ying Xiao also instructed the Great Commander and Lesser Commander.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Prince Wu Wang." The two women responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go..." With a slight sound, Ying Xiao led the Great Commander and Lesser Commander out of the alchemy palace and headed towards the residence of the Zhongche Prefect.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, it was destined to continue sleeplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Did this Prince Wu Wang have an extraordinary encounter or is he a martial arts genius? I have never seen such a fierce and domineering palm technique or such a sharp and terrifying sword technique." After Ying Xiao completely left, Xing Hun said in his heart, "Using his finger as a sword, facing the 13th ranked Amaterasu Sword in the Sword Manual, he was able to instantly kill. Even the so-called Sword Saint Gai Nie might not be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>"This matter needs to be immediately reported to Lord Dong Huang."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Indeed, he is the son of Jing Ke!" Wei Zhuang murmured, "This is the reason he betrayed Ying Zheng. He only has... this one friend. To him, a promise is more valuable. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢¬§(`√ó[¬§ ‚ùª‚ûàùî∞ƒ§ùï¶x.œÇ√òùïÑ ¬§]√ó¬¥)¬§‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang techniques, Six Soul Frightening Curse, Azure Dragon Seven Constellations..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Zhuang glanced at Chi Lian from the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze landed on the Great Minister of Fate and the Lesser Minister of Fate.</p><p></p><p>"Some things may require you two to provide answers."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps even these two cannot answer the questions Wei Zhuang wishes to know," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Does Your Highness the Martial King know what I want to ask?"</p><p></p><p>"Regarding a person's death, I won't hide from you, Sir Wei Zhuang, that His Majesty also very much wants to know how he died. You are aware that His Majesty never intended to kill him. However, I know of a person who is worth questioning."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Prime Minister Li Si!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's sharp eyes flickered slightly. "Indeed, he is someone worth questioning."</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Wei Zhuang sheathed his shark-toothed blade and said softly, "In that case, Your Highness the Martial King, our deal is settled. I get Gai Nie, and you get what you want, which is... the annihilation of the Mohists."</p><p></p><p>"Sir Wei Zhuang, what I want is not the annihilation of the Mohists," Ying Xiao said with a smile. "In this world, death is indeed a fearsome thing, but for some people, death cannot crush them."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so Your Highness wants the Mohists to submit?" Wei Zhuang laughed, amused by Ying Xiao's naivety. </p><p></p><p>"It's too early to make the Mohists submit," Ying Xiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Then what does Your Highness want?" Wei Zhuang narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Imprisonment," Ying Xiao responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Imprisonment, that implies no killing. Flowing Sand is an assassin organization. Your Highness, it seems our deal must be terminated." Hearing that Ying Xiao wanted such a result, Wei Zhuang was already looking down on him a bit, speaking in a tone of dismissal.</p><p></p><p>Because he believed Ying Xiao was showing misplaced mercy.</p><p></p><p>But how could Wei Zhuang understand what Ying Xiao was thinking? Ying Xiao was not being soft-hearted. Killing is very simple, extremely simple. With a raise and fall of a sword, heads roll and blood flows like a river, shocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mohists have many disciples scattered throughout the empire. Can they all be killed? Even if they could, what good would it do? In people's hearts, there would only be two more words - "Tyrannical Qin"!</p><p></p><p>"Sir Wei Zhuang, killing is very simple, isn't it? If I only wanted some dead bodies, why would I come to Flowing Sand? Is the highest realm of an assassin really just about making heads roll, just about death?" Ying Xiao said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, those words finally sound a bit interesting," Wei Zhuang said, his eyes changing again, full of interest. "It's just that the bargaining chips may not be enough now."</p><p></p><p>"Increasing the deal naturally requires increasing the stakes. Otherwise, it would seem I lack sincerity, which would be disrespectful to you, Sir Wei Zhuang," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Please elaborate!" Wei Zhuang said softly.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Ying Xiao's aura suddenly changed, his very being like a sword.</p><p></p><p>"The Vertical and Horizontal Sword Art, using the way of Heaven and Earth, is divided into the Vertical Sword and Horizontal Sword. The Horizontal Sword attacks with schemes, seeking advantage, which is called 'Pang'. The Vertical Sword attacks with power, seeking substance, which is called 'He'. 'Pang He' is the way of Heaven and Earth," Ying Xiao said. </p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Vertical and Horizontal Sword Art can be called the Sword of Heaven and Earth, the strongest sword. But, it's still not perfect enough."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words that it was still not perfect enough, killing intent towards Lin Fan clearly flashed in Wei Zhuang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Just now, when exchanging blows with Wei Zhuang, Ying Xiao had already comprehended the Vertical and Horizontal Sword Art through the Against-the-Heavens Enlightenment System, far surpassing Gui Guzi's version, the most perfect Vertical and Horizontal...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Horizontal Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>"What..." Wei Zhuang was shocked and his face turned pale. </p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was the same, her charming eyes seemed to make time stop, in disbelief, "How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>In shock, Wei Zhuang was also quickly caught in Ying Xiao's Horizontal Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Even after Ying Xiao finished, Wei Zhuang was stunned for a long time.</p><p></p><p>When Wei Zhuang came back to his senses, two hours had passed. He looked at Ying Xiao, only shocked, and felt the same kind of respect as for his master Gui Guzi, a long-lost respect.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness King Wu, is this the bargaining chip?" Wei Zhuang asked heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, one of the bargaining chips." Ying Xiao said, then his eyes glanced at the various poisonous snakes wandering around, and his gaze fell on Chi Lian.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Hong Lian, in this world, no one can withstand your Zhen Yu Qian Ye, the sun is right, slaughtering the whole city, that's not what I want."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Ying Xiao actually knew about Zhen Yu Qian Ye, both Wei Zhuang and Chi Lian were shocked again, and even fear flashed in their eyes. At this moment, in front of Ying Xiao, they only had one feeling - no secrets.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Xiao was already comprehending.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed countless poisonous snakes and comprehended the Hundred Poisons True Scripture and the Golden Snake Sword Technique!]</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's body trembled slightly, and the leaves around him floated up. Ying Xiao stepped on the leaves and rose up, condensing internal energy on the edge of the Tian Wen sword, and wrote the Hundred Poisons True Scripture in the air.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, Chi Lian was caught in the mind method of the Hundred Poisons True Scripture, "How is it possible, there is actually such a poisonous scripture in the world."</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Poisons True Scripture, one of the bargaining chips. Princess Hong Lian, please remember, what I want is imprisonment." Ying Xiao said with a smile, then turned the edge of the Tian Wen sword and directly began to perform the Golden Snake Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao's eyes also changed at this moment, like a snake.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Chi Lian no longer knew what to say.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Snake Sword Technique, but this is not counted as one of the bargaining chips." Ying Xiao said, "It's just because I don't want this sword technique to be buried forever, and looking at the empire now, only Princess Hong Lian is worthy of this sword technique."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Chi Lian thanks Your Highness King Wu." Chi Lian bowed her head in thanks.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright." Ying Xiao said with a smile, then looked at Wei Zhuang again, "Mr. Wei Zhuang, this deal..."</p><p></p><p>"Within half a month, the people of Mo Jia will be imprisoned, and the place of imprisonment will be their so-called paradise, the Mo Jia Mechanical City." Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I hope Mr. Wei Zhuang will not disappoint me." Ying Xiao said with a smile, "Then, the deal is done, can we talk about other things?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao was also very direct, "Is Mr. Wei Zhuang content with just being an assassin?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Wei Zhuang did not say any clich√©s, but he did not speak either.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao continued, "I wonder how Mr. Wei Zhuang understands the two words 'Tian Xia'."</p><p></p><p>This time, Wei Zhuang spoke, looking up and murmuring, "Tian Xia..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I already know Mr. Wei Zhuang's answer." At this moment, Ying Xiao smiled, then left with Da Si Ming and Shao Si Ming.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Mr. Wei Zhuang, let me remind you, for an opponent like Gai Nie, some of the assassins under your command should not go to their deaths."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"The only king of Qin, what kind of person is he?" After Ying Xiao left completely, Chi Lian slowly walked to Wei Zhuang's side and asked, looking deeply in the direction Ying Xiao left.</p><p></p><p>"I once said that Ying Zheng did what no one else could do, and this empire exists only because Ying Zheng exists." Wei Zhuang said softly, but his tone was extremely heavy, "This empire will not continue, it will collapse with the death of Ying Zheng."</p>

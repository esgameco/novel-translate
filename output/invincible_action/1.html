        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So, I've transmigrated?" </p><p></p><p>In a magnificent palace, Ying Xiao slowly woke up, rubbing his head. As memories flooded in, he gradually understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>In the world of the Qin Dynasty, in Xianyang of Great Qin, in the imperial palace, Ying Xiao was the biological younger brother of Emperor Ying Zheng (Qin Shi Huang), bestowed the title of Martial King, the only king after the Qin unified all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no interest in politics and was obsessed with martial arts. So after Emperor Ying Zheng unified the world, he collected martial arts and inner cultivation techniques from all schools, wanting to gather the strengths of each to create his own unique martial arts and inner cultivation, thereby breaking through to the Grandmaster realm in one fell swoop. </p><p></p><p>The realms of martial artists can be divided into Postnatal and Prenatal. </p><p></p><p>Postnatal has nine levels, from low to high, first rank to ninth rank, with each rank further divided into early, middle, late and peak stages.</p><p></p><p>Prenatal has three realms - Grandmaster, Celestial Being, and Earthly Immortal, each realm also divided into early, middle, late and peak stages.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao was already at the peak of ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, just as he was breaking through to Grandmaster, he deviated and entered the demonic way, dying in the palace. Thus there was the current Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After fully coming to his senses, Ying Xiao slapped his thigh and jumped up, extremely excited. "Hahaha, this identity isn't bad. The First Emperor's only biological younger brother, relying on each other since young in the state of Zhao, deeply trusted by the First Emperor, unconditionally trusted even, otherwise he wouldn't have been bestowed as the only king."</p><p></p><p>"Clothed in brocade and fed with jade, listening to music in the pleasure quarters, hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>However, the laughter stopped abruptly in less than two seconds. </p><p></p><p>Because Ying Xiao thought of the most important point - Fusu did not inherit the throne, Huhai did.</p><p></p><p>After Huhai inherited the throne, he allied with Zhao Gao and nearly slaughtered the entire Ying clan. At that time, he, as the only king, would definitely be the first target.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, got excited too soon..." Ying Xiao slapped his thigh again, but without the earlier excitement, only solemnity remained. "No, gotta get rid of that Zhao Gao, otherwise this king position won't be secure."</p><p></p><p>"Right, there's also that Yin-Yang Master Yun Zhongjun. It was this guy who refined pills for Brother Zheng, causing him to pass away in his prime, not even reaching 50 years old. Once Brother Zheng dies, even if Fusu inherits the throne, I'm afraid he still won't be able to suppress the remnants of the six states. By then, this king position still won't be secure."</p><p></p><p>"But how to get rid of these two."</p><p></p><p>"Although based on my relationship with Brother Zheng, I could request an edict to kill these two, and Brother Zheng would most likely agree. But these two definitely won't sit and wait for death. Yun Zhongjun is a peak Grandmaster, and possesses the mystical Yin-Yang techniques and alchemy, not inferior to ordinary early Celestial Beings."</p><p></p><p>"That little eunuch Zhao Gao is even more formidable, the leader of a spy network, unfathomably deep, likely already in the late Celestial Being realm, maybe even peak Celestial Being."</p><p></p><p>"Difficult..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ying Xiao's eyes flashed with a sharp light as he spoke excitedly, "That's right, this young master is a legitimate transmigrator, how could I not have a system."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ying Xiao started calling out, "System daddy, are you there? Are you there?"</p><p></p><p>"If you're there, don't hide. If not, give a shout."</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, come out and see your descendant..."</p><p></p><p>[Ding~!]</p><p></p><p>Very clearly, Ying Xiao's calls took effect. A cold mechanical voice sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Host, rest assured, this system never fails to show up, and also never arrives late like that damned justice.]</p><p></p><p>[Inverse Heaven Comprehension System binding successful!]</p><p></p><p>[Host will obtain inverse heaven comprehension, able to comprehend all powerful inner cultivation and martial arts techniques in the span of a conversation.]</p><p></p><p>"Inverse heaven comprehension, sounds not bad, let's try it..."</p><p></p><p>In just the time of three breaths, the system's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Host has comprehended the Nine Yang Divine Technique and Tai Xuan Scripture based on his own inner cultivation.]</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the cultivation methods and mental formulas of the Nine Yang Divine Technique and Tai Xuan Scripture appeared in Ying Xiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit,</p><p></p><p>"Awesome..." </p><p></p><p>With a shocking sound, Ying Xiao directly entered a state of cultivation. With such heaven-defying comprehension, cultivating the two great inner martial arts was easier for Ying Xiao than farting and taking a dump.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Very quickly, powerful inner energy erupted from within Ying Xiao's body. Ying Xiao instantly broke through from the peak of the ninth rank to the early stage of the Grandmaster realm. But this was not the end, it was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Mid-stage Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Late-stage Grandmaster! </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Late-stage Celestial realm!</p><p></p><p>Peak of the Celestial realm!</p><p></p><p>In just one day's time, Ying Xiao broke through from the peak of the ninth rank to the peak of the Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a breath of turbid air, Ying Xiao's eyes suddenly opened, emitting condensed and solid rays of light. His entire being was instantly sublimated, as if a true celestial had descended.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful, this feeling." Ying Xiao spoke heavily, "Without the appearance of Earthly Immortals, I am invincible in the martial world of this Great Qin. And it seems there are no Earthly Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Yun Zhong Jun, Zhao Gao, you two goods, this time this King will kill you without any negotiation."</p><p></p><p>However, Ying Xiao was not in a hurry to come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He had the inner martial arts, he had the cultivation realm, but he didn't have the martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Ying Xiao's eyes fell on the stack of sword manuals beside him. He casually picked one up and flipped it open. After flipping only three pages, the voice of the Heaven-Defying Comprehension System sounded.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has read three pages of the sword manual and comprehended the Dugu Nine Swords and Taiji Sword!]</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, the cultivation methods and techniques of the two sword arts appeared in Ying Xiao's mind. Ying Xiao directly picked up a sword and started dancing with it. In half a day's time, the two sword arts were cultivated by Ying Xiao to great perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Too refreshing." Ying Xiao was extremely excited, "Let's do palm techniques next..."</p><p></p><p>There were no palm manuals here, because in the current martial world of Great Qin, the sword was revered. Almost all martial artists were practicing the sword, so previously Ying Xiao had only collected sword manuals.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>With one palm strike, he truly comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed his own palm strike and comprehended the Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms and Tathagata Palm!]</p><p></p><p>At this time, a gentle breeze blew into the palace from outside. Ying Xiao involuntarily began to sense the breeze, moving along with it. In that instant, numerous afterimages filled the great hall.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has sensed the power of the gentle breeze and comprehended the Rippling Water Steps and Cloud Ladder!]</p><p></p><p>"This is about enough, sufficient to kill Zhao Gao and Yun Zhong Jun." Lin Fan smiled wickedly, brimming with confidence, "But I should still familiarize myself a bit more, can't capsize in a ditch."</p><p></p><p>Then, Ying Xiao continued to seclude himself for ten more days.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Ying Xiao walked out of this palace.</p><p></p><p>Refreshed in body and mind!</p><p></p><p>But looking around, in the vast Martial King Mansion, there was only him alone, appearing a bit desolate.</p><p></p><p>The previous Ying Xiao, in order to cultivate with an undistracted mind, didn't even want a single servant.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, that previous Ying Xiao really wasted the identity of the Martial King, and wasted such a large Martial King Mansion. At least get a few pretty maidservants. The autumn wind is bleak, winter is coming soon, how nice it would be to warm the bed." Ying Xiao shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ying Xiao sensed a figure rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Han, the commander of the Shadow Guards created by Brother Zheng, late-stage Grandmaster realm." Ying Xiao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Han pays his respects to Your Highness the Martial King." Arriving in front of Ying Xiao, Zhang Han performed the ritual of kneeling and bowing, respectfully saying.</p><p></p><p>Brother Zheng had decreed that seeing Ying Xiao was like seeing him, so in this Great Qin, apart from Brother Zheng himself, everyone else had to perform the kneeling and bowing ritual upon seeing Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Rise. For His Majesty to have Commander Zhang personally come, there must be some important matter." Ying Xiao asked.</p><p></p><p>"Replying to Your Highness the Martial King, Gai Nie has defected. His Majesty wants the Martial King to have an audience as soon as he comes out of seclusion." Zhang Han responded.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is." Ying Xiao nodded and asked again, "I suppose those so-called various schools of thought and remnants of the six states have also started getting restless."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness the Martial King." Zhang Han said with hands clasped.</p>

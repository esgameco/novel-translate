        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"We understand, Prince Wu..." </p><p></p><p>Gongxu Qiu and Ban the Master exchanged a glance, speaking in unison, but deep in their eyes was still defiance towards each other.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao noticed this defiance. </p><p></p><p>However, this was precisely what Ying Xiao wanted. Only with their defiance would their mechanical arts become more exquisite.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, there is one point I need to warn you about," Ying Xiao continued, his tone becoming solemn. "At this moment, you have become people under heaven's punishment. So for you, within the borders of the great Qin, apart from the enemies of great Qin, there are only the people of great Qin."</p><p></p><p>"If anyone dares to kill the innocent indiscriminately, what awaits you is this prince's Heaven's Questioning Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Within the borders of great Qin, the people of great Qin can only be governed by the laws of great Qin."</p><p></p><p>"Wolf King, Yin Bat, especially you two, did you hear me clearly?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness..." Wolf King replied heavily.</p><p></p><p>Yin Bat trembled, stuttering.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao struck out with his palm, the internal force of the Nine Yang Divine Art swiftly entering Yin Bat's body, eliminating the yin-cold aftereffects of the martial arts he practiced.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you no longer need to consume human blood, and you can cultivate your martial arts and skills one hundred percent," Ying Xiao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Highness..."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, White Phoenix, Black Qilin, Gao Jianl√≠, and Dao Qiao, among the eight, took the lead in leaving the Mechanical City, embarking on the path to find the main base of the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>Ban the Master, Gongxu Qiu, and Xu the Scholar also set off for Xianyang.</p><p></p><p>By Ying Xiao's side were left only the Grand Astrologer, Minor Astrologer, Red Lian, Snow Maiden, and Duanmu Rong.</p><p></p><p>"Heheh...this feeling is really not bad..." Ying Xiao sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, what Ying Xiao did next was wait, wait for news from Meng Yi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main thing was to relax...</p><p></p><p>The scenery of the Mechanical City was very beautiful, perfect for relaxation.</p><p></p><p>The first day, Ying Xiao spent in intimate entanglement with the Grand Astrologer.</p><p></p><p>The second day, Ying Xiao spent immersed in beautiful music with Snow Maiden playing the guqin.</p><p></p><p>The third day, Ying Xiao spent under the guidance of the Minor Astrologer, skillfully applying the Salted Pig Eighteen Hands technique.</p><p></p><p>The fourth day, Ying Xiao and Red Lian studied the Classic of Hundreds of Poisons together, jointly developing some formidable poisons, such as the Ten Fragrances Soft Tendon Powder, Seven Flowers Seven Insects Paste, Seven Steps Summon Spirit Powder...</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao even "inadvertently" developed the Yin-Yang Union Powder with Red Lian.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it was intentional or unintentional, only Ying Xiao knew in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Red Lian naturally noticed the implication and smiled coquettishly, "Your Highness, this Yin-Yang Union Powder, was it intentional? Or was it intentional?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally it was unintentional," Ying Xiao replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The fifth day, Ying Xiao helped Duanmu Rong comprehend the Compendium of Materia Medica and Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders, causing the medically-obsessed Duanmu Rong to rejoice greatly, sincerely praising Ying Xiao in astonishment, "Your Highness, is there anything you don't know?"</p><p></p><p>"This prince doesn't know what exactly this prince doesn't know," Ying Xiao said seriously, truly putting on quite a show again.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ying Xiao continued guiding Duanmu Rong.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently, he helped her comprehend the Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Canon was naturally the perfect way of medicine, but within it, there were many things...</p><p></p><p>In any case, on this day, the usually outwardly even more aloof than Snow Maiden, Duanmu Rong, blushed countless times.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Ying Xiao spent a wonderful over half a month in the Mechanical City.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Ying Xiao also thought about longevity again.</p><p></p><p>If he did not achieve longevity, such wonder would disappear in the blink of an eye, and once gone, it would never return.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"If Yun Zhongjun, Xu Fu, did not die, after going out to sea, he must have found the legendary phoenix and learned the location of the divine dragon..." Ying Xiao murmured to himself. </p><p></p><p>On the 17th day, the celestial punishers finally brought news.</p><p></p><p>Meng Yi and Zhang Han joined forces and basically completely eliminated the scattered nightingales transmitting messages within the empire. </p><p></p><p>They also found the nightingales' nest.</p><p></p><p>"You found it? Where is it?" Ying Xiao asked heavily.</p><p></p><p>The celestial punisher who brought the news respectfully responded, "Your Highness, in the land of sand dunes."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, sand dunes..." Ying Xiao narrowed his eyes, "A very familiar place name."</p><p></p><p>How could Ying Xiao be unfamiliar with the sand dunes?</p><p></p><p>The former mighty lord of the Zhao state, the nomadic horse-riding archer King Zhao Wuling of Zhao, Zhao Yong, was precisely because of the so-called Sand Dune Disturbance that he was imprisoned in the Sand Dune Palace and starved to death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the future, if Ying Xiao had not time-traveled, the First Emperor, the sole emperor of all ages and the first emperor in history who was also called the Ancestral Dragon, would also lose his life in the sand dunes.</p><p></p><p>"If I were not a time-traveler, perhaps Zheng Ge's death in the sand dunes was not from so-called illness. The nightingales' nest is there, this cannot be a coincidence," Ying Xiao said to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reporting celestial punisher continued, "Your Highness, in the sand dunes, many traces of the Luowang assassins were also discovered. There seems to be one of Luowang's bases there."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so..." Ying Xiao said in a deep voice, "The sand dunes, the nightingales' nest, one of Luowang's bases, things cannot be so coincidental. It seems I must go there myself."</p><p></p><p>"Immediately pass on the message to Meng Yi, tell him not to act rashly, wait until I arrive to discuss further." With a flash of killing intent in his eyes, Ying Xiao instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness..."</p><p></p><p>That day, six fast horses galloped out from the mechanical city, rushing non-stop towards the sand dunes.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Si and Yan Dan sat across from each other, eyeing one another.</p><p></p><p>It was a meeting between two hypocrites.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial King's actions are very swift. My nightingales operating for me in various places across the empire can no longer be contacted, and not even their corpses can be found," Li Si said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I really underestimated this Martial King."  </p><p></p><p>"His formidable strength is no less than His Majesty's strategizing and skill, even far surpassing His Majesty's."</p><p></p><p>A vicious look flashed across Yan Dan's face as he said coldly, "He deceived everyone under heaven. When Ying Zheng unified the realm, he was still hiding, was it to wait for this day..."</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince Dan, although I am joining hands with you, it does not mean I will betray His Majesty. Please show some respect to His Majesty in front of me," Li Si said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Great Lord Li, you are indeed superior to this crown prince with your self-righteous appearance," Yan Dan said disdainfully. "At a time like this, Great Lord Li can still say he will not betray Ying Zheng."</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince Dan, no matter what, His Majesty made Li Si's achievements possible. As long as His Majesty remains on the throne for a day, Li Si will never betray His Majesty," Li Si said.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, as you wish, Great Lord Li," Yan Dan no longer argued, smiling faintly. "From now on, in front of Great Lord Li, I shall call him Ying Zheng, His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yan Dan's words, Li Si's expression finally softened, and he began discussing matters in earnest, "No matter how the former Martial King was, the current Martial King is undoubtedly a great mountain blocking me and you, Crown Prince Dan."</p><p></p><p>"If we do not destroy this mountain, what you and I want will forever remain an empty dream."</p><p></p><p>"Then how does Great Lord Li want this crown prince to act?" Yan Dan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It is something you, Crown Prince Dan, excel at," Li Si said slowly after taking a sip of tea.</p>

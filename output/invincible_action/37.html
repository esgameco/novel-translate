        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, don't worry about me," Chiliang said resolutely, though restrained. As a former assassin from the Flowing Sands, she had envisioned scenarios like this countless times in her mind. </p><p></p><p>The determination in her eyes signaled her acceptance of the impending death.</p><p></p><p>Chiliang did not think Prince Xingxiao would spare her life just because she was captured. </p><p></p><p>But this time, Chiliang was mistaken. The moment the Ghost Skylark King spoke, Xingxiao's heavenly sword dropped to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked Chiliang. </p><p></p><p>"Your...Your Highness, you..." Chiliang's beautiful eyes trembled as she stuttered in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Xingxiao put down his heavenly sword without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness..." Chiliang murmured in a daze, still unwilling to believe it despite the reality before her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In her dazed state, she wondered if it were Weizhuang instead, he might care about her life, but surely he would not put down his shark-tooth sword.</p><p></p><p>This scene also shocked the Ghost Skylark King.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Ghost Skylark King never expected to truly threaten Xingxiao with Chiliang's life - it was just a dying counterattack, a last-ditch effort.</p><p></p><p>Xingxiao was the king, the ruler of the vast Qin Empire, and deeply trusted by the First Emperor. Compared to the chancellor Li Si, Xingxiao was truly peerless, able to have any woman he desired. How could he give up success and life itself for a mere Chiliang?</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>After regaining his composure, the Ghost Skylark King laughed uproariously. "I never imagined the mighty Martial Prince of Qin, the one most trusted by the First Emperor himself, would forsake his life for a woman."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you have truly opened my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Skylark King, enough talk. Release her, and I promise you won't die," Xingxiao said calmly. "Otherwise, I have ten thousand ways to make you wish you were dead."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, it seems I control the situation now. With that tone, this Red Lotus Princess might just..." The Ghost Skylark King sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>The iron chains in the Ghost Skylark King's hands contracted, and the sickle opened a bloody gash on Chiliang's jade-like neck.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I'll do as you say," Xingxiao immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Your Highness, that's more like it. Only then will this peerless beauty remain unharmed," the arrogant Ghost Skylark King cackled, savoring the moment with a vicious hissing laugh. "Now, Your Highness, withdraw all your internal energy and let the mechanical Azure Dragons bind you."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, don't listen to him. Just take action - as an assassin, I've long known this day would come," Chiliang shouted, trying to stop Xingxiao.</p><p></p><p>But Xingxiao ignored Chiliang and followed the Ghost Skylark King's instructions, withdrawing all his internal energy.</p><p></p><p>Clank clank clank!</p><p></p><p>Without the protection of his internal energy, two mechanical Azure Dragons immediately bound Xingxiao - one coiling from above, the other from below, intertwining around his body. Numerous smaller mechanical Azure Dragons also covered Xingxiao's entire body, interconnecting like chains, locking his every joint.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these small Azure Dragons had needles protruding from their mouths, sealing all of Xingxiao's accupressure points.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xingxiao was rendered unable to circulate his internal energy...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Without exerting any internal force.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness..." Red Lian cried out in pain, full of resentment, "Why is there a Mozi mechanical beast here, and it's even a mechanical Azure Dragon, why?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"  </p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ghost Nightingale King couldn't help but laugh loudly.</p><p></p><p>He roared jubilantly, "Mission accomplished!"</p><p></p><p>"But the ones who completed the mission are not you Nightingales, but us from the Mozi school." However, another voice rang out, and three figures descended from three sides of the palace, all wearing cloaks.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Ghost Nightingale King naturally didn't accept such words, but he was helpless and could only utter these two words. Because if these three wanted, he would only end up severely injured like Xiang Xiao. In his battered state, he was absolutely incapable of stopping the mechanical Azure Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The true Mozi school has finally revealed itself?" Xiang Xiao slowly opened his eyes and said indifferently with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Prince of Wu has destroyed one of our Mozi school's mechanical cities, aren't we allowed to take revenge?" one of them said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't say you're not allowed. But you three, could you tell me your positions in the Mozi school?" Xiang Xiao said, "In any case, you should at least let me die with my eyes closed. I think I deserve that much."</p><p></p><p>"The Prince of Wu naturally deserves that."</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, the three removed their cloaks, revealing three faces with white hair and beards.</p><p></p><p>The three gave off a sense of having returned to the original truth.</p><p></p><p>"Unfathomable!" The moment he saw the three, Xiang Xiao couldn't help but murmur inwardly, "Although these three are still far from the level of terrestrial immortals, to a large extent they far surpass the peak of the celestial realm."</p><p></p><p>"They can be considered half-step terrestrial immortals."</p><p></p><p>"One of the Mozi school's leaders - Tian Zhi!"</p><p>"One of the Mozi school's leaders - Fei Gong!" </p><p>"One of the Mozi school's leaders - Shang Tong!"</p><p></p><p>The three spoke in unison, cupping their hands in respect towards Xiang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Zhi, Fei Gong, Shang Tong - if I'm not mistaken, these three are among the ten great teachings of the Mozi school," said Xiang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Mozi school now has ten great leaders."</p><p></p><p>"And these ten great leaders are the true Mozi school."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness is correct, the Mozi school has ten great leaders. However, even the ten great leaders cannot fully represent the Mozi school," said Fei Gong. "For the Mozi school's hundreds of years of tradition, if there were only ten great leaders, how could it be called one of the two greatest academic schools of the age?"</p><p></p><p>"I was truly ignorant," said Xiang Xiao. "I really underestimated the hundreds of years of inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"But the more so, the more I admire His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"Unifying all under heaven is harder than ascending to heaven, yet he accomplished such a mighty feat."</p><p></p><p>"However, I cannot allow you to destroy this unity now."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Hearing Xiang Xiao's words, Tian Zhi roared with laughter. "Your Highness, at this moment, shouldn't you be more concerned about whether you can keep your head?"</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Master is waiting for your head."</p><p></p><p>"Yan Dan, that hypocrite - does he really think he can kill me?" Xiang Xiao was disdainful too. "In the mechanical city, if I didn't want to recruit those Mozi leaders, do you think Yan Dan could have left alive?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, everything, everything is under my control, including now. You see me as prey, but in my eyes, aren't you all prey as well?"</p>

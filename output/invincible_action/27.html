        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"And thinking carefully, the Luowang sect, the Yin-Yang sect, in the past they were only nurturing trouble for themselves. With their true power, destroying the Hundred Schools of Thought would basically just be a flick of the wrist."  </p><p></p><p>"So what they really schemed for was only this realm under heaven."</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes pensively for a moment, Ying Xiaocould only keep this grave matter in his heart for now, and then successively taught the Grand Astrologer and Minor Astrologer the immortal arts.</p><p></p><p>During the teaching process, naturally Ying Xiao did not lack opportunities to put his hands all over the two women, especially the Minor Astrologer.  </p><p></p><p>Be solemn when the time called for solemnity, and relax when the time allowed for relaxation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ying Xiao returned to the Mechanical City and rejoined everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, thank you for rescuing Yue'er and Tianming," Duanmu Rong and the others expressed their gratitude to Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"We're all our own people, what is there to thank," said Ying Xiao. "It's just that next I'll have to trouble you all to wait for me a moment more, as I have some words to exchange with Sir Wei Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Ying Xiao brought Wei Zhuang into a room in the Mechanical City, and the two sat down facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Wei Zhuang, I believe you are already clear on what I want. At this moment, I believe you already have the answer in your heart," said Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Assassins, killers, even the so-called strongest sword - all of these are absolutely not what is in Sir Wei Zhuang's heart."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu, I cannot help but admire you, but for many things, can Prince Wu truly take charge?" said Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"I understand Sir Wei Zhuang's concerns," said Ying Xiao. "Rest assured on this point, because very soon Sir Wei Zhuang will be able to see my sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the flowing sands will no longer be flowing sands," said Wei Zhuang. "Heavenly Punishment, perhaps that is a purer name."</p><p></p><p>"But Sir Wei Zhuang will not be part of the Heavenly Punishment," Ying Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, may I inquire about the reason for Han Fei's death?" Wei Zhuang suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"You may," said Ying Xiao. "Last time, I told Sir Wei Zhuang that Li Si was someone who knew some things, so my meaning was quite clear - I believe Li Si was the culprit."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" asked Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Wei Zhuang, you know better than anyone how much importance His Majesty placed on Han Fei," said Ying Xiao. "From start to finish, His Majesty never thought of killing Han Fei, only imprisoning him."</p><p></p><p>"And this so-called imprisonment could hardly be called imprisonment, you must know that every day, His Majesty would discuss matters with Han Fei in depth."</p><p></p><p>"So if Han Fei did not die, if Han Fei was not the Prince of Han or was willing to serve the Qin dynasty, who do you think would be the Chancellor of Qin today?"</p><p></p><p>"Your meaning is jealousy," said Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Just a guess," said Ying Xiao. "But to borrow a phrase Sir Wei Zhuang often says - analyzing with the simplest behavioral motives, the inevitable result of all things ultimately comes down to two words: benefit."</p><p></p><p>"Between Li Si and Han Fei, I believe there was not a shred of fellow-disciple feeling, only a life-and-death struggle."</p><p></p><p>"A person like Han Fei would not betray his own country, but Li Si dared not gamble on it, Sir Wei Zhuang, wouldn't you agree?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," Wei Zhuang nodded. "So Li Si colluded with the Yin-Yang sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang sect is very mysterious, even more mysterious than I imagined. About the Yin-Yang sect, I don't know much, but there is one thing I'm clear on - Donghuang Taiyi, this person's ambition is as great as His Majesty's," said Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The path.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the overall direction is different."</p><p></p><p>New69bookbarshnx.com</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Lord of the East, a name that strikes fear into those who hear it,"Wei Zhuang said. "In the valley, my master once mentioned this name - unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>"Since it is unfathomable, then only a genius could harbor such ambition, or rather, only something that would require the entire world's strength to accomplish could contain such ambition," Ying Xiao said.  </p><p></p><p>"For example..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Wei Zhuang's eyes flashed with anticipation, awaiting Ying Xiao's example.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal life..." Ying Xiao repeated solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal life..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's tone shook, hoarsely murmuring.</p><p></p><p>However, Wei Zhuang quickly regained his composure, speaking indifferently with a hint of disdain, "Does the Prince of Wu believe in so-called eternal life?"</p><p></p><p>"Believe..." Ying Xiao said seriously, "And moreover, I can tell you Mr. Wei, eternal life truly exists, it's just not the pill concoction spoken of by the late Lord Yunzhong."</p><p></p><p>"Eternal life..." At this moment, Wei Zhuang became a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>"But this is too far-fetched, let's not discuss it further," Ying Xiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao was confident he had thoroughly piqued Wei Zhuang's interest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue discussing the Supreme Lord of the East. To realize his unfathomable ambition, he must eliminate obstacles. I believe Han Fei could become his greatest obstacle."</p><p></p><p>"Because if Han Fei had served the Emperor, the Qin Empire today would be even stronger, and definitely not so rotten at the core with countless flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Everything the Prince says is reasonable," Wei Zhuang said. "And all the analysis is based on self-interest."</p><p></p><p>"The mystical arts are elusive, and at that time Li Si was the Emperor's only contact able to reach Han Fei..." Ying Xiao continued analyzing.</p><p></p><p>"Prince, this grievance, I must avenge," Wei Zhuang said. "Even if the enemy is the chancellor of Qin."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Wei, I have made a promise to everyone, and you are no exception. Li Si, I will handle him," Ying Xiao said heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I believe the Prince," Wei Zhuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as Ying Xiao and Wei Zhuang exited the room, Meng Yi immediately came to report, "Prince, a coded message has arrived from Mr. Gainai."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wei Zhuang's expression froze, unable to help but wonder, "How could my master brother have sent a coded message in just half a day's time?"</p><p></p><p>Taking the coded message, Ying Xiao did not hastily open it, but instead asked Wei Zhuang, "Mr. Wei, what do you think the contents of this message could be?"</p><p></p><p>"I do not know," Wei Zhuang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wei Zhuang refer to himself as a subordinate before Ying Xiao, Meng Yi was utterly shocked, marveling inwardly, "The Prince is truly the Prince, able to subdue even the unruly top swordsman Wei Zhuang..."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, Yan Dan did not go to Xianyang," Ying Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Prince, Yan Dan is no match for my master brother now," Wei Zhuang said. "Although my master brother only learned the new Horizontal and Vertical Sword technique less than a day ago, I know better than anyone what a sword genius he is."</p><p></p><p>"Believe it, someone helped Yan Dan," Ying Xiao said. "I'm just not sure if it was the mystics, the web, or Li Si's nightingales."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Li Si's nightingales are more likely."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ying Xiao handed the coded message to Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang immediately opened and read it.</p><p></p><p>Then when he looked back at Ying Xiao, his eyes held even more respect, "Your guess was not wrong, Prince. Li Si's nightingales did appear, helping Yan Dan escape from my master brother."</p><p></p><p>"Li Si, it was indeed him," Ying Xiao said with a cold laugh.</p>

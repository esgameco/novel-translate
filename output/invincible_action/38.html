        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ferocious scene, the Ghost Nightingale King advanced towards Ying Xiao, his scythe leaving fiery trails on the blood-soaked ground, as if making the blood boil. </p><p></p><p>The three Mohist patriarchs did not stop the Ghost Nightingale King's actions.</p><p></p><p>The words had been spoken, it was time to sever Ying Xiao's head and report back.</p><p></p><p>Their giant had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." At this moment, Ying Xiao lamented discontentedly, "This time, I deeply infiltrated the Nightingales' old nest, using myself as bait, intending to completely annihilate you Nightingales and the Mohists in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, only seven out of the eighteen Nightingale Kings came, and only three out of the ten patriarchs showed up. The other hidden experts never revealed themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Ying Xiao, go to hell with your regrets," the Ghost Nightingale King snarled ferociously. At this moment, his hands had never possessed such power before, and the scythe he swung had never contained such killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness..." Chi Lian cried out painfully, "It's my fault for implicating you..."</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>However, when the Ghost Scythe fell on Ying Xiao's neck, it could not advance even an inch.</p><p></p><p>"What..." The three Mohist patriarchs roared in unison, their pupils contracting in disbelief, "How is this possible? All his accupoints have been sealed, how can he still muster his inner energy and unleash his Adamantine Indestructible Body?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao had turned completely golden, entering the Adamantine Indestructible state.</p><p></p><p>"No..." Seeing the radiant golden light emanating from Ying Xiao, the Ghost Nightingale King let out a fearful roar and immediately retreated without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The adamantine inner energy rippling through Ying Xiao's body shattered the small mechanical azure dragons, freeing his right arm, which grabbed the Ghost Scythe and pulled the Ghost Nightingale King towards him with force.</p><p></p><p>"You used this scythe to leave a bloody mark on her neck, so I shall use this same scythe to leave a bloody mark on your neck," Ying Xiao said coldly.  </p><p></p><p>His inner energy surged again, causing the scythe to rotate, and in an instant, a ring of blood appeared on the Ghost Nightingale King's neck.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Nightingale King then fell, his fearful pupils no longer contracting, only despair remaining.</p><p></p><p>As the blood sprayed, the Ghost Nightingale King's severed head rolled next to another corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness..." Chi Lian exclaimed in shock, almost crying tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Break!" Ying Xiao roared, channeling the Nine Yang Divine Skill to transform it into adamantine inner energy, shattering all the mechanical azure dragons on his body.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the cloud ladder, Ying Xiao instantly appeared beside Chi Lian, the Heavenly Questioning Sword following, its sword rays slicing through the mechanical azure dragons on her body.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright?" Ying Xiao asked gently.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, I'm fine," Chi Lian nodded.</p><p></p><p>"My apologies for worrying you. I knew Yan Dan would send experts, but I was indeed negligent about the mechanical traps," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao apologize to her, Chi Lian was at a loss for words for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?" The three Mohist patriarchs remained in disbelief, staring fixatedly at the needles on Ying Xiao's body. These needles were definitely flawless, each one precisely inserted into his accupoints.</p><p></p><p>With all his accupoints sealed, even a true celestial being from the land should not be able to circulate their inner energy.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" Tian Zhi asked hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>"What, moving and rearranging the accupoints..."</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Ying Xiao's words, the three Mohist patriarchs shook their heads frantically, refusing to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Even if there was such a martial art, rearranging more than a dozen accupoints would be..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible, how could all the hundreds of acupoints all over the body be relocated in such a short time?"</p><p></p><p>"This is absolutely impossible..."</p><p></p><p>"Just because you don't believe it doesn't mean it's not possible," Ying Xiaoran said calmly. </p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoran used the Great Relocation of Yin and Yang technique. </p><p></p><p>When Chi Lian was sealed by the Qinglong mechanism, Ying Xiaoran had thought that he too would be sealed, and his acupoints would definitely be sealed off.</p><p></p><p>So while wasting words with the Siwang King of the Dead Souls, Ying Xiaoran comprehended the Great Relocation of Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists tightly, Ying Xiaoran's body trembled slightly, and all the needles on his body were forced out. Then, Ying Xiaoran's entire body twisted and moved, and in an instant, his acupoints returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"It really is...true..." Seeing such a scene, the three Patriarchs of the Mohist School could not help but believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Chilian, step back," Ying Xiaoran said to Chi Lian, his fighting spirit rising.</p><p></p><p>These three Patriarchs of the Mohist School were the true killers this time.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is not wrong, you three have indeed surpassed the peak of the Celestial Realm," Ying Xiaoran said. "You could be considered half-step Terrestrial Immortals."</p><p></p><p>Coming out of their shock, the three Patriarchs of the Mohist School regained their composure and responded, "Correct, half-step Terrestrial Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder only three of you came."</p><p></p><p>"Three is enough..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, both sides erupted with power and killing intent surged. Their inner energy was like waves engulfing the entire palace. The blood on the ground truly boiled, and many corpses floated up.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was exerting all her strength to resist, but she could only keep retreating until her back was against the wall. "So this is the power of a half-step Terrestrial Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Under this power, my only feeling is powerlessness, like drifting, like an ant..."</p><p></p><p>"Then how terrifying must a true Terrestrial Immortal be? No wonder no one can reach that realm."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoran prepared to kill one of them first with the speed of lightning, making it easier to deal with the remaining two.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike would be his strongest Frenzied Demonic Vanquishing Strike.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that Ying Xiaoran's eyes had already turned blood-red, with his sole desire being total victory.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike made even Tian Zhi sense death, so Tian Zhi went all out, not daring to be careless as the supreme weapon of the Mohist School, the "Tian Zhi" appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At first it was a key, but it quickly transformed into a rod, with inner energy flowing through it and thunderous might clashing against Ying Xiaoran's Frenzied Demonic Vanquishing Strike.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Thunder Skill - Heavenly Thunder Rod Strike...Subdue!" Tian Zhi shouted with killing intent, the thunderous power of millions of tons seeming to suppress everything.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also roaring, "Attack together, leave no openings..."</p><p></p><p>Without Tian Zhi's words, Fei Gong and Shang Tong had already acted.</p><p></p><p>Fei Gong took out the supreme weapon "Fei Gong", while Shang Tong took out the supreme weapon "Shang Tong".  </p><p></p><p>Their initial forms were both key shapes.</p><p></p><p>After transforming, "Fei Gong" resembled a split sword sheath.  </p><p></p><p>The Fei Gong Patriarch infused his inner energy into "Fei Gong" and shouted, "Celestial Questioning Sword Sheath!"</p><p></p><p>Following the Fei Gong Patriarch's palm strike, the "Celestial Questioning Sword Sheath" form of "Fei Gong" went straight for Ying Xiaoran's Celestial Questioning Sword, attempting to lock it down.</p><p></p><p>With the Celestial Questioning Sword locked down, Ying Xiaoran's Frenzied Demonic Vanquishing Strike was also broken.</p><p></p><p>After transforming, "Shang Tong" became another Celestial Questioning Sword.</p><p></p><p>And following the Shang Tong Patriarch's sword techniques, they were the same as Ying Xiaoran's - the highest strike of the Solitary Sword of Nine Swords, the Frenzied Demonic Vanquishing Strike.</p>

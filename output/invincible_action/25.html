        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As Ying Xiaoer's eyes filled with internal energy, he was able to clearly see the mechanical giant snake. Above the snake's head, Gong Shouchou was controlling the mechanical giant snake, while the Elder Lord and Junior Lord were being treated for their injuries. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, there were also two children, a boy and a girl, who were both unconscious. </p><p></p><p>Judging from the appearance of the Elder Lord and Junior Lord, they seemed to have suffered serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a massive yin-yang energy blade erupted from the ground, slicing through the mechanical giant snake from below.</p><p></p><p>"Xingghun..." Seeing it was a blade formed from concentrated energy, Ying Xiaoer let out a cold remark. The killing intent within him instantly exploded as he rushed over at top speed.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical giant snake was cut at the seven-inch section, which was its core mechanism. As a result, the entire mechanical snake had broken down, losing its ability to move and coil. It crashed down thunderously.  </p><p></p><p>At this very moment, from all directions in the forest, nearly twenty experts clad in yin-yang Dao robes emerged, all having formed energy blades, surrounding the five people atop the snake's head in a killing formation.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, I won't make it in time..." Seeing this scene, Ying Xiaoer's expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>However, Ying Xiaoer's eyes swiftly shifted, and he immediately thought of a countermeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Lion's Roar Skill..."</p><p></p><p>Murmuring to himself, the scene of a roaring lion appeared in Ying Xiaoer's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Host has visualized a roaring lion on his own, comprehending the Lion's Roar Divine Skill!]</p><p></p><p>The moment he comprehended it, Ying Xiaoer unleashed it, channeling the Nine Yang Divine Skill and the internal energy of the Taixuan Scripture. An ear-splitting lion's roar instantly echoed through the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>The entire mountain forest was as if swept by a tornado.  </p><p></p><p>Although Gong Shouchou, the Elder Lord, and the Junior Lord were also heavily shaken by the Lion's Roar Divine Skill, and the injuries of the Elder and Junior Lords worsened, those yin-yang experts could no longer attack them.</p><p></p><p>Tian Ming and Gao Yue avoided being affected by the Lion's Roar Divine Skill because they were unconscious.</p><p></p><p>With the Lion's Roar Divine Skill, Ying Xiaoer had bought enough time to rush over. Descending on a cloud ladder, he caught the falling giant snake head just in time, allowing the group to land safely.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wuwang..." Seeing it was Ying Xiaoer, the Elder Lord and Gong Shouchou were delighted, while the Junior Lord remained calm as usual.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..." Upon seeing Ying Xiaoer, Xingghun let out a resentful hiss, then hurriedly cupped his fists in salute, "Prince Wuwang."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoer ignored Xingghun and immediately channeled the Nine Yang Divine Skill and Taixuan Scripture to heal the Elder Lord and Junior Lord.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xingghun would not let such an opportunity slip by and dropped his pretense. Yin-yang internal energy swirled beneath his feet as he swiftly took to the air, charging towards Ying Xiaoer to kill.</p><p></p><p>The other yin-yang experts also took action, all attacking once more.</p><p></p><p>"Courting death," Ying Xiaoer's expression turned utterly murderous.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ying Xiaoer could not take action, as he had to immediately heal the Elder Lord and Junior Lord. Their organs were constantly being ravaged by Xingghun's yin-yang internal energy. Any delay would increase the danger to the two women's lives.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wuwang, from the look in your eyes, I can tell you really want to kill me. But unfortunately, you cannot free your hands right now," Xingghun sneered coldly. "Since that's the case, allow me to help send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Prince Wuwang, the younger brother of the Emperor himself, dying in this desolate wilderness - no one would ever know, would they? Even if someone did find out, by then it would just be a dried corpse, who could identify it?"</p><p></p><p>"Soul Roaming Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>To prevent giving Ying Xiaoer any extra time, Xingghun unleashed his powerful Soul Roaming Dragon skill.</p><p></p><p>Yin-yang internal energy converged as the yin-yang taiji diagram emerged from Xingghun's palms. As it opened, an enormous roaring dragon burst forth, heading straight for Ying Xiaoer.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, don't worry about us..." At this moment...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Grand Celestial was terrified that Ying Xiaowould suffer any harm, so he hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>Although the Junior Celestial still did not speak, there was more worry in his eyes, and all his attention was on Ying Xiao.  </p><p></p><p>"No matter..." Ying Xiao said, "Just close your eyes and accept my internal force healing. If delayed further, your organs will be beyond saving. At that point..."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, just leave everything to me."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao was in a state of realization. </p><p></p><p>*Ding! The host has observed the gathering of stellar souls into a blade, realizing the Three Zhang Force Field!*</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ying Xiao released his internal force outwards to three zhang (about 10 meters), creating his own domain within three zhang of his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The stellar soul's dragon spirit slammed into the force field but could not shake it at all. </p><p></p><p>The other top experts from the Yin-Yang Sect were blown back, coughing up blood and tumbling.</p><p></p><p>Even the stellar soul himself was forced back over ten steps, his small chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>"What martial art is this?" the stellar soul snarled ferociously. "This is impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao ignored the ferocious stellar soul, fully focused on healing the Grand Celestial and Junior Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Yang Divine Art was truly the bane of yin-yang arts - in less than an hour, the Grand Celestial and Junior Celestial recovered completely.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Martial King," the Grand Celestial immediately thanked Ying Xiao after recovering.</p><p></p><p>"You need not thank me," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>Then, he turned towards the stellar soul. The three zhang force field instantly transformed into boundless furious energy. At this moment, Ying Xiao's internal force seemed to be burning, growing more and more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>His woman had almost been killed. How could he not be enraged?</p><p></p><p>Sensing Ying Xiao's terrifying anger, the Grand Celestial felt beautiful inside, because she knew Ying Xiao was angry for her sake. Such anger proved that in Ying Xiao's heart, she was the woman he loved, not just a plaything.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Celestial couldn't help looking at the ferocious stellar soul smugly. "Stellar Soul, this time you are destined to pay the bloody price."</p><p></p><p>"Grand Celestial, the one who will pay in blood is you, for betraying the Yin-Yang Sect, betraying the Eastern Emperor. No one who does so has ever met a good end," the stellar soul said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang Sect, the Eastern Emperor of Unity, you truly have wolfish ambitions," Ying Xiao said angrily. "But this is only human nature, I do not mind. However, today, Stellar Soul, you dared harm someone of mine, you will surely die."</p><p></p><p>With those words, Ying Xiao moved as fast as lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" the stellar soul immediately ordered the Yin-Yang Sect's top experts.</p><p></p><p>Though severely injured, these experts did not dare hesitate at all, desperately charging at Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Inquiry Sword was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>Sword light flashed, blood dripped. When Ying Xiao reached the stellar soul, severed heads kept dropping.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Those headless corpses directly exploded into bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's scales are reversed - to touch them is to die without a burial place.</p><p></p><p>"Stellar Soul, your turn..." Ying Xiao said hoarsely, the Heaven's Inquiry Sword's brilliance at the stellar soul's brow.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, Ying Xiao found he could no longer circulate his internal force.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Grand Celestial cried out, "Corpse Demon Curse!"</p><p></p><p>And in that instant, countless tiny golden insect-like curse bugs appeared in the space around Ying Xiao and the others - it was the stellar soul's stealthy Corpse Demon Curse.</p><p></p><p>Any top expert afflicted by the Corpse Demon Curse would completely lose their internal force within 24 hours.</p><p></p><p>"Martial King, what do you think of my Corpse Demon Curse?" the stellar soul raised his eyes, the arrogant smirk of triumph returning to his lips as he calmly asked.</p>

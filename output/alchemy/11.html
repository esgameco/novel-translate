        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that a ninth-level Qi-cultivating grandmaster of the previous generation had engaged in bloody battles that shook the great dao and altered the celestial phenomena. </p><p></p><p>On Luo Chen's side, he was truly tasting the sweetness!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he only had one product, the Fast Pill, and when customers came, it was obvious at a glance with no room for selection. </p><p></p><p>They either wanted it or didn't, with very little room for bargaining.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even employ the most common sales tactic of bundling items.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Old Daoist Chen who could say "This is the price, but I'll throw in a Cleansing Talisman for free!" when customers hesitated over the high price of his Qi-Absorbing Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't even have any complementary items to bundle.</p><p></p><p>Now, he finally had a second product he could put out!</p><p></p><p>Well, not quite - the low-grade Invigorating Pill for male enhancement couldn't really be considered a proper product.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, selling that first bottle of Invigorating Pills let him see a glimmer of hope on the great path!</p><p></p><p>The price was a bit inflated - the cost was one spirit stone but he sold it for five.</p><p></p><p>But anything related to male enhancement, be it food, medicine or exercise, has always been evergreen across all times and cultures.</p><p></p><p>Even in the cultivation world that emphasizes personal power!</p><p></p><p>In fact, it's the opposite in this regard.</p><p></p><p>For lower-level cultivators, especially those in the Qi Refining stage who are refining essence to energy, solely relying on absorbing turbulent spiritual energy from the outside and then refining it leads to very slow progress.</p><p></p><p>That's why there are markets for spirit rice, demonic beast meat, and spirit pills that contain abundant spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with spiritual power permeating their entire body, lower-level cultivators often can't control themselves and the slightest provocation can easily lead to leakage of essence and energy.</p><p></p><p>So to ensure the most efficient conversion of spiritual energy, many cultivation methods have corresponding essence-locking techniques.</p><p></p><p>The classics refer to this as "concealing the horse's essence."</p><p></p><p>There are typically two ways to resolve this situation:</p><p></p><p>One is for the cultivator to progress to the Foundation Establishment stage and give birth to a spiritual consciousness, allowing them to freely control the conversion of internal spiritual power. Only then will their power grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in the initial stages, if their essence keeps leaking out, how could anyone climb the great path?</p><p></p><p>The second solution is for the Qi Refining cultivator to voluntarily release the lower cinnabar field lock after determining their path is hopeless.</p><p></p><p>With the feedback from their spiritual power, it becomes easy to regain their masculine vitality.</p><p></p><p>This is also why those cultivators who establish offshoots and family lineages are often older cultivators whose paths have reached a dead end.</p><p></p><p>They know their own limits - unable to progress further and stuck at that level for life.  </p><p></p><p>So why bother struggling? Better to go home, have children and enjoy life!</p><p></p><p>But with the Invigorating Pill specifically tailored for Qi Refining cultivators, the situation is completely reversed.</p><p></p><p>The main ingredients are the water-attribute Lingzhi Mushroom and the fire-attribute Hellhound Whip, providing a synergistic water-fire effect.</p><p></p><p>After consuming it and slightly guiding the spiritual energy within, one can experience an eruption of masculine vigor without unlocking the lower cinnabar field!</p><p></p><p>Why else would Luo Chen have gone to such lengths to refine this pill if not for his own needs?</p><p></p><p>It's because there is an enormous market demand for it!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen is addressing an urgent need shared by many.</p><p></p><p>If this were Earth, he would undoubtedly be hailed as a little Song Jiang, with the nickname "Timely Rain"!</p><p></p><p>When the second bottle of Invigorating Pills sold again for five spirit stones, even Old Daoist Chen's gaze towards him changed.</p><p></p><p>Holding a Qi-Absorbing Talisman worth at least three spirit stones, he compared it to that exquisite little jade bottle, muttering:</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't make sense!"</p><p></p><p>"My Qi-Absorbing Talisman is made from the blood of tri-colored earth dragons and drawn by an odorless field mouse. The cost is at least two spirit stones. How could the Invigorating Pill's cost be higher than mine?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that compared to something that can save their life at a critical moment, male cultivators value that other ability more?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't explain. Even if he sold out of Fast Pills and only the lonely Invigorating Pills remained on his stall, he would stay squatted there.</p><p></p><p>Today, he was determined to shamelessly poach customers from Old Daoist Chen.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a cultivator came to buy talismans, he would pull them aside and whisper, "Dear Daoist, would you be interested in learning about the Invigorating Pill?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, not everyone had such interests. Those with resolute will and devotion to the great path flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>How could they let their thoughts dwell on carnal pleasures? Such beasts could never achieve anything of significance!</p><p></p><p>The more self-respecting ones left with a cold snort. "Do I look like someone who needs that kind of pill?"</p><p></p><p>But most cultivators showed obvious interest, especially after Luo Chen repeated the tale of how Master Cloudcrane Soaring used this pill to battle a fourth-rank demonic beast king.</p><p></p><p>They eagerly opened their purses, hoping to emulate him.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Demeanor of a Senior.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, by the afternoon, Luo Chen had finally sold out all the Zhongmiao Wan pills in his hands. </p><p></p><p>After giving Chen Laodao a bag of spicy beef jerky, Luo Chen squatted down and munched on the beef jerky while calculating today's earnings.</p><p></p><p>First were the twenty bottles of Bi Gu Dan pills, with a very stable market price, selling for a total of four spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Then there were the new Zhongmiao Wan pills, with ten bottles sold for forty-six spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>The reason it wasn't fifty stones was because to open up the sales channel, he slightly lowered the price on a few bottles.</p><p></p><p>It was a new product after all, so there had to be some discounts.</p><p></p><p>After calculating the accounts, Luo Chen couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>His savings had finally returned to the fifty spirit stone mark!</p><p></p><p>He could completely start refining Zhongmiao Wan pills again.</p><p></p><p>However, before his proficiency in making Zhongmiao Wan underwent a qualitative change, his production rate would likely not rise much.</p><p></p><p>With just this income, it couldn't support his regular Five Spirits Root cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So, if he wanted to increase production, there was only one path to take.</p><p></p><p>Expand production!</p><p></p><p>But expanding production would require investing higher costs and more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Where would the spirit stones come from?</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Luo, forgive me for asking, but how much does it cost to make these Zhongmiao Wan?"</p><p></p><p>"You even know it's rude to ask!" Luo Chen didn't even look up.</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao gave an awkward laugh, but with a thick skin like his, he didn't get angry.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because while others didn't know Luo Chen's earnings today, he had been sitting right there and saw everything clearly.</p><p></p><p>Fifty spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Previously, Luo Chen would have had to sell two hundred and fifty bottles of Bi Gu Dan to earn that much.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was rude to ask about someone's business secrets, and since Luo Chen didn't want to say, he didn't plan to continue asking.</p><p></p><p>However, even though he didn't ask, Luo Chen sidled up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Starting to call him uncle again!</p><p></p><p>"I grew up watching you, no, it was you watching me grow up. You know exactly how many spirit stones I have. You more or less have an idea of the costs for making Zhongmiao Wan."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen said sincerely, his tone utterly genuine.</p><p></p><p>"I can't say the exact costs, but you know them, just don't go blabbing about it. However, there is a knack to being able to sell them at a high price!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao's expression wavered, recalling Luo Chen's entire operation today.</p><p></p><p>Deep in thought!</p><p></p><p>But there were still some things he just didn't get.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between a traveler who had experienced the modern information bombardment and an old local man.</p><p></p><p>Even after personally watching someone's operation, he still didn't understand the reasons behind it.</p><p></p><p>"I can tell you this knack. But can you do a little favor for young Luo?"</p><p></p><p>"A favor?" Chen Laodao looked at Luo Chen doubtfully, his left eye involuntarily twitching, "Let me say this first, I can do a favor, but I won't lend spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen grabbed his robe sleeve and shook it repeatedly, giving him an adoring look.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, in this cold and cruel cultivation world, you're the only elder I have!"</p><p></p><p>"Please maintain some dignity, Daoist friend!"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle! Not much, just fifty low-grade spirit stones, lend them to me just once! I'll return them in half a month at most!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, you really dare to ask!"</p><p></p><p>"You know how much I earned today, I absolutely have the ability to repay you, you have to believe me!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen grabbed Chen Xiuping Laodao's thick, calloused large hand, "Uncle, trust me! Plus, don't you want to know how to sell your talisman papers at high prices?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao was a bit tempted.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, every time I see the talisman papers you painstakingly drew sold for just a few spirit stones, my heart aches!"</p><p></p><p>"They look down on your talisman drawing skills, they're looking down on young Luo!"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, believe me, borrow me the spirit stones, and I'll help you sell your talisman papers at high prices, letting you grow big and strong, creating brilliance!"</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao swallowed his saliva, looking at young Daoist Luo with deep affection on his wrinkled face.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty isn't much, you won't lose out, you won't get scammed!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, here you go! But I'm a sixth level Qi Condensation great cultivator, you better not try to weasel out of repaying!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen hurriedly took the handful of scattered spirit stones, putting them in his small pouch, tightly pulling the drawstring closed and stuffing it deep into his inner lining.</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao turned his face away, unable to watch this scene.</p><p></p><p>That was his money!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can tell me now."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Chen, do you know what brand value is?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

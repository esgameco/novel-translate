        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, early morning.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen got up early and packed the pills on the desk into five jade bottles, ten pills per bottle.  </p><p></p><p>He put on his only low-grade Daoist robe and hurriedly went out the door carrying a low-grade flying sword.</p><p></p><p>He had to get into the city early, otherwise when daylight came, he would miss out on the better stalls of the wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because it had rained heavily all day yesterday, the roads in the outer city area were quite muddy.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the center of the outer city, the more pungent the mixed smell of feces, urine, medicinal fragrance, and scents of humans and beasts became.  </p><p></p><p>Especially with the addition of the earthy smell, that feeling was really quite unbearable.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Chen was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, he arrived at the city gate.  </p><p></p><p>When entering the inner city, Luo Chen couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the air in the inner city was so much better!</p><p></p><p>"I heard the inner city was built on a first-grade spirit vein, very beneficial for cultivators in the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"When I have money in the future, I must buy a house in the inner city district!"</p><p></p><p>Sighing inwardly, Luo Chen headed straight for the wandering cultivators' area in the southwest corner.</p><p></p><p>In front of a bluestone slab, more than half was occupied by yellow talisman papers and animal skins, with an old man busily working there.  </p><p></p><p>He arranged the animal skins, stood up and stretched lazily, and happened to notice Luo Chen's arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Luo, you came a bit later than me this time."</p><p></p><p>The old man's name was Chen Xiuping, at the sixth level of Qi Refining, an elder of Dahechang Market.</p><p></p><p>He had lived here for decades, making a living selling talismans, and also had considerable skill in tanning animal hides into talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>With his income level, he could actually afford to rent a house in the inner city district.  </p><p></p><p>But this old man was a bit stingy, preferring to live in a low-grade spirit stone wooden hut in the outer city for one spirit stone per month, rather than spend ten times that on a stone house in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>He even calculated clearly when it came to renting a stall to sell his goods.</p><p></p><p>The stalls in the wandering cultivators' area required paying rent to the market manager.  </p><p></p><p>One stall cost one spirit stone per month in rent.</p><p></p><p>The rather large two square meter stall, if crammed, could fit all the talisman papers and animal skins, with a small half square meter left over.</p><p></p><p>He simply split that half square meter with Luo Chen, and each paid half the rent.</p><p></p><p>Was Luo Chen being taken advantage of?</p><p></p><p>Not necessarily, if he rented his own stall, it would cost one spirit stone per month.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, not many cultivators liked sharing a stall to sell goods together.</p><p></p><p>So Luo Chen didn't really lose out, but Old Daoist Chen definitely profited.</p><p></p><p>After a simple greeting, Luo Chen set out his own goods in front of the stall.</p><p></p><p>Twenty bottles of Talisman Dispersing Pills!</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen looked at the quantity in surprise, "Daoist Luo, your pill refining level has improved again recently!"</p><p></p><p>No wonder he said that.</p><p></p><p>Normally Luo Chen came to set up his stall once every seven days, four or five times a month.  </p><p></p><p>And each time, he would sell around fifteen or sixteen bottles of Talisman Dispersing Pills.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he brought a full twenty bottles!</p><p></p><p>From this it could be seen that he must have made considerable progress in refining Talisman Dispersing Pills.</p><p></p><p>And indeed that was the case.</p><p></p><p>In those seven days, excluding one day for setting up the stall and purchasing materials, six days remained, half for processing materials and half for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>In other words, only three days for actual pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Luo Chen could at most produce two batches in a day by working himself to the limit, gathering around five bottles of Talisman Dispersing Pills - the material wastage rate was quite high.</p><p></p><p>But yesterday, his skill in refining Talisman Dispersing Pills rose from the perfect proficiency level to the grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The last batch directly produced five bottles!</p><p></p><p>Adding to the previous good luck, the loss was reduced to a very low level, this time just enough to make twenty bottles of Bigu Pill. </p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just getting more skilled!" Luo Chen smiled modestly, but there was still some self-satisfaction in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Having just reached the master level proficiency in refining Bigu Pills, he was somewhat accomplished to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiuping shook his head, "There are a few fellow daoists selling Bigu Pills, but none of them can produce twenty bottles in five days like you."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he reached out towards the nearest bottle.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't mix in some flour to make up the numbers, did you? As an old senior, I have to check for you, can't let our stall's reputation get ruined."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen smiled and looked at him reaching out, already holding a talisman covered in red lines in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I heard last time someone bought your Xieqi Talisman, but it didn't work, and their butt got bitten by a demon beast. Junior shouldn't take one back to research for you, we can't ruin our family's reputation!"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist Chen got anxious and didn't care about the pill in front of him, hastily snatching the talisman back from Luo Chen's hand.</p><p></p><p>"You sell five Bigu Pills for just one spirit stone, and you dare to try to exchange it for my Xieqi Talisman that costs three spirit stones each!"</p><p></p><p>"Give it back! Give it back!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen smiled and watched the old man place the talisman in the most prominent spot, treasuring it dearly.</p><p></p><p>The Xieqi Talisman was Daoist Chen's signature product!</p><p></p><p>Among his various low-grade talismans that cost one spirit stone each, this was the most expensive, with a starting price of three low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Xieqi Talisman had the best market, especially for cultivators who went to the mountains to hunt demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>This kind of talisman that could conceal one's blood aura for an hour could save a life in critical moments, its value not inferior to many defensive talismans.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, Luo Chen was actually quite envious of Daoist Chen.</p><p></p><p>Just casually selling a talisman would earn at least one spirit stone, netting over a hundred spirit stones profit per month.</p><p></p><p>Unlike himself.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he worked desperately hard to earn just twelve spirit stones in a month. After deducting costs, he only had six or seven spirit stones left.</p><p></p><p>If he also deducted half a spirit stone for rent, half for the stall fee, and one spirit stone for daily food and drink, he could only save four or five spirit stones in the end.</p><p></p><p>This was after transmigrating for a year and working really hard to save money.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of life the original host had lived in the early days.</p><p></p><p>But envy was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen was well aware that in the mainstream cultivation arts, each had its own difficulties.</p><p></p><p>Pill refinement focused on quantity, with greater profits, but the difficulty lay in mastering the various pill formulas. For each type of pill, from entry to mastery, who knows how many failed batches were required.</p><p></p><p>Talisman drawing focused on quality, with each talisman condensing the cultivator's full spiritual energy during its creation. A slight mistake meant complete failure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, talisman masters tended to have shorter lifespans, for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>Like Chen Xiuping, he looked old, but was actually only in his sixties. Well, I guess that is quite old too.</p><p></p><p>For a Qi Condensation cultivator, the theoretical lifespan was around 120-130 years, so the sixties were still considered "young."</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to switch to being a talisman master, spending the rest of one's life doing homework every day.</p><p></p><p>It was better to refine pills and knead pellets.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Luo Chen knew his own situation best. Having just reached the master level in refining Bigu Pill, he could already double his income going forward.</p><p></p><p>Although a monthly income of ten spirit stones was still insufficient to support longevity cultivation (net income), at least it was a step in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>And wasn't he about to start a new project?</p><p></p><p>Just as Luo Chen was filled with beautiful hopes for the future, Daoist Chen tugged at his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Customers are coming!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

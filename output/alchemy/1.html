        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The thunderous roar shook the heavens and earth, causing the entire Dacheng Town to fall silent in its might. </p><p></p><p>The previously lively scene filled with streaks of light across the sky was now much quieter.</p><p></p><p>After all, who would dare guarantee they wouldn't be so unlucky as to be struck down by a lightning bolt while flying?</p><p></p><p>That would be akin to prematurely attempting to ascend and transcend one's mortal form.</p><p></p><p>Dacheng Town occupied a vast area, with an inner city protected by a three-layered grand formation capable of defending against demonic beasts below the third rank. </p><p></p><p>Even if a third-rank demonic beast suddenly attacked, the formation could withstand it for a while, giving the inner city's residents enough time to react.</p><p></p><p>Of course, maintaining such a powerful formation required immense resources daily, which is why it only encompassed the inner city.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the scattered dwellings of cultivators radiating outwards from the inner city core were far less secure.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of wooden and stone houses stood scattered in all four directions - east, south, west, and north.</p><p></p><p>In the southwestern corner, next to a stream, a quiet wooden house with just one room, a hall, and a kitchen stood, nearly two li (around 0.8 km) away from the nearest cultivator's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>While it was tranquil outside, the kitchen inside was a blaze of activity.</p><p></p><p>"One jin of sliced yam, two liang of poria, three liang of one-year-old ginseng."</p><p></p><p>"One jin of minced meat from a first-rank demonic bovine beast, with no bone fragments."</p><p></p><p>"Add scallions, ginger, japonica rice, and fennel seeds."</p><p></p><p>The voice reciting these instructions came from a bare-chested young man, who stared intently into the pot, deftly adding ingredients from a wooden shelf nearby. His ladle stirred and tossed the contents vigorously.</p><p></p><p>As a pot of white bone broth was poured in, Luo Chen couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>He stoked the stove's firewood, occasionally pulling out a few sticks, and then patiently waited for the dish to finish cooking.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the young man lifted the pot lid and inhaled deeply at the sight of the thick concoction inside.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this color - smooth, bright white luster - top-grade!"</p><p></p><p>"Smell this aroma - rich yet not greasy - top-grade!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen dipped his finger into the ladle and tasted it.</p><p></p><p>One sip!</p><p></p><p>"The yuan qi is fully present. With the catalyzing effects of the angelica and ginseng, the spiritual energy from those five jin of first-rank demonic bovine meat has been evenly distributed into this pious grain porridge."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, the flavor has also been perfectly controlled - top-grade!"</p><p></p><p>Licking his fingers, Luo Chen couldn't help but show a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Based on his recent experience, this single pot of pious grain porridge should yield at least five vials of pious grain pills.</p><p></p><p>It sounded ridiculous, but Luo Chen was indeed refining pills!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were the most commonly used pious grain pills by cultivators, albeit a low-grade version more akin to a pious grain porridge.</p><p></p><p>Not waiting for it to cool, he lifted the pot and poured the contents onto a cutting board.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen took a yellowed bamboo slip, poured the sticky paste onto it, then drizzled a few drops of hundred-flower honey before starting to roll up the bamboo slip.</p><p></p><p>As the hot pious grain porridge rolled up inside the bamboo slip, it gradually formed into a cylindrical shape and took on a slightly yellowish hue from the infused honey.</p><p></p><p>His hands moved swiftly, pinching off segments of the cylinder into round, thumb-sized pellets.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three...</p><p></p><p>When Luo Chen finished, the cutting board was neatly arranged with fifty pious grain pills.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at his handiwork, Luo Chen didn't have time to feel elated before his attention turned to the invisible status panel before him:</p><p></p><p>[Name: Luo Chen]</p><p>[Lifespan: 27/75]</p><p>[Spirit Root: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]</p><p>[Realm: Qi Refining 3rd Layer: 75/100] </p><p>[Technique: Mastery in Longevity Technique 235/300]</p><p>[Spells: Novice Cleansing Talisman 49/100, Proficient Binding Spell 176/200, Mastery Fireball 268/300]</p><p>[Skills: 1st Rank Pill Refiner: Pious Grain Porridge Grandmaster 501/1000]</p><p>[Achievement Points: 10 (Can be used to gain novice proficiency in corresponding realms, techniques, spells, skills)]</p><p></p><p>"Ten achievement points obtained, enough to gain novice proficiency in the Wondrous Pellet technique!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at this mastery panel, Luo Chen felt unexpectedly moved.</p><p></p><p>It had been a year since he came to this world!</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he was just an ordinary office worker who toiled from dawn until dusk. His only entertainment in his spare time was playing leveling cultivation games on his phone.</p><p></p><p>Since he lacked money, he could only "grind" in such free games, mindlessly raising the progress bars for techniques whenever he had a chance.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that one night while unable to sleep and grinding a game dungeon, he would cross into this world?</p><p></p><p>The original owner of this body was also named...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen, even his age was about the same as him. </p><p></p><p>In his early years, he entered the deep mountains and encountered an extraordinary event in a mountain cave, where he came across the remains of a cultivator. From then on, he embarked on a ten-year journey of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Following the map from the remains, he came to this riverside town, intending to join a nearby sect and be accepted as a disciple. </p><p></p><p>However, ten years ago, he was already seventeen years old, exceeding the age limit of sixteen for most sects.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he had a balanced five spiritual roots constitution, comparable to ordinary mortals without any spiritual roots. Thus, no sect was willing to accept him.</p><p></p><p>Logically, he should have returned to where he came from.</p><p></p><p>But the original owner had an unwavering determination to seek the Dao. Relying on a bottle of elixir pills, a scroll of the Longevity Cultivation Method, and a few spirit stones from the extraordinary encounter, he settled down in this riverside town.</p><p></p><p>In the early days, due to his meager resources, he could not even afford a wooden hut near the inner city and had to rent a house by a small stream on the outskirts.</p><p></p><p>Living in the town was not easy at all.</p><p></p><p>Even for a house on the outermost edge, the monthly rent required half a spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>Although he built the house himself, he still had to pay half a spirit stone in rent every month.</p><p></p><p>After exhausting a few spirit stones, the original owner did not simply wait for death.</p><p></p><p>He either helped others with their stalls or went hunting in the mountains with others, struggling to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Later, he also started to ponder the two pill formulas from the remains.</p><p></p><p>The Wondrous Pill was a bit difficult, so he began by studying the most basic Hunger Dispelling Powder.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that those who have extraordinary encounters are more or less blessed with good fortune.</p><p></p><p>After a few initial failures, he successfully refined the Hunger Dispelling Powder.</p><p></p><p>Although the quality was average, there were always buyers among the wandering cultivators who often went hunting in the mountains for ten days or half a month at a time.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the original owner managed to settle down in this riverside town with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>However, the heavens are unpredictable, and one's fortunes can change in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After realizing that the Hunger Dispelling Powder was not enough to support his cultivation, the original owner turned his attention to a fragmentary pill formula he had collected.</p><p></p><p>Then, during his first attempt at refining the pill, the cauldron exploded!</p><p></p><p>The violent explosion even caused the wooden house to collapse.</p><p></p><p>It was at that moment that Luo Chen transmigrated and occupied this body.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his initial predicament after transmigrating, Luo Chen felt like crying but had no tears.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it was raining heavily, and amidst the ruins, he was covered in blood, dazed and helpless, facing this new world.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, all of that was in the past.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a year, and the Hunger Dispelling Powder has finally reached the master level of proficiency, barely enough to sustain my daily life."</p><p></p><p>"The biggest gain is that I've accumulated ten achievement points, which can be used to start learning the Wondrous Pill!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen currently has three pill formulas in his possession.</p><p></p><p>The first-grade Hunger Dispelling Powder formula, the first-grade Wondrous Pill formula, and a second-grade fragmentary formula called the Jade Dew Pill that the original owner had luckily obtained.</p><p></p><p>If successfully refined, the second-grade Jade Dew Pill would be extremely useful for cultivators practicing water-attribute cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Its normal selling price is as high as a mid-grade spirit stone per bottle!</p><p></p><p>With such a substantial profit, it's no wonder the original owner became overconfident.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he believed in his luck, or perhaps the easy mastery of the Hunger Dispelling Powder gave him confidence, or maybe the harsh reality of poverty drove him to take the risk.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he boldly ventured forth.</p><p></p><p>The result was the cauldron explosion, the house collapse, and his own demise.</p><p></p><p>Now, Luo Chen has arrived at this critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on the Hunger Dispelling Powder would only allow him to survive, but it would not be enough for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If he wants resources for cultivation, he must find another source of income besides the Hunger Dispelling Powder.</p><p></p><p>His goal is not the Jade Dew Pill, and the ten achievement points are also insufficient for him to start refining second-grade pills.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after discovering the achievement point function on the proficiency panel, he has made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I must refine the Wondrous Pill!"</p><p></p><p>"I have no choice!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't seek fame!"</p><p></p><p>New book released, I hope my dear readers will follow it daily.

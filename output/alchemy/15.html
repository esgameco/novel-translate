        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Return customers have always been very important clients to Luo Chen!</p><p></p><p>He has also always tried his best to cultivate his own return customers, instead of always leeching off customers from Chen Laodao. </p><p></p><p>However, for a common product like the Bigu Pill, even if he had previously refined it to the middle grade, it could not really cultivate many return customers, and he was also limited by the output.</p><p></p><p>The Zhongmiao Pill, on the other hand, gave him an opportunity. </p><p></p><p>After some casual chatting, Luo Chen arranged all the pills properly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao took another look this time, the quantity was clear at a glance, and he secretly thought that Luo Chen's pill refining skills must have truly made a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In these few stalls, the quantities he took out were increasing.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, his own "spirit stone loan" also played a role in this.</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose, more and more cultivators came to the market, and Luo Chen and Chen Laodao also opened their stalls one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Little Friend Luo, what a coincidence!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what a coincidence!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen warmly greeted Ceng Wen, pointing at the bottles in front of him, "Get some?"</p><p></p><p>"Get some!"</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen picked up five bottles of Bigu Pill, playing with them as he said, "Your skills are really good. Last time I tried the Bigu Pill, it was surprisingly at the high-grade level, much better than others'."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's filling, thank you for the praise, friend."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let me have two bottles of the Zhongmiao Pill too!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen cooperatively put two bottles of Zhongmiao Pill from the stall into Ceng Wen's hands, and the two smiled at each other, everything understood without words.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator next to them who was selecting talisman papers seemed to know Ceng Wen.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ceng, was that spotted tiger slaughtered at Butcher Li's house yesterday your battle spoil? You really had a bountiful harvest from going into the mountains this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the demonic tiger was a menace to the world. I was just doing Heaven's work, it's nothing to mention, nothing to mention."</p><p></p><p>"You're being modest. What are you buying here?"</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen secretly put the Zhongmiao Pills into his storage bag, holding the bottles of Bigu Pills.</p><p></p><p>"Buying some Bigu Pills to stock up, it'll be convenient for the next mountain trip. Brother Duan, I won't chat anymore, I have something urgent to attend to, I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator called Brother Duan by him seemed a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw Luo Chen take out two more exquisite jade bottles from below and place them on top.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Ceng Wen had also bought those things just now?</p><p></p><p>"What kind of pill is this?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's eyes lit up, "The Zhongmiao Pill, would you like to learn more about it, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Customers came and went, but the conversations were all the same.</p><p></p><p>Sky-high asking prices, bargaining down to the ground.</p><p></p><p>I praised how good my products were, he picked out all kinds of flaws.</p><p></p><p>Then we reached a price we could both accept, and a deal was made.</p><p></p><p>Unlike those aloof cultivators who just sat meditating at their stalls, the Qingshi stalls were much livelier, with both the old and young being thick-skinned and glib-tongued.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally when Luo Chen was free, he would also help Chen Laodao talk up his wares and sell a few talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because it was a big market day today, Luo Chen's own pill business was going well.</p><p></p><p>In just the morning, he had basically sold almost everything.</p><p></p><p>Thirty bottles of Bigu Pill were all sold, earning six pieces of low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Twenty bottles of Zhongmiao Pill were all sold, earning one hundred pieces of low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The difference was enormous.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of profit, the Zhongmiao Pill currently had zero profit, just breaking even.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, after deducting costs, the Bigu Pill had a net profit of three spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Luo Chen's mastery as a Bigu Pill grandmaster, if he increased Bigu Pill production, he could probably earn even more.</p><p></p><p>But the market for Bigu Pills was right there, as was its consumption capacity, so earning a few more spirit stones was the limit.</p><p></p><p>He might as well take this opportunity to build up his proficiency with the Zhongmiao Pill, so he could start earning big profits later.</p><p></p><p>Industrial transformation, opening up new channels.</p><p></p><p>A brief period of growing pains was acceptable!</p><p></p><p>Chen Laodao kept urging him to pay back the debt, so Luo Chen had no choice but to pay back fifty on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Then, after paying it back, he pleaded and begged for a long time, and borrowed it back again.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I'll definitely be able to pay you back. You've seen my recent income yourself. Just consider it supporting the poor..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"As I cultivate diligently, when I become prosperous, I will certainly repay you generously!"</p><p></p><p>"How about this, I've sold out of my spirit pills. This afternoon I'll work for you, helping sell your talisman papers!" </p><p></p><p>"Trust me, the sooner I help you sell them all, the more talismans you can draw, and you'll earn back even more."</p><p></p><p>After much persuasion, Luo Chen managed to keep the 106 spirit stones in his pocket. </p><p></p><p>The price was having to do temporary work for the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, did something happen at Wang Ge's stall?"</p><p></p><p>As Luo Chen was selling talismans, he looked up and saw a crowd gathered around Wang Yuan's stall not far away.</p><p></p><p>He was tempted to go watch the commotion, but was held back by Old Daoist Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go!"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten what happened the last time this situation occurred?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen stopped in his tracks, recalling a scene from the original host's memory two years ago.</p><p></p><p>The circumstances then were so similar to now.</p><p></p><p>"Enemies have come for revenge?"</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen looked over with a complex expression, "Though most cultivators are lone drifters, some still have relatives and friends."</p><p></p><p>"If they died, that would be that. But to have their artifacts and Daoist robes sold off, it leaves an unresolved grievance in one's heart."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen suddenly realized that the crowd did indeed look confrontational, on the verge of fighting at the slightest provocation.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan was at the seventh level of Qi Refinement realm - those daring to surround him likely had formidable cultivation bases too.</p><p></p><p>If a fight broke out and he went to watch the spectacle, he could easily get caught in the crossfire.</p><p></p><p>"They won't actually fight. Don't worry, combat is strictly prohibited in the inner city."</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen shook his head. He had seen too many such incidents.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that for a ruthless character like Wang Yuan who had walked many dark paths, encountering trouble was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after a few harsh words, three cultivators left indignantly. </p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan remained nonchalant, sitting cross-legged at his stall with drooping eyelids, as if not fully awake.</p><p></p><p>"Selling blood-stained artifacts is so risky!" Luo Chen muttered. "Why not just sell them to the Wanbao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen sneered, "The Wanbao Pavilion would buy them back at half price, do some minor refinement, then resell them at an even higher price than the original. Where's the profit in selling them yourself at a stall?"</p><p></p><p>I see!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen understood - the artifacts at the Cultivators' Market varied greatly in quality, relying entirely on each cultivator's discernment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, without being refined, their distinct appearances made them easily recognizable by the original owners' friends.</p><p></p><p>The only advantage was that they were much cheaper than those sold officially.</p><p></p><p>"Right now I only have a rusty low-grade sword."</p><p></p><p>"When I have money in the future, should I buy artifacts here or at the Wanbao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen stroked his chin, reminiscing about whether to buy a BMW or Mercedes in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>But such fantasies were fleeting.</p><p></p><p>He had work for the whole afternoon.</p><p></p><p>After helping Old Daoist Chen with the talismans, he hurried to purchase the ingredients he needed.</p><p></p><p>Through several bulk orders, negotiating with the vendors to reserve stock for him, he managed to spend all his over 100 spirit stones in the short time.</p><p></p><p>Not a single one was left - he had gone all in.</p><p></p><p>Going all-in requires wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen never lacked the courage for such gambles, especially in the early stages when losing everything meant simply starting over.</p><p></p><p>As he returned home carrying the large snake-skin bag, night had fallen again.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen strode along the dirt path in the outer city, humming a few lines softly,</p><p></p><p>"I cannot drift aimlessly, for the sake of my beloved longevity..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Luo Chen's steps halted.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, four figures blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>On this dark windy night, the time had finally come for murder and robbery?</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's heart sank to the bottom of the Lancang River.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

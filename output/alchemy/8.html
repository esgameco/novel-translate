        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The frost wolf packs have actually come to the outskirts recently?" </p><p></p><p>"Really unlucky. It's a pity about those two rank-one demonic beasts we hunted, we didn't even get a chance to cut them up and store them in our storage bags."</p><p></p><p>"It's probably time for the wolf kings to fight for dominance over in the Howling Moon Mountains again. Rumor has it that a few hundred years ago there was an incident, and many wolf packs fled to the outskirts to avoid the disaster."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's head back to the town and rest up. We've been exhausted lately."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it's good no one was hurt."</p><p></p><p>Just a few terse sentences, laced with exasperation but also gratefulness for surviving the ordeal.</p><p></p><p>A few cultivators walked from the plains towards the center of the town, pausing briefly when they passed by Luo Chen's house. </p><p></p><p>Then a crisp, straightforward female voice came over:</p><p></p><p>"Friends, it may not be very peaceful around here lately. If you're capable, you should probably move closer to the inner city area!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>If he was capable, he would have moved long ago.</p><p></p><p>And the areas near the inner city weren't the inner city itself - could they really be considered safe?</p><p></p><p>Those wandering cultivators lived lives where they constantly faced death. Ambushes and robberies happened way too frequently.  </p><p></p><p>More than once on the road into the city, he had seen bloodstains and corpses on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Though this area was dangerous, in reality the cultivators from the town set up beast deterrent formations every year in the plains area. Lower-rank demonic beasts instinctively avoided entering, while the stronger rank-two beasts didn't dare approach human settlements.</p><p></p><p>Relatively speaking, his current residence was still quite safe.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he normally pretended to be destitute, struggling to scrape together a few spirit stones each month to get by. Not many cultivators would look at him twice.</p><p></p><p>"Hui Niang, why are you bothering with that kid?"</p><p></p><p>"Lounging in the creek playing in the mud in broad daylight, he must be some new arrival to Dahu Town!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go home."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because they didn't hear a response, the people outside muttered a few words and then left together.</p><p></p><p>Listening to their departing footsteps, Luo Chen couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Compared to demonic beasts, he feared human cultivators even more.</p><p></p><p>However, what that Hui Niang said did make sense. Given the circumstances, if there really was turmoil in the Howling Moon Mountains, as the closest southwestern region, it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"My mood has settled down enough, not too tense but not too relaxed. I'll officially start pill refining tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely succeed this time!"</p><p></p><p>After a day and night of rest, both his body and mind were in optimal condition.</p><p></p><p>At dawn, after practicing the Long Spring Technique, Luo Chen donned a drab apron and went to the kitchen window.</p><p></p><p>A long-bearded mud man holding a wooden sword stood there, with phoenix eyes and silkworm eyebrows, his cheeks painted red.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Guan, please bless me to succeed!"</p><p></p><p>With a calm mind, he lit the stove, added water, threw in kindling, and used the Fire Ball Technique to start the fire.</p><p></p><p>First simmering the auxiliary ingredients, then stir-frying the mineral ingredients, adding broth and bringing to a boil, then adding polygonum multiflorum, dioscorea opposita, and canis root one by one.</p><p></p><p>After simmering for around three hours, he added the final spirit herb stamen bryoniae for yin-yang harmonization.</p><p></p><p>In between, adjusting the fire intensity, sometimes high flame, sometimes low.</p><p></p><p>Two more hours later, it was time to open the pot!</p><p></p><p>A pale red, jelly-like substance had condensed in the pot. Prodding it with a new wooden ladle, it even jiggled like jelly.</p><p></p><p>Quite Q-bouncy!</p><p></p><p>However, this was still a failure.</p><p></p><p>According to the pill recipe, the finished jelly-like product should be a deep red color for the Invigorating Pill to have maximum potency.</p><p></p><p>Though it was a failure, Luo Chen didn't feel too disappointed.</p><p></p><p>It was clear this attempt had come very close to success.</p><p></p><p>At least it had solidified well, achieving the desired Q-bouncy texture.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator unafraid of toxicity, if someone ate this whole pot, it would probably still have some effect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the side effects would definitely be huge.</p><p></p><p>So Luo Chen didn't plan to try selling it - that could easily get him beaten up.</p><p></p><p>He tasted just a tiny bit to gauge the potency gap, then reviewed the process in his mind, nodded, and dumped all the dregs into the creek.</p><p></p><p>That evening was as usual, cultivation and sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he made offerings to Lord Guan on schedule, then began pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Failure!</p><p></p><p>The third day, made offerings to Lord Guan on schedule, then pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>Wait, success!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen looked at the large pot of bright red jelly and felt immense relief, his eyes almost welling up with tears.</p><p></p><p>"I failed eight batches of ingredients, about forty spirit stones worth of losses. Plus the forty bottles of Travel Provisions Pills I could have made in those eight days, that's another eight spirit stones lost."</p><p></p><p>"Wah, I almost went completely broke."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen hurriedly took out all the medicinal jelly, not caring about the heat as he used a bamboo knife to slice it into blocks, then pinched and rolled them into little balls.</p><p></p><p>Left to dry overnight, and the job would be done!</p><p></p><p>He even had one more batch of ingredients left to try again tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Luo Chen couldn't wait to get started...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Onto the cutting board in the kitchen where pills were being concocted.</p><p></p><p>As expected, those ten round pellets had all shrunk down to the size of longans. </p><p></p><p>What had evaporated was the moisture, leaving only the essence behind.</p><p></p><p>Any single one of them would make a man soar!</p><p></p><p>Cherishing these precious red pills, Luo Chen carefully put them into a jade bottle, then bowed again to Lord Guan.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Guan, you are so kind-hearted. Even though I've traveled through time, you are still blessing me. When I become successful, I will definitely build a temple for you and cast a golden statue!"</p><p></p><p>After bowing, Luo Chen put on an apron and clenched his fists tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I'm a natural genius at pill refining, born to refine pills!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely become famous in the future. I've even thought of a cool nickname - the Eastern Wilderness Pill Immortal, no less prestigious than the Central Plains Pill Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>After encouraging himself, Luo Chen got busy again. </p><p></p><p>In the smoky, fiery kitchen, a hot yet pleasant atmosphere filled the room.</p><p></p><p>However, when the bright sunshine poured in, what came into view was that expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, even the most skilled can stumble. The Pill Immortal exploded his furnace refining first-grade pills when he was young."</p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely succeed next time, definitely!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Luo Chen still felt the pain.</p><p></p><p>The cost of these ingredients was five spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>He was at a loss!</p><p></p><p>"No way, I have to sell this only bottle of Myriad Wonder Pills at a high price, otherwise I can't even recover the cost!"</p><p></p><p>The sky was just brightening.  </p><p></p><p>The world seemed shrouded in a veil of white mist, with the million great mountains like a vast abyss, waiting to swallow the rivers and markets.</p><p></p><p>A young man wearing a washed-out low-grade Daoist robe ran like the wind through the muddy cultivator slums.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a female cultivator out emptying a chamber pot couldn't help laughing and cursing:</p><p></p><p>"The kid sure runs fast, is there a dog chasing him?"</p><p></p><p>Fast, he was indeed very fast.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Luo Chen had some affinity for martial arts. With that Xiao Yao You manual, he had progressed from the entry level of proficiency to the proficient level in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it give him an achievement point, but it also doubled his speed bonus.</p><p></p><p>Before, at his peak he could only run 100 meters in 9 seconds.  </p><p></p><p>Now, with just a few strides, he could go much farther than 100 meters.</p><p></p><p>A journey to the city gate that normally took an hour and a half to walk, even if running it would have taken thirty to forty minutes before.</p><p></p><p>Today, he reached the city gate in just twenty minutes!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen had never experienced the effects of the Wind Tread Technique, but he felt Xiao Yao You was no worse. And this was just the proficient level - there were still the mastery, perfection, and grandmaster levels to go.</p><p></p><p>It had great potential to unlock!</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the southwest cultivator district, the sky had not yet brightened. This time, Elder Chen Xiuping had not beaten him there.</p><p></p><p>In this vast area for setting up stalls, there were only a few people out with their wares displayed.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen glanced around and didn't immediately take out his pills to sell. Instead, he wandered over to one stall.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, you're here early!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan glanced at him but didn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen grinned awkwardly, then squatted down to flip through the books there.</p><p></p><p>"Don't touch the 'Five Essential Techniques for the Qi Condensation Realm' - that one costs money."</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"Two mid-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you just rob people?!"</p><p></p><p>"That's exactly how I got it!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh, never mind I said anything."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan, at the seventh level of the Qi Condensation Realm - what Luo Chen often called a "blood-licking blade" cultivator - had done his fair share of village raids and highway robberies.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't dare provoke him, and Wang Yuan looked down on Luo Chen. The two only chatted a bit when setting up their stalls.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and in the past when Wang Yuan had fallen on hard times and was forced to hunt in the Ancient Yuan Mountains, Luo Chen had fronted him a few bottles of hunger-suppressing pills.</p><p></p><p>So the two did have a bit of a connection.</p><p></p><p>"And don't touch that one either, it records a sinister and devious technique."</p><p></p><p>"Hey kid, keep your grabby hands to yourself, or I'll rob you once we're outside the inner city!"</p><p></p><p>"Here, you can read this one for free. If you want to buy it, I'll give you a discount - five spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Why buy something when there are free options?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was rich, who would put themselves through that hassle?</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen excitedly picked up the "Customs of the Six Domains" and began reading it avidly.</p><p></p><p>He read for a whole hour.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the market became more crowded that Luo Chen reluctantly put the book down.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, I'm heading over now. Here's a bag of spicy beef jerky for you to snack on."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan glared at him. "Scram!"</p><p></p><p>He eyed the beef jerky bag, unconsciously swallowing some saliva, then clenched his buttocks.</p><p></p><p>Back at his stone slab stall, Elder Chen was already starting to arrange talisman papers and seal scripts.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen, do you know the Cloud Crane Sect?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

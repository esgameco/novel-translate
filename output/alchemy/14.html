        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Great River Market was located at the very edge of the Jade Tripod Domain, neighboring the Eastern Wilderness' million great mountains. </p><p></p><p>According to the statistics of a Qi Condensation cultivator who wrote a travelogue a few years ago, because it was situated on a first-grade spirit vein, there were always over ten thousand cultivators lingering in this area.</p><p></p><p>Mainly consisting of wandering cultivators, people from major sects did not stay for long periods, only remaining to take care of business. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was periodic, with the management staff of the shops in the inner city area being replaced every few years.</p><p></p><p>So, the entire market town was dominated by the spontaneous activities of the wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was just like a wandering cultivators' market, divided into major and minor gatherings. </p><p></p><p>The major gathering occurred once a month, while the minor ones took place on the 1st, 4th, and 7th days.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even when there were no gatherings, there were still cultivators setting up street stalls, but the flow of people was not as large.</p><p></p><p>Ten days had passed since the last minor gathering.</p><p></p><p>A plump figure rushed into the market early in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Zeng Wen was quite lucky this time, having hunted down a first-grade demonic beast within just a few days of entering the mountain, obtaining over a thousand pounds of demonic beast meat!</p><p></p><p>His storage bag had a capacity of only one cubic meter, barely enough to hold it all.</p><p></p><p>So, when he had harvested almost everything, he knew to retreat from the great mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ten pounds of first-grade demonic beast meat could be sold for one low-grade spirit stone, and the bones of that demonic beast were also a spirit material. Therefore, this time's harvest, while not exceptional, was still decent enough for him to live extravagantly for a while.</p><p></p><p>After returning home yesterday, he found a familiar butcher to process the meat, and then he couldn't wait to go and live it up at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Well, the process was a bit hard to describe.</p><p></p><p>The beauties were indeed exquisite, and his performance was as stable and efficient as ever.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the bravado of striking out ten times in the previous encounter, it paled in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Hence, early this morning, with great willpower, he struggled to break free from the Hero's Tomb, solely to do some business with the little brother he had become so familiar with during their previous meeting.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the southern city market, there were already some stall owners set up, and Old Daoist Chen was sitting leisurely on his small mat, looking like an old immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Hasn't Little Daoist Luo come yet?"</p><p></p><p>"No, he's probably refining pills at home!"</p><p></p><p>"Will he come to set up a stall today?"</p><p></p><p>"Generally, if he hasn't shown up by this time, he won't be coming for today's minor gathering."</p><p></p><p>Disappointment was written all over Zeng Wen's face.</p><p></p><p>Quite disappointed, he chatted with Old Daoist Chen about his experiences from entering the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a customer approach, he was about to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, he noticed Old Daoist Chen carefully holding back the unsatisfied customer.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, are you interested in learning about the Divine Concealment Talisman?"</p><p></p><p>"What's that? A talisman for concealing one's aura?"</p><p></p><p>"You know the Enlightened Concealer of the Divine Talisman Sect, right? Let me tell you..."</p><p></p><p>Zeng Wen's expression seemed a bit strange, as he felt a sense of familiarity with those few sentences.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he had walked quite far from the market that he suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that just a rip-off of what Little Daoist Luo had said back then?</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, the old man has learned some bad habits!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think Luo Chen had deceived him, because when Luo Chen was promoting the Wondrous Pills to him initially, he never used any definitive language, only ambiguous phrasing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the effects of the Wondrous Pills were exactly as Luo Chen had described.</p><p></p><p>He could only assume that Old Daoist Chen had plagiarized Luo Chen's sales pitch.</p><p></p><p>As for the victim, Luo Chen, he was currently curled up at home, wearing an apron and worshipping Lord Guan.</p><p></p><p>"The previous few batches all failed. I've already used up most of my savings as cushion funds. Today's batch should finally be successful!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Guan, I've offered incense to you today. You must bless me!"</p><p></p><p>Muttering incantations, he continuously added ingredients to the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The processed fire hound whip released a natural foul odor, which, when combined with the fragrances of the various spirit ingredients, emitted an indescribably strange scent.</p><p></p><p>The process of decocting the medicine lasted from morning until afternoon.</p><p></p><p>After lifting the cauldron lid and seeing the deep red medicinal paste, inhaling the fragrant aroma, Luo Chen clenched his fist tightly.</p><p></p><p>"It worked! The sixth cauldron was finally a success, a huge improvement!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Guan, I knew you had me in your heart, blessing me even after transmigrating."</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, I'll keep at it!"</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Luo Chen looked satisfiedly at the fifty small jade bottles on the table.</p><p></p><p>This was the fruit of nearly a month's labor.</p><p></p><p>Thirty of the bottles contained Fasting Pills that he had hastily refined over the past two days.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There were twenty bottles left, which meant they were all Zhongmiao Wan (Wondrous Pills). </p><p></p><p>However, unlike the Bi Gu Dan (Fasting Elixir Pill) which had ten pills per bottle, the Zhongmiao Wan had only one pill per bottle.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this time the refinement of the Zhongmiao Wan was only successful twice. </p><p></p><p>With nineteen portions of materials, only two batches were produced. This success rate was indeed not high, and in terms of the quality of the pills, they were only of the lowest grade.</p><p></p><p>Low-grade elixir pills have strong limitations. Their medicinal properties are generally average, and there are strong side effects if taken excessively. </p><p></p><p>However, that was not something he was worried about. He believed his fellow cultivators all had strong self-control and would know when to stop and not be greedy.</p><p></p><p>"At present, this is the best I can do, but as long as I become more proficient, the situation is bound to improve!"</p><p></p><p>"The future is bright, Luo Chen, keep going!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen put all the jade bottles into a bag, closed the door, and rushed into the inner city of Dahe Fang like the wind.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day of the big market fair, and this batch of goods had to be sold well.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the market, there were still few people around. Luo Chen had come too early.</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen had not arrived yet, but his old acquaintance Wang Yuan was already sitting cross-legged on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you don't take care of your body at all, the ground is so cold!"</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Luo Chen greeted Wang Yuan and naturally squatted down in front of his stall.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you've got some new things!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to last time, there were several more old books, and even a broken jade slip.</p><p></p><p>On the magic treasures, there were four or five more items, some of which were even stained with blackened blood stains.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, you've done a few big deals recently!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuan drooped his eyelids, "Look but don't touch."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen eagerly looked at a few of the old books: 'Five Essential Spells for the Qi Condensation Stage', 'Miscellaneous Talk on Herbs', 'Longevity Practice: Qi Condensation Chapter'...</p><p></p><p>These were exactly what he wanted, but unfortunately he had no spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>If Wang Yuan sold all these items, plus those few magic treasures, who knows how much profit he would make.</p><p></p><p>As far as Luo Chen knew, even a low-grade magic treasure would start at least one hundred low-grade spirit stones, not to mention the exorbitant prices of mid-grade and high-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Killing and robbing was indeed the fastest way to make money in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he himself was not good at such things at all. He was just an ordinary cultivator who liked refining pills.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, he picked up the unsold 'Record of the Six Realms' and began reading it with relish.</p><p></p><p>In the Far East, there were six major sects in each of the six realms that had produced Yuanying cultivators, such as the Jade Tripod Sword Sect, the Lotus Sect, the Talisman Sect, and the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>But apart from these major sects, there were also many small sects and cultivating clans in each of the vast realms.</p><p></p><p>The vast territories and abundant resources gave birth to countless talented and exceptional individuals.</p><p></p><p>Often in each period, there would be powerful figures rising up.</p><p></p><p>In the process of their rise, there were naturally many strange tales and bizarre happenings.</p><p></p><p>This 'Record of the Six Realms' was written by a cultivator at the ninth level of the Qi Condensation stage. Since he had no hope of forming his Nascent Soul, he spent the rest of his life writing this book.</p><p></p><p>Limited by his realm and knowledge, much of the content was hearsay.</p><p></p><p>But it still allowed Luo Chen to catch a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Just those snippets and fragments made his heart waver and filled him with longing.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Tripod Immortal's sword sweeping through mountains and rivers, stabilizing the entire realm - such grandeur, truly magnificent!"</p><p></p><p>After sighing in admiration, Luo Chen reluctantly put down the book to set up his stall.</p><p></p><p>"If you like reading it, take it. This travelogue has too many mistakes. It's been on display for months without selling," Wang Yuan said indifferently, flicking his finger to make the book float into Luo Chen's hands.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen was very surprised, and then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Wang. I'll return it to you after reading it."</p><p></p><p>Taking the book back to his stall made of bluestone slabs, Old Daoist Chen hurried over eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that old face, Luo Chen smiled slightly, "Do you want to tell me how good business has been recently?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to remind you to pay back the money you owe!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen was greatly discouraged. He had just thought there were many good people in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>However, after Luo Chen displayed his pills, Old Daoist Chen did tell him a piece of good news.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there have been many fellow cultivators asking for your Zhongmiao Wan. You're going to make it big, kid!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

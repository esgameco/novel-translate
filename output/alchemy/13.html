        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The hour of the Mao (between 5-7am).</p><p></p><p>White dew had turned into frost, and the evening mist hung heavily. </p><p></p><p>Outside the house, it was still pitch black, but inside the small hut by the stream, Luo Chen had already begun his work.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, this was his personality. </p><p></p><p>As long as he had a goal, he would persevere until the end.</p><p></p><p>Working 996 (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week) was very tiring, having to attend WeChat meetings even after getting off work, but he had never been late once.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the painful process of getting up every day back then, at least now he could practice Changchun Gong morning and night, which gave him a very comfortable experience after work, making it less difficult to get up.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he couldn't practice more than three times, otherwise his head would ache unbearably.</p><p></p><p>In that state, he couldn't even handle the basic work of processing medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>There was a lot of work to do today, but not too many tasks.</p><p></p><p>Processing the ingredients for the Bigu Pill and Zhongmiao Pill.</p><p></p><p>He was already extremely familiar with the Bigu Pill, especially at the master level proficiency, which not only made the refining process effortless, but also made the preliminary ingredient processing much smoother.</p><p></p><p>The ingredient processing for the Zhongmiao Pill was also faster than last time.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes when Luo Chen was free, he would study his system.</p><p></p><p>A plain attribute panel, with the only two functions being increasing proficiency levels and using achievement points to learn martial arts of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the achievement points, he was gaining more and more understanding of the proficiency function.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't limited to successes, as failing enough times would also increase proficiency.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed that every time he broke through a proficiency realm, he would gain an additional insight.</p><p></p><p>He could confirm that the conventional "practice makes perfect" was insufficient to explain that insight.</p><p></p><p>It was more like once he reached that proficiency level, the system would fill in all the insights belonging to that level for him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the same skill, he was relatively more comprehensive compared to others of the same level.</p><p></p><p>This comprehensiveness was reflected in his master-level Bigu Pill, which had a stable output rate and guaranteed top-grade quality.</p><p></p><p>If the master-level proficiency was maxed out, he didn't know if there would be further levels, but surely at that time the grade of the Bigu Pill would be able to reach the supreme grade!</p><p></p><p>A supreme grade Bigu Pill ah...no, is it still a Bigu Pill?</p><p></p><p>It's a common product with high market saturation and many competitors, while customers consume it slowly.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme grade would be useless. The Zhongmiao Pill is better.</p><p></p><p>A niche product with a wide open blue ocean market, gentle effects, and can imagine there would be many returning customers.</p><p></p><p>The downside is the high cost - five spirit stones per batch, and a high failure rate.</p><p></p><p>And this so-called blue ocean market isn't that big to begin with.</p><p></p><p>Most of the scattered cultivators still persisting in Dahe Market were aiming to build their foundations.</p><p></p><p>Those indulging in enjoyment were actually not that many.</p><p></p><p>But for now, this was Luo Chen's only viable main product!</p><p></p><p>So expanding production was a must, even if the current input costs and returns had not yet generated a net profit.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Chen had to persevere!</p><p></p><p>As long as the success rate increased, he had a promising future!</p><p></p><p>Noon was still stewed beef and rice as usual.</p><p></p><p>Since his Bigu Pill proficiency reached the master level, his consumption had dropped to the minimum.</p><p></p><p>Originally he should have consumed the frozen beef faster, but after refining the Zhongmiao Pill, the consumption rate slowed down instead.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen felt that the spiritual energy in the demonic beast yellow cattle meat was leaking out too much.</p><p></p><p>So recently, when cooking rice, he would cut off an extra finger-thick slice of meat.</p><p></p><p>After eating the delicious meal and letting out a burp, the milky fragrance lingered.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was ingredients for the Bigu Pill or Zhongmiao Pill, they all had to go through this final time processing procedure.</p><p></p><p>Sitting by the stream, he set up a fishing rod to catch some fish.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen noticed that recently, this small stream originating from the Lancang River had more fish and shrimp.</p><p></p><p>He planned to catch a few to snack on.</p><p></p><p>While fishing, he opened his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Luo Chen]</p><p>[Lifespan: 27/75]  </p><p>[Spirit Root: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]</p><p>[Realm: Qi Refining 3rd Layer: 76/100]</p><p>[Martial Art: Changchun Gong Mastered: 257/300]</p><p>[Spells: Cleansing Entry 52/100, Binding Proficient 176/200, Fireball Perfect 315/500, Roaming Proficient 102/200]</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Skills: First Level Pill Refining: Bigu Powder Master 510/1000, Zhongmiao Pill Beginner 13/100】</p><p></p><p>【Achievement Points: 1 point (can be used for corresponding Realm Cultivation Methods, Spells, Skills)】</p><p></p><p>This time, the panel display made him very happy.</p><p></p><p>His long stagnant realm had increased from 75 to 76, rising a whole point!</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the fourth level of the Qi Refining Realm was imminent!</p><p></p><p>The other items had no surprises though, whether it was the Changchun Skill or the Bigu Powder and Zhongmiao Pill, they all received normal positive feedback based on existing progress.</p><p></p><p>Only the fire ball spell and the carefree roaming spell in the spell column caught his extra attention. </p><p></p><p>The carefree roaming spell had leapt from the beginner level to the proficient level, giving him the change of increasing speed.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that he ran wildly on the plains every day.</p><p></p><p>As for the perfected-level fireball spell, he had not had a chance to experiment with it yet.</p><p></p><p>When lighting fires for cooking every day, he only felt it was more effortless.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, there was not a single fish in the dug water pit!</p><p></p><p>"How can I indulge in such enjoyment, it's time to cultivate the protective Tao arts!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen threw away the fishing rod and shot a fireball at the deepest part of the stream.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The calm stream was suddenly disrupted by a huge splash of water, with scalding steam spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>One charred fish corpse after another fell onto the pebbles at the bottom of the stream, slowly floating up as the upstream currents rolled in.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen looked at the results of this fireball spell with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>One fire scorched the stream, and the fish sank into oblivion!</p><p></p><p>Befitting of the perfected-level fireball spell!</p><p></p><p>After feeling the consumption of spiritual power within his body, Luo Chen couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, previously one fireball spell would consume one-tenth of my spiritual power, but this time it only consumed less than half of that!"</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean I can unleash twenty fireball spells in one breath now?"</p><p></p><p>It had doubled!</p><p></p><p>This was an absolute qualitative change!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the speed seemed to have doubled as well?</p><p></p><p>Previously when lighting fires for cooking, he would follow the procedures meticulously, chanting incantations and fearing he might blow up the stove, so the spiritual power he infused was very minute.</p><p></p><p>Just now he didn't have such concerns and casually tossed out a fireball spell.</p><p></p><p>That's when he realized the speeds of the two were incomparable.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators it took three breaths, when Luo Chen was at the proficient level it was shortened to two breaths, and now at the perfected level it was down to just one breath.</p><p></p><p>"To activate a fire talisman should be no faster than one breath!"</p><p></p><p>Activating talismans also had a process - infusing spiritual power, guiding the internal spiritual qi, and aiming at the enemy.</p><p></p><p>This process usually required an experienced veteran to calmly and rapidly activate the talisman.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was an external object.</p><p></p><p>Perception could often lead to illusions.</p><p></p><p>To avoid illusions, Luo Chen fired three more fireball spells at the stream.</p><p></p><p>No mistake!</p><p></p><p>The three fireball spells, plus the initial one, only consumed two-tenths of his power in total.</p><p></p><p>The speed was also much faster than before, comparable to activating a fire talisman.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the experimental results, Luo Chen couldn't help but show a happy smile.</p><p></p><p>Every day when he cultivated the Changchun Skill, absorbing and converting spiritual power was a very small amount. Even using all his effort, he could only recover one-fifth.</p><p></p><p>This also led to him being unable to study spells extensively, fearing his internal spiritual power would be depleted, leaving him without the ability to escape danger.</p><p></p><p>But now that the fireball spell's consumption had decreased, it also meant he could double his daily proficiency practice.</p><p></p><p>And what made Luo Chen happiest was not even this.</p><p></p><p>"Comparable to the activation speed of talismans, in a situation of catching the enemy off guard, I can completely take them by surprise."</p><p></p><p>"I finally have a combat skill I can put to use!"</p><p></p><p>All this time, Luo Chen had lacked effective combat abilities, which was why he was as insignificant as dust and no one paid attention to him.</p><p></p><p>But not being paid attention to and having combat abilities were two different matters.</p><p></p><p>His apprehensive mentality eased slightly, and Luo Chen almost wanted to let out a long shout to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But after careful consideration, he decided against it and to keep a low profile instead.</p><p></p><p>Next time when he breaks through realms and becomes a mid-level Qi Refining cultivator, then he'll shout to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>He picked up a fish that had been stunned by the steam from the shore - he could have an extra meal tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, today I caught one fish, fishing skill proficiency increased by one!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

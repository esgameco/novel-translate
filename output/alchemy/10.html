        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He was once asked, being a ninth level of Qi refining cultivator, an old resident of the inner city district. </p><p></p><p>Originally he had hopes of building a foundation on the Dao path, but unfortunately in those years he fought with others and injured his root, having no hope of building a foundation in this life.</p><p></p><p>Though his root was injured, his martial power still remained. He was at the prime age of being wealthy and strong. Thus, he normally did not lack spending money. </p><p></p><p>Even without spirit stones, if he entered the Hundred Million Mountains for a trip, as long as he didn't go into the inner areas but just circled the outskirts, killing one or two first-level demonic beasts would be enough for him to earn plenty of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for what to do with the money earned? </p><p></p><p>That was naturally to eat, drink and make merry. Naturally to enjoy delicacies, fine wine and beautiful women!</p><p></p><p>Recently he felt his funds were tight, so he planned to enter the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Thus, at the roadside stall, he browsed for some talisman papers, bought a few elixir pills, and also bought one or two convenient magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, although entering the mountains had a great possibility of earning a lot, the losses were also huge each time.</p><p></p><p>Those demonic beasts were especially rough, tough-skinned and fleshy, always easily damaging his magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Not at all like the beautiful ladies of Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, who could always polish his artifacts to a brilliant shine every time.</p><p></p><p>But today his luck wasn't bad, he bought a Qi Absorbing Talisman. The little guy beside Old Daoist Chen's fasting pills he had previously looked down upon, but this time he felt the quality was no worse than Spirit Medicine Pavilion's.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he bought five bottles, planning to try out their effects.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to leave, that little guy called out to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, are you interested in learning about the Wondrous Gathering Pill?"</p><p></p><p>"Wondrous Gathering Pill, what is that?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen said in an extremely soft voice: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator He Wen was a bit dazed, what did that mean?</p><p></p><p>Are you playing tongue twisters with me?</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen took a deep breath and said in a tone of voice that suggested the profundities could not be transmitted lightly: "Therefore, being constantly without desire, one observes its wondrous essence. Being constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations. These two emerge together but differ in name. This is called the profound. The profound of the profound is the gate to the wondrous essences."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he stared at He Wen, "Daoist friend, do you understand the meaning of these sentences?"</p><p></p><p>He Wen hesitated, nodded, then shook his head, "I don't understand, but it sounds very formidable."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help giving a thumbs up!</p><p></p><p>"It's no wonder for a ninth level Qi refining senior cultivator far beyond my realm to sense the formidable nature within just from the first listen."</p><p></p><p>He Wen blinked his eyes, is that so?</p><p></p><p>That's right, this little guy is only at the third level of Qi refining, how could he understand those words that sounded so formidable at first listen.</p><p></p><p>"But what does this have to do with the Wondrous Gathering Pill you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen pursed his lips and continued softly: "Does the Daoist friend know the story of the legendary Intimate Union sect's Cloud Crane Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you mean the Venerable Cloud Crane!"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's Cloud Crane!"  </p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"You cannot directly speak the Venerable's name, nor can you be disrespectful. You and I can just call him Cloud Crane."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, go on!"</p><p></p><p>"The story of how he back then cultivated the core methods of the Intimate Union sect, deducing it to the highest realms, thereby using the Golden Dan initial stage to suppress a fourth-level Beast King - surely you are well aware of this story!"</p><p></p><p>He Wen nodded, who didn't know this famous tale?</p><p></p><p>Especially for an old rake like himself who frequented the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, when chatting with the ladies, there would be three or two instances of conversations like this:</p><p></p><p>"Where are you from?"</p><p></p><p>"The outer sect of the Intimate Union sect?"</p><p></p><p>"I know that place, your sect has a Venerable Cloud Crane right, the old guy is super powerful, known as number one under the Yuan Ying stage!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity he's capable but the Intimate Union sect is ultimately not a righteous place. Miss, you're trapped in bitter seas, why not leave early?"</p><p></p><p>And so on, when feelings ran deep he couldn't help but hug his head and weep bitterly, lamenting the hardships of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't know this senior's inner thoughts were so rich, and continued his sales pitch.</p><p></p><p>"To use the Golden Dan stage to suppress a fourth-level Beast King, what brilliant battle accomplishments! From this we can see what shocking, earth-shattering divine abilities he comprehended from the Intimate Union sect's core methods!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, when have I not wished to witness such magnificence? But alas, I was born two hundred years too late," He Wen shook his head and sighed, his tone desolate.</p><p></p><p>"Although you cannot witness Venerable Cloud Crane's magnificence from back then, you can still sense a part of it."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how should I put this?"</p><p></p><p>"The profound insights I just spoke of, those inexplicably powerful words, are said to be one of the realizations of Master Yun Zhong He."</p><p></p><p>"Is that true or not?"</p><p></p><p>"This junior does not know if it's true or not, but many years ago I collected a tattered pill formula from the market, rumored to be from Tian Dao Feng!"  </p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen widened his eyes and said with trembling lips, "But wasn't that the nest of the fourth-grade demonic crane king back then?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps! It's a pity the pill formula was too tattered. After reading it once, it disappeared like smoke and clouds. In my haste, I only memorized a small part, and then used it to research a first-grade pill."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen looked somewhat dejected, unable to conceal his regret on his face.</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen was somewhat excited, "If it's true, even if it's just feathers and fur, it must be extraordinary. What effects does the Zhong Miao Pill have?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen lowered his head slightly, his expression somewhat shy.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, the Zhong Miao Pill has no great use, only slightly invigorating and tonifying, strengthening the root and cultivating essence."</p><p></p><p>It can invigorate and also strengthen the root and cultivate essence!</p><p></p><p>Is there such a wondrous spirit pill in this world?</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had felt a bit lacking in strength in the battles.</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen felt he had encountered the treasure pill of his life. With no hope of building a foundation, perhaps the Zhong Miao Pill was his only reliance for the rest of his days.</p><p></p><p>"Is this it?" Ceng Wen pointed to the most exquisite jade bottle at the back of the stall, clearly different from the rest.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen nodded, "This junior is inept. Using all my life's learning, I could barely refine one bottle. If the senior wishes to experience Master Yun Zhong He's great way's feathers and fur, I'm willing to sell it to you at a low price. Eight low-grade spirit stones, no, since we've just met, five will do!"</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen did not hesitate, picking up the jade bottle and opening the soft stopper.</p><p></p><p>A heart-penetrating fragrance wafted out. At first whiff, his lower abdomen felt a stirring urge.</p><p></p><p>Another whiff brought pure spiritual power to his nose, faintly like raging ocean waves crashing on the shore, boldly defying the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Carefully looking with the vision of the ninth layer of Qi Refining, the deep red pill the size of a longan fruit seemed to roll around like jelly.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang intermingling, water and fire harmonizing, it truly has a hint of the lingering fragrance that Miss Yun Xiang Lou of the Harmonious Union Sect spoke of when their core technique reaches the Golden Pill realm, the flavor of dragons and tigers intertwining."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, old pal, since we've just met, I'll take this bottle!"  </p><p></p><p>"Five spirit stones, right? Here you go!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen was pleasantly surprised, quickly stuffing the spirit stones into his robe.</p><p></p><p>"Please take your time, senior. I'll be here next month. If you need anything, feel free to find me. If there's anything unsatisfactory about the Zhong Miao Pill, please let me know directly, and this junior will do his utmost to improve it for you!"</p><p></p><p>With affectionate eyes, he watched the ninth layer Qi Refining cultivator Ceng Wen gradually walk away until he could no longer be seen.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help but breathe a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The first sale of the new product was finally made.</p><p></p><p>Once is a start, twice is familiar. The next opening is surely not far off.</p><p></p><p>He twisted his neck, feeling his shoulders were a bit stiff. Glancing sideways, he saw Elder Chen Xiuping staring at him in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>His beard trembled, his lips mumbled, and finally he gritted his teeth and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen such a shameless person!"</p><p></p><p>Hehe!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen cupped his hands, taking out another exquisite jade bottle from his robe and placing it among the remaining fifteen Bi Gu Pills.</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen seemed to have teeth grinding against the wind as he hissed, "Didn't you say you only refined one bottle?"</p><p></p><p>"It is one bottle! One bottle with ten pills, I divided it into ten bottles to sell - this is called low profit, high turnover!"</p><p></p><p>Solid!</p><p></p><p>His fists clenched solid!</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen felt he had encountered an unprecedented formidable opponent in his life!</p><p></p><p>That noon, Ceng Wen used the Wind Escorting Talisman, transforming into a azure rainbow that shot straight into the Fragrant Boudoir.</p><p></p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator blocked his way, stating that the ladies were resting and not receiving guests for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Ceng Wen, with the might of the ninth layer Qi Refining peak, glared at the Foundation Establishment cultivator and roared, "I am Ceng Wen, and today I want ten servings!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

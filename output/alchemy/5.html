        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, very early before dawn, Luo Chen crawled out of bed. </p><p></p><p>Outside was a misty haze, and if you listened carefully, you could occasionally hear the roars of beasts from the vast mountains.</p><p></p><p>But those had nothing to do with him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Today, or from now on, he would be very busy. </p><p></p><p>First was sorting and processing all kinds of medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>Most of the herbs bought from the street vendor stalls were rather crudely processed, some even still not fully dried.</p><p></p><p>He first put those on a winnowing basket, to be taken out and sun-dried once the sun came up.</p><p></p><p>Then there were the jade lotus seeds. </p><p></p><p>He had to peel off the skins, only keeping the seed kernels, the skins had to be discarded.</p><p></p><p>Working by oil lamp light, Luo Chen peeled them one by one, until his eyes felt dry, before stopping.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this will cause nearsightedness?"</p><p></p><p>"But I'm cultivating immortality, surely I can't get nearsightedness!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing processing the big pile of lotus seeds, the sky had already brightened.</p><p></p><p>Soaking the lotus seeds in diluted chicken blood from a Fire Chicken, Luo Chen took out several winnowing baskets to sun-dry them.</p><p></p><p>Living on the outskirts of the outer city, though not very safe, had the relative advantage of a large usable area.</p><p></p><p>Normally when refining the Famine Dispelling Powder, there was one process that actually gave off a very pungent smell. Doing it in a crowded area would likely lead to complaints.</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen was reported multiple times for tanning symbol papers at home, and had to bribe the officials with a few good talismans to smooth things over.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't have that concern.</p><p></p><p>The jade yam had to be diced into cubes, and some sliced into pieces - this portion was kept for refining the Famine Dispelling Powder.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen wasn't the type to put all his eggs in one basket.</p><p></p><p>In the initial refinement of the Myriad Wonder Pill, he could foresee there would be many failures.</p><p></p><p>It was entirely possible for all of them to fail, resulting in a total loss!</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just starting out with beginner-level proficiency.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, he absolutely could not let his original income stream be cut off.</p><p></p><p>In the worst case of a total loss, at least he could still rely on the earnings from the Famine Dispelling Powder to sustain his livelihood, and then make a comeback.</p><p></p><p>After processing the jade yam, it was already noon.</p><p></p><p>It was time to eat!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the hunger in his stomach, Luo Chen smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>It's said immortal cultivators don't eat mundane grains, but hunger still had to be endured!</p><p></p><p>Washing his hands, Luo Chen entered the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>He scooped out a small bowl of translucent spirit rice from the rice bin, and poured it directly into a small pot without rinsing.</p><p></p><p>This was spirit rice, a spirit stone could only buy ten pounds of it!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't bear to rinse it, fearing some of the spiritual energy would be washed away.</p><p></p><p>Going to a hidden compartment next to the kitchen, he pressed on it, and the ground opened up to reveal a small underground cellar about three feet square.</p><p></p><p>Hanging inside was half a side of beef!</p><p></p><p>A first-grade demonic beast, a yellow ox!</p><p></p><p>This stuff was also expensive, about one low-grade spirit stone for ten pounds.</p><p></p><p>The reason Luo Chen had hundreds of pounds of this meat wasn't because he was a glutton, but because yellow ox meat was the main ingredient in the Famine Dispelling Powder.</p><p></p><p>One pound of meat, plus an appropriate amount of ginseng, angelica and other medicinal ingredients, could produce five bottles of Famine Dispelling Powder, which sold for one spirit stone!</p><p></p><p>He always tried to buy more at once, as buying in bulk was cheaper, and he stored it with ice.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this half side of beef, Luo Chen's mouth watered a little.</p><p></p><p>Then with a kitchen knife, he sliced off a small two ounces of meat, and took out some regular vegetables from the ice cellar.</p><p></p><p>He washed the meat and vegetables thoroughly clean, diced the vegetables, sliced the meat into very thin pieces, and put everything into the small pot.</p><p></p><p>Add firewood!</p><p></p><p>Light the fire!</p><p></p><p>With both hands forming hand seals and murmuring incantations, after about two breaths, a small fireball appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Go!</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, the firewood in the stove immediately ignited.</p><p></p><p>"This time it went very smoothly, unlike that stove-exploding fireball incident when I first came through, that shouldn't happen again!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen smiled slightly, with a hint of self-satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the status panel, his proficiency in the Fireball Spell, which was at 268/300, had now jumped to 269/300!</p><p></p><p>Currently he had only cultivated three spells in total.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The water-based purification technique, the wood-based binding technique, the fire-based fireball technique. </p><p></p><p>Among these three spells, his proficiency was highest with the fireball technique.</p><p></p><p>This was not without reason.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he just found cultivating immortality mysterious and fun, so he would casually cast fireballs for amusement when bored. </p><p></p><p>He had experimented with the effects of this spell - slow speed, high energy consumption, but indeed great power!</p><p></p><p>As long as it hit the target, it would melt gold and iron, burn bones to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite was hitting the target!</p><p></p><p>For a normal cultivator to cast the fireball spell, from forming the hand seals to chanting the incantation, it would take at least three breaths.</p><p></p><p>Three breaths, and the enemy would have had enough time to kill him 180 times over.</p><p></p><p>At first, Luo Chen was about the same, and each cast would consume one-tenth of his total spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he realized why low-level cultivators rarely used spells in combat.</p><p></p><p>They would either use magic weapons or talismans, both of which were faster, less draining, and not much weaker than spells.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this, he lost interest in low-level spells like the fireball technique.</p><p></p><p>However, as he used the fireball to start fires for each pill concoction, his proficiency improved, and he realized spells may have their uses in battle after all.</p><p></p><p>Like now, the energy cost was still one-tenth, but the casting time had been reduced to within two breaths.</p><p></p><p>And this was just at the proficient level.</p><p></p><p>What if he reached perfect mastery?  </p><p></p><p>What if he reached grandmaster-level mastery?</p><p></p><p>So whenever the fireball could be used, he would almost always cast it once or twice.</p><p></p><p>Little by little, it adds up!</p><p></p><p>Amidst these random thoughts, the rice in the pot was almost done.</p><p></p><p>Smelling the aroma of the rice, Luo Chen took out a piece of pickled radish from the jar.</p><p></p><p>A big bowl of beef stew rice, full of spiritual energy, with an appetizing mix of red, green, yellow and white colors, paired with a few pieces of refreshingly sour and sweet pickled radish.</p><p></p><p>Sitting under the eaves, facing the cool stream breeze and sun, he ate heartily.</p><p></p><p>This was Luo Chen's most enjoyable time of the day!</p><p></p><p>If not for the pressures of survival and the pursuit of immortality, a meal like this every day would truly be blissful.</p><p></p><p>But alas, Luo Chen had no choice - he was a man with a system, one who would shine brightly even under the dark night sky!</p><p></p><p>"Damn, why does this thing stink so much!"</p><p></p><p>This destined shining man covered his chest and leaned over the stream, repeatedly gagging.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that the fire hound whip he bought from the Hundred Herb Hall would reek to that degree when undergoing special treatment.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a mask, Luo Chen mustered his courage and resumed processing the fire hound whip.</p><p></p><p>Flipping open the skin with one hand to apply the special liquid, he chanted to himself:</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't stink, it doesn't stink."</p><p></p><p>"It's a spirit stone, all spirit stones, a fragrant spirit stone!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing one fire hound whip, he rushed to the stream without delay.</p><p></p><p>"Urgh!"</p><p></p><p>Processing the raw materials was very laborious and time-consuming, but could not be done halfheartedly!</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was even more crucial than the concoction process itself.</p><p></p><p>It was simple logic - no matter how perfect the pill formula, how exquisite the technique, how top-notch the cauldron, if there were issues with the materials themselves, the end result was doomed.</p><p></p><p>It was like building a tall building - if the foundation was flawed, what was the point of discussing anything else?</p><p></p><p>After seven days, all the raw materials had undergone preliminary and advanced processing to reach the most perfect state possible.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen had also taken the time to concoct a few batches of Hunger Dispelling Powder, forming them into pills and storing them away.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't plan to sell them this time.</p><p></p><p>He planned to wait until the All-Marvelous Pills were ready, then sell them together.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, that iron cauldron containing traces of spirit ore would be cleaned for use in concocting the All-Marvelous Pills.</p><p></p><p>Standing before the stove, Luo Chen solemnly donned an apron.</p><p></p><p>Bowing to the blackened kitchen ceiling, "Guardian Deity Guan Er of my hometown, the Venerable Lord Lao Zi, the great Pill Saint of this land, bless me with a successful concoction!"</p><p></p><p>Light the cauldron!</p><p></p><p>Start the fire!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

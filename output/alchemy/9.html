        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Call me Uncle Chen when there's something to do, Daoist friend Chen when there's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Daoist Chen stroked his beard and then excitedly began telling his favorite gossip story. </p><p></p><p>He had this habit.</p><p></p><p>Normally stingy and looking for bargains, he never let himself be shortchanged when selling things, even splitting the stall fees with novices like Luo Chen at the third level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he liked to share for free was probably his experience from the past sixty-odd years.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Crane? You mean the Venerable Cloud Crane?"</p><p></p><p>"If you ask ordinary people, they probably really don't know, but this old Daoist knows a bit."</p><p></p><p>"The Thirty-Six Domains of the Eastern Wilderness, we're located at the extreme east, near the Million Mountains Range. So the six domains nearby that border the Million Mountains have a special name - the Six Extreme Eastern Domains."</p><p></p><p>"Within each major domain, there are countless sects. Only the major sects that have produced Yuanying True immortals can take the name of that domain."  </p><p></p><p>"The sect Venerable Cloud Crane belongs to is the Heluan Sect, the strongest in the Heluan Domain!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen listened with relish, this was his first time understanding the world outside of Dahu Town.</p><p></p><p>He casually asked, "Then does that mean our domain here is called the Yuding Domain?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the strongest sect here is the Yuding Sword Sect, so we're called the Yuding Domain."</p><p></p><p>Elder Daoist Chen answered, then continued: "The Yuding Sword Sect is famous for its battle prowess. Being closest to the Million Mountains, it has several large towns under its jurisdiction that serve as forward outposts for attacking the Million Mountains. Dahu Town is one of them."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he felt something was off. </p><p></p><p>He glared and stroked his beard, "Don't interrupt me kid, I'm talking about Venerable Cloud Crane."</p><p></p><p>"The Heluan Sect is renowned worldwide for its dual cultivation methods, with its signature industries spread across the six domains. For example, the Tianxiang Pavilion here is just one of their insignificant businesses."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxiang Pavilion was so huge, earning top-grade spirit stones by the bushel daily, yet it was just an insignificant business?</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help but become interested. Such a wealthy, beautiful enterprise should be his goal to strive for!</p><p></p><p>"People say the Heluan Sect doesn't walk the righteous path, doesn't produce anything, and doesn't establish dominance through martial prowess, only engaging in the fleshly business, tarnishing the reputation of us cultivators. However, an anomaly appeared three hundred years ago!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen slapped his hand, "That's Cloud Crane, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It's Venerable Cloud Crane! For a Golden Dan cultivator, you must use the honorific 'Venerable'!" Elder Daoist Chen rebuked, then continued: "That Venerable Cloud Crane cultivated the Heluan Sect's core methods to the highest level. Not only was he outstandingly talented and graceful, his martial prowess was unmatched."</p><p></p><p>"When the Yuding Domain was first opened up, although the Yuding Sword Sect led the charge, the other five domains also sent many experts. Venerable Cloud Crane was one of them."</p><p></p><p>"At that time he was still unknown, just an ordinary early Golden Dan cultivator. But in that battle, with just early Golden Dan realm, he actually captured a fourth-grade yao beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what a fourth-grade yao beast means?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's eyes went wide like an ox's.</p><p></p><p>Then he gasped sharply, making a huge contribution to global warming. </p><p></p><p>Next he swallowed his saliva with an audible gulp.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he deeply exhaled a foul breath that would probably demote any cultivator who smelled it.</p><p></p><p>"A fourth-grade yao beast, isn't that on par with a human Yuanying True Immortal?!!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Daoist Chen was very satisfied with the intense reaction of his audience. He stroked his beard smugly, as if he had accomplished that feat himself.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you little brat actually have some knowledge. A fourth-grade yao beast, also called a Beast King, has even greater battle prowess than a same-realm Yuanying True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen asked doubtfully, "But isn't it said that cross-realm challenges are extremely difficult? How could the then early Golden Dan Venerable Cloud Crane have such a brilliant achievement?"</p><p></p><p>"The reason is something we later generations cannot know. Some say he took advantage when that Beast King Yao Crane was weak from crossing a tribulation. Others say a True Immortal from the Heluan Sect intervened. But the result was Venerable Cloud Crane made a name for himself in that battle. Moreover, with the Beast King Yao Crane as his achievement, he earned the title 'Venerable Cloud Crane'!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Elder Daoist Chen raised his hand to point towards the inner city in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The heart's pavilion of rouge and embroidery.</p><p></p><p>"In the Six Eastern Domains, each has its own crisscrossing industries. Even a wealthy and influential sect like the Yao Wang Sect merely has shops spanning across four domains. Only the Hehuan Sect has businesses covering all six domains. Even in this remote Dahe Market Town, there stands a Tianxiang Pavilion filled with music and singing every night."  </p><p></p><p>"This is largely due to the contributions of Venerable Yunhe, the number one under the Yuan Ying realm!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yunhe, the number one under the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p></p><p>What an impressive title and story!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help but give an appreciative glance towards Wang Yuan at a street stall in the distance. That book 'Records of the Six Domains' was indeed worth obtaining for free.</p><p></p><p>In the future when he has money, he must buy it and study it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, little Luo, you're making me thirsty talking like that. Have some beef jerky to quench your thirst."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen ignored him and laid out all the spirit pills he had.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Chen, it's time for us to gather resources for cultivation. Given time, perhaps we too can be addressed as Venerables!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiuping's eyes widened as his white beard trembled with anger.  </p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of his height, Luo Chen patted Chen's shoulder. "I only hope that when we next meet after achieving the Golden Core, we won't be called 'impoverished Daoists'!"</p><p></p><p>"Scram! I'm sixty-five already, forget about that Golden Core dream!"</p><p></p><p>After cursing, Chen Xiuping took a deep breath to calm down. Getting angry leads to illness with no one to help.</p><p></p><p>His gaze habitually fell on Luo Chen's stall and couldn't help but focus.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-one bottles? Are they all Abstinence Pills, or did you really refine some new spirit pills?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen sighed with a dejected look. "Your junior has limited talent and exhausted his family's wealth to barely refine one new spirit pill. Please don't laugh, Senior Chen."</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen swallowed his saliva.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't really refine that incomplete second-grade pill formula, did you?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, your junior is incapable of refining second-grade spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>"Well, of course for a brat like you..."</p><p></p><p>"So I could only settle for deducing it into a first-grade spirit pill instead."</p><p></p><p>"First-grade Jade Dew Pill?" Old Daoist Chen's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>This little old man's expressions are quite lively, swallowing saliva, widening eyes. Hopefully he doesn't gasp next!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen said solemnly with his hands behind his back, "That's no incomplete Jade Dew Pill formula. It's actually the secret Zhong Miao Pill formula passed down by Venerable Yunhe of the Hehuan Sect. It was only left behind in this Dahe Market Town after a great battle to open the Jade Cauldron Domain back then. You can't go around spreading rumors, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Hiss!!!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen covered his face. He could feel the climate in the Jade Cauldron Domain warming up!</p><p></p><p>In fact, the temperature did warm up because the sun came out.</p><p></p><p>With the sun out, customer flow naturally picked up too.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators liked browsing the Street of Wandering Cultivators, as everyone had thoughts of purchasing affordable resources or finding bargains.</p><p></p><p>As always, Old Daoist Chen's stall opened first. </p><p></p><p>He had set up his street stall here for many years. Although stingy, his reputation was rock solid.</p><p></p><p>Not only did others buy talismans from him, some fellow cultivators too lazy would even buy talisman papers from him and just draw the talismans themselves when they got back.</p><p></p><p>When Old Daoist Chen's stall opened, it also meant Luo Chen's was about to open too.</p><p></p><p>"Abstinence Pills?"</p><p></p><p>"The color and aroma are quite decent, with considerable spiritual energy stored within. Top-quality goods! How much for them?"</p><p></p><p>The customer casually picked up five bottles and tossed Luo Chen a low-grade spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>Five bottles containing fifty Abstinence Pills in total. One pill could provide a full meal, so fifty would last fifty days!</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was an extreme case. Normally, it would be enough to sustain someone for half a month without eating.</p><p></p><p>However, these tasted bland, and were unsuitable for cultivation. Unless truly destitute, secluded for retreat, or out hunting and gathering herbs in the mountains, hardly anyone would eat them as meals.</p><p></p><p>After paying the spirit stone, the plump cultivator was about to leave when Luo Chen called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, are you interested in learning about the Zhong Miao Pill?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ever since he inherited this body through transmigration, his proficiency would only increase on the premise of success. </p><p></p><p>So he had never considered the possibility of gaining proficiency from failure.</p><p></p><p>But thinking carefully, why couldn't failure increase proficiency?</p><p></p><p>Success never came directly, but was accumulated through repeated failures.  </p><p></p><p>Although the experience gained from failure was meager, wasn't that meager experience also a form of success?</p><p></p><p>It was like learning to drive. Beginners indeed couldn't take curves in drainage ditches.</p><p></p><p>But wasn't each successful uphill start, successful parallel parking, successful straight-line acceleration a small success in itself?</p><p></p><p>It was by accumulating these minor successes that one finally became an experienced city driver, a curve-mastering driver on Mountain Qiuming.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was one more point!</p><p></p><p>He wasn't without any complete success!</p><p></p><p>He had one!</p><p></p><p>The system achievement points helped him get started directly, which actually represented having the experience of one success.</p><p></p><p>Why could only sects and cultivator clans nurture orthodox pill furnacers, while wandering pill furnacers were so rare?</p><p></p><p>The reason was actually very simple - the initial investment was just too huge.</p><p></p><p>So huge that a pill furnacing apprentice, failing repeatedly, couldn't even see hope for one success. Wandering cultivators could only give up in the face of such enormous upfront investment.</p><p></p><p>But sects and clans were different - they had enough financial resources to support the repeated failures in the early stage.</p><p></p><p>And as long as the pill furnacing apprentice succeeded once, they would have the experience of one success, making it natural to replicate that success later.</p><p></p><p>This was why those who succeeded, succeeded forever.</p><p></p><p>And in fact, Luo Chen also had a backing force cultivating him, allowing him to skip over the entire investment stage of initial failures and get started directly!</p><p></p><p>And this system thing was even more formidable than sects and clans.</p><p></p><p>Some people were truly talentless, but as long as Luo Chen got started, he would be considered to have a certain talent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this start relied on the achievement points provided by breaking through proficiency levels in each skill.</p><p></p><p>So to speak...</p><p></p><p>"All my successes come from my own efforts!"</p><p></p><p>Discovering his proficiency was rising, Luo Chen's mood, which had already adjusted quite well, became even better.</p><p></p><p>He was even howling excitedly like he had been injected with chicken blood!</p><p></p><p>However, having realized the principle of "more haste, less speed" yesterday, he also understood that this excited state was not very suitable for pill furnacing directly.</p><p></p><p>So today, he planned to do something else to adjust his state.</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Practice martial arts!</p><p></p><p>To be more precise, practice lightness skill.</p><p></p><p>Those close to him knew his situation - his cultivation base was not high, his spiritual power was not formidable, and the low-grade flying sword in his hands was just for show. He hadn't even learned the Guiding Technique, so the flying sword could only be used for slashing in his hands.</p><p></p><p>When the original host had entered the mountains back then, he had actually just been helping others transport demonic beast meat back to the city in the outermost area.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, what would give him the greatest ability to preserve his life?</p><p></p><p>The answer was naturally to be able to run!</p><p></p><p>In theory, the most suitable way for a qi condensation cultivator to run was with talisman transportation or riding a magical artifact for temporary flight, with the wind-summoning spell being the worst option.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, talisman transportation was extremely expensive, and ordinary people couldn't even buy it.</p><p></p><p>Magical artifacts required the Guiding Technique, and their effect was not even better than the wind-summoning spell.</p><p></p><p>As for the wind-summoning spell, a common item that Luo Chen couldn't afford before - a single copy cost dozens of low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>So he could only set his sights on the lightness skill of secular martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a mortal-level martial art, it wasn't completely useless, at least not relying on spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's spiritual power was not much to begin with.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power of low-level scattered cultivators is actually not that great. In many cases, battles are just about standing still and outputting attacks.</p><p></p><p>So secular light skills that don't consume spiritual power still have their uses in martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the main gate, he opened up a light skill secret manual that he had bought for ten taels of gold from the market street. </p><p></p><p>'Wandering at Ease'</p><p></p><p>What an awesome name!</p><p></p><p>The introduction was also awesome: "Riding the righteous forces of heaven and earth, commanding the subtleties of the six breaths, to wander endlessly!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, in reality it was just the great fantasy of the founder.</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading it several times, Luo Chen tried to put it into practice, no, put it into footwork!</p><p></p><p>This was not a set of bizarre footwork-based combat light skills, but rather travel light skills focused on borrowing force, deflecting force, adjusting one's form at high speeds, coordinating with rhythmic breathing to achieve fast and long-distance running.</p><p></p><p>When he first started practicing, Luo Chen felt a bit unaccustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>What was this borrowing force, deflecting force stuff? How do you command the six breaths?</p><p></p><p>But after running on the plain across the stream for the whole morning, he really did gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>"When the wind is strong, adjust your form and change directions, don't run against the wind."</p><p></p><p>"If there are branches or slopes, you can borrow the force to leap, and when landing either deflect the force for a light landing or put force into a rebound to accelerate your running."</p><p></p><p>"Your breathing rhythm can't be disordered, and your mindset must be calm, though not wandering at ease, you must still put in your full effort with sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, this light skill actually has some profound substance to it."</p><p></p><p>While eating lunch, Luo Chen glanced at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>In the skills section, there was now clearly a [Wandering at Ease Beginner: 13/100].</p><p></p><p>"I've reached the beginner level, and the proficiency is rising quite quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating immortality is like a turtle's crawl, but the martial path is like a soaring roc. I must have been a peerless martial genius all along!"</p><p></p><p>Holding the big bowl, Luo Chen laughed foolishly.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity the martial path can't grant longevity, otherwise he could show off as a martial sage.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon he practiced Wandering at Ease for half a day more, and Luo Chen became increasingly adept at it, his proficiency rising swiftly.</p><p></p><p>When Luo Chen rested, he investigated the reasons and attributed it to his current physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Eating spirit rice and monster meat every day, circulating spiritual qi with the Long Spring Skill, even if he was a pig, he'd be a demonic pig.</p><p></p><p>With a stronger physique, wasn't it natural that his physical abilities would be stronger too?</p><p></p><p>It was just like those basketball superstars in the previous world - do you think they became stars just from skills? No, first they had to have bodies full of natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called "talentless" superstars had better bodies than ordinary professional basketball players.</p><p></p><p>He currently had sufficient physical strength. Studying a body cultivation manual, his performance wasn't super-human, he was just developing the physical capabilities he should have.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Luo Chen soaked in the one-meter deep stream, lowering his head to dig out a pile of mud.</p><p></p><p>Then, relying on his memory, he sculpted a mud figurine.</p><p></p><p>With phoenix eyes, silkworm eyebrows, a majestic and formidable appearance - even art college girls would have to praise his sculpting skills.</p><p></p><p>"Just you wait, Guan Er. Tonight I'll stick a beard on you and carve you a crescent moon blade!"</p><p></p><p>As he muttered, the sounds of beast roars came from the forest miles away on the plain.</p><p></p><p>Then several rays of light flashed out from the trees.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen quickly stood up warily, went back into the house to retrieve his sword, and closed the main gate.</p><p></p><p>On the plain across the stream, those rays of light had already landed in the wild grass, gazing towards the depths of the distant mountains.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

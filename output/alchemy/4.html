        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Conpoy was still acceptable, with its unique taste, and people often bought it to make soup. </p><p></p><p>But as for the Fire Hound Whip, its use was rather singular. </p><p></p><p>How could this young man need to use such a thing?</p><p></p><p>Hehe</p><p></p><p>"No need to address me as senior, just call me Proprietor Liu. What should I call you, young friend?" The plump proprietor asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings Proprietor Liu, my surname is Luo, you can call me Little Luo."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help but act humbly, as the amiable plump proprietor before him exuded an aura that made him uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed this kind of aura before, naturally emanating from high-level cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Facing such an expert, he naturally had to maintain a respectful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Proprietor Liu smiled slightly, "So you're Fellow Daoist Luo. I do have the two medicinal ingredients you asked about, but the quantities are not very large."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen had expected as much.</p><p></p><p>Dahe Market Town was located in a frontier region near the Eastern Wilderness, a vast inland area.  </p><p></p><p>One of the ingredients he inquired about, the conpoy, was a marine spirit herb that often had to be transported from very far away.</p><p></p><p>A small quantity was to be expected, but having any was good enough!</p><p></p><p>"Can you gather one hundred portions of conpoy? For the Fire Hound Whip, I need ten."</p><p></p><p>"There is that much, but the price is not cheap." Proprietor Liu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>By not cheap, he of course didn't mean very expensive, but was referring to Luo Chen's cultivation level of the third layer of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Especially given the other party's modest attire, he didn't seem to have much money.</p><p></p><p>"What's the price?"</p><p></p><p>"One hundred portions of conpoy is ten low-grade spirit stones. Ten Fire Hound Whips is also ten low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's eyelids twitched.  </p><p></p><p>He even suspected that this plump proprietor had X-ray vision and saw that he only had twenty spirit stones left in his possession.</p><p></p><p>"So expensive?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want them or not?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll be a regular customer from now on, can I get a discount?"</p><p></p><p>"The Bai Cao Tang is a five-hundred-year-old establishment with branches in four domains. Our prices are fair to all, no bargaining!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, pack them up for me. Here are twenty spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, Luo Chen reluctantly took out a bag of twenty spirit stones from his robe.</p><p></p><p>The plump proprietor snatched the bag of spirit stones from his hand at a speed invisible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ling, grab one hundred portions of conpoy and ten Fire Hound Whips!"</p><p></p><p>With the goods in hand, Luo Chen shouldered the large bundle of herbs by the entrance and left Bai Cao Tang with a knowing smile from the proprietor.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the remaining daylight when there were few wandering cultivators on the road to accost him, the travel-stained Luo Chen hurried back home.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the large pile on the ground, Luo Chen sighed.</p><p></p><p>Years of savings, gone in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Carefully calculating, he had only saved up fifty spirit stones over the years, and today he had spent them all.</p><p></p><p>Especially those last two main ingredients, which cost twenty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Damn five-hundred-year-old establishment, more like a black market shop, I hope you go out of business soon!"</p><p></p><p>After cursing the profiteers, Luo Chen tried to encourage himself.</p><p></p><p>"The money will come back, it will all come back!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll earn even more spirit stones in the future!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he took off his low-grade Daoist robe, carefully folded it up, and jumped into the nearby stream wearing just his underwear.</p><p></p><p>This place was relatively remote. Although it was near the Eastern Wilderness' million mountains, most people returning from the mountains would take the eastern route, so there were few people around.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have to worry about being seen in the nude and having to offer his body in return.</p><p></p><p>After a refreshing wash to rinse off the various odors from the day, even though he knew cleansing spells, they were more like using spiritual power to explode the dirt off one's body. Not as refreshing as a good bath.</p><p></p><p>He only used those spells to clean his Daoist robe regularly.</p><p></p><p>Back in the wooden hut, Luo Chen changed into a fresh pair of underwear and casually threw on a gray linen robe.</p><p></p><p>With his damp long hair hanging down his back, he retrieved a bundled package from under the floorboards in the corner of the room.</p><p></p><p>Unwrapping it revealed a yellowed bamboo slip, a thin booklet, and a sheepskin paper.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo slip contained simple content called the Changchun Skill, which was Luo Chen's main cultivation method, only up to the ninth layer of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it this skill was the entry-level method of the Yao Wang Sect, with the Yimu Yao Wang Scripture above it.</p><p></p><p>This skill came from a chance encounter in his youth, found on the remains in a mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen had never stopped cultivating this method. Apart from nightly practice sessions, on days he didn't refine pills, he mostly spent time cultivating this skill.</p><p></p><p>However, the results were truly negligible.</p><p></p><p>Even until now, he was still at the third layer of Qi Condensation, with breaking through to the fourth layer seeming hopelessly out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was this cultivation method's proficiency level that was increasing quite rapidly, already reaching the mastery level. </p><p></p><p>He estimated it wouldn't take long before breaking through to the perfect level, with grandmaster level just around the corner!</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to know if the proficiency of the Changchun Skill at the grandmaster level could significantly improve his cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin scroll recorded the incomplete pill formula he had obtained in his previous life - the Jade Dew Pill. </p><p></p><p>Luo Chen had no interest in it. Not to mention this pill formula was incomplete, even if it was complete, he had no plans to study it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was just a second-grade pill for cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage. All the medicinal ingredients were not something he could currently prepare.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the host had exhausted his savings and barely gathered a set of materials, even finding many substitutes, hoping to make a huge gain in one go.</p><p></p><p>He must have been so impoverished that he saw red.</p><p></p><p>His attention was completely on that small book.</p><p></p><p>Opening the thin book, the first two pages contained the formula for the Fasting Incense Pill. </p><p></p><p>Unlike regular pill formulas that only listed the required ingredients, this book recorded the proportions of each material, the processing methods for various herbs, and even mentioned controlling the flame temperature.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the original host was able to easily get started that year.</p><p></p><p>After just a few failed attempts, he successfully refined his first batch of Fasting Incense Pills.</p><p></p><p>From then on, he also had the capital to settle down in the Dahu Market.</p><p></p><p>As for this pill formula, Luo Chen had already studied it thoroughly.  </p><p></p><p>What he wanted to work on next were the following five pages.</p><p></p><p>"Zhongmiao Pill: Harmonizing water and fire, balancing yin and yang, stimulating yang energy without damaging the kidney's source, helping to prolong intimacy."</p><p></p><p>Enjoying alone is not as good as enjoying together, the intermingling of yin and yang is indescribably wonderful!</p><p></p><p>Hence this pill is named the Zhongmiao (Wondrous Crowd) Pill.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, this is the Viagra of the cultivation world. </p><p></p><p>Of course, according to the product description, it should be red in color.</p><p></p><p>If he could refine this stuff, there would definitely be a market for it.</p><p></p><p>As long as they're human, they have those needs, even cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even in this Dahu Market, one of the six top-tier shops is the Fragrant Boudoir.</p><p></p><p>With few female cultivators here, this group of men who frequently go into the mountains to hunt demonic beasts and gather herbs have an even greater demand in that area.</p><p></p><p>As for why the original host didn't try refining these kinds of pills, Luo Chen couldn't guess his psychological reasons.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of losing face selling these pills?  </p><p></p><p>Heh, in cultivation, nothing is unsavory!</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, he carefully reviewed the five pages of the Zhongmiao Pill formula again.</p><p></p><p>The processing of each ingredient, the order and timing of adding them, the proportions, controlling the flame temperature - </p><p></p><p>After everything was committed to memory, Luo Chen opened the panel in his mind's eye.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Luo Chen]</p><p>[Longevity: 27/75]</p><p>[Spiritual Root: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]</p><p>[Realm: Qi Condensation Level 3: 75/100] </p><p>[Cultivation Method: Changchun Skill Mastery: 235/300]</p><p>[Spells: Cleaning Talisman Beginner 49/100, Binding Spell Proficient 176/200, Fireball Spell Mastery 268/300]</p><p>[Skills: First Grade Pill Refiner: Fasting Incense Pill Grandmaster 501/1000]</p><p>[Achievement Points: 10 (Can be used to begin corresponding realm's methods, spells, skills)]</p><p></p><p>His gaze first paused on Longevity, then fell on the last line.</p><p></p><p>Achievement Points!</p><p></p><p>For every cultivation method, skill, or spell that broke through a proficiency level, it would provide one achievement point.</p><p></p><p>As long as he accumulated ten achievement points, he could use them to begin learning any method, spell or skill corresponding to his current realm.</p><p></p><p>He had only recently acquired the Cleaning Talisman, so it was just at the beginner level, not having time to grind its proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, spells consumed quite a bit of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the pressures of survival, he had invested most of his efforts into pill refining.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it paid off as his proficiency in refining the Fasting Incense Pill broke through to grandmaster, giving him a full five achievement points.</p><p></p><p>Adding the two from the Changchun Skill, one from the Binding Spell, and two from the Fireball Spell.</p><p></p><p>He had just accumulated ten points!</p><p></p><p>And his entire savings were just enough to gather materials for ten batches of the Zhongmiao Pill.</p><p></p><p>Success or failure would be decided tomorrow!</p><p></p><p>And now, deep blue... no wait, the Zhongmiao Pill refining skill, begin!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the ten achievement points disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In their place, a new line appeared on his attribute panel:</p><p></p><p>[First Grade Pill Refiner: Fasting Incense Pill Grandmaster 501/1000, Zhongmiao Pill Beginner 1/100]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

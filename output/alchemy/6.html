        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blackish lump in the pot and smelling the burnt odor, Luo Chen's eyes were red and his face was ashen. </p><p></p><p>Failure!</p><p></p><p>The sixth pot, failed again!</p><p></p><p>This was the sixth day of refining the Zhong Miao Pill, and he had been refining it methodically at the pace of one pot per day.</p><p></p><p>The final result left him deeply hurt. </p><p></p><p>Not a single success!</p><p></p><p>The best attempt only produced a pale reddish paste.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that according to the pill formula, the final product should be deep red, redder than his patriotic heart!</p><p></p><p>With a somewhat dejected look, he picked up the pot and dumped the blackish lump on the other side of the stream. </p><p></p><p>Then, by the stream, he halfheartedly washed the pot with a loofah.</p><p></p><p>His mind kept replaying the refining process.</p><p></p><p>"The proportions of ingredients can't be wrong, I weighed them precisely to the extreme."</p><p></p><p>"The order of adding ingredients shouldn't be wrong either, I added them at exactly the right moments indicated by the symptoms."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the fire control? Or is it the firewood? But the formula says as long as it's peach wood, it's fine. For a first-grade pill, it shouldn't require anything too special."</p><p></p><p>"Or is it that my technique is wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The successive failures made Luo Chen start to doubt himself.</p><p></p><p>He even wondered if he lacked the innate talent for pill refining, and his previous success with the Bi Gu San Pill was only because of the original owner's talent that he had taken over.</p><p></p><p>He was merely usurping someone else's well-practiced game account, walking briskly on a path that had already been paved.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Water splashed onto his face.</p><p></p><p>It was a big carp that had swum by, leaping up and splashing water on his face as it passed.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be more and more fish in the stream lately, probably washed over from the rising waters of the Lancang River!</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the quickly swimming away fish, Luo Chen was fuming.</p><p></p><p>Bala bala energy!</p><p></p><p>"Fire Ball!"</p><p></p><p>A lump of charcoal floated up from the water surface, then gradually drifted away with the stream's current.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the iron pot in his hands that he had washed spotlessly clean.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the problem is with the equipment?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen couldn't help but show the classic bitter smile of a webnovel male lead. How well he knew the predicament of his pill refining efforts.</p><p></p><p>No renowned master to guide him, no family to support him, not even proper equipment for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Others used top-notch magic cauldrons and stoves, fueled by celestial and earthly fires, while he was here simmering medicine in an iron pot.</p><p></p><p>But those magic cauldrons and stoves cost ten times more than a flying sword of the same grade!</p><p></p><p>Even the favorite defensive magic tools of wandering cultivators were less precious than magic pill cauldrons.</p><p></p><p>Just scraping together the ingredients for ten batches of Zhong Miao Pills had drained his family's assets, let alone buying a magic cauldron or stove - that was completely out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even the most low-grade pill cauldron couldn't be fired up with ordinary firewood.</p><p></p><p>At minimum it required first-grade spirit wood as fuel, and a pill refiner constantly adjusting the flame with their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't afford first-grade spirit wood, nor did he have the cultivation level to keep adjusting the flame with spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he wished he could be like the legendary pill refiners of tales, with a fresh batch of glistening pills emerging from the cauldron, instead of having to knead the scorching medicine paste into shape with his bare hands when it was still piping hot.</p><p></p><p>Who didn't know how hot that stuff was!</p><p></p><p>Some medicine pastes even had negative effects on the physical body!</p><p></p><p>It was just a lack of conditions, wasn't it!</p><p></p><p>After a bout of self-pity, Luo Chen put the pot back on the stove and untied his apron, sitting at the front door.</p><p></p><p>Facing the last rays of the setting sun, he gave himself two slaps on the face.</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of thinking about what I don't have!"</p><p></p><p>"I've already gambled my entire fortune on this, even if I hit a wall this time, I have to break through it no matter what!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a break from practice tomorrow and readjust my mindset first."</p><p></p><p>The principle of "more haste, less speed" was understood by all.</p><p></p><p>But when it came down to it, one often had to bang their head against the wall before realizing they had been too hasty.</p><p></p><p>Having nothing better to do in the evening, Luo Chen felt a pent-up blaze in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had to vent it!</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Fire Ball!  </p><p></p><p>Fire Ball!</p><p></p><p>Fire Ball!</p><p></p><p>The stream suffered, and the fish in the river cried out in distress.</p><p></p><p>Nine full-power castings of the Fire Ball spell in a row depleted his spiritual power completely.</p><p></p><p>Along with gaining nine points of proficiency, an exhausted Luo Chen returned to his house, sat cross-legged, and circulated the Long Spring Skill.</p><p></p><p>After a full greater cycle, his spiritual power recovered by one-fifth.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Another full day passed, and his spiritual power recovered by one-fifth. </p><p></p><p>Yeah, that's it.</p><p></p><p>Low-level cultivators' physical bodies are lacking, and their spiritual souls have not undergone qualitative change either. Cultivating two or three times a night is pretty much the limit.</p><p></p><p>In the latter half of the night, Luo Chen fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day when he woke up, the spiritual power in his body had recovered to less than half.</p><p></p><p>The limited spiritual power was actually the reason why he couldn't use his spell proficiency to break through and gain achievement points.</p><p></p><p>Practicing the Fireball Spell for a day would require five days to recover!</p><p></p><p>Even for a low-energy spell like the Cleaning Spell, it still required enough time.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen wasn't staying in a particularly safe place either, so he had to reserve some spiritual power to escape if needed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when he got up in the morning, he felt a bit of regret.</p><p></p><p>He really went crazy last night, actually using up all his spiritual power. If a demonic beast had wandered over here, he wouldn't have had much ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>"I can't do that again in the future, remember, remember!"</p><p></p><p>After muttering that, he sat cross-legged and practiced the Long Spring Technique.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power recovered by another one-fifth.</p><p></p><p>Then he opened his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Luo Chen]</p><p>[Lifespan: 27/75]</p><p>[Spiritual Root: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]</p><p>[Realm: Qi Refining 3rd Layer: 75/100] </p><p>[Technique: Long Spring Technique Mastered: 249/300]</p><p>[Spells: Cleaning Spell Beginner 51/100, Binding Spell Proficient 176/200, Fireball Spell Perfect 304/500]</p><p>[Skills: 1st Rank Pill Refiner: Bigu Powder Master 507/1000, Zhongmiao Pill Beginner 3/100]</p><p>[Achievement Points: 1 point (Can be used to reach beginner level of corresponding realm, technique, spell, skill)]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the attribute panel, Luo Chen became a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>His lifespan was likely his own from before transmigrating, as the original owner of this body must have died already, with a lifespan of zero.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted to earn so many spirit stones was actually for cultivation, for longevity.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about how if he hadn't transmigrated, he could only live 75 years on Earth, he felt a bit sad.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't even reach the level of an 80th birthday celebration, let alone have descendants dancing at his funeral, even though he was just a single dog before transmigrating.</p><p></p><p>So in this life, he had to take it step-by-step and cultivate to the highest level, living as long as possible!</p><p></p><p>Then the cold reality gave him a slap - half a month had passed, and he hadn't stopped practicing the Long Spring Technique twice a day.</p><p></p><p>But his realm was still completely stagnant.</p><p></p><p>With his balanced five spiritual roots, he couldn't be this much of a waste, could he?</p><p></p><p>How did the previous owner cultivate to the 3rd Layer of Qi Refining? It couldn't be that the remains left him a few big bottles of Qi Replenishing Pills, right?</p><p></p><p>After the cold reality, he was touched by the benefits of transmigration.</p><p></p><p>The Long Spring Technique's proficiency increased by 26 points, though he didn't feel much difference.</p><p></p><p>In the Spells section, the Cleaning Spell increased by 2 points, once when he used it to clean his robe, and once to clean an iron pot, thoroughly washing away the residual smell from refining the Bigu Powder.</p><p></p><p>There was basically no change to the Binding Spell, as he didn't want to end up binding a Golden Core cultivator by mistake.</p><p></p><p>As for the Fireball Spell, with the maximum two castings per day, plus last night's splurge, its proficiency soared by 36 points.</p><p></p><p>It had now broken through the Mastered level and reached the Perfect level.</p><p></p><p>It even provided a breakthrough achievement point.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, what would a Perfect-level Fireball Spell feel like?</p><p></p><p>But since his spiritual power hadn't fully recovered yet, he should probably hold back his excitement and eager hands!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Luo Chen closed the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>However, before closing it, his gaze unconsciously skipped over the achievement points section, and he blinked his eyes before hurriedly reopening the panel.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute!"</p><p></p><p>"[Skills: 1st Rank Pill Refiner: Bigu Powder Master 507/1000, Zhongmiao Pill Beginner 3/100]"</p><p></p><p>He clearly remembered that after using an achievement point to reach the beginner level of the Zhongmiao Pill, its proficiency should have only been 1, but now it was 3.</p><p></p><p>But he had never successfully refined a single Zhongmiao Pill!</p><p></p><p>"You can gain proficiency even from failures?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Three male cultivators wearing tight Daoist robes surrounded him, bending down to look at the things on the bluestone slab. </p><p></p><p>"Hey, a Qi Concealing Talisman, good stuff! How much for one?"</p><p></p><p>"Five spirit stones per talisman. An essential item for home, travel, mountain hunting. At a critical moment, activate this talisman, and even a prickly wolf won't be able to smell you!"</p><p></p><p>"So expensive, why don't you just rob people?"</p><p></p><p>"Just say if you want it or not!"</p><p></p><p>"Give us a discount, we need to go into the mountains and buy many kinds of talismans. We can buy a bunch from you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you guys want to ask around? I'm Old Daoist Chen at the Great River Market, known for my talisman crafting skills! Besides, can the talisman give you a discount when the demon beast attacks? Will it bite you one less time?"</p><p></p><p>"Three spirit stones for this Qi Concealing Talisman, plus three Earth Thorn Talismans and six Fireball Talismans."</p><p></p><p>"Four stones! Can't go any lower, this Qi Concealing Talisman is my unique product, I only make one per month!"</p><p></p><p>The three male cultivators discussed and decided to buy this Qi Concealing Talisman. </p><p></p><p>After settling the bill, they turned their attention to the jade bottle in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Fasting Pills?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen perked up, "One pill can fill you up. Ten pills will keep you from getting hungry for three days and three nights. How many bottles do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, these Fasting Pills use premium first-grade yellow cattle meat as the main ingredient, supplemented with ginseng and angelica, and finally refined with the Hundred Flower Honey, a specialty of the Medicine King Sect. They are high quality at a reasonable price!"</p><p></p><p>"Really that good?"</p><p></p><p>"Here, smell this fragrance, isn't it alluring? Look at the color, absolutely no adulteration with flour. I dare say no one in this area has better quality than mine!"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, it does seem more fragrant than the Fasting Pills we bought before."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, this Daoist friend is clearly an expert. The Fasting Pills you bought before must have been fake beef!"</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"Four bottles for just one spirit stone!"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you just rob people?"</p><p></p><p>"Just say if you want them or not! After this stall, there's no such good stuff. Let me tell you, I have many regular customers. Wait a bit and I'll sell out and go home."</p><p></p><p>"Give us a discount?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you three Daoists seem sincere about buying, how about this, still one spirit stone, but five bottles! How's that? Consider it making new friends, and I'll give you a discount when I have new pills in the future too!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, ten bottles then. We still have some stock left from before, let's try yours this time."</p><p></p><p>After the transaction, Luo Chen and Old Daoist Chen cupped their hands in blessing, "Safe travels into the mountains, may your harvest be bountiful."</p><p></p><p>After the people left, the two men smiled at each other.</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen even secretly put another Qi Concealing Talisman on the stall.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he say he only made one per month?</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose higher, the scattered cultivator area in the southwest also became more lively.</p><p></p><p>There were vendors selling pills, cultivation methods, demon beast meat, you name it.</p><p></p><p>Buyers browsing goods came in an endless stream, and occasionally one or two disciples in the standard Daoist robe of the Jade Tripod Sword Sect would appear.</p><p></p><p>When the latter showed up, the scattered cultivators became even more energized, raising their prices by dozens of percent.</p><p></p><p>Sect disciples, those were the real fat sheep!</p><p></p><p>But that had nothing to do with Luo Chen.</p><p></p><p>Fasting Pills were just the most common goods on the road, every sect had them.</p><p></p><p>What's more, the ones he refined were the lowest grade Fasting Pills, they couldn't even be called pills, just Fasting Powder kneaded into pellet form.</p><p></p><p>No matter how well he refined this kind of stuff, it had no competitive advantage.</p><p></p><p>By noon, Luo Chen had sold most of his goods.</p><p></p><p>Just twenty bottles in total, not much at all. Luo Chen had only accumulated this amount over six or seven days.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that life was harsh for a low-level pill refiner!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If they were not supported by a sect or family, the life of a wandering low-level pill refining Taoist would be even more miserably inhumane!</p><p></p><p>Without needing to tidy up anything, Chen the old Taoist gave Luo Chen some beef jerky made from scraps, and Luo Chen was ready to leave. </p><p></p><p>Before leaving, while chewing on the beef jerky with plain water, Chen the old Taoist called out to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to refine a new pill recipe? It can't be that incomplete pill formula you stumbled upon last year, can it?"</p><p></p><p>"Kid, don't aim too high. I've seen too many wandering pill refiners research new pill formulas and end up penniless with nothing to show for it."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't easy for you to save up those spirit stones. You'd be better off going to the Spirit Medicine Hall to buy a couple bottles of qi-replenishing pills to raise your cultivation a bit."</p><p></p><p>This counted as rare sincere advice from this stingy old man who loved taking advantage of others.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen could sense the other's sincerity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the original host had paid an even greater price than what Chen described for that incomplete pill formula.</p><p></p><p>However, Luo Chen had other plans, so he naturally wouldn't do something as overambitious as that.</p><p></p><p>"You're getting on in years, be careful with those teeth. This beef jerky could make you lose your teeth."</p><p></p><p>Chen the old Taoist viciously bit into the beef jerky, with shreds getting stuck between his teeth quite uncomfortably, but he still forcibly swallowed it down.</p><p></p><p>He glared at Luo Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen snickered, then quickly squeezed into the crowd and disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>He was still in the southwestern wandering cultivator area, but he had arrived at the herb trading district.</p><p></p><p>Having frequented this area for a long time, he was quite familiar with the buying and selling of all kinds of goods here.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Wang, did your husband just come back from the mountains with this fresh batch? Feels like it hasn't even dried yet, I'm afraid discerning buyers won't want it."</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, let me do you a favor today and take ten pounds off your hands, albeit reluctantly!"</p><p></p><p>"This piece of Polyporusterrootstock, looks like it's not even ten years old! Discount it, and I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>"Diascorea opposita, yeah, I'll take fifty pounds. I used to procure twenty pounds for one spirit stone, but now the price has doubled. At least give me a bit of a deal!"</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, I won't bargain anymore. Just throw in a Taxus fruit, this big one will do."</p><p></p><p>Over the course of the afternoon, Luo Chen wandered around the herb district, making large-scale purchases of all the medicinal herbs he needed.</p><p></p><p>Since they were just wandering cultivators selling at stalls, the quality was judged by the eye, and the prices were negotiated.</p><p></p><p>After wearing his lips dry from all the bargaining, Luo Chen had finally procured this and that.</p><p></p><p>Next, he still had to make a trip to the city center.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Medicine Hall, one of the six top-tier shops in the Daxing Market District, stood in the most prominent location of the city center.</p><p></p><p>Five stories tall, with intricate carved beams and painted rafters, it cut a breathtakingly beautiful figure.</p><p></p><p>However, they only sold finished pill products, which was still out of Luo Chen's budget for now.</p><p></p><p>His destination was the Hundred Herb Hall next to the Spirit Medicine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that both the Spirit Medicine Hall and Hundred Herb Hall originated from the Pharmaceutical Sect, but no one knew why they had split into two separate establishments.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the grand Spirit Medicine Hall, the Hundred Herb Hall was much more ordinary.</p><p></p><p>A row of flat houses extended to the back, appearing plain and unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But as one approached, the rich aroma of medicinal herbs wafted over.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen's spirit trembled as he gently set down the large sack on his back at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The stout shopkeeper eyed that large sack, narrowing his eyes slightly and twitching his nose, before shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen wasn't bothered as he approached the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you have any Dioscorea persimilis or Cynanchum stauntonii in stock?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the names of these two medicinal ingredients, the stout shopkeeper gave Luo Chen an intrigued look.</p><p></p><p>A new book has been released. Fans can bookmark it. Thanks everyone!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

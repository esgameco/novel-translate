        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In front of the bluestone slabs, an old man held some spicy beef jerky, his eyes filled with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. </p><p></p><p>Before him stood a tall, handsome, and dashing young man, one hand behind his back and the other holding a long strip of beef jerky, speaking eloquently.</p><p></p><p>"Don't understand? Let me teach you!"</p><p></p><p>"So-called brand value refers to the additional value artificially added to a product beyond its inherent value."</p><p></p><p>"Still don't get it?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the old man's confused look, Luo Chen sighed and pointed his beef jerky at the scattered cultivators' market with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Just in this market, there are at least three stalls that sell low-grade talismans long-term!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Lu Heng, Mao Wuniao, and me - we're the long-term talisman sellers," the old Daoist Chen chimed in eagerly when he could get a word in.</p><p></p><p>"So how do you see them? And how do you see yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Old Daoist Chen scoffed disdainfully, "That little brat Lu Heng's skills are lacking - he even buys talisman papers from me. Not worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>"What about Master Mao?"</p><p></p><p>"A latecomer to the Dao. His skills are on par with mine, but he's ninety-three years old - just withered bones in a grave!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what about you, Daoist Chen?"</p><p></p><p>Chen stroked his graying beard confidently. "I joined the Talisman Pavilion as a laborer at twenty, learned talisman papermaking in five years, and began studying talismans fifteen years later. Ever since I hung up my shingle, I've been selling at this stall for twenty-five years. In my prime, my talisman skills are out of this world. Any cultivator coming to this market to buy talismans must come see me first!"</p><p></p><p>Clap clap clap!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen applauded, revealing a gratified smile.</p><p></p><p>"Well said, Daoist Chen. Your talismans have already acquired basic brand value derived from your experience as a laborer at the Talisman Pavilion, your twenty-five years of steadfast stall-keeping, and the consistent quality of your talismans."</p><p></p><p>Chen felt quite self-satisfied but then sensed something amiss after pondering.</p><p></p><p>"But over these decades, I still can't charge high prices for my talismans?"</p><p></p><p>"True, few high prices. But compared to others, aren't your prices generally a bit higher?"</p><p></p><p>"It does seem that way. But they still can't match the Talisman Pavilion's. Customers looking to buy talismans in bulk still prefer going to the Talisman Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen rolled his eyes. "The Talisman Pavilion has the backing of the Easternmost Six Domains' Talisman Sect, one of the six great sects. Its brand value comes from golden elders and immortal venerables. How can you compare?"</p><p></p><p>"You're right." Chen regained his self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>"So you see, no matter how far you take this stall's brand value, it won't amount to much. In this case, you need to find another way out!"</p><p></p><p>"Such as?"</p><p></p><p>"Bestow brand value onto your individual products."</p><p></p><p>"Elaborate!"</p><p></p><p>"Give them a whole story!"</p><p></p><p>Chen was dumbstruck. "You mean like the Wondrous Pellet? The Crane in the Clouds? The Harmonious Union Sect's Crane Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Even a child can be taught!"</p><p></p><p>It clicked!</p><p></p><p>It clicked!</p><p></p><p>His fist clenched again!</p><p></p><p>After it clicked, Old Daoist Chen entered an enlightened sage-like state.</p><p></p><p>"You mean I need to tell stories about my talismans like you did?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah."</p><p></p><p>"Just like that?"</p><p></p><p>"Just like that!"</p><p></p><p>"Then why all that rambling before?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I had to justify those fifty spirit stones you borrowed, didn't I?"</p><p></p><p>Whew! Inhale!</p><p></p><p>Chen took a deep breath and decided not to get angry - he was sixty-five and needed to watch his health.</p><p></p><p>"But how do I tell this story?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen glanced at Chen's stall, mentally cataloging the types of talismans he sold.</p><p></p><p>In total, six kinds: the lowest-grade cleaning and wind talismans; the mid-grade fireball and earth spike talismans; and the higher-grade earth wall and air-gathering talismans.</p><p></p><p>The fireball and earth spike talismans sold the most but at very low prices of just one and a half spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>The earth wall and air-gathering talismans fetched the highest prices.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The former cost two spirit stones each, while the latter started at three spirit stones. When the market was hot, they could sell for five or six spirit stones, or even higher. </p><p></p><p>Talisman symbols were quite popular among low-level cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Their power was slightly weaker than spells, but they were released faster and consumed very little spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Especially those related to defense and life-saving, they were extremely popular.</p><p></p><p>Pointing at that talisman for dispersing qi, Luo Chen had an idea after recalling the "Records of the Six Domains" he had read before, and came up with a story outline for it.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Laodao would have to fill in the specific details himself, as his experience was greater than Luo Chen's.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen also gave him a suggestion - to tell new stories to new customers, and old ones to old customers.</p><p></p><p>However, the talisman for dispersing qi also needed to be redecorated, it couldn't look so drab anymore. Without affecting its use, two golden borders could be added.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if no stories were told to the old customers, the price could still be raised a bit.</p><p></p><p>After giving his advice, Luo Chen could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>Like a gust of wind, carrying a huge sum of money, he rushed into the market for wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Purchase! Purchase! Frenzied purchasing!</p><p></p><p>The night had fallen deep, the moonlight shining brightly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A young man was walking quickly on the road, carrying two huge snakeskin bags on his back.</p><p></p><p>The bags were made of real snakeskin, tough and capable of holding a lot!</p><p></p><p>Today at the market, because he had to sell the Wondrous Pills and discuss things with Chen Laodao, he was delayed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his purchases in the evening, it was already this late.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the dried yellow dirt road, Luo Chen's breathing was a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although his steps were fast, his eyes kept scanning, paying special attention to the shadows between the wooden houses.</p><p></p><p>Fighting was strictly prohibited in the inner city of Dahe Town, but not in the outer city area where the wandering cultivators lived.</p><p></p><p>The spirit stones collected each month were only used by the big shots in the inner city to deal with rampaging beasts when they invaded.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the outer city area, powerful people often blocked the roads to rob and kill for treasures.</p><p></p><p>It was still alright during the day, but at night, such incidents happened frequently.</p><p></p><p>One could only say, this was the unique situation in Dahe Town.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen currently didn't have a single spirit stone on him, his entire fortune was in those two huge snakeskin bags on his back.</p><p></p><p>But in truth, it was only worth about a hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And they were scattered items, which would be very troublesome to resell.</p><p></p><p>But whether he thought it was a big deal or not, it remained to be seen if anyone would be tempted by the money.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, once I have spirit stones, I must move to the inner city area!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen cursed inwardly, walking apprehensively on the dirt road.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the moonlight was so bright tonight, or perhaps because he was dressed in tattered rags, even the two ugly snakeskin bags on his back looked so unsightly.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Luo Chen made it home safely.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, when a person was too lowly, even robbers wouldn't look at them.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chen didn't feel bitter, he just caught his breath and sorted out all the materials he had purchased, categorizing them on the shelves.</p><p></p><p>A hundred spirit stones - ninety-five were spent on purchasing materials for nineteen batches of Wondrous Pills.</p><p></p><p>With the remaining five spirit stones, three were used to buy materials for the Fasting Pills. Based on his success rate, he could at least refine thirty bottles of Fasting Pills. Selling at one bottle for half a spirit stone, he could earn six spirit stones, a net profit of about half, which was three spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two spirit stones, one was used to buy ten pounds of spirit rice, and the other was paid as rent to the lord's manor for two months.</p><p></p><p>His house in the outermost area only cost half a spirit stone per month in rent, so he paid for two months at a time.</p><p></p><p>After pouring the spirit rice into the rice barrel, Luo Chen collapsed onto the wooden bench in the living room, smelling the aroma of medicinal herbs filling the room, and grinned.</p><p></p><p>Although tired, his mood was great.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, he could start expanding production!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

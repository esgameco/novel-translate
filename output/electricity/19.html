        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The office fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao really wanted to refute, saying that even with high talent, a junior anomaly is still just a junior anomaly. Geniuses are still weak before they can realize their talents.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he could just wave his hand and kill Jing Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>But they were three levels apart. If they were both just junior anomalies, then Jing Xinghuо could just raise his hand and shoot an arrow to kill him.</p><p></p><p>But that was the rotating magnetic field! Mín Chóngwǔ the bald guy couldn't fuse with it, so he didn't care, but as an Anomaly Wind Client, the rotating magnetic field was extremely compatible with him, allowing him to advance to an even stronger professional template.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang turned off the surveillance video and then asked, "How's the information collection on Ji Zongbang going?"</p><p></p><p>"Sòng Fēi from the Public Security Bureau has already sent the information." Yan Xiao was well-prepared and replied, "Ji Zongbang should be an alias. His father is from the Fusang Autonomous Province, and his mother is a second-generation descendant of the Western Alliance. He entered the 'Obsidian Security Company' six years ago and has been stationed in Chang'an for four years. The procedures and formalities are all legal. If he hadn't been reported, it would be hard to discover his true identity."</p><p></p><p>"Have you found the source of the report?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Yan Xiao shook his head, "But judging from the content of the report, the informant should be quite familiar with Ji Zongbang, but was quickly discovered by Ji Zongbang, so he didn't have time to investigate thoroughly before being forced to flee."</p><p></p><p>"Is there any problem with this Obsidian Security Company?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably not."</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao answered smoothly, "Based on past experience, the upper echelons of the company are also in the dark, but I still sent people to investigate. They are screening the people who have had contact with Ji Zongbang."</p><p></p><p>Mín Chóngwǔ suddenly interjected, "Didn't the report say that Ji Zongbang was trained by the American Alliance and involved in a big conspiracy, with many big figures implicated?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't fully trust that." Yan Xiao snorted, "Use your brain a little."</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Yishang was very cautious. "This kind of infiltration method is indeed a common channel used by the American Federation. We can't take it lightly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Chief Zhou." Yan Xiao lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>He dared to mock Mín Chóngwǔ for having no brain, but in front of Zhou Yishang, he was very respectful.</p><p></p><p>Not only because Zhou Yishang was the deputy director of the Sword Blade Bureau, but also because the other party was a powerful legendary anomaly, who was a renowned powerhouse in the global intelligence community.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, he determined the direction, "For the Ji Zongbang case, we must dig deeper to find his superiors and subordinates, confirm his mission, and if possible, identify the informant. I have a feeling that this case is not simple, but for now, we should focus on covert investigation instead of making a big fuss, to avoid alerting the target."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he looked at Mín Chóngwǔ, then turned to Yan Xiao, "Yan Xiao, you are responsible for this case."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao was energized, stood up, and accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>Mín Chóngwǔ was dissatisfied in his heart, but since the deputy director had appointed someone, he could only obey.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yan Xiao asked again, "Chief Zhou, how should we deal with Jing Xinghuо?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang seemed to have already made arrangements, "That rotating magnetic field will be distributed according to the spoils of war principle. If you want it, go find Jing Xinghuо. If he is willing to sell it to you or trade, I won't interfere."</p><p></p><p>"But this person has problems..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao was still not convinced. The value of the rotating magnetic field was at least 50-60 million, and it could even reach 200-300 million at auction. Where would he get so much money? The only way was to seize it.</p><p></p><p>There were many doubts about Jing Xinghuо, and if he had some time to maneuver, he would definitely be able to find out, and then use it to coerce the other party to give up the right to distribute the spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>"I know what you're thinking."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang directly interrupted Yan Xiao's words, his expression suddenly becoming serious, and he sternly said, "The Sword Blade Bureau has given you law enforcement power, not for you to act willfully and pursue private interests! I warn you, if Jing Xinghuо dies by accident or something happens to him in the next ten years, you will be the prime suspect. I hope the day will never come when I personally send you to the prison ship bound for Mars."</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao was suddenly scolded from head to toe, his face pale, and he didn't dare to say a word.</p><p></p><p>"Chief Zhou is wise!" </p><p></p><p>Mín Chóngwǔ gave a thumbs up, but was glared at by Zhou Yishang.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, everyone sit down." Zhou Yishang eased the atmosphere a bit, "I'm planning to recruit Jing Xinghuо into the Sword Blade Bureau, of course, we'll do a few more background checks. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"I agree."</p><p></p><p>Mín Chóngwǔ was the first to express his approval. He was very optimistic about Jing Xinghuо's potential, and in the future, he would definitely be a sharp sword for the Sword Blade Bureau! Yan Xiao's expression was complex, but he could only nod, "I agree too."</p><p></p><p>In the interrogation room.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо was making a written statement. Two Sword Blade Bureau swordsmen were sitting across the table from him, first letting him recount the sequence of events, recording it, and then answering a few questions he raised.</p><p></p><p>He gave truthful answers to everything.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't mention the existence of the Myriad Phenomenon Star Eye, only saying that when he entered the main entrance of the building, he happened to notice someone hiding under the bridge of the superconducting highway, and that was the Class A wanted criminal, who wanted to kill him to eliminate the witness, so he had to take the initiative to attack.</p><p></p><p>The two swordsmen responsible for the written statement had seen the surveillance video and were shocked, but they were skeptical of Jing Xinghuо's account.</p><p></p><p>The biggest doubt was how Jing Xinghuо could see Ji Zongbang?</p><p></p><p>A super shadow blade, with level three shadow escape, even a "hawk-eyed" pursuer might not necessarily be able to detect him, but he was exposed in front of a junior ranger.</p><p></p><p>This question also troubled Jing Xinghuо himself.</p><p></p><p>If he had a choice, he certainly didn't want to provoke a Class A wanted criminal. With that ten million, he could cultivate peacefully and improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to be high-profile, and even less wanted to be exposed to the gaze of the authorities, especially an intelligence agency like the Sword Blade Bureau.</p><p></p><p>However, plans don't keep up with changes.</p><p></p><p>At the time, there was no choice but to act, or he would have died.</p><p></p><p>"Intuition."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's face was full of confidence, "I've had this intuition since I was little. When danger approaches, my heart will feel a sense of alert, and it's very accurate!"</p><p></p><p>He stubbornly insisted it was intuition, since it couldn't be tested anyway.</p><p></p><p>If this happened before the Star Gate opened...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this era, of course it is impossible to convince others, but now it is an age where extraordinary people and superpowers are everywhere, so having such a vague intuition is not strange.</p><p></p><p>The two swordsmen looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The door of the inquiry room was opened, and Zhou Yishang, Min Chongwu, and Yan Xiao walked in.</p><p></p><p>"You can leave now." Zhou Yishang told the swordsmen to leave, then he sat down opposite Jing Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu and Yan Xiao stood beside them, and even though there was another chair, they still chose to stand.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо noticed this and realized that the middle-aged man in front of him had a high status.</p><p></p><p>"I am the deputy director of the Sword Bureau, Zhou Yishang."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang introduced himself.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was very amiable, which actually made Jing Xinghuо feel wary in his heart. He outwardly showed tension and stood up, saying, "Greetings, Director Zhou."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous, please sit down." Zhou Yishang said straightforwardly: "The Sword Bureau has checked the surveillance footage at the scene and confirmed that Mr. Jing acted bravely and righteously, and not only does he not need to bear any legal responsibility, but there is also a reward."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо felt relieved, "That's great."</p><p></p><p>He did relax a bit.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Bureau must have seen some clues from the surveillance footage, but they didn't investigate further, and although he didn't know the reason, it was definitely good for him.</p><p></p><p>The system of the Asia-Pacific Community is not perfect, but civil rights are protected, and although it cannot be said to be absolutely fair, it is generally satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>This is also due to confidence in the leadership of the President.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо might doubt the government of the Asia-Pacific Community, but he would never doubt the President, and the Sword Bureau is a department directly under the President's jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Sword Bureau is an intelligence agency responsible for dirty work.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang intentionally left a cliffhanger.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо cooperated and immediately asked, "However what, Director Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang took out a crystal and placed it on the table. Jing Xinghuо's gaze changed, it was the "rotating magnetic field" mutant.</p><p></p><p>"With your eyesight, Mr. Jing, you should have noticed that Gi Zongbang was seriously injured when you shot him, right?" Zhou Yishang had a slightly mocking expression on his face when he said "eyesight".</p><p></p><p>Sure enough...</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо thought, the Sword Bureau had grasped the biggest doubt about him, why he saw Gi Zongbang in the middle of his stealth, which was the most unreasonable part.</p><p></p><p>He could only nod and admit, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang continued to ask, "That means you already knew about it before you shot Gi Zongbang, so can this still be considered a solo kill?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The principle of spoils regarding the judgment of solo kills has the prerequisite of not knowing. But this knowing and not knowing does not have a very clear standard - does it mean knowing that the target has already been attacked and injured, or knowing who the attacker is, or knowing that the other party is nearby? Even the law has loopholes and needs to be revised and supplemented with additional clauses many times.</p><p></p><p>But the "principle" does not have these things.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many times, especially in the Star Realm, the principle is difficult to fully implement, and in the end it comes down to using fists. Whoever is stronger has the right to distribute!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang glanced at Yan Xiao beside him. "Gi Zongbang was a spy of the American Federation, he was accidentally exposed while in hiding, and the Sword Bureau sent someone to capture him. Yan Xiao seriously injured him, not only making him infected with a nerve toxin, but also breaking his 'star gland'."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's face suddenly dawned with understanding.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Gi Zongbang's strength had dropped so much, it turned out his star gland had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "star gland" is an artificial organ or foreign object implanted in the body of an extraordinary person during the process of evolving from an advanced level to a super level.</p><p></p><p>The star gland can store, release, and condense star force, making the star force visible to the naked eye, and it also has the function of regulating the endocrine system and motor system of the body.</p><p></p><p>A super extraordinary person who has lost their star gland will not be much stronger than an advanced extraordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Xiao destroyed Gi Zongbang's star gland, so Mr. Jing was able to kill Gi Zongbang. Do you agree with this?" Zhou Yishang asked.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо looked directly into Zhou Yishang's eyes, without the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang remained calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's heart sank, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Yan Xiao. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, Yan Xiao should be the most likely person in the Sword Bureau to obtain the mutant, but he didn't seem happy at all when he heard the conversation between Jing Xinghuо and Zhou Yishang, as if it had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Zhou Yishang himself wants the rotating magnetic field?</p><p></p><p>No, that's not right.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, Zhou Yishang wouldn't have let Jing Xinghuо's "loophole" go, and he wouldn't even need to come in person. He could just let his subordinate swordsmen take advantage of the situation and use some tricks to legitimately snatch away the mutant.</p><p></p><p>The deputy director of the Sword Bureau is at least a legendary extraordinary person, with connections and power, this would be no problem for Zhou Yishang.</p><p></p><p>I understand now!</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuó suddenly showed a smile, "Regarding this point, I am not aware of it and do not agree."</p><p></p><p>"Then you and Yan Xiao may have to go to the arbitration tribunal." Zhou Yishang's tone carried a hint of coercion. The arbitration tribunal is one of the official institutions of the Asia-Pacific Community, responsible for arbitrating civil disputes. "The arbitration tribunal may not support you. Do you really want to lose this mutant?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuó was unmoved. "Then let's go to the arbitration tribunal, I will stick to my point of view."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang's expression faltered. Jing Xinghuó was so unyielding, precisely grasping the bottom line of the psychological game, leaving Zhou Yishang at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The two stared at each other for dozens of seconds in an awkward silence.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Jing Xinghuó who broke the silence, giving the other party a way out: "Director Zhou, if you have any advice, please feel free to say it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang gave Min Chongwu a look.</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu came over and placed a document on the table, unfolding it in front of Jing Xinghuó.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, sign this contract and the mutant will be returned to you." Zhou Yishang leaned back in his chair, wearing a benevolent smile, with an air of having the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

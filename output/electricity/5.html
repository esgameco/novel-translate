        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Jixinghuо could confirm the fusion success himself, seeing the words "Nascent Anomalous" on the interface still filled his heart with uncontrollable joy.</p><p></p><p>The 23rd century was the era of the Anomalous.</p><p></p><p>The chasm between ordinary people and the Anomalous was immense, and the disparity in individual power profoundly impacted human society in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>From culture, economy, and politics, to science, sports, and entertainment, the advantages of the Anomalous were ubiquitous, almost dominating all human activities.</p><p></p><p>Even if countries tried to downplay the differences between the Anomalous and ordinary people, emphasizing equality before the law, and even restricting the rights of the Anomalous in certain places to tilt towards ordinary people, in reality, ordinary people were always the underdogs.</p><p></p><p>The Anomalous not only possessed supernatural abilities, but were also more powerful, more intelligent, and even had longer lifespans. Ordinary people naturally lacked the confidence to face the Anomalous.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those Anomalous who had advanced far along the path of evolution were already a different species from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Just as the feudal era had the saying "All else is low, only scholarship is high," now it was "All else is low, only the Anomalous are high." While somewhat exaggerated, this statement was not far from the truth.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of which country they were citizens of, or what political system they lived under, the first life goal that all people set for themselves from a young age was to become an Anomalous! Jixinghuо was certainly no exception.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had finally achieved this, joining the ranks of the Anomalous!</p><p></p><p>"Doctor!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone in the observation room called out. A young man with a pale face shouted loudly, "My head hurts, what's going on?" Blood was flowing from his nostrils, and his expression was both agonized and panicked as he cried out, "Didn't my fusion fail?"</p><p></p><p>A doctor, accompanied by two nurses, immediately rushed over. After a brief examination, he shook his head, "Take him to the medical room immediately, his conflict is quite severe, and he may need emergency treatment."</p><p></p><p>"Did my fusion fail?" the young man heard the implication in the doctor's words.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the doctor comforted him. "There's no danger to your life, it will take at most a year to recover, and you can try fusing with another species next time."</p><p></p><p>The nurses helped the young man up, and he looked dejected and mournful as he said, "I fused with the 'Beast Whisperer,' and next time I'll have to buy the species myself, over 2 million Aeonian credits. How many years will it take me to save up that much money?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо and the remaining people in the observation room watched him being taken to the medical room, all with sympathetic expressions.</p><p></p><p>For citizens of the Asia-Pacific Community, everyone only had one free opportunity to obtain an Anomalous species.</p><p></p><p>If the fusion failed, they would have to pay for the species themselves the next time they wanted to try.</p><p></p><p>And almost all the core abilities of professional templates were at least Exceptional Abilities, worth no less than 1 million Aeonian credits. Without family support, young people simply couldn't afford it, even with low-interest government loans, it was still a heavy burden.</p><p></p><p>A single fusion failure was a huge blow for the vast majority of ordinary people, a double loss of both money and time, causing many to give up on becoming Anomalous.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>He continued to look at his interface, and in addition to his [Rank] changing to Nascent Anomalous, his [Ability] was no longer "None," but displayed "Thousand Nimble Hands," with the additional information: Level 1/47.</p><p></p><p>"Level 1."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо stroked his chin, this was easy to understand - Anomalous Abilities could be upgraded through cultivation, and his just-fused Thousand Nimble Hands was at Level 1.</p><p></p><p>But what did the "1/47" mean? "Ability upgrade progress?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо couldn't help but speculate. Was it like in virtual games, where as proficiency increased, reaching 47/47 would allow Thousand Nimble Hands to advance to Level 2? But in games, there were skill points used for upgrading, so what would he use here?</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on [Spiritual Source Energy], which was still just a duck egg, unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He had been pondering this term "Spiritual Source Energy" for a long time last night. Jixinghuо had never heard of it before, and searches online didn't yield any relevant answers. The results related to the Anomalous were either about spiritual powers, mental powers, or something similar, but nothing called Spiritual Source Energy.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuо didn't dwell on it for too long.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't directly increase the level, just having a progress display was already extremely helpful.</p><p></p><p>There were corresponding methods for Ability upgrades, with various countries having conducted extensive research on different Abilities, and there were dozens of cultivation methods for Thousand Nimble Hands that could be downloaded from the Stellar Bureau's official website.</p><p></p><p>But Ability cultivation was long, tedious, and difficult, often taking years of practice without any level-up, truly a painful process.</p><p></p><p>So many Anomalous couldn't persist, and their Abilities remained at very low levels, unable to fully unleash their potential and power.</p><p></p><p>But now that he knew the upgrade progress, he had a clear goal.</p><p></p><p>Each Ability cultivation would provide positive feedback, and he could quickly correct any ineffective or incorrect methods, knowing that he would definitely level up. He could even calculate the exact date of the upgrade and make a cultivation plan - his Ability would definitely level up much faster than other Anomalous! Jixinghuо was full of confidence about this.</p><p></p><p>Next to the information on the interface, his virtual body avatar had also changed.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious was a network of fine lines appearing within his arms, running from his neck, along the shoulders and arms, all the way to the palms and fingertips, like a dense neural network.</p><p></p><p>When he focused on the virtual arms, the neural network would light up, becoming very prominent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it was labeled: Thousand Nimble Hands, Level 1.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was a bit puzzled, as the Ability information was already displayed next to it, so why was it repeated on the virtual body? Was there another purpose?</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing for a moment, he soon made a discovery.</p><p></p><p>The lines where Thousand Nimble Hands was located were emitting faint points of light, like wandering energy, gradually spreading throughout the entire virtual body. Over time, the points of light covered every corner of the body, although still very weak, they could no longer be ignored.</p><p></p><p>"Stellar Force!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо suddenly realized, these points of light represented Stellar Force.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a new line of text had appeared on the left side of the interface, below [Rank].</p><p></p><p>[Stellar Force: 1]</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed Stellar Force!" Jixinghuо was very happy that he had guessed correctly.</p><p></p><p>All Anomalous had to cultivate Stellar Force, its importance and priority were even higher than Abilities, because Stellar Force was the primal driving force of life evolution!</p><p></p><p>Stellar Force was derived from ether energy, with the human body absorbing ether and converting it into Stellar Force, strengthening the body's strength, speed, and endurance, and promoting life evolution, extending lifespan.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Stellar Force opened the door to cultivation, and only by possessing Stellar Force could one truly be on the path of evolution!</p><p></p><p>An Anomalous's Ability could be mediocre or even useless, but their Stellar Force could never be weak, because Stellar Force was the source of an Anomalous's power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the use of Abilities also consumed Stellar Force.</p><p></p><p>Using a virtual game analogy, Abilities were the skills, while Stellar Force was the character attributes, serving as both life force and mana.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining Stellar Force was not difficult, at least for Anomalous it was very simple.</p><p></p><p>As long as one successfully fused with any Anomalous species, they would gain Stellar Force, as Anomalous species were born from the Stellar Realm, and must contain ether energy, which would be converted into Stellar Force upon successful fusion.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating Stellar Force was a mandatory course for Anomalous.</p><p></p><p>There was no special technique or shortcut, the only way was to constantly exercise the body, consuming the Stellar Force within, and then waiting for it to recover.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated consumption and recovery, the Stellar Force would slowly increase.</p><p></p><p>From the Nascent Anomalous stage to the Advanced Anomalous stage, Stellar Force existed in the body in an undetectable energy form, relatively weak.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, Stellar Force could not be seen, only the Anomalous themselves could sense it.</p><p></p><p>Yet Stellar Force was a real existence, and when it accumulated to a certain degree, it would allow the Anomalous to evolve and advance, enabling them to fuse with another Ability.</p><p></p><p>With Earth's current technology, it was impossible to detect the existence of Stellar Force, let alone measure its precise values.</p><p></p><p>But the Myriad Phenomena Astral Eyes could display it directly.</p><p></p><p>However, the [Stellar Force] on the interface was just a numerical value, without any unit, so Jixinghuо could not compare it to other Anomalous' Stellar Force, he could only treat it as a reference for now.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, the Stellar Force value changed to 2.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо also quickly felt the effects of the Stellar Force.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His body seemed to be infused with an invisible energy that made his limbs stronger and stronger. His internal organs were being strengthened from the inside out, and his senses of hearing, touch, and smell were all slightly enhanced to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Each breath became longer, and each heartbeat became more powerful.</p><p></p><p>His whole body seemed to have endless strength, and his spirit was a hundredfold! "This is the power of an Extraordinary Person!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо was still experiencing his own enhancement when a staff member came over and asked, "Mr. Qi, have you successfully fused?"  He had been in the observation room for over half an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Xinghuо stood up and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>The staff member gave a formulaic congratulation and reminded, "Mr. Qi, you can go home now. Over the next few days, your body will be in its initial evolution period, with significant changes. During this time, do not engage in too strenuous exercise to avoid excessive fatigue. You need to adapt to the power of an Extraordinary Person as soon as possible to avoid harming others."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо nodded, as these were common knowledge.</p><p></p><p>The degree of the first life evolution from an ordinary person to an Extraordinary Person is the greatest and lasts the longest, and it varies from person to person.</p><p></p><p>Some people take a week or even half a month to complete the evolution, while others only need a few hours.</p><p></p><p>The speed of evolution does not affect the degree of enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо glanced at the interface of the Wanxiang Star Pupils, and the light spots in the human body virtual image were still increasing. The [Star Force] value had already grown to 3, and he estimated that his initial evolution would last more than a day.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Extraordinary Person Service Center, Qi Xinghuо received a notification from the Interstellar Department that he had officially become a registered Extraordinary Person of the Asia-Pacific Community.</p><p></p><p>Because he had used a free alien species and enjoyed the benefits of a citizen, he must unconditionally obey the summons of the state in the future and fulfill his civic duties.</p><p></p><p>"I hope they don't summon me when I'm still too weak."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He did not resist the summons, as it was his obligation, which was only natural.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of Extraordinary Persons in the Asia-Pacific Community would never receive a state summons their entire lives, as over 90% of Extraordinary Persons are only at the initial level, with insufficient strength to be called to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Only when even the initial Extraordinary Persons need to be summoned would it mean that the Asia-Pacific Community or even the entire Earth is in a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>That would certainly not be good news.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо was not afraid to dedicate himself to the country, but he feared that his strength would not be enough, and he would end up sacrificing his life in vain.</p><p></p><p>As he walked out of the Tianqin Sports Stadium, he heard a noisy and enthusiastic chanting from a distance: "Sword Immortal! Sword Immortal! The Sword Immortal from Guanghan is unbeatable in the world!"</p><p></p><p>The shouts came in waves, getting louder and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо turned his head and found that on the other side of the Tianqin Sports Stadium, in the square outside the main gate, hundreds of people had gathered, mostly young people. They were wearing shirts with a golden five-pointed star and holding shiny signs, chanting slogans in unison, led by someone, their faces filled with excitement and fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>They were looking up at the giant screen on the outer wall of the stadium, which displayed a stunningly beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>She wore a tight-fitting combat uniform, holding a long sword behind her back with a solemn expression, her beautiful eyes gazing straight ahead as if locking onto a battle opponent. Several other Extraordinary Persons in combat uniforms surrounded her, like stars around the moon, the focus of all eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's her."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The person on the screen was Zhao Manying, the globally renowned genius Extraordinary Person. The people gathered outside the stadium were her fans.</p><p></p><p>However, it was a bit strange that so many people had suddenly come. Qi Xinghuо opened his phone and checked the news, and his expression changed: "Zhao Manying has advanced to a Super Extraordinary Person, no wonder..."</p><p></p><p>What had happened just half an hour ago had already topped the national hot search list.</p><p></p><p>It was also a sensational news globally.</p><p></p><p>"Advancing to a Super Extraordinary Person at 22 years old, that's ridiculous!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо couldn't help but sigh, feeling a mix of admiration and a slight bitterness. He was also 22 years old, just a few months older, and had just been proud of becoming an initial Extraordinary Person, but someone else had already become a Super Extraordinary Person, breaking multiple records.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder she's called the Sword Immortal," Qi Xinghuо silently praised, "I can't help but admire her."</p><p></p><p>He had also followed Zhao Manying's social media accounts and would watch her matches whenever he had the chance. He knew a lot about her.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Manying had fused with an alien species and become an Extraordinary Person at the age of 16, evolved to an intermediate Extraordinary Person at 17, and was evaluated by the Martial Arts Association as the "Sword Technique Master" at the youngest age in history.</p><p></p><p>After advancing to a high-level Extraordinary Person at the age of 20, Zhao Manying signed a sky-high contract with the "Imperial Star" club, entered the Super League, and became a professional Extraordinary Person, being cultivated as the core of the team.</p><p></p><p>Most of the members of the Super League teams are Super Extraordinary Persons, a level higher than Zhao Manying. </p><p></p><p>Even so, Zhao Manying was still unmatched on the battlefield. Her professional model is a "Sword Cultivator," and with her unparalleled sword skills in the world, she rarely meets an opponent who can withstand her in one-on-one confrontations.</p><p></p><p>However, the battles in the professional league are more inclined towards team cooperation, and the other members of the Imperial Star team are not particularly outstanding, unable to provide enough support. So in the two years since Zhao Manying joined the club, her team has not achieved outstanding results and has been in the middle to upper ranks.</p><p></p><p>But this in no way affects Zhao Manying's popularity.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple - in addition to her unparalleled sword talent, Zhao Manying also possesses a breathtakingly beautiful appearance! In this era, there are many beautiful women, but the level of appearance, figure, and temperament that Zhao Manying has reached is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In this era, there are many geniuses, but the level of star force, extraordinary abilities, and martial arts that Zhao Manying has reached is also very few.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful women are always a scarce resource, and talent is even more so. </p><p></p><p>When the two are concentrated in one person, the explosive effect is unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Manying's popularity is so high that it is beyond imagination, surpassing all cultural and entertainment stars. Even though she is only a high-level Extraordinary Person, her fame is comparable to a "superstar," if not exceeding it.</p><p></p><p>She has tens of billions of fans around the world, from the Asia-Pacific Community to the New Roman Empire, from the Southern Kingdom to the Latin Revolutionary Army, almost no one does not know her. Her every match is a focus battle, with at least a billion people watching, and the heat makes other teams pale in comparison. The Imperial Star club has been making a fortune in recent years.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Manying is a true global idol! She has many nicknames, the most famous of which is "Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>There are also "Century Prodigy," "The Number One Genius of the Era," "The Second Global Goddess," "Guanghan Sword Immortal," and so on, some of which are well-deserved, and some are too exaggerated, but they are all words of praise.</p><p></p><p>Now, Zhao Manying has advanced to a Super Extraordinary Person in less than two years, and her strength will surely soar. </p><p></p><p>Even though the Super League is more focused on team battles, the overall strength of the Imperial Star club will also rise with the tide.</p><p></p><p>In the next few years, the Imperial Star club will undoubtedly be a hot favorite to win the championship.</p><p></p><p>So these fans and team loyalists are so excited. As soon as the news came out, they gathered at the home stadium of the Imperial Star team to cheer them on, chatting enthusiastically about the team's bright future.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо went to observe for a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>The square outside the Tianqin Sports Stadium was crowded with people, and the security guards had to come out to maintain order, but more and more fans kept coming, and the scene was somewhat chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо quickly got in his car and left.</p><p></p><p>In the car, he turned on the built-in projection screen, and almost every platform, live broadcast channel, and social media were discussing Zhao Manying's advancement to a Super Extraordinary Person.</p><p></p><p>Hosts and commentators were eloquent in front of the cameras.</p><p></p><p>Sports programs were analyzing data and predicting the performance of the Imperial Star team; Extraordinary Person bloggers were guessing how many ranks Zhao Manying could climb on the "Global Ladder"; entertainment channels were gossiping about Zhao Manying's private life;</p><p></p><p>Economic news was focused on the stock price of the Imperial Star club;</p><p></p><p>And the fans were either praising Zhao Manying's talent or simply lusting after her appearance, venting their emotions on the internet.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the focus of the whole world was on Zhao Manying.</p><p></p><p>No one cared that a 22-year-old named Qi Xinghuо in Chang'an had also become an Extraordinary Person.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Xinghuо himself was not particularly excited, because he knew he would eventually become an Extraordinary Person, and he did not expect this event to have any impact.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

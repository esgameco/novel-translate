        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò was assigned to the third group in the draw.</p><p></p><p>Lǔ Yúnhǎi happened to be the referee in this group, and as he passed by, he greeted Jixinghuò with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Coach Lǔ, do you know him?" </p><p></p><p>Fāng Yínpíng was also assigned to this group, and seeing the two of them talking, she curiously asked a question.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Fāng, we were university classmates." Lǔ Yúnhǎi immediately responded, and he spoke respectfully towards Fāng Yínpíng, explaining, "Xīnghuǒ just started learning archery three weeks ago, and it was me who signed him up for the course."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Fāng Yínpíng was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but take another look at Jixinghuò.</p><p></p><p>For a beginner to have reached such an archery level, it was clear that he had exceptional archery talent, far surpassing most archers. If she hadn't fused the Thousand Nimble Hands and Precision, and practiced archery for many years, she wouldn't dare say she could easily defeat Jixinghuò.</p><p></p><p>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Jī." Fāng Yínpíng smiled, "About the small misunderstanding this morning, I hope Mr. Jī won't take it to heart."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò hadn't really thought much of it. "Sister Fāng is overthinking, it's just a trivial matter."</p><p></p><p>Fāng Yínpíng nodded and went back to prepare for the competition.</p><p></p><p>After she left, Jixinghuò asked, "Who is this Sister Fāng? She seems quite famous."</p><p></p><p>"She is the daughter of one of the shareholders in our archery club," Lǔ Yúnhǎi replied in a low voice. "Sister Fāng used to come to the archery club to practice frequently, but she has been competing in tournaments outside lately, so you haven't seen her. Her archery level is very high, the club director has given her pointers many times, and she has won the Archery Cup championship twice in the past five competitions."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder." Jixinghuò suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Fāng is an open and friendly person, and she's easy to get along with," Lǔ Yúnhǎi said with a smile. "Many people in the archery circle in Changan like her."</p><p></p><p>"What does that have to do with me?" Jixinghuò felt a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I was just making a casual remark."</p><p></p><p>As they were talking, they had arrived at the venue for the fourth round of competition, and Lǔ Yúnhǎi returned to the referee team to preside over the competition.</p><p></p><p>This round required shooting at a 50-meter moving target, with only one person on the field at a time.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò looked around.</p><p></p><p>The field was very open, and the weather was good today. Although it was the scorching summer, it wasn't as hot up in Mount Qinling as in the city, and the competitors were all hiding in the shade of the trees, watching as the first contestant was called to the field.</p><p></p><p>They also had one minute of preparation time.</p><p></p><p>Beep!</p><p></p><p>The buzzer sounded, and a drone took off 50 meters away, flying at a speed not much faster than a person's running pace, with an 80-centimeter archery target suspended below it, following a fixed trajectory.</p><p></p><p>This was the moving target, and the shooting window was only two seconds long, with any shots after that time invalid.</p><p></p><p>Bang! An arrow hit the target, but not the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>The contestant on the field shot the first arrow, not stopping, and quickly nocked the second arrow. Five seconds later, the second drone target flew by, and he quickly aimed and shot.</p><p></p><p>Five drone targets flew by in succession, five seconds apart, and the speed kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>All five arrows were shot in less than half a minute.</p><p></p><p>"39 points!"</p><p></p><p>The score immediately displayed on the screen at the far end of the field, not a very high score. The contestant shook his head and stepped down.</p><p></p><p>The second contestant quickly took the field, and each person's time was very short.</p><p></p><p>Consecutive five-arrow shots, each one more difficult than the last, with the scores naturally decreasing, averaging between 35 and 40 points.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was Jixinghuò's turn.</p><p></p><p>Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! Five crisp, decisive shots, all hitting the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>"50 points!"</p><p></p><p>The spectators watching from under the trees exclaimed in surprise - this was the first perfect 50-point score in the fourth round. Many people inquired about Jixinghuò's background, but no one recognized him.</p><p></p><p>However, no one was particularly concerned, because Fāng Yínpíng took the field and also shot a perfect 50.</p><p></p><p>The fourth round ended.</p><p></p><p>In Jixinghuò's group, four people had achieved perfect scores.</p><p></p><p>Due to the tight schedule, the referees immediately led this group of contestants to the next field for the fifth round. The fifth round was also shooting at a moving target, but the distance had increased to 70 meters, and it was a downward angle shot from a higher position.</p><p></p><p>The field was located on a hillside, with the contestants gathered at the top of the slope and the targets halfway down the hill, occasionally with a light breeze blowing.</p><p></p><p>The shooting difficulty had increased again.</p><p></p><p>The contestants who went before had scores that just kept getting worse, with half of them scoring below 30 points after the five shots.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò's luck wasn't great.</p><p></p><p>When he took the field, there happened to be a strong gust of wind blowing across the slope, causing two of his arrows to hit the 9-ring, and he ended up with a score of 48 points.</p><p></p><p>In the sixth round, the target distance was increased to 100 meters, and it was an upward angle shot, with the field moved to the bottom of the slope and the targets on the hill above.</p><p></p><p>The contestants were mostly defeated, and those who managed to score above 30 points were few.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò's performance was also not ideal.</p><p></p><p>He shot five arrows, with only one hitting the 10-ring, giving him a score of 41 points. However, this score was still among the top, as the others had even lower scores.</p><p></p><p>After three rounds of competition, the contestants waited for the results to see who would advance.</p><p></p><p>The total scores from these three rounds would be calculated, and the top 32 would advance to the seventh round.</p><p></p><p>The results came out quickly.</p><p></p><p>The screens set up around the field displayed the rankings, and Jixinghuò easily found his name, in third place with a total score of 139 points.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually only in third place?" Jixinghuò was a bit surprised. The shooting difficulty in these three rounds had already been very high, and yet there were still people who had scored 143 points, ranking first.</p><p></p><p>The second-place score was also 2 points higher than his.</p><p></p><p>That Fāng Yínpíng had also advanced, with a score of 138 points, tied for fifth place.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò looked up at the weather, knowing that outdoor shooting was easily affected by climate, especially wind, and even a slight mistake could cause a miss.</p><p></p><p>With these uncertain factors, no one could say they would definitely win the championship, it would all come down to the performance on the day.</p><p></p><p>The top 10 all had a chance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a broadcast echoed through the valley: "Will the 32 advancing contestants please gather at Target Field 9, the seventh round will begin in 15 minutes."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò hurried over.</p><p></p><p>Not only the advancing contestants, but even those who had been eliminated had not left, becoming spectators wanting to see the final results.</p><p></p><p>Target Field 9 was set up on a 100-meter-high cliff, but the slope was gentle, and safety railings had been installed, so there was no real danger.</p><p></p><p>A flat area and spectator stands had been built along the cliff edge, enough to accommodate over a thousand people.</p><p></p><p>The remaining four rounds would all take place here.</p><p></p><p>When Jixinghuò arrived, most of the spectator stands were already filled, and Yangtianqing and a few other club directors were sitting and chatting.</p><p></p><p>"Please come up, everyone," the chief referee stood on a platform jutting out from the cliff, with shooting position lines drawn on the ground, and the 32 contestants stood a few meters back.</p><p></p><p>The referee quickly explained the rules.</p><p></p><p>In the open space in front of the cliff, numerous drones with archery targets were flying at different speeds and trajectories. When the contestants were in position, one of the drones would light up with a prominent red light for one second, and the contestant had to complete the shot within that one second.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò had seen the videos beforehand, but the actual experience was quite different from the videos.</p><p></p><p>With so many spectators, it was inevitable to feel some nervousness.</p><p></p><p>"Contestant 76, Jī Xīnghuò!"</p><p></p><p>In this round, the order of appearance was determined by the registration numbers, and Jixinghuò's number was 76.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among the top 32, he was the youngest, so he was the first to take the stage.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо walked a few meters forward and stepped into the shooting area. All eyes were focused on him.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо gripped the compound bow with his left hand, took an arrow with his right hand and nocked it on the bow, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the slight nervousness in his heart subsided, his mind became calm and focused, and his eyes looked towards the area 50 to 70 meters outside the cliff. In the depths of his right pupil, there was a faint flicker, and the Wanxiang Star Pupil vividly mapped the movements in this area in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The flow of the wind, the scorching sun, and the constantly flying drones were like a painting in Jixinghuо's mind, with every detail visible.</p><p></p><p>"Please get ready," the chief referee shouted.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо glanced at the 10-second countdown with the corner of his eye, and as soon as the time was up, the buzzer sounded.</p><p></p><p>Beep!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо pulled the bowstring with force, maintaining the open bow posture, his gaze sweeping back and forth among the dozens of drones that were quickly moving like a school of fish.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the drones lit up.</p><p></p><p>An arrow shot out almost simultaneously, turning into a black line and hitting the target.</p><p></p><p>Ten points!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо did not look at the result of this shot, his right palm gripping four more arrows, his nimble fingers moving like a fluttering butterfly, quickly nocking another arrow on the bow, hooking the thumb on the string, ready for the next shot.</p><p></p><p>Another drone lit up, about 70 meters away, but lower than the platform of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо instantly adjusted the angle and shot downwards.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Ten points!</p><p></p><p>He immediately nocked the third arrow, maintaining the rhythm, and shot as soon as the third drone lit up, followed by the fourth and fifth arrows, completing this round of shooting.</p><p></p><p>All five arrows were ten points! The hundreds of spectators in the stands were stunned, and it took them a few seconds before they burst into exclamations.</p><p></p><p>The faces of several directors showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing noticed the logo of his archery club on Jixinghuо's clothes, and couldn't help but look at him a few more times, puzzled, wondering when his archery club had such a powerful archer.</p><p></p><p>Hitting five consecutive ten-point targets at a random distance of 50 to 70 meters was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>The players who came after Jixinghuо all had varying degrees of mistakes. It wasn't until Fang Yinping took the stage that another 50-point score appeared.</p><p></p><p>When all 32 players had finished, a total of five had achieved perfect scores.</p><p></p><p>This round eliminated the players with the lower scores, and the top 16 players advanced to the eighth round, shooting at random targets at a distance of 70 to 100 meters.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was the first to take the stage again.</p><p></p><p>Five arrows shot.</p><p></p><p>He once again got a perfect score of five ten-point shots! Now everyone knew that this unknown archer was definitely the top seed to win today, and the other few well-known players were not doing as well as him, and their performance was terrifyingly stable.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо instantly became the focus of the entire venue.</p><p></p><p>He noticed that Yang Tianqing called over a coach from his own archery club and asked him a few questions in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>In the ninth round, there were only eight players left. By this round, each of the top eight players would receive a cash prize, so they were all very happy.</p><p></p><p>The shooting distance for the ninth round was changed to 100 to 120 meters.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, for archers below the super-human level, the hit rate would drop significantly when the target distance exceeded 100 meters.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Even with the assistance of the Wanxiang Star Pupil, limited by the performance of the "Yefeng" and his own ability level, he had not trained at such a long distance before, and in the end, he was unable to maintain a perfect ten-point score, quickly shooting five arrows and only getting a score of 42 points.</p><p></p><p>But this was already enough to advance to the semifinals, and he was in first place.</p><p></p><p>The tenth round.</p><p></p><p>The distribution area of the random targets expanded several times, from 50 to 150 meters, and there were more than 200 drones densely packed in the air outside the cliff, looking magnificent.</p><p></p><p>The shooting window was also halved, to only half a second.</p><p></p><p>A total of 10 arrows were to be shot.</p><p></p><p>This tested the shooter's reaction, skill, bow range, and sustained focus at the same time. For ordinary people, they wouldn't even get a single point. Even for superhumans, if they had not been trained, their scores would be hard to exceed 10 points, and most of the archers on the scene were like this.</p><p></p><p>The order of the last round was determined by the scores of the ninth round, with the lowest scores going first.</p><p></p><p>"Bai Li."</p><p></p><p>The first to take the stage was the well-known archer in the Changan archery circle.</p><p></p><p>He had scored 143 points in the elimination round.</p><p></p><p>Bai Li was an intermediate ranger, using a traditional bow, sticking nine arrows in a row at his feet, taking a deep breath at the shooting position, then raising the bow and nocking an arrow, his gaze focused on the area outside the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Beep!</p><p></p><p>A light sound, and Bai Li began to shoot quickly, one arrow after another rising from the ground and shooting towards the drones in the air.</p><p></p><p>After shooting ten arrows, Bai Li seemed to have been drained of strength, his whole body sagging.</p><p></p><p>"55 points!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Li shook his head, very dissatisfied with his score.</p><p></p><p>The next four semifinalists performed even worse, with three arrows missing the target or exceeding the time limit, only getting a score of 25 points, almost throwing down their bows in anger.</p><p></p><p>Then it was Fang Yinping's turn.</p><p></p><p>She had also advanced to the semifinals, performing excellently in the ninth round, second only to Jixinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо watched as she shot arrow after arrow, all hitting the targets, and the scores were not low. In the end, her score was 61 points, temporarily in first place.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yinping was very satisfied, waving to the cheering audience.</p><p></p><p>As she passed by the stage where Jixinghuо was standing, she said in a low voice, "Good luck!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He stood at the shooting position, his heart completely calm, because he knew he had won the championship, and what he had to do next was just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>But the audience didn't know that, and instead became nervous for Jixinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Beep!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the buzzer sounded, Jixinghuо shot the first arrow. Many spectators hadn't even seen the result when his second arrow was already shot.</p><p></p><p>Although the flight speed of the drones was faster than the previous three rounds, their trajectories were more complex and the range was larger.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of the Wanxiang Star Pupil, there was not much difference.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо shot the ten arrows with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Each arrow hit the lit-up drone target, but due to his own strength and control, he could not hit the bullseye every time. In the eyes of the audience, his movements were pleasing to the eye, standard and smooth, like a soulless archery machine.</p><p></p><p>"72 points!"</p><p></p><p>The chief referee shouted loudly, and the scoreboard also displayed the score.</p><p></p><p>The champion was born! "Wow..."</p><p></p><p>The audience all stood up and applauded enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yinping also had to sigh in admiration, because this was the best tenth round score in the history of the "SheyeCup".</p><p></p><p>The award ceremony began quickly, with Bai Li winning the bronze medal, Fang Yinping the silver, and the directors of their respective archery clubs presenting the awards.</p><p></p><p>The champion's award was presented by Yang Tianqing.</p><p></p><p>This super-human smiled broadly, holding a golden trophy in the shape of an archer, and went on stage to announce to the crowd, "I now declare that Jixinghuо has won the 15th 'SheyeCup' championship!" He handed the trophy to Jixinghuо and said with a smile, "Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Director." </p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо raised the trophy with one hand to show the audience, prompting another round of applause, and some people took photos. Then the competition ended.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

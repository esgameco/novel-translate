        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the capital of the Asia-Pacific Community, Chang'an is one of the largest super-cities on Earth, with the entire 40,000-square-kilometer Guanzhong Plain incorporated into the capital region. It has a permanent population of over 300 million, with a population density that ranks among the top five globally.</p><p></p><p>Although the government has introduced various policies over the years to discourage people from flocking to the capital, the efforts have had little effect. This is due to a combination of human nature and historical factors, making the situation quite complex.</p><p></p><p>Managing such a massive city is no easy task. Chang'an is divided into 36 administrative districts, and the "Qishan District" where Qi Xinghuо lives is located in the west, more than 100 kilometers from the city center.</p><p></p><p>After a 20-minute high-speed drive, the car exits the superconducting highway and reaches the destination.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо gets out of the car and looks up at the building in front of him. It is a sports stadium.</p><p></p><p>The sports stadium on the north bank of the Wei River has a very unique architectural design. The main building resembles a high-speed, diamond-shaped spacecraft, with sharp edges and a silver-gray glass facade that shines brightly in the sunlight, making it one of the landmark buildings in the capital.</p><p></p><p>The "Tianqin National Sports Stadium" covers an area of over 150,000 square meters, yet it is only 20 stories high, which is considered a luxury in the densely populated Chang'an city center.</p><p></p><p>This sports stadium is a sacred place in the hearts of countless people across the country and even the world, as it is the home stadium for multiple teams in the Asia-Pacific "Super League" and "Premier League."</p><p></p><p>Every week, multiple sports and cultural performances are held here. It has hosted numerous "International Invitation Tournaments" and two "Super World Cups," showcasing many thrilling battles that have become legendary, and producing numerous world champions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо has attended matches here before. However, today he is here to undergo a physical fitness test, as the Tianqin Sports Stadium houses a "Metahuman Service Center" operated by the Starry Realm Department.</p><p></p><p>After entering the stadium, Qi Xinghuо follows the signs to the Metahuman Service Center on the first to fifth floors, where there is a bustling crowd, mostly young people like himself, who have come to take the fitness test. Some are nervous, some are calm, but all have an air of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо had made an appointment for the service the previous night and is directed to the second floor.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he approaches a counter.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Xinghuо," the female staff member in a white uniform calls out his name. When she sees his photo on the screen, she discreetly glances up at him and greets him with a smile, asking, "Mr. Qi, are you here for the physical fitness test?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Xinghuо nods.</p><p></p><p>"Please verify your identity." The staff member shows unusual enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Following her instructions, Qi Xinghuо steps into the designated area, where a circular device scans him from head to toe and collects a few milliliters of his blood for anti-doping and genetic testing.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, please rest in the waiting area. The results will be available soon."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо sits down in the waiting area, appearing calm and composed, but inwardly a bit unsettled.</p><p></p><p>The scanning process is a crucial step to verify the applicant's information and prevent the impersonation of citizens to claim metahuman status. With the advancement of biotechnology, it is almost possible to impersonate someone convincingly, from physical appearance and build to facial features, fingerprints, voice, and even iris patterns. There have been cases in the past where a syndicate used genetic technology to deceive the Metahuman Service Center and claim high-quality metahumans.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Qi Xinghuо's identity is not in question, but he is concerned about the impact of his Myriad Astral Eyes, especially the light ring around his right iris, which may not match the records.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, a few minutes later, he receives the notification that the verification has passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо breathes a sigh of relief and heads to the testing area.</p><p></p><p>The Starry Realm Department's test consists of four categories: strength, speed, endurance, and willpower. Only the first three are directly related to physical fitness, while willpower, though often associated with a strong physique, can have exceptions.</p><p></p><p>The passing standards for each test are different. Passing just one test is enough to qualify for metahuman application, but the higher the scores and the more tests passed, the higher the overall evaluation and the opportunity to apply for higher-grade metahumans.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuō chooses to take the strength and speed tests.</p><p></p><p>He first enters the strength testing hall, which is like a massive gym with rows of barbells and racks. Several people are already being tested under the supervision of the examiners, while others are observing or warming up. The people around him, both men and women, have clearly muscular builds from regular exercise.</p><p></p><p>The strength test consists of three simple exercises: unequipped bench press, squat, and deadlift, with ten repetitions for each. The total weight of the three exercises must reach 500 kg for men or 350 kg for women to pass the strength test.</p><p></p><p>The standard may sound simple, but it is actually quite challenging. This threshold is just on the border between having talent and not having talent. With a few years of proper training and arduous effort, along with modern fitness technology, it is possible for those with some talent to reach the 500 kg target. However, the majority of people lack the perseverance to train to that level.</p><p></p><p>Those who dare to take the test are usually confident in passing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuō does not observe the others but chooses a corner to quietly warm up. He starts with a set of stretching exercises to get his blood flowing, then moves on to some dumbbell exercises, gradually increasing the weight before finally picking up the barbell.</p><p></p><p>After about 15 minutes, Qi Xinghuō's body is warm and slightly sweating.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Xinghuō," the examiner, a tall and burly man in his 30s with prominent neck muscles, calls out. He is clearly a metahuman, likely of the "Giant" mid-level type.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuō steps forward.</p><p></p><p>The examiner first confirms Qi Xinghuō's identity, then gives him a once-over and nods slightly, saying, "Your limb proportions are good, and your muscle development is standard. But good looks alone won't cut it. If you want to reach the strength standard, you'll need to work harder and strive for an exceptional performance."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuō is somewhat surprised. The examiner's eye for detail is impressive. Qi Xinghuō's strength is indeed not particularly outstanding, as he has only been able to consistently meet the standard since the beginning of the year, often failing one or two reps in his previous gym training.</p><p></p><p>The other men and women waiting for the test are also observing Qi Xinghuō.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The size of the muscles didn't matter much, but the women's gaze was different - they were more focused on Jixinghuos face.</p><p></p><p>"How much weight are you going to lift?" the examiner asked.</p><p></p><p>"130 kilograms," Jixinghuos replied.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos set up the barbell plates, adjusted the angle of the incline bench to fit his body measurements, and then lay down. Gripping the iron bar, he took a deep breath and, on the examiner's signal, pushed the barbell slightly off the rack, lowered it to his chest, and then pushed it back up. He repeated this bench press motion ten times to complete one set, doing it all in one smooth motion.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, Jixinghuos expression remained calm, without any signs of struggle on his face.</p><p></p><p>The examiner was a bit surprised at how effortless it seemed for him, but still announced, "The lift is completed, the result is valid, bench press weight 130 kilograms."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos was surprised himself. Even though he had integrated the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes, its effects were limited to just visual enhancements, not physical strength increases.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the 'see the subtle' and 'precision' abilities," he nodded to himself. These two functions of the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes had allowed him to precisely gauge and control his own strength, effectively enhancing his physical performance.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can lift even heavier weights," he thought.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuos did not rashly increase the planned weight, as just passing the test was sufficient. He smoothly completed the next squat and deadlift sets as well, scoring 181 kilograms and 195 kilograms respectively, for a total of 506 kilograms, passing the strength test.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jixinghuos' relaxed demeanor, the examiner couldn't help but say, "Your strength limit is far beyond 506 kilograms. Go back and train harder, you can easily improve by another 100 kilograms and get a higher score. Want to give it another try?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos understood the examiner's suggestion - to forgo this test and come back for a higher score, which would mean a better alien species. But he already had his own plan.</p><p></p><p>"No need, please just record my scores, thank you," Jixinghuos politely declined.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." the examiner shook his head, regretting that many talented people like Jixinghuos were impatient, applying for alien species as soon as they met the minimum requirements, unwilling to wait an extra year or two. They would soon realize how difficult it is to obtain high-grade alien species.</p><p></p><p>The national welfare was the only chance in 90% of aliens' lives to relatively easily obtain high-grade abilities. The examiner did not try to persuade Jixinghuos further, and just recorded his scores.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos left the strength testing hall and went to the neighboring speed test area, which had fewer people and specialized treadmills for testing. </p><p></p><p>The speed test was a 400-meter run, with a requirement of under 52 seconds for men and 60 seconds for women. The faster the time, the higher the score.</p><p></p><p>Since Jixinghuos had just warmed up, he did a few stretches and got on a treadmill. These were specialized testing treadmills - the belt would match the runner's speed, with wind resistance simulated in front.</p><p></p><p>After the examiner confirmed his identity, Jixinghuos immediately took off at full speed.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom - his footsteps were fast and steady. </p><p></p><p>For the first 300 meters, Jixinghuos ran easily, but in the final 100-meter sprint, pushing to the limit of anaerobic exercise, lactic acid built up and his face began to contort.</p><p></p><p>"Test completed!"</p><p></p><p>The treadmill slowed to a stop, and Jixinghuos jumped off, supporting his knees and panting heavily, completely exhausted and feeling nauseous. </p><p></p><p>That final sprint had felt like an eternity. This was why so few people took the speed test - the 400-meter run was one of the most painful and tiring events for the average person. Moreover, running ability demanded more innate talent than strength.</p><p></p><p>"45.8 seconds!" </p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos looked at the time on the treadmill - nearly a second faster than his previous best, far exceeding the test standard.</p><p></p><p>The nearby examiner was visibly shocked, as they hadn't seen such an outstanding result in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos caught his breath and left.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the strength test examiner had said Jixinghuos' strength training was not good enough, but that was intentional on Jixinghuos' part - his true forte was speed and explosiveness. If he had focused on strength training and muscle growth, his speed would have suffered.</p><p></p><p>Of the four tests, the endurance test was a 10,000-meter run, with a requirement of under 33 minutes for men and 40 minutes for women. The willpower test was to endure 7 levels of electric shocks for 10 minutes, with the same standard for both genders.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos could pass both these tests as well. In his training, he could run the 10,000 meters in under 29 minutes and endure the electric shocks for over 10 minutes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, four years ago when Jixinghuos was 18, he had already met the speed test standard, but he had waited until after university graduation to take the full battery of tests, aiming for the highest possible scores to apply for an Overlimit Ability.</p><p></p><p>However, now that he had obtained the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes, he had changed his plan, opting for a Peerless Ability one level lower instead.</p><p></p><p>There were two reasons for this:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Jixinghuos wanted to maintain a relatively low profile in the short term. Applying for an Overlimit Ability required independent evaluation and political review by the Stellar Realm Department, not just scanning and blood tests. They would thoroughly investigate his entire life history, conduct multiple medical examinations, and the examiners would be at least Super Humans, even Legends. Jixinghuos was not confident the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes would go undetected.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given his test scores, he was not guaranteed to obtain an Overlimit Ability. There were too many geniuses in the 56 billion people of the Asia-Pacific Community - hundreds apply each year with perfect scores, many even younger at 15-16 years old. At 22 years old, Jixinghuos did not have a significant advantage, and estimated his chances of getting an Overlimit Ability were only about one-third. The risk of exposing the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes was not worth it for such uncertain odds.</p><p></p><p>The second reason was that Jixinghuos had already planned out his path for the next few years. Based on the functions of the Myriad Phenomenon Stellar Eyes, the Overlimit Abilities compatible with it were not a good fit.</p><p></p><p>With his plan in mind, Jixinghuos went to the first floor of the Alien Services Center.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, I've passed the physical tests and now want to apply for an Alien Species," he told the staff member, a young woman.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment," she quickly verified his test scores.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jixinghuos, which Alien Species would you like to apply for?" she asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Nimble Hands of the Ranger," Jixinghuos answered without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

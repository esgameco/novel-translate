        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The staff did not have any particular thoughts about Jixing Huo's choice, and immediately proceeded to register his application.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo was not worried that his application would be rejected, as he had passed two tests and scored higher than most people.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qianling Qiashou was a relatively sought-after ability, its acquisition quantity was not low, so even if he had to wait in line, it would not take very long.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "Does the service center have any existing Qianling Qiashou species?"</p><p></p><p>The female staff member hesitated for a moment. </p><p></p><p>She glanced down at Jixing Huo's test scores, then replied, "There should be some. A batch of species arrived just the other day, and there were a few Qianling Qiashou among them. Once your application is approved, you'll be able to get the species right away."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo gave her a happy smile and went to sit down to wait, thinking to himself, "If I can get the species today, that would be very smooth."</p><p></p><p>"Qianling Qiashou" is an exceptional ability.</p><p></p><p>The grading standard for abilities was initially released by the "Stargate Defense Council". The first four levels from low to high are: basic, superior, exceptional, and transcendent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this standard is not only used by countries on Earth, but is also universal in the Stargate, with only slightly different specific names.</p><p></p><p>Exceptional abilities are already very rare.</p><p></p><p>Even among exceptional abilities, Qianling Qiashou is one of the most sought-after, with a market price of around 1.6 million Yayuan.</p><p></p><p>Many times, even if one has the money to buy it, they still have to wait for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this is that Qianling Qiashou is the core ability of the "Ranger" profession template.</p><p></p><p>"Profession templates" can be understood as the evolutionary path of an Ability Person's life.</p><p></p><p>Normally, each Ability Person can only fuse one species when their life evolves once. Therefore, the choice of ability becomes particularly important, as it is the most critical factor in determining the strength of the Ability Person.</p><p></p><p>However, there are simply too many abilities! Letting the Ability People choose for themselves, they really don't know which abilities are the optimal solutions.</p><p></p><p>With the Stargate opening for nearly two centuries, the abilities obtained on Earth, combined with the collected ability information, have mostly been recorded in the "Stargate Defense Council" species database, totaling more than 12,000 abilities.</p><p></p><p>The countries, forces, organizations, and individuals on Earth have certainly hidden some ability information, and if all were counted, the number of abilities might reach 20,000.</p><p></p><p>More than 90% of these 20,000+ abilities are basic abilities, with similar effects, too low in power, or even useless waste abilities.</p><p></p><p>Researching the remaining 10% of the abilities to the fullest is an almost impossible task.</p><p></p><p>Many abilities conflict with each other and cannot be fused simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Some abilities are simply not suitable for human beings on Earth, perhaps due to genetic differences or other reasons, with a fusion success rate of zero.</p><p></p><p>Even if some abilities are successfully fused, their power may be greatly reduced, or even mysteriously become ineffective.</p><p></p><p>And it varies from person to person, extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are also positive examples with good results. Certain abilities, when mastered together with other abilities, can complement each other, making up for shortcomings, and exerting far greater power than normal.</p><p></p><p>So countries on Earth have been investing countless resources since the 21st century to study abilities, trying to find the best ability combinations, while also learning from other civilized races, and after two centuries of accumulation, they now possess a large amount of data.</p><p></p><p>By analyzing the ability information data and conducting practical experiments, they have finally obtained a series of optimal ability combinations.</p><p></p><p>These ability combinations are called "profession templates"! Like a virtual game, each profession template has a name, such as "Great General", "Shadow Blade", "Martial Artist", "Gravity Master", "Mind Hacker", "Superconductor Mage", and so on.</p><p></p><p>A profession template usually has five abilities, and some have as many as seven or eight.</p><p></p><p>The biggest advantage of a profession template is its stability and guaranteed strength. The constituent abilities are relatively common, with low conflict probability, high fusion success rate, and great potential, allowing for rapid combat capability formation and mature breakthrough methods, which is why it is the choice of most Ability People.</p><p></p><p>Although the profession templates are fixed, the evolutionary path is not.</p><p></p><p>As long as they are not afraid of conflicts and can successfully fuse abilities, Ability People can change their minds at any time and switch to other profession templates.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are always people who want to blaze their own trail, abandoning profession templates and freely exploring the evolutionary path. </p><p></p><p>These people are called "Unclassified Ability People", and they are very rare.</p><p></p><p>Unclassified Ability People are either geniuses or fools, or they have obtained extremely powerful abilities that are not within the scope of profession templates, leaving them no choice.</p><p></p><p>So the strength of Unclassified Ability People is either exceptionally strong or exceptionally weak.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit is very high, but the lower limit is even lower.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of Ability People still focus on stability and will choose profession templates.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there are more than 40 mature profession templates suitable for humans globally. If incomplete profession templates and some unique ability combinations are included, the number would be two to three times that.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo had no intention of becoming an Unclassified Ability Person. After careful consideration the night before, he chose the "Ranger" profession.</p><p></p><p>Ranger is one of the most popular profession templates. According to the data statistics of the Stargate Defense Council, Rangers account for 7% of the global Ability People, ranking fifth in number! The main combat method of Rangers is ranged attacks, but their close combat strength is also extremely formidable, with agile and nimble movements, and quick reactions, making them a relatively comprehensive profession template.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Rangers are in high demand and never have to worry about employment.</p><p></p><p>The root cause lies in the Stargate.</p><p></p><p>The Stargate exists between reality and illusion, a parallel world to the material universe. </p><p></p><p>It is constructed by the combination of the infinite energy of the galactic center and the thoughts and emotions of countless intelligent beings, forming a hyperspace with completely different natural laws from the physical rules of the real universe. It is permeated by a wondrous energy that acts on both the microscopic world and the spiritual world, possessing a characteristic of idealism that scientists refer to using a term abandoned by physics in the 20th century - ether! Ether is the source of all supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>It can open the Stargate, stimulate life evolution, wield great power, and forge the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, ether also renders all electronic equipment, thermal weapons, and nuclear weapons ineffective in the Stargate, as any weapons and tools relying on physical rules and chemical reactions cannot be used there.</p><p></p><p>This is the iron law of the Stargate! Even the oldest and most powerful civilizations in the galaxy must abide by this rule!</p><p></p><p>Without the use of thermal weapons, Ability People lose most of their ranged attack means, especially low-level Ability People, who can only engage in close-quarters combat in the Stargate.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, ranged attack ability becomes particularly precious in the Stargate.</p><p></p><p>And the Ranger profession template is designed around the "Shooting" ability, initially using bows and arrows as the main weapons, while also not weak in close combat.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, when Rangers return to Earth from the Stargate, they can replace their bows and arrows with firearms, and their strength will soar by several levels.</p><p></p><p>Generally, an Ability Person's strength is relatively diminished on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Only Rangers and a few one or two other professions actually see their strength skyrocket on Earth, and Rangers have the largest increase.</p><p></p><p>Whether on the battlefield as a sniper or assassinating targets in the city, Rangers are a terrifying presence, with far greater deterrence than other professions.</p><p></p><p>The professional potential of Rangers is also very large, with many directions for subsequent advancement.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixing Huo's choice of Ranger was not entirely due to employment and potential, but more because Ranger matches the Wanxiang Star Eyes very well.</p><p></p><p>The Ranger profession template includes five abilities: "Qianling Qiashou", "Flashstep", "Intuitive Reflex", "Precision", and "Balance".</p><p></p><p>The Wanxiang Star Eyes can replace the "Intuitive Reflex" and "Balance" abilities in this template.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Precision," and the functions of the Myriad Star Pupils are even stronger than these two abilities. It also has the additional effects of Eagle Eye, Infrared Vision, and Microscopic Vision, all of which are related to the eyes. Combining these, it is enough to give the Ranger an incredible perception ability! As long as he can obtain the "Thousand Nimble Hands," then his professional template will be close to taking shape.</p><p></p><p>To have mastered three abilities just after becoming an Anomalous Person is two steps ahead of others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuos plan does not end there.</p><p></p><p>Next, he needs to find a way to earn enough money to purchase cultivation resources and services, striving to undergo another life evolution within one or two years and advance to the Intermediate Anomalous Person level, so that he can fuse with another species. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>During this period, it would be best to also obtain an "Expansion Treasure," fusing with an additional species.</p><p></p><p>If everything goes smoothly, he will be able to master five abilities when he reaches the Intermediate Anomalous Person level, and his professional template will be complete, with strength far surpassing that of Anomalous Persons of the same level! Plans are always beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuos mind was somewhat immersed in the beautiful future he had envisioned, to the point of being a bit distracted, until his phone vibrated slightly, and he received a message.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a female voice also came over: "Mr. Qi, your application has been approved, and you can now collect the species."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuos spirits were lifted, and he immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua followed the staff member upstairs to the fifth floor, entering one of the clean and quiet rooms - the Ability Fusion Room of the service center.</p><p></p><p>To prevent species from being impersonated or resold, the Starry Realm has issued a regulation that any species obtained through application must be fused on the spot at the service center and cannot be taken away. If the person feels their physical condition is not good, they can postpone, but not for more than a month.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua naturally chose to fuse the species immediately.</p><p></p><p>The doctor responsible for fusing the species for Qi Xinghua was a woman in a white coat, around fifty years old, with a calm demeanor. After verifying Qi Xinghua's identity again, she said softly, "Please sit down, Mr. Qi, don't be nervous, the species is ready."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Xinghua nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The doctor's smile was very infectious, making Qi Xinghua's mood even more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a staff member brought in a metal box and handed it to the doctor.</p><p></p><p>She opened the box in front of Qi Xinghua and took out a test tube containing a transparent solution, with a pale gray object floating in it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua's eyes lit up - this was the species for Thousand Nimble Hands!</p><p></p><p>The species form of Thousand Nimble Hands is a tangled mass of roots, with sources from various plants in the Starry Realm.</p><p></p><p>This tiny thing is worth 1.6 million Starry Realm dollars.</p><p></p><p>The doctor used forceps to pick up the species and gently place it in another test tube.</p><p></p><p>The test tube contained a freshly prepared solution, and the root-like species immediately began to wriggle and struggle like a drowning earthworm as it fell into the liquid.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the shape of the species dispersed and faded, and a few minutes later, it had completely dissolved into the solution.</p><p></p><p>The doctor gently shook the test tube and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Take off your shirt."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua did as instructed, as he already knew that the fusion method for Thousand Nimble Hands was by injection, so he was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>The doctor drew the liquid into a syringe, wiped the area around Qi Xinghua's collarbones with an alcohol swab, and reassured him, "It may hurt a bit, just grit your teeth and hold still, don't move."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The doctor's hand was very steady as she inserted the needle into the area above Qi Xinghua's right collarbone, angling it downward to reach the brachial plexus nerve behind the collarbone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua's brow furrowed slightly - it did hurt, but compared to the pain of fusing the Myriad Star Pupils the previous night, it was nothing. He had undergone many willpower tests, and the pain of a level seven electric shock was even greater, but he gritted his teeth and persisted.</p><p></p><p>After injecting half the liquid, the doctor immediately withdrew the needle and inserted it into the other side of the collarbone, injecting the remaining half.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The doctor smiled, "It went very smoothly. Wait in the observation room for half an hour, and if you experience any discomfort, report it immediately."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua put his shirt back on. "Thank you, doctor."</p><p></p><p>He went to the observation room and immediately received a document on the "Precautions for Species Fusion," including the possible reactions after fusing Thousand Nimble Hands, the training methods for this ability, and how to recover in case of fusion failure - it was very detailed, and the service was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Xinghua began to feel the reactions.</p><p></p><p>From his shoulders down to his palms, a slight itching and mild pain began, like countless fine needles moving through his arms, both painful and itchy, making his hands numb.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Xinghua was not at all anxious.</p><p></p><p>This was all a normal phenomenon mentioned in the precautions.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Nimble Hands is the most important core ability for the Ranger, allowing the hands to become extremely agile and stable, with enhanced tactile sensitivity. The hands can perform complex and delicate movements, and all skills related to the hands can be quickly mastered.</p><p></p><p>Through the injection, the species has integrated into the brachial plexus nerve in the neck, and then spread to the ulnar, radial, and median nerves.</p><p></p><p>These three nerve branches, as well as the lower-level terminal nerves, control the upper limb movements, from the arms to the hands and fingers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua carefully felt the changes in his hands.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The pain and itching in his arms began to subside, and he could feel the presence of his hands again, noticeably more sensitive than before.</p><p></p><p>He gently clenched and unclenched his fist, feeling the subtle sensations in his palm.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave, he could even perceive the changes in the airflow passing through his fingers. Each finger felt like an independent organ, capable of precise movements.</p><p></p><p>The tactile sensation in his hands had become more delicate, and even with his eyes closed, he could form an accurate mental image of an object just by touching it.</p><p></p><p>The reaction speed of his hands had also clearly increased.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghua remembered a dexterity video he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try it."</p><p></p><p>He took out his phone, placed his index finger in the center of the back, and applied a little force, making the phone spin on his fingertip. However, it only rotated two or three times before losing balance and falling.</p><p></p><p>He flipped his palm and caught the phone, then tried again.</p><p></p><p>After just a dozen attempts, Qi Xinghua had mastered the technique, able to spin the phone on his index finger, using another finger to gently nudge it back into balance when it was about to fall, making it rotate for over a hundred circles before losing stability.</p><p></p><p>Although the speed was not as fast as the video he had seen, and he could only achieve a hundred rotations, it was still a remarkable feat.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!" Qi Xinghua exclaimed, "No wonder it's a superior ability.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it can become the core ability of the Ranger! The Ranger's main weapon is the bow and arrow, with 70% of their strength focused on archery. The enhancement that Thousand Nimble Hands provides for archery skills is unimaginable. Not only for archery, but the Ranger also uses close-combat weapons, and Thousand Nimble Hands will greatly benefit their martial arts as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, like many other abilities, Thousand Nimble Hands can be upgraded through cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I guess this means I've successfully fused it?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Qi Xinghua's face. He had never doubted his ability to become an Anomalous Person, "I've mastered the first ability, so I'm an Anomalous Person now, even if just an Initial-level one."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Xinghua's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>He slightly lowered his head to look at the ground, and the interface of the Myriad Star Pupils opened up. Sure enough, the information on the interface had changed!</p><p></p><p>【Myriad Star Pupils Master: Qi Xinghua】</p><p>【Race: Earth Human】</p><p>【Level: Initial Anomalous Person】</p><p>【Ability: Thousand Nimble Hands (Level 1/47)】</p><p>【Spiritual Source Energy: 0】</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

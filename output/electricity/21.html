        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Never would I have thought that it would come true one day!</p><p></p><p>However, although the Magnetic Field Extremist is powerful, it is also much more difficult to walk this path than other professions.</p><p></p><p>Its template is composed of seven special abilities.</p><p></p><p>The remaining six special abilities, apart from "Lightning Fist" and "High-Frequency Thinking", the other four are extremely rare and cannot be bought even with money.</p><p></p><p>In the future, it will likely take a lot of effort to find these special abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I'll first fuse the Rotating Magnetic Field tomorrow." Jing Xinghuо carefully stored the alien species, as he had experienced too much today, and with his energy, he also felt fatigued, quickly falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Soon after dawn, Jing Xinghuò got up and left the hotel.</p><p></p><p>He slept very well last night, and the Myriad Phenomenon Star Eyes did not detect any danger or abnormalities approaching, as he walked around the city center and did not find anyone following him.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò had told Zhou Yi the merchant yesterday that he would take a few days off and would not report to the Sword Agency for the time being.</p><p></p><p>So before going on the run, he still had some time to prepare.</p><p></p><p>At 9 o'clock in the morning, Jing Xinghuò came to a large shopping mall in the center of Chang'an City, located on the top floors of a hundred-story building, the mall area was very large, with a variety of stores and merchandise, bustling pedestrian streets, and even an aerial garden where one could enjoy the magnificent urban scenery.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò walked into a store called "Star Warrior".</p><p></p><p>The decoration of this store was very grand, the simple and bright atrium was full of modernist style, and as soon as you entered, you could see a row of glass cabinets displaying various forms of alien species!</p><p></p><p>Star Warrior was a very famous chain store in the Confederation, specializing in the sale of alien species and other precious rarities from the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò casually glanced around.</p><p></p><p>Just the displayed alien species alone had many that reached the Excellent level, and the total value of all these alien species was probably forty to fifty million.</p><p></p><p>There were many customers in the store, both Espers and ordinary people who had come to broaden their horizons.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the type of customer, the store staff were very enthusiastic in their reception, treating everyone equally. If customers had any requests, they could directly take out the alien species for close observation.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to have any malicious intentions.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the atrium sat a woman with an expressionless face, her skin unnaturally pale, her black pupils in stark contrast to her white sclera, her gaze sweeping back and forth in the store, making it clear that she was not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò glanced at her and then averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Malevolent Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Likely a super Esper."</p><p></p><p>Most of the store staff were also Espers, from junior to senior levels, and if armed, they could form a hunting team capable of exploring the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, "Star Warrior" was backed by a company that specialized in Stellar Realm hunting.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you have any alien species you're interested in?" a female store clerk approached and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò had wanted to get straight to the point, but after thinking about it, he said, "I'll just take a look around, maybe I'll find something I like."</p><p></p><p>The clerk's enthusiasm did not diminish. "May I ask what kind of alien species you're interested in, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"Any kind is fine."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò pointed to an alien species in the display case and asked, "Can I feel this one?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course." The store unhesitatingly unlocked the display case and took out a glowing red object, handing it to Jing Xinghuò and reminding him, "Be careful, sir, it's a bit hot."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò took the alien species and felt the scorching heat in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the interface of his Myriad Phenomenon Star Eyes appeared in his field of vision, displaying the information of the alien species.</p><p></p><p>[Alien Species: Internal Combustion]</p><p>[Grade: Excellent]</p><p>[Fusion Success Rate: 85%]</p><p>[Can it be Upgraded: Yes]</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed Internal Combustion." Jing Xinghuò thought to himself, "The core ability of the Blazing Extremist." His second brother, Zhong Ming, was a Blazing Extremist.</p><p></p><p>The clerk explained, "Sir, you should know the effects of Internal Combustion, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò nodded.</p><p></p><p>Internal Combustion, as the name suggests, is the internal burning of the body.</p><p></p><p>But unlike ordinary burning, its fuel is stellar force and physical strength, exchanging for an all-round enhancement of power, speed, and neural response, the entire person becoming like an internal combustion engine, crazily doing work externally, with an explosive offensive power that ranks among the top of all professions.</p><p></p><p>Internal Combustion consumes stellar force extremely quickly, and an initial-level Esper who activates it may only be able to maintain it for less than half a minute before exhausting their strength.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Blazing Extremists must defeat their enemies before the burning ends.</p><p></p><p>It's either you die, or I perish.</p><p></p><p>This ability has shaped the Blazing Extremist's combat style, bursting into flames at the slightest provocation, chasing and biting people like a rabid dog, not easily provoked.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the 'Internal Combustion' in our store is of the highest quality and well-preserved. If you purchase it, we will also provide fusion services and a special healing ointment for burn injuries..."</p><p></p><p>The store enthusiastically promoted the alien species.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò wasn't actually that interested, but he still listened patiently.</p><p></p><p>His attention was focused on the [Fusion Success Rate], which surprisingly reached 85%, meaning that he could also become a Blazing Extremist if he wished.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the fusion success rates of the other alien species are?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuò's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." He returned the alien species to the clerk and pointed to another one, indicating that he wanted to take a look at it.</p><p></p><p>The clerk took out the alien species.</p><p></p><p>When Jing Xinghuò's hand touched the alien species, the information was displayed again.</p><p></p><p>[Alien Species: Stellar Might]</p><p>[Grade: Excellent]</p><p>[Fusion Success Rate: 92%]</p><p>[Can it be Upgraded: Yes]</p><p></p><p>Stellar Might is the core ability of the "Martial Artist".</p><p></p><p>It can allow Espers to finely control their stellar force, combining it with...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The martial arts and power-releasing techniques form numerous "forces" with different effects, amplifying strength, enhancing speed and explosiveness, and can also be used for defense - very comprehensive and with immense potential.</p><p></p><p>The variant species of "Star Force" are relatively easy to obtain, with an extremely high output.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the professional template score of the Martial Artist reaches 39 points, with low resource investment and high cost-effectiveness, and there are also many options for subsequent advancement.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Martial Artist is the most numerous profession.</p><p></p><p>According to ADC's data statistics, 12% of the Anomalies are Martial Artists, ranking first among all professions!</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо finished watching the "Star Force" variant species and quickly returned it to the clerk, then requested to view other variant species.</p><p></p><p>【Steel Bone】 fusion success rate 76%, 【Hound's Scent】 fusion success rate 68%, 【Molten Hand】 fusion success rate 66%, 【Unwavering Will】 fusion success rate 80%, 【Muscle Memory】 fusion success rate 77%, 【Nimble Step】 fusion success rate 95%.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо watched more than a dozen variant species in succession, trying them all.</p><p></p><p>He discovered an abnormal phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Not a single variant species had a fusion success rate below 65%, with most being above 75%, and success rates exceeding 80% being the most common.</p><p></p><p>This must be problematic!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was ADC or the research of the Stellar Division, they had both reached the same conclusion - the average success rate for any two random variant species combination is only around 20%.</p><p></p><p>How could he still have such a high success rate, even with his Thousand Nimble Hands? Could it be the effect of the Kaleidoscope Eye again? Moreover, the success rates provided by the Kaleidoscope Eye seemed to conceal a certain pattern - the higher the success rate of a variant species, the stronger the power it could unleash after fusion!</p><p></p><p>Conversely, variant species with lower success rates would not have any additional effects even after fusion.</p><p></p><p>"Is the success rate equivalent to the degree of compatibility?" Xing Xinghuо was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>If this rule was correct, it would mean that the Kaleidoscope Eye could point him towards the optimal evolutionary path, completely unbound by the professional template! The fusion success rate is unrelated to the quality of the variant species.</p><p></p><p>He could directly choose the variant species with the highest success rate for fusion.</p><p></p><p>The fusion success rates of "Star Force" and "Nimble Step" were both over 90%, especially "Nimble Step" at a staggering 95%, and this was just a basic ability.</p><p></p><p>"Given this situation..." Xing Xinghuó's thoughts were racing rapidly, "Could it be that the most suitable path for me is not any particular professional template, but to become a Variant Human without a profession?"</p><p></p><p>He continued to request the clerk to bring out more variant species, even though the clerk's eyes showed a hint of strangeness, and the Malevolent Spirit guarding the store also frowned slightly while observing him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, thank you." Xing Xinghuó did not want to cause too much commotion and stopped viewing the variant species.</p><p></p><p>The female clerk heaved a sigh of relief. "Does the sir have any variant species you would like to purchase?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Xing Xinghuó shook his head, disappointing the clerk, but his next words immediately filled her with joy, "Please give me a Life Seed, I want to purchase it."</p><p></p><p>"A Life Seed!" The clerk was stunned for a moment before exclaiming excitedly, "Certainly, please follow me, sir."</p><p></p><p>The other customers who overheard the conversation all looked at Xing Xinghuó with envious gazes.</p><p></p><p>The Life Seed is an extraordinary item that can expand one's capacity! Anomalies can only fuse one variant species during their life evolution, but the expansion item can break this limitation.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Realm produces many expansion items, and the Life Seed has the highest output, being the most common. The vast majority of Anomalies can only encounter the Life Seed once in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>It allows Anomalies to fuse an additional variant species, and each person can only use it once - it is ineffective for Super Anomalies and higher-level Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Life Seed is also the cheapest of the expansion items.</p><p></p><p>However, this "cheapness" is in comparison to other expansion items. The price of the Life Seed has remained very stable at 8 million Astral Dollars.</p><p></p><p>As long as their finances allow it, many Anomalies will buy a Life Seed to quickly increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó had not originally expected this.</p><p></p><p>The 10 million Astral Dollars gifted by Xia Qingyu, although there was no message left in the letter, could be guessed to be for the purpose of purchasing a Life Seed for him, provided that he became an Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó followed the clerk into the "Star Champion" VIP reception room, and soon the store manager appeared. After Xing Xinghuó paid 8 million Astral Dollars, the manager immediately handed him the Life Seed.</p><p></p><p>The Life Seed was a golden seed, about the size of a little finger. Although small in size, Xing Xinghuó could feel the surging life force within it, similar to that of a variant species.</p><p></p><p>"If Sir wishes to take the Seed with you, we can prepare a portable refrigeration box for you," the store manager said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessary," Xing Xinghuó replied, directly popping the Life Seed into his mouth and swallowing it.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Please prepare a cultivation room for me."</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, certainly." The store manager personally escorted Xing Xinghuó to the door of a luxurious cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>After entering, Xing Xinghuó looked around to confirm there were no hidden cameras, then sat down in the center. He waited for a moment, and the Life Seed had already been completely digested and absorbed. A sensation similar to hunger on an empty stomach rose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This meant he could fuse another variant species.</p><p></p><p>He took out the variant species of Rotating Magnetic Field and unhesitatingly tossed it into his mouth, swallowing it down his throat in one gulp, like eating a jelly candy but without any taste.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the Rotating Magnetic Field variant species was the simplest - just swallowing it. A few minutes later, the changes began!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

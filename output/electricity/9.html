        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today is Jixinghuos 22nd birthday. As Lu Yunhai said, this may be the most important birthday of his life.</p><p></p><p>Because on this day, Jixinghuos will meet his biological parents.</p><p></p><p>If they are still alive.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, after Jixinghuos finished his cultivation, when his physical strength and star power had recovered, he went out as usual to the Qishan Wutong Archery Hall to practice archery.</p><p></p><p>He had already registered for the "Shoot Leaf Cup" competition, which was in three days.</p><p></p><p>These days, following the training plan formulated by Lu Yunhai, Jixinghuos had been practicing shooting moving targets and random targets, and his progress was very fast, with his hit rate increasing significantly.</p><p></p><p>When the training was over, Lu Yunhai came over and said, "Happy birthday!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Jixinghuos was packing up his bow case and asked, "Are you really not coming to the birthday party tonight?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai shook his head, "No, after all, it's your family gathering, I won't participate in your family gathering."</p><p></p><p>"Okay. I'll invite you separately tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos didn't insist, packed up his things and left the archery hall.</p><p></p><p>Back home, he washed up and changed into new clothes, looking fresh and clean.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not leave immediately, but went to the wall, opened the glass window, and quietly looked at the prosperous city scenery outside, with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>As the sky gradually darkened, Jixinghuos' figure was lengthened by the setting sun, casting a shadow on the wall behind him.</p><p></p><p>The skyscrapers outside were lit up with neon lights, and the maglev cars on the superconducting highways also turned on their lights, forming a dazzling and endless stream of light.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos came to his senses, glanced at the time, and then left.</p><p></p><p>It was 7 o'clock in the evening.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos arrived at the "Weiyang Building" in the center of Chang'an City, a skyscraper reaching a height of 1,800 meters, one of the tallest buildings in the capital, with an architectural design resembling a majestic palace reaching into the clouds, known as the "Palace in the Sky."</p><p></p><p>He took the elevator to the 228th floor, where there was a high-end restaurant called "Guxiang."</p><p></p><p>"Welcome back to Guxiang!" </p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos followed the slender female server, walking through the luxurious corridor, and the well-dressed and upper-class customers passed by.</p><p></p><p>He rarely came to such an upscale place, but his mind was not on that at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Entering the private room.</p><p></p><p>One side of the private room was a full-length transparent glass wall, overlooking most of Chang'an, taking in the prosperity and hustle and bustle of the capital of the Allied Sphere.</p><p></p><p>Standing here, it was as if standing above the clouds, overlooking the masses.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuos did not look around much, sat down and ordered a table of dishes, then quietly waited.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Xinghuos." A tall young man pushed the door open and came in.</p><p></p><p>He had a handsome appearance, with a sunny smile on his face, and an aura of vigor and confidence as he walked, and a warmth that was different from ordinary people could be felt when he approached, making people feel very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos stood up to greet him.</p><p></p><p>The two hugged, and Zhongming patted him firmly on the back, then let go and handed him a wrapped box, "This is your birthday gift, the latest 'Zhuodian' power shoes, you can use them for transportation, I think you'll like them."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Second Brother." Jixinghuos took it without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Zhongming's income was very high, and a pair of power shoes worth tens of thousands of yuan was just a few days' salary for him.</p><p></p><p>He was the most accomplished among the five siblings, becoming an Anomaly at the age of nineteen, with the professional template of "Blazing Fury."</p><p></p><p>Last year, Zhongming was promoted to an intermediate Anomaly at the age of twenty-two, and after graduation, he signed a contract with a club and is now playing in the minor league.</p><p></p><p>The team believes he has the potential to enter the super league in the future and has already gained some fame.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhongming was about to sit down when his movement paused for a moment, carefully examining Jixinghuos' eyes and asked, "Xinghuos, have you become an Anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>Before Jixinghuos could answer, a cry came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Third Brother! Have you become an Anomaly too?"</p><p></p><p>A young man and woman quickly stepped in, both in their early twenties, and the one speaking was a beautiful young woman.</p><p></p><p>She was wearing a tight-fitting crop top that exposed her midriff, with a colorful pleated skirt underneath, paired with thigh-high stockings, her face lightly made up, and her dyed sea-blue hair styled neatly, exuding a youthful and vibrant aura.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the young man beside her looked very ordinary, thin in build, unkempt, with his hands in his pockets, in a lazy posture, intentionally keeping his distance from her.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was keeping his distance from the hovering camera next to the girl.</p><p></p><p>"Feifei, turn off the live stream, will you?" Zhongming reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, I'm not live streaming, I'm just filming my own life, and if I become famous in the future, it'll be good material for a documentary!" Liang Qiu Feifei walked in with a bright smile, maneuvering the camera to fly around the room, pointing the lens at Zhongming and Jixinghuos.</p><p></p><p>Zhongming glanced at it and confirmed it was just filming, shaking his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Third Brother, you don't mind, do you?" Liang Qiu Feifei asked again.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos was indifferent to this, already used to it.</p><p></p><p>When Liang Qiu Feifei turned 18 and came of age, she had set her sights on becoming a globally famous live streamer, singing, dancing, gaming, performing, she could do it all, but not excelling at any. Relying on her relatively outstanding appearance, she has been live streaming for three years and is now a small streamer with a few hundred regular viewers.</p><p></p><p>Except for sleeping and using the bathroom, she is almost always live streaming.</p><p></p><p>There are over a million people like her who live stream their personal lives across the country, and you can encounter seven or eight of them just by walking a few hundred meters on the streets of Chang'an.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuos never wanted to appear on camera.</p><p></p><p>In his "Personal Network Privacy and Security" settings, he had enabled the "Portrait Protection" mode.</p><p></p><p>This way, any images of himself that appear in live streams, videos, or photos publicly posted online, no matter who took them, unless he authorizes it, his face will be automatically processed and replaced with a random generic face.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is only for public portrait protection. If it involves legal issues or cases, government agencies have the right to access the data and obtain the real information.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan snuggled up warmly next to Jing Xinghuо, and she had always been close to her third brother, so she happily asked, "Third brother, you haven't answered me yet! Have you become an Anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Jing Xinghuо nodded.</p><p></p><p>"When did this happen?" Liang Qiu Fei Yan learned that it had been almost three weeks, and her eyebrows immediately shot up as she let out a fierce hum, "It happened at the beginning of the month, and you didn't tell me all this time!"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Jing Xinghuо to explain, she asked with a smile, "Third brother, what career template did you choose?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming also inquired with concern.</p><p></p><p>"Ranger."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо answered with a smile, looking at the young man who had been sitting down without saying a word since entering, "Zhi Zhen, what have you been busy with during the summer vacation?"</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, that's just nonsense..." Liang Qiu Fei Yan interrupted, "Other than playing games, what else can he do?"</p><p></p><p>She then started to complain, "I live with him, and I only see him two or three times a week. Today, he even forgot your birthday. If I hadn't dragged him out, he'd probably still be lying in the game pod, molding away!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan and Wang Zhi Zhen entered the same university, so they rented a house together.</p><p></p><p>They were both a year younger than Jing Xinghuо and would graduate next year.</p><p></p><p>However, their personalities were completely opposite.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan was lively and cheerful, actively upbeat, and very likable; while the youngest Wang Zhi Zhen was very introverted, completely laid-back in life, and had decided at the age of 15 that he would never work or become an Anomaly, immersed in virtual games and unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't forget, it's just that the boss in this dungeon was a bit tough, so I couldn't finish it on time, so I was delayed a bit." Wang Zhi Zhen defended himself, taking out a gift box.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, this is the gift I got for you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо took the gift, and although Wang Zhi Zhen didn't say what was inside, his expression showed that he had prepared it a long time ago, with heartfelt sincerity.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, I also bought you a birthday gift." Liang Qiu Fei Yan quickly presented her gift as well, smiling, "Your phone has been used for several years, so I bought you a new one, the recently popular 'Magic Star' phone. I specially picked the black and gold version, your favorite color."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо was touched, "Thank you, Fei Fei, you've spent a lot."</p><p></p><p>"Last week, a 'small capitalist' came to my live stream and was very generous, giving me several tens of thousands. It was perfect for buying a phone for Third Brother, haha..." Liang Qiu Fei Yan looked quite proud.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо and Zhong Ming exchanged a glance, a hint of concern flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming said seriously, "Fei Fei, you need to be careful to protect your information during live streams, and let us know if there are any issues."</p><p></p><p>"I know that!" Liang Qiu Fei Yan's face showed a cunning expression. "I'm not a child anymore. I know very well what the intentions are of those rich people who send money in my live stream. In the future, when I become a big star, I'll even have to avoid serious relationships, so how could I mess around for a little money?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо also felt more at ease and nodded, "As long as you're confident."</p><p></p><p>The four of them sat around chatting.</p><p></p><p>Today was Jing Xinghuо's birthday, so he was naturally the focus.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming asked curiously, "Xinghuо, your previous goal was always to become a 'Titanium Cobalt Dragon Person', so why did you choose Ranger?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan and Wang Zhi Zhen were also very curious.</p><p></p><p>"The competition for Titanium Cobalt Dragon Person is too fierce, and I would need to train for at least two more years to have even a fifty percent chance. But I really can't wait any longer." Jing Xinghuо had already prepared his explanation beforehand, "And recently, I've been practicing archery with my classmates and found that I have a natural talent for it, which is very suitable for the Ranger class."</p><p></p><p>His words were seven parts true and three parts false, and the causal sequence was also reversed.</p><p></p><p>However, the three siblings did not suspect anything.</p><p></p><p>"That's too bad!" Zhong Ming shook his head regretfully, "Your talent is even higher than mine. If you had become a Titanium Cobalt Dragon Person, you would have truly soared."</p><p></p><p>He had grown up with Jing Xinghuō, shared the same aspirations, and trained together. He was very familiar with each other's situations.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō's talent was definitely the highest in the family!</p><p></p><p>Among the five siblings, only Jing Xinghuō could be called a true genius.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhong Ming's current achievements were the highest and his strength the strongest, he was well aware that Jing Xinghuō would eventually surpass him, just a few years later. He just didn't expect Jing Xinghuō to fall short in the end, unable to persist for the last two years.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Ranger and Titanium Cobalt Dragon Person was really too large!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming was only filled with regret and sorrow for Jing Xinghuō, but he didn't show it on his face, after all, this was Jing Xinghuō's own choice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Liang Qiu Fei Yan and Wang Zhi Zhen also looked disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Their talent and willpower were both rather average, unable to endure the hardship of training, with average physical fitness, and had an extremely low probability of passing the Star Realm's test to become Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>The private room fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't the eldest sister arrived yet?" Jing Xinghuō changed the subject, glancing at the time, it was already 7:30 pm.</p><p></p><p>The five siblings had an eldest sister, Ye Dongyan, who had graduated a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>After failing to fuse with an alien species, she gave up the path of becoming an Anomaly and entered the government department as a civil servant. Now she was so busy that she rarely spoke in the group chat, and when she did appear, it was just to forward some government news.</p><p></p><p>"The eldest sister has recently participated in some kind of key project. I heard that if she does well, she may even get promoted."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan had been the closest to the eldest sister since childhood, and they kept in more frequent private contact.</p><p></p><p>"She's here, she's here!"</p><p></p><p>The voice arrived before the person.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, a woman dressed in a neat and professional manner pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>She was carrying a briefcase and a gift box, and the moment she entered, her solemn expression immediately turned into a warm smile.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers and sisters, sorry to have kept you waiting."</p><p></p><p>"I had to go on a business trip to Tianfu City this afternoon. As soon as I finished, I rushed back, so I was delayed by half an hour." Ye Dongyan explained with a smile on her face, handing over the gift in her hand, "Third brother, happy birthday!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

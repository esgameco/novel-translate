        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо sat in the cabin of the aerospace fighter.</p><p></p><p>Two swordsmen from the Sword Agency sat beside him, staring intently at each other without a moment's respite.</p><p></p><p>The body of Jizongbang lay on the floor in front of them, and Min Chongwu squatted there, examining the corpse with great interest, occasionally making clicking sounds with his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and pulled an arrow from Jixinghuо's quiver, looked at the not-so-sharp arrowhead, and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"So you killed Jizongbang with this training arrow?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"I still can't believe it until I see the surveillance footage." Min Chongwu sat down across from Jixinghuо on the other side of the cabin. "Just from the body, if you told me a super hunter killed him, I wouldn't have any doubts."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо still didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>"When did you become an Anomaly?" Min Chongwu asked, then suddenly turned his head and cursed, "What are the information processing people doing? It's been so long, how come they still haven't brought the documents over?"</p><p></p><p>One of the swordsmen replied, "They said they just got the authorization and are in the process of retrieving it."</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu turned back, "Hey, why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you just say to be careful with your words?"</p><p></p><p>"That was for others." </p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu impatiently slapped his hand, his eyes shifting as he took out the Anomaly specimen in the cold storage tube, smiling, "I know you're not happy. But if you want your Rotating Magnetic Field back, you'll need to be nicer to me. Just answer whatever I ask."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо nodded slightly, but still emphasized, "This Anomaly specimen belongs to me. Even though you're from the Sword Agency, you have no right to take it."</p><p></p><p>He dared to say this because of the "Spoils of War Principle".</p><p></p><p>This principle originated in the Star Realm. The Star Realm is very dangerous, but people have to go there to obtain various precious resources. When they are weak or face targets they cannot kill alone, they have to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>Over time, a rule formed on how to distribute the spoils of war after success. Roughly summarized as: whoever contributed the most effort in the battle gets the right to distribute the spoils.</p><p></p><p>If it's a solo kill, even if the target has already been weakened by others, as long as the killer was unaware of this, it still counts as a solo kill, and they can take all the spoils.</p><p></p><p>This principle was also introduced on Earth.</p><p></p><p>The countries have never been on good terms, there is always competition and hostility, and infiltration, espionage, and assassination activities never stop. </p><p></p><p>When powerful Anomalies are involved in these dirty jobs, it becomes especially difficult to guard against them. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, unofficial Anomalies need to be involved to work together. </p><p></p><p>To encourage everyone to take action, most countries have tacitly accepted the "Spoils of War Principle". Spies, assassins, and criminals from other countries killed within their borders are all included in the scope of this principle.</p><p></p><p>The Asia-Pacific Community is no exception.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо killed Jizongbang alone, so according to the Spoils of War Principle, he owns everything on Jizongbang's body, including the corpse! Of course, this is just a principle, not a law.</p><p></p><p>The principle has to give way to the law. For example, if something is an important piece of evidence in a case, it can only be returned after the case is closed, which may take a long time.</p><p></p><p>Or if it originally didn't belong to the deceased, but was stolen or robbed, then it must be returned to the rightful owner.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's concern is the first point.</p><p></p><p>As for the second possibility, judging from Min Chongwu's reaction when he saw the Anomaly specimen, he didn't know about the Rotating Magnetic Field beforehand, so it was most likely Jizongbang's own possession.</p><p></p><p>Unless someone comes forward to claim it.</p><p></p><p>"However, rules are dead, while people are alive."</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu played with the cold storage tube, "If someone bypasses the rules and uses underhanded means to snatch the Anomaly specimen, what can you do about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to snatch it?" </p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо had already sensed some clues before boarding the aircraft, so he deliberately provoked, "Commander, do you have any ideas?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not me." Min Chongwu snorted contemptuously, "I'm a Halo Warrior, the Rotating Magnetic Field is useless against me no matter how powerful it is."</p><p></p><p>The Star Force of Halo Warriors is completely converted into light energy, and light energy has an extremely strong repulsive nature.</p><p></p><p>It not only repels other energies, but also repels the vast majority of Anomalies. </p><p></p><p>So Halo Warriors can fuse with very few Anomalies, and any Anomaly that causes physical changes to the body cannot be fused.</p><p></p><p>The Rotating Magnetic Field belongs to this type of Anomaly, so Halo Warriors have nothing to do with it.</p><p></p><p>However, not being able to fuse does not mean it cannot be sold.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо didn't know how much the "Rotating Magnetic Field" is worth, because this Anomaly specimen has never circulated in the market before, and it was intercepted or traded away even before reaching the selling stage.</p><p></p><p>If he had to guess a price, at least 50 million to start with! Even super Anomalies would be tempted.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuо could see that Min Chongwu truly had no interest in the Rotating Magnetic Field. This person's character, while outwardly careless, is actually quite principled and relatively upright. </p><p></p><p>At least that's how he appears so far.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to know who might have their eyes on 'your' Rotating Magnetic Field?" Min Chongwu emphasized the word "your" with a tone that made it sound like Jixinghuо was begging him.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо said softly, "Some Evil Wind Client?"</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the few swordsmen in the cabin all changed, finally no longer underestimating Jixinghuо, with a hint of wariness on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Now it was Min Chongwu's turn to be silent.</p><p></p><p>But after a few minutes, he couldn't hold it in and asked, "Why did you guess that?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо looked at the corpse.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was quite obvious that he had already discovered the clues before he shot and killed Ji Zongbang.</p><p></p><p>When Ji Zongbang was hiding under the bridge pier, he had already suffered serious injuries. His wounds were fine and long, and he had also been infected with a toxin that could numb the nerves, causing his strength to drop sharply, less than a third of his peak state.</p><p></p><p>The sharp weapon that caused such wounds was very thin, and the attacks were extremely concentrated.</p><p></p><p>Plus the nerve toxin.</p><p></p><p>As long as one's eyesight was good enough, one could guess that Ji Zongbang had encountered an "Evil Wind Guest" with a 90% probability, whose core ability in this profession template was "Manipulating Airflow", combined with the "Blue Mamba Poison Gland", his respiratory system would secrete deadly toxins that would spread in the air, making it impossible to defend against.</p><p></p><p>The Evil Wind Guest was a very powerful profession, but its reputation was terrible, especially among ordinary people, it was enough to make people tremble with fear at the mere mention of it.</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu was suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later.</p><p></p><p>The aerospace fighter flew into the Qinling Mountains south of Chang'an and landed in a hidden valley.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's gaze pierced through the cabin window and swept across the mountains, finding dozens of camouflaged arrays and gun platforms, as well as a "superconducting shield array" composed of dozens of bases, in just a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>The open space in the valley opened a crack, the sluice gates slid to the sides, revealing a take-off and landing platform.</p><p></p><p>The fighter landed on the platform.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A muffled sound, the wide platform sank into the ground, rapidly descending in a vertical passage, and after more than ten seconds, the scene suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>A vast and bright underground space was revealed, divided into multiple layers from top to bottom, like the decks of a warship.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a branch base of the Sword Blade Bureau."</p><p></p><p>"Go down."</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu stood up, letting his subordinate swordsmen pick up Ji Zongbang's body, and as he passed by Jing Xinghuо, he suddenly reminded him, "Be careful of Yan Xiao, he's not as easy to talk to as I am."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>This "Yan Xiao" should be the Evil Wind Guest who seriously injured Ji Zongbang. Judging from Min Chongwu's tone, Yan Xiao's rank in the Sword Blade Bureau was not low, at least on par with Min Chongwu.</p><p></p><p>And he had just taken Yan Xiao's spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо walked out of the cabin, flanked by the two swordsmen, and looked around. There were more than a dozen aerospace fighters around, and outside the cabin door, more Espers wearing black combat uniforms and bearing the "Sword Blade" badge were waiting.</p><p></p><p>He immediately spotted the leader of the swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>A tall and thin man, wearing a rather antique-style blue robe, with a somewhat strange appearance, especially his eyes were green, with vertical pupils, just a glance would make one's hair stand on end, as if being stared at by a venomous snake.</p><p></p><p>Not only were his eyes like a snake, but there were also blue scale-like patterns hidden under his skin, and if they surfaced, the whole person would look like a giant snake standing up.</p><p></p><p>These physical characteristics all indicated the profession template of this person.</p><p></p><p>Evil Wind Guest! Many profession templates will develop corresponding physical characteristics as they reach a certain level, such as the bald head of the Halo Warrior.</p><p></p><p>And the Evil Wind Guest, the feeling they give is that of a venomous snake!</p><p></p><p>"Min Chongwu, you're quite lucky."</p><p></p><p>The Evil Wind Guest spoke with a cold and evil aura, his words unclear, each syllable with a slight tremor, hissing like a snake's tongue in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his green eyes stared intently at Min Chongwu, stretching out his pale palm: "Where's the Mutant?"</p><p></p><p>"What Mutant?" Min Chongwu frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Sss..." Yan Xiao sneered coldly, "Even if your brain is not sharp normally, at this time, do you still have to pretend to be stupid?"</p><p></p><p>Min Chongwu's expression darkened, and he glanced back at his swordsman.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't reported the Mutant incident yet, but Yan Xiao already knew about it, which meant that either someone in his team had reported it above his level, or there was a spy of Yan Xiao's among them.</p><p></p><p>"The Mutant has nothing to do with you." Min Chongwu ignored Yan Xiao's hand, "It belongs to Jing Xinghuо."</p><p></p><p>"Who is Jing Xinghuо?" </p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao's gaze swept over, finally noticing the outsider, but only glanced at him briefly before looking away, with a tone of disdain: "A novice Ranger killed Ji Zongbang? I've checked his file, he just became an Esper three weeks ago."</p><p></p><p>"The surveillance video shows who the spoils of war belong to." Min Chongwu didn't want to waste more words, "I'll go report to Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at a female swordsman, "Xin Feng, take Jing Xinghuо to the interrogation room and prepare to take his statement."</p><p></p><p>Then Min Chongwu left.</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiao looked at Min Chongwu's back, his green eyes flashing, and then he also followed his team.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he didn't pay any attention to Jing Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jing, please follow me." The female swordsman named Xin Feng led Jing Xinghuо through a long corridor, passing through several metal gates, and entered a spacious room.</p><p></p><p>This was the interrogation room.</p><p></p><p>But in the Sword Blade Bureau, the interrogation room could also be used as an interrogation room.</p><p></p><p>Xin Feng brought Jing Xinghuо in and then left, leaving Jing Xinghuо alone sitting at the table. He scanned the room, noticing a surveillance camera installed in the corner of the ceiling, and one wall was a one-way transparent glass, so that the people behind it could see him, but he couldn't see them.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо was not nervous, he had already anticipated this situation on his way here.</p><p></p><p>He sat calmly, lowered his head to look at the tabletop, and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His vision flashed, and the interface of the Myriad Star Pupils appeared, focusing his attention on the [Spiritual Source Energy], whose value had changed from 0 to 137.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо thought to himself, "Now I can study what the Spiritual Source Energy can be used for."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

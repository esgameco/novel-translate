        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang was wearing the power shoes given to him by Zhongming, quickly gliding along the park trail.</p><p></p><p>The wheel assembly installed at the bottom of the shoes was driven by a micro-motor, with a top speed of 50 kilometers per hour. The inner sole had a smart control system that not only maintained body balance at all times, but could also sensitively perceive the wearer's force output, assisting in controlling speed and direction.</p><p></p><p>Just go where you want to go, stop whenever you want to stop; simple operation, smooth movement.</p><p></p><p>The power shoes are the prime choice for short-distance travel! In less than three minutes, Jixinghuang arrived at the Guishan Wutong Archery Hall.</p><p></p><p>The archery hall was particularly lively today. In addition to it being the weekend, the "Shoot the Leaf Cup" competition was also about to be held.</p><p></p><p>Most of the people passing by had archery bags on their backs, gathering in groups of two or three to chat.</p><p></p><p>They, like Jixinghuang, were all participants.</p><p></p><p>"Yunhai."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang's feet came to a stop, the wheel assembly retracted into the soles, turning into a normal pair of sports shoes.</p><p></p><p>As he walked into the archery hall, he saw Lu Yunhai in the crowd, wearing a referee's uniform, very conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Many students were gathered around Lu Yunhai, asking him about the competition details.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai heard someone calling his name, turned and saw Jixinghuang, and walked over to ask, "How's your preparation going?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang nodded and gave him a confident smile.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, he had specifically increased his archery practice, especially targeting the moving targets over 50 meters and the random targets, improving his grasp of them.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand the competition schedule?" Lu Yunhai confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang had received the "Shoot the Leaf Cup" competition process on the day he registered, and had carefully read it through twice at home.</p><p></p><p>The competition was divided into a total of ten rounds, with the difficulty increasing with each round.</p><p></p><p>The first three rounds were group matches, scattered across the seven archery halls hosting the event. They would take the stage in groups, using the entire morning to determine the top 300 scorers out of nearly 3,000 participants, who would advance to the fourth to sixth rounds of the elimination rounds.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon elimination rounds, the players would be concentrated at an archery range in the suburbs of Chang'an, using three rounds of competition to determine the top 32.</p><p></p><p>From the seventh to the ninth rounds, half of the players would be eliminated each round.</p><p></p><p>The final four players would then enter the tenth round to compete for the ultimate champion!</p><p></p><p>The entire competition schedule was very tight, lasting only one day.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai said a few more words and then left, as he was one of the referees and had a heavy workload today.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang found a corner in the archery hall to sit down, taking out his compound bow to recalibrate it once more. The theme of the Shoot the Leaf Cup competition was oriented towards practical application, allowing the use of sights but not stabilizers, and each shot had to be completed within a set time limit, with scores invalidated if exceeded.</p><p></p><p>He observed the other players around him, and over 80% were using compound bows like himself, though most were target compound bows rather than hunting bows.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a competition, so power wasn't a requirement, and the target compound bows had an advantage.</p><p></p><p>The remaining 20% of players used traditional bows or light bows, with dozens of different models and styles, some quite obscure.</p><p></p><p>Traditional bows and light bows placed higher demands on archery skills, and the players daring to use these two bow types were unlikely to be lacking in ability.</p><p></p><p>Several of the popular participants were using traditional bows, surrounded by fans constantly asking for autographs.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuang had only been learning archery for two or three weeks, and apart from Lu Yunhai, he didn't know anyone else in this circle, nor were they familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>"The competition is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>The archery hall's broadcast system sounded, a female voice saying, "Please, all participants, proceed to your respective venues according to your grouping."</p><p></p><p>The participants at the Guishan Wutong Archery Hall numbered over 400, divided into five small groups, each assigned to a different level of the archery range.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang went to the fifth level, where seventy or eighty other players in his group gradually arrived.</p><p></p><p>Several referees were maintaining order.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the first round of shooting begins." A referee shouted loudly, "Please come forward when your name and number are called, four players at a time, standing in the designated shooting area. Please do not make noise, so as not to disturb the players on the field."</p><p></p><p>The venue quickly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The referee called out the names of four players, who lined up. Fifty meters in front of them was the target for the first round, and each person had a timer by their side.</p><p></p><p>"One minute of preparation."</p><p></p><p>The players had to be ready to shoot within one minute; when the time was up, they had to shoot the first arrow within three seconds; then there was ten seconds of preparation, and they had to shoot the second arrow; the intervals were all ten seconds, after which they had to shoot within three seconds, until all ten arrows were fired.</p><p></p><p>One minute passed quickly, and with the beep of the buzzer, the three-second countdown began.</p><p></p><p>Bang, bang, bang...</p><p></p><p>The bowstrings vibrated in unison, and the four players almost simultaneously shot their first arrows.</p><p></p><p>Three minutes later, this group of players had completed their ten-shot round.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang looked at the targets across the field; the first round was the easiest, but perhaps due to the initial nervousness of being the first to take the stage, of the four players, only one scored a perfect 100, while the other three scored between 90 and 97.</p><p></p><p>Judging from their frustrated expressions, it was clear they had not performed up to par.</p><p></p><p>The referee tallied the scores and recorded the results.</p><p></p><p>"Next group of players, step up."</p><p></p><p>One group after another completed their ten-shot rounds, and Jixinghuang found that the scores of most players were around 95, with very few able to shoot a perfect 100.</p><p></p><p>These exceptionally skilled players were mostly either rangers or hunters.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо heard his name called, and he went up to the field along with the other three contestants.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of all the participants were focused on him, but they were actually looking at the female contestant next to Jixinghuо, who seemed to be quite famous and recognized by many people.</p><p></p><p>"One minute of preparation."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's mind was calm and collected. He drew an arrow and nocked it on the "Yifeng" bow, waiting for the preparation time to end.</p><p></p><p>Beep!</p><p></p><p>The buzzer sounded, and he quickly fired the first arrow, hitting the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of his vision, he saw the target next to him also hit the bullseye, almost in sync with his shot.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо then noticed the person next to him, but he did not get distracted. As soon as the ten seconds were up, he fired the second arrow.</p><p></p><p>Bullseye.</p><p></p><p>Bullseye.</p><p></p><p>Bullseye...</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's hands were quick and steady, like a well-calibrated mechanical hand. Each archery motion was completely consistent, without the slightest deviation.</p><p></p><p>After ten arrows, he scored a perfect 100.</p><p></p><p>When the referee confirmed the scores, the audience burst into applause. Out of this group of four contestants, three had shot perfect scores, and the remaining one was also not far behind with a 99.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо exchanged glances and nodded in acknowledgment with the other two perfect scorers before leaving the field.</p><p></p><p>It took an hour for all the contestants to complete the first round.</p><p></p><p>Then came the second round.</p><p></p><p>This round required shooting at a fixed target 70 meters away, with the difficulty level increased significantly. The contestants' scores were generally lower than the previous round, averaging around 80.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the exceptional archers still maintained a high standard.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's second-round score was also a perfect 100.</p><p></p><p>In the third round, the target distance was extended to 100 meters, greatly increasing the difficulty. Many contestants missed the target, and most only scored below 50.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо, however, still shot a perfect 100.</p><p></p><p>After three rounds of shooting, the number of contestants who could still achieve a perfect 100 score was dwindling, and they were mostly exceptional archers. Jixinghuо also gained some attention because of this.</p><p></p><p>"Let me introduce myself." </p><p></p><p>The female contestant in the same group approached him and introduced herself: "My name is Fang Yinping, from Chang'an, an intermediate ranger."</p><p></p><p>She was around thirty years old, with a strong-willed appearance. Approximately 1.65 meters tall, with a well-proportioned figure, she wore a white archery uniform and had a light bow strapped to her back, exuding a sense of competence and agility.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо shook her hand briefly and nodded, saying, "Jixinghuо, a novice ranger."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jixinghuо is quite young!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yinping had already observed him a few times and chuckled, asking, "How come I've never heard of your excellent archery skills before?"</p><p></p><p>She had already considered Jixinghuо a formidable opponent in this competition.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо answered truthfully, "I've only been learning archery for a short while, and this is my first time participating in a competition."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yinping was taken aback, and a hint of displeasure flashed across her face, clearly not believing him and thinking that Jixinghuо was just making up excuses.</p><p></p><p>"Then I wish Mr. Jixinghuо the best of luck in getting a good ranking." With those words, Fang Yinping turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо watched her retreating back and shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>I was telling the truth...</p><p></p><p>After the first three rounds, the contestants had a good idea of their chances of advancing to the elimination round.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were just here to experience the high-level archery and had no intention of advancing, so they left the archery hall after completing the three rounds.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо waited at the entrance for half an hour, and Luyunhai finally finished his tasks and came out. The two of them went to have lunch together.</p><p></p><p>Luyunhai asked, "How did you do?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо took out his new phone, which he had been using for a few days, and showed the screen to Luyunhai, displaying his competition scores and the notification of his advancement to the elimination round.</p><p></p><p>"I knew you wouldn't have any problems!"</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>After resting at home for an hour, Jixinghuо set out for the outdoor archery range in the southern suburbs of Chang'an, in the Qinling Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The venue was large, and at the entrance of the gathering point, a large screen was erected, playing the promotional video for the "Shiye Cup" competition. Below the screen was a podium, and each shooting position was equipped with a hovering camera for live broadcasting, making the event look very formal.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred contestants who had advanced to the elimination round gradually arrived.</p><p></p><p>At 2 p.m.</p><p></p><p>Seven archery hall directors took the stage, five of whom were exceptional archers.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо immediately noticed the director of the Yishan Wutong Archery Hall, Yang Tianqing, whom Luyunhai had often mentioned to him. Yang Tianqing was a super exceptional archer, with the profession template of a ranger, and his archery skills were extremely advanced and powerful. Only those who had enrolled in his courses could meet him.</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing was of average build, neither tall nor short, with his hands empty, but anyone could tell that he was no ordinary middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was extremely sharp, like a razor's edge.</p><p></p><p>Many of the contestants recognized Yang Tianqing and curiously looked at him, but they did not dare to make eye contact with him.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо glanced at him for a moment and then turned away.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, archers!" Yang Tianqing stood on the stage and spoke a few ceremonial words on behalf of the seven archery halls, encouraging the participants to demonstrate their skills and strive for good rankings. The rewards for this competition were generous, with the top eight positions receiving prize money, and the champion could win 200,000 yuan! This was slightly more than in previous editions, but the contestants were not surprised, as many were here for the prize money.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing did not waste any more words and immediately announced the start of the fourth round of shooting. The contestants entered the field according to the new draw.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

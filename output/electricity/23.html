        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо compared the before and after.</p><p></p><p>The range of the magnetic field induction had expanded by dozens of meters, and the strengthening of the rotating magnetic field on the body had also increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the rotating magnetic field was activated, the strength, speed, and explosive power would all increase.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!" </p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо couldn't help but exclaim. The speed of this power growth was simply like riding a rocket, it felt so good that he couldn't help but be intoxicated.</p><p></p><p>"If there were enough spiritual source energy..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the cultivation room, apart from leaving some traces on the ground when fusing with the alien species, there was no other damage.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one problem.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо looked down at himself, completely naked, and suddenly felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He could only press the call service button, and when the staff member came, he said through the door, "Could you please buy me an outfit and bring it in? I'll pay for it, thank you." Although he could order online and have it delivered directly, it would be faster to have someone from the nearby clothing store buy it for him, he didn't want to waste time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before the staff member brought the casual outfit as Xing Xinghuо requested.</p><p></p><p>After putting it on, he walked out of the cultivation room, leaving this "Star Warrior" store under the somewhat strange gazes of the manager and staff.</p><p></p><p>All the way back home, Xing Xinghuо immediately went into the training room.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to test his own strength.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо was shocked, now he could easily push up a 330 kg barbell! Previously, when he had just become an esper, his bench press weight was 220 kg, and after three weeks of cultivation it had increased by 10 kg. After fusing with the rotating magnetic field, his physical enhancement directly increased by over 100 kg. The squat and deadlift had also increased by a similar magnitude, reaching 415 kg and 471 kg respectively.</p><p></p><p>The total of the three lifts had exceeded 1200 kg!</p><p></p><p>This was already stronger than many "Giant Generals".</p><p></p><p>Giant Generals are one of the strongest profession templates, with the core ability being "Giant Transformation", fusing with which will make the body become tall and strong in a short period of time, like a small giant.</p><p></p><p>The total of the three lifts for a junior Giant General is generally around 1000 kg, that is, one ton.</p><p></p><p>Only the most talented Giant Generals can reach over 1200 kg.</p><p></p><p>And the rotating magnetic field had given him strength comparable to the top Giant Generals, and this was just in his normal state. If he fully activated the rotating magnetic field...</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо immediately tested it.</p><p></p><p>The rotating magnetic field erupted with power that even he found hard to believe, the total of the three lifts directly breaking through 2000 kg, almost running out of weight plates in his home.</p><p></p><p>Compared to strength, the explosive power and speed were even more exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The 400-meter sprint time directly went from 38 seconds to 17 seconds! However, the consumption of star force by the rotating magnetic field was very fast, and in about three minutes, the star force had dropped to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>"It's just right to do an endurance test."</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо noted the time, and then started running quickly on the treadmill.</p><p></p><p>Even without star force, his body, after being enhanced, had become extremely resilient. Running at the speed of a top-level ordinary person's 100-meter sprint, his breathing was still smooth and long, not showing the slightest fatigue, his footsteps fast and steady.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until more than an hour later that Xing Xinghuо stopped his steps.</p><p></p><p>His whole body was drenched in sweat, but in the interface of the Wanxiang Star Eye, the star force had already recovered to 97/97, reaching the peak state.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó exhaled a long breath.</p><p></p><p>"The star force recovered from depletion to full in 70 minutes." He quickly calculated in his mind, "When my star force was at 56, the full recovery took 100 minutes. Now that the star force is stronger, the recovery is even faster, the recovery efficiency is 2.4 times that of before!"</p><p></p><p>This was one of the advantages of the rotating magnetic field, far exceeding the normal recovery speed.</p><p></p><p>The faster the recovery, the shorter the time. </p><p></p><p>This way, the daily cultivation cycle could be increased, and with the same 24 hours, the star force growth would be faster than other espers! Xing Xinghuó's eyes were bright, as if he could see himself soon advancing to the intermediate esper level.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think, if he could secretly obtain the rotating magnetic field, he wouldn't have to worry about being detected by the Sword Bureau and having to flee to the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could cultivate steadily at home for a year or two, he would definitely be able to undergo another life evolution.</p><p></p><p>"I hate the cameras!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó looked in a certain direction on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The magnetic field sensing instantly spread out, and there were more than a dozen cameras installed at the main entrance of the building and on the nearby streets, some in plain sight and some very hidden, but all revealed in the magnetic field sensing.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, no matter what I do, I must first destroy the cameras before taking action."</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó made a note of this lesson.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the distractions, he immediately immersed himself in training, combining physical exercise to consume star force, then waiting for recovery, and also practiced the upgraded Thousand Spirit Dexterity, adapting to the current state of both hands.</p><p></p><p>At 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuó came to the Yishan Wutong Archery Hall as usual and proceeded with his archery practice.</p><p></p><p>He had just won the "Shoot Leaf Cup" yesterday, and many people in the archery hall already recognized him, but seeing him focused on archery, they didn't come to disturb him, occasionally casting surprised glances.</p><p></p><p>Halfway through the practice, Lu Yunhai came over.</p><p></p><p>"Xinghuó." Lu Yunhai, as if he had some great news, couldn't hide the smile on his face and said in a low voice, "The manager wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>"When?" Xing Xinghuó asked after shooting an arrow.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai replied, "Anytime today, the manager came this morning and told me he would be at the archery hall all day, so he should be waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fire Jiang nodded, "Take me there now."</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing's office was on the top floor of the archery hall. The two left the shooting range and took the elevator up. Fire Jiang intentionally slowed his pace. There were no people or surveillance cameras in the nearby rooms detected by his magnetic field sensing. He then took out his phone and turned it off, gesturing for Lu Yunhai to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai followed his instructions, but was very puzzled. "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to the Star Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Lu Yunhai was greatly shocked. "What happened? Why the urgency?"</p><p></p><p>Any Anomalous Person who aspired for greater power and wished to advance further on the path of life evolution must enter the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the early days when the Star Gate just opened, many pioneers dared to venture into the Star Realm with ordinary human bodies, in order to rapidly increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>But things were different now.</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm was extremely dangerous for ordinary people, and also perilous for Anomalous Persons.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of life safety, whether it was the ADC or the national Star Realm department, they all advised everyone to reach the Advanced Anomalous Person level before entering the Star Realm, as that would ensure a higher survival rate. After all, there was no much difference for those below the Advanced level on Earth, and most resources could be obtained through proper channels, without the need to take risks.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most Anomalous Persons couldn't wait to advance and would enter the Star Realm after breaking through to the Intermediate level.</p><p></p><p>Anomalous Persons who entered the Star Realm at the Elementary level were very rare.</p><p></p><p>They were either reckless and impulsive young people, who thought they could have extraordinary encounters in the Star Realm, gambling with their own lives;</p><p></p><p>Or they had the backing of a powerful family or force, with a strong team to guard them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai was well aware of Fire Jiang's character - he was definitely not a rash and impulsive person, nor did he have a strong background.</p><p></p><p>Something must have happened.</p><p></p><p>"There was indeed a bit of an incident, but it's not a big problem." Fire Jiang did not explain much. "I won't wander around recklessly in the Star Realm, I'll just stay around the Olympia City area, so there won't be any danger. Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai was still doubtful.</p><p></p><p>If it was really not a big deal, why did he need to turn off his phone before saying anything?</p><p></p><p>But since Fire Jiang didn't want to talk about it, he could only sigh and say, "Alright, be extra careful. It's a pity, the director was going to recommend you to some top teams, I heard even a Class A League club."</p><p></p><p>Fire Jiang paused for a moment, then could only shake his head regretfully.</p><p></p><p>A Class A League club!</p><p></p><p>In the past, he would have desperately wanted that. If he could enter a club and be cultivated as a core player, his future would be boundless.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother Zhong Ming was in a Class B League club.</p><p></p><p>Maybe they could even face off on the field.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell anyone that I'm going to the Star Realm," Fire Jiang instructed. "Just act like you don't know anything. I'll transfer the 700,000 to you later when I leave the archery hall."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten about the money he needed to borrow from Lu Yunhai.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Lu Yunhai nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>The two reactivated their phones, and Fire Jiang entered the director's office to meet Yang Tianqing.</p><p></p><p>This Super Anomalous Person was dressed in training attire. Seeing that it was Fire Jiang, he stood up from the back of the office and smiled, "Mr. Jiang, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Fire Jiang politely responded, "Director Yang, just call me Fire."</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing's magnetic field was extremely "bright". In the afternoon at the archery hall, he had sensed the many Anomalous Persons, but none of their magnetic field strengths could match Yang Tianqing's. It could be said that Yang Tianqing was the strongest Anomalous Person Fire Jiang had encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing was very amiable, and instructed his assistant to bring Fire Jiang a drink.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Fire, your performance at the Leaf Cup was impressive, even an old man like me thinks you're amazing. At your age and level, my archery skills are far inferior to yours."</p><p></p><p>"The director is too kind." Fire Jiang responded humbly, "There have been so many champions born from the Leaf Cup, they are all better than me."</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing shook his head firmly, "No, they are not as good as you."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." </p><p></p><p>Fire Jiang was somewhat taken aback. Evidently, this Super Anomalous Person had also perceived something special about him.</p><p></p><p>He self-mockingly smiled inwardly, saying he wanted to develop quietly, but in the eyes of those with insight, his uniqueness would always be revealed.</p><p></p><p>Unless he truly hid at home and did nothing, his talents would eventually be discovered, just like a pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted casually for a while, complimenting each other.</p><p></p><p>Then they finally got to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lu Yunhai had said, Yang Tianqing had some connections.</p><p></p><p>He had sent Fire Jiang's videos from the Leaf Cup to a few of his friends yesterday, and they had all responded positively.</p><p></p><p>Three were hunting teams, one was a Star Realm exploration company, and there was also a Class A League club with tremendous financial strength, an experienced coaching team, and had been making a push towards the Super League in recent years.</p><p></p><p>They were all very interested in Fire Jiang.</p><p></p><p>As long as Fire Jiang was willing, they could immediately arrange interviews and tryouts, and offer extremely generous contracts.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Director Yang, for your kindness, but I don't have the intention to join a company or club at the moment." Fire Jiang politely and firmly declined.</p><p></p><p>He had already signed a contract with the Sword Agency, and signing with other parties would be illegal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he couldn't stay on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Yang Tianqing was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He had never expected to be rejected, but seeing Fire Jiang's very resolute attitude, even after repeated inquiries, he did not change his mind, so Yang Tianqing's attitude naturally became more cold.</p><p></p><p>After thanking him again, Fire Jiang directly left the archery hall.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jixing returned home and no longer paid attention to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>From the Extraordinary Person Service Center to his home, his star force value increased to 5, and his body was further strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no visible change in his appearance, his physique remained the same, but internally, both his strength and endurance had clearly improved.</p><p></p><p>Jixing remembered the precautions during the evolution period, so he rested for a while.</p><p></p><p>"It's still early..."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the clock, it was only a little past 3 pm, and just sitting around wasn't very interesting. "I can't over-train and get fatigued, but some light training won't have any impact."</p><p></p><p>So he opened his phone and purchased some training equipment.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Jixing received a notification and saw a silver-white drone quickly flying towards the building where his apartment was located, landing on the preset delivery spot on the balcony, gently placing a delivery box, and then taking off.</p><p></p><p>He went to the balcony, brought the delivery box inside, and opened it. It contained the items he had just ordered.</p><p></p><p>It took him a few minutes to unpack - a set of coins of various sizes, a dozen tennis balls and iron balls, a set of rubber juggling clubs, an electronic keyboard with over a hundred keys, an already outdated input keyboard, several bundles of ropes, and some strange-looking tools.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of things, like the props of an acrobatic troupe.</p><p></p><p>These were all items to be used in training the "Thousand Nimble Hands" ability.</p><p></p><p>Jixing picked up a coin, placed it on the back of his finger, and his fingers moved quickly, making the coin roll and dance between them.</p><p></p><p>After a few seconds, the coin paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Still not proficient enough..."</p><p></p><p>Jixing practiced for a while and soon mastered the technique of rolling a single coin.</p><p></p><p>The coin danced like a wave between his fingers, moving at lightning speed, dazzling to the eye, but never falling.</p><p></p><p>He then added another coin.</p><p></p><p>According to the training method, each hand can simultaneously roll a maximum of three coins of different weights, without colliding with each other.</p><p></p><p>Even with the help of the Myriad Astral Eyes, it was not easy for Jixing to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to master it immediately, so he switched to another exercise after half an hour, picking up tennis balls and tossing them up one by one, reaching ten balls, then stabilizing for a while, and adding rubber juggling clubs, suddenly becoming a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>From afternoon until late at night, Jixing went back and forth training several projects.</p><p></p><p>Coin rolling, ball tossing, rapid piano playing, typing, rope skills, and puzzle lock assembly - he had all of them mastered.</p><p></p><p>He felt he was progressing very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Before going to sleep, Jixing opened the information interface and saw that his star force had grown to 28.</p><p></p><p>However, the progress of the Thousand Nimble Hands was still only 1/47.</p><p></p><p>"Upgrading abilities is indeed very difficult," Jixing sighed, but he was not at all discouraged and soon fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day when he woke up, Jixing found that his body had become even stronger than the previous night, but the degree of improvement was not as great as the day before, and the strengthening speed had clearly slowed down.</p><p></p><p>His star force value reached 41, and the growth had also slowed.</p><p></p><p>"My initial evolution period should end today." Jixing got up, washed, ate, and then began his ability training for the day.</p><p></p><p>Using abilities also consumes star force. Different abilities consume different amounts of star force, and the Thousand Nimble Hands is a passive, constantly active ability, belonging to the least consuming category.</p><p></p><p>Jixing trained for seven or eight hours the previous day, using the Thousand Nimble Hands the entire time, but the star force consumption was not much, less than a third.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the star force consumed during ability training, even if recovered, has a negligible effect on star force growth.</p><p></p><p>Star force growth is fastest when combined with physical training.</p><p></p><p>So ability training and star force cultivation usually need to be done separately, creating a conflict in time allocation, forcing extraordinary people to make choices.</p><p></p><p>Either focus on star force cultivation, or focus on ability training.</p><p></p><p>Jixing currently had no such dilemma, single-mindedly practicing the Thousand Nimble Hands, immersing himself in the monotonous training with relish, forgetting the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Every few minutes, he would open the interface to take a look.</p><p></p><p>The day passed quickly. After dinner, Jixing continued training until around 9 pm. Finally, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Astral Eyes interface had updated the Thousand Nimble Hands information: [Ability: Thousand Nimble Hands (Level 1, 2/47)].</p><p></p><p>"Finally..."</p><p></p><p>Jixing let out a sigh, silently calculating, "From yesterday to today, I've trained for a full 20 hours, and the Thousand Nimble Hands progress has only increased by 1 point."</p><p></p><p>"Assuming the difficulty of future increases doesn't change, reaching Level 2 will require 940 hours."</p><p></p><p>"If I fully devote myself, excluding 16 hours for sleeping and eating, 8 hours for star force cultivation, and 8 hours for ability training per day, it will take 120 days to upgrade the Thousand Nimble Hands to Level 2."</p><p></p><p>After doing the calculations, Jixing's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"That's so fast!"</p><p></p><p>The higher the ability level, the more difficult the upgrade. </p><p></p><p>For a superior ability like the Thousand Nimble Hands to reach Level 2 in just four months is considered extremely fast. </p><p></p><p>Most adventurers' Thousand Nimble Hands remain at Level 1 their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Generally, only adventurers who have advanced to the intermediate or even high-level extraordinary person stage can upgrade their Thousand Nimble Hands to Level 2, with an average time of around three years! Compared to three years, four months is nine times more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Jixing was even surprised by himself.</p><p></p><p>He had always had a clear understanding of his own talents, believing his willpower surpassed the vast majority, over 99% of his peers.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he squeezed into the top 0.1%, he could only be considered first-class, not the absolute top genius.</p><p></p><p>Because that 0.1% is still a huge number.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jixing felt like he saw a grand path opening up before him, a smooth road all the way to the limits of life evolution! All of this stemmed from the Myriad Astral Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two days, Jixing's experiences were particularly clear.</p><p></p><p>The functions of the Myriad Astral Eyes went far beyond just "seeing" with the eyes. It had made earth-shattering changes to his self-awareness, body control, perception of external changes, and more!</p><p></p><p>One very obvious point was that when practicing the Thousand Nimble Hands, his hands were extremely precise and stable, with delicate control, allowing him to progress exceptionally quickly, almost the entire training being effective.</p><p></p><p>This was not the normal effect of the Thousand Nimble Hands, but the Myriad Astral Eyes at work.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Myriad Astral Eyes could also see the upgrade progress, allowing him to constantly receive positive feedback during training, maintaining high enthusiasm and focus.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Jixing had a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Astral Eyes was incomplete, and the missing part was the core, so the displayed effects were perhaps not even one-thousandth of its full potential!</p><p></p><p>"If the Myriad Astral Eyes was complete, I can't even imagine."</p><p></p><p>Jixing shook his head, his gaze resting on the [Star Force] value in the interface, which had reached 53 a few hours ago and not changed since.</p><p></p><p>"The initial evolution is over."</p><p></p><p>"As I expected, this evolution period lasted about 24 hours."</p><p></p><p>However, Jixing was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Is the star force of a junior extraordinary person only 53?"</p><p></p><p>The strength of star force has always been vague and subjective. Neither the ADC nor the research departments of various countries have a clear standard for how much star force different levels of extraordinary people possess.</p><p></p><p>The star force value displayed by the Myriad Astral Eyes didn't even have a unit, like a dimensionless number.</p><p></p><p>Jixing felt quite helpless and could only set this question aside.</p><p></p><p>He could feel the surging power within his body, and as the evolution was complete, his physical condition had stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no longer that kind of ever-changing uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level my current strength has reached?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо immediately began to warm up.</p><p></p><p>The physical fitness of a junior Extraordinary was far superior to that of an ordinary person, and the warm-up was especially fast. His body entered a state of readiness in less than two minutes.</p><p></p><p>The training room in the apartment had a complete set of fitness equipment.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо lay on the incline bench and did a few bench press movements. With each set, he increased the barbell weight, breaking through from 130 kilograms to 200 kilograms, and still had some reserve strength.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his bench press weight reached 220 kilograms, and he pushed it up ten times in one breath, just to the point of exhaustion!</p><p></p><p>"The bench press increased by 90 kilograms!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This weight would have been quite amazing in the early 21st century, when there were no Extraordinaries. The most talented strongmen doing raw bench press had a record of 355 kilograms, but they could only do it once.</p><p></p><p>He rested for a while, then did squats and deadlifts.</p><p></p><p>The weights were 278 kilograms and 303 kilograms respectively, adding up to a total of 801 kilograms with the bench press weight!</p><p></p><p>In less than two days, his strength performance had increased by nearly 300 kilograms, but his body shape and weight had not changed much, completely defying the laws of human physiology.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of an Extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Nimble Hands doesn't have much of an amplifying effect on strength."</p><p></p><p>Jixingyan thought to himself as he looked at his well-proportioned figure in the mirror, "If I were a 'Giant' Extraordinary and fused the first core ability 'Gigantification', my three strength records should be able to easily break through 1,000 kilograms, and reaching 1,200 kilograms wouldn't be strange at all."</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his messy thoughts. "The evolution is complete, now I can cultivate Star Force."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how fast the Star Force grows."</p><p></p><p>The first step in cultivating Star Force is consumption, which needs to be combined with physical training to achieve the highest efficiency.</p><p></p><p>He had done a few sets of movements earlier, and the Star Force had already been consumed quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>The interface showed the current value was 45.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо jumped onto the treadmill and ran at full speed, completing 10,000 meters in just 19 minutes, an improvement of a full 10 minutes over his previous record.</p><p></p><p>He ran for half an hour, completing the aerobic exercise.</p><p></p><p>Then he switched to anaerobic exercise, with barbells, dumbbells, bench presses, squats, and deadlifts, all done at his maximum weight, one exercise after another.</p><p></p><p>The Star Force gradually decreased, and after 20 minutes of strength training, the Star Force was depleted.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's physical strength was also completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Phew... phew..."</p><p></p><p>He sat down, panting heavily, drenched in sweat, looking like he had just been fished out of the water, his clothes completely soaked.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I'm so tired!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо didn't even want to move a single finger.</p><p></p><p>But he still opened the interface of the Myriad Cosmos Star Pupils and stared intently at the "Star Force" line, noting the current time point.</p><p></p><p>Soon, as his physical strength recovered, the Star Force also began to rise.</p><p></p><p>When the Star Force recovered to 53, it was already 1 a.m.</p><p></p><p>"140 minutes."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо calculated the time, "My Star Force is fully recovered, and it takes 140 minutes, a bit longer than I expected."</p><p></p><p>"My physical strength is also fully recovered."</p><p></p><p>"But I can't immediately start training at full strength again, otherwise the excessive fatigue will damage my muscles and bones. I need to rest for at least four hours."</p><p></p><p>"That means, even if I don't need to train my abilities, I can only train a maximum of three times a day."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's thoughts were active. "However, during the rest periods between these three training sessions, I can train the Thousand Nimble Hands, as it consumes little Star Force and has a low impact on the recovery of Star Force."</p><p></p><p>He quickly made a training plan for himself.</p><p></p><p>Three Star Force cultivation sessions per day, with the entire process, including rest time, taking five hours each.</p><p></p><p>During the last two hours of each rest period, he would train the Thousand Nimble Hands, three times a day, for a total of six hours of ability practice.</p><p></p><p>He also tried to arrange eating and going to the bathroom during the rest periods.</p><p></p><p>He put the plan into action immediately.</p><p></p><p>The next morning at 6:30 a.m., Jixinghuо got up, and at 7 a.m. sharp, he began the day's cultivation according to the plan.</p><p></p><p>At 12 noon, he completed the first training cycle of the day.</p><p></p><p>At 5 p.m., he finished the second one.</p><p></p><p>He took an hour to eat and rest.</p><p></p><p>At 6 p.m., he continued, and at 11 p.m., he completed the entire day's training plan.</p><p></p><p>Then he lay down on the bed to relax, watched the news for a while, and browsed the internet for a while, falling asleep precisely at midnight.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was immersed in the monotonous training, tireless, never leaving the house, as if he had forgotten the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>[Ability: Thousand Nimble Hands (3/47)]</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Thousand Nimble Hands had increased a little.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was very happy about this.</p><p></p><p>Because this increase was achieved after training for just over 19 hours, it showed that the upgrade of the Thousand Nimble Hands did not increase in difficulty, but rather became faster and more efficient as he trained more.</p><p></p><p>A week later.</p><p></p><p>[Ability: Thousand Nimble Hands (4/47)]</p><p>[Star Force: 54]</p><p></p><p>"Finally..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>For a full seven days, more than 20 times his Star Force had been depleted, his body completely exhausted, and the fatigue had started to affect his mental state, making his brain a bit numb. But the Star Force had finally increased a little.</p><p></p><p>From 53 to 54, the change was not very significant.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the information displayed on the Myriad Cosmos Star Pupils interface, it would be hard to notice the increase in Star Force.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо calculated that if he averaged an increase of one point in Star Force per week, his Star Force would roughly double after a full year of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the upper limit of a junior Extraordinary's Star Force is?"</p><p>"And how much Star Force will I need for the next evolution?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо didn't have much of a clue.</p><p></p><p>He sat down at the desk, and a beam of light projected from the desk, forming a clear display screen in front of him, and he opened a search engine.</p><p></p><p>Earth had entered the Star Era for nearly two centuries.</p><p></p><p>The internet was full of information on Extraordinaries cultivating Star Force - various tutorials, analyses, ability research, career model explorations, videos, and papers, a vast ocean of data that grew by the day.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо only searched for content related to junior Extraordinaries.</p><p></p><p>After a few hours.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing a lot of information and videos, he had a general understanding.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the strength gap between junior Extraordinaries is not large.</p><p></p><p>For two junior Extraordinaries with the same career model and abilities, if their combat experience and martial arts cultivation are similar, their fight would not show an overwhelming difference, even if one had just reached the junior level and the other was close to the next evolution.</p><p></p><p>The latter's main advantage is still their more robust Star Force and greater endurance.</p><p></p><p>The Star Force difference will not exceed twice as much.</p><p></p><p>If you consider the differences in career models, some careers have stronger Star Force, such as "Martial Artist", "Blazing Fury", and "Aura Warrior". Their Star Force will be significantly higher than other careers.</p><p></p><p>But the Ranger is not on this list, their Star Force is at an average level.</p><p></p><p>"Twice the Star Force!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I cultivate for a year, my Star Force can double, and I should be able to evolve into a mid-level Extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"This rapid advancement speed is not much slower than any genius."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's eyes were full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of the recently hottest Zhao Manying, the "Sword Immortal" who had advanced from a junior Extraordinary to a mid-level one in just over a year.</p><p></p><p>You can do it, so can I! Jixinghuо was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not immediately immerse himself in cultivation again, but instead changed into a clean set of clothes and walked out of the house, which he had not left for a week.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

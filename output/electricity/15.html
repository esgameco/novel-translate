        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But this in no way affected his determination to kill Jixinghuо. </p><p></p><p>That brief eye contact just now, although he didn't know why he had been discovered by this weak outsider, nonetheless he had to silence him, otherwise if the police were called, the swordsmen of the "Sword Agency" would immediately rush over, and then he would be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to aim your bow at me, how laughable!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Blade's eyes were full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't know was that at this moment, Jixinghuо's view of the world was completely different from what he was seeing, in fact, no one on Earth had ever experienced observing the world from this perspective.</p><p></p><p>The entire world had slowed down!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо felt as if the pause button had been pressed, the flow of time had slowed down dozens of times, or to be precise, his own thinking had sped up dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>The scenes in his field of vision were playing frame by frame.</p><p></p><p>All things and phenomena were revealed in the finest detail.</p><p></p><p>His brain was like a super-high-speed quantum computer, processing in an instant a huge amount of information that would normally take dozens of minutes or even hours to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>He saw the minute bumps on the cement ground, the chaotic texture, like the surface of sandpaper; the beams of light emitted by the street lamps, each beam was extremely distinct, because it had just rained not long ago, there were countless tiny water droplets floating in the air, forming a small-scale Tyndall effect under the lamp light;</p><p></p><p>The "golden privet" plants planted by the roadside had just been trimmed, the golden yellow leaf edges were rough, with water droplets reflecting the neon lights still remaining on the leaves;</p><p></p><p>In the distance, on the horizon, one floor of a skyscraper was a banquet hall, and the people inside were toasting and drinking;</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо could even judge from their lip movements that he was urging them to drink.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't drink, you're not giving me face!"</p><p></p><p>These images and information flashed through Jixinghuо's mind, finally locking onto that Shadow Blade. At this moment, his appearance, characteristics and movement state were fully revealed before him.</p><p></p><p>Distance 105 meters, speed 29 meters per second.</p><p></p><p>He had sixteen wounds on his body, all cut by an extremely sharp and thin blade; the most serious injury was on the outside of his left leg, the wound was very deep, likely cutting to the bone, causing his speed to decrease; the excessive blood loss made his complexion pale, his pupils slightly diluted, and there was a certain degree of incoordination between his limbs and torso, most likely he had been hit by a neurotoxin; he ran silently and stealthily, this was the "Soundless Technique"; the faint glow on his hand was a formless blade, the Shadow Blade's core ability "Shadow Blade"; just now merging into the darkness was "Shadow Retreat"; his footsteps were fine and fast, with a unique swaying rhythm, the habit brought by the "Phantom Steps"; </p><p></p><p>While running at high speed, a barely visible shadow trailed behind him, like a flow of dim light, ready to be unleashed at any time, a harbinger of the "Afterimage" release.</p><p></p><p>Five abilities, at least a super-powered individual!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was unafraid.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the concept of fear did not even exist in his mind, he only felt that in this state, he was a god!</p><p></p><p>Comprehending all phenomena, omnipotent!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо sensed the composite bow in his hand, illusory beams of light leaping out of the void, as if guided by the long river of time, forming a semi-transparent virtual line extending from the arrow tip, pointing towards the approaching enemy.</p><p></p><p>This virtual line was his shooting trajectory, not yet happened, but he already knew the result! As the arrow moved, different possibilities were presented.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо quickly changed the shooting position several times, the eyes, throat, heart, none of which could threaten the opponent, they were always easily evaded or the arrows deflected. Even if he hit a non-vital area, it would not be a one-hit kill, and then he himself would die.</p><p></p><p>In his field of vision, light and shadow intertwined, overlapping layer upon layer, countless information and possibilities unfolding in a way that was incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the scene froze!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо fired the first arrow, targeting a billboard about 90 meters away on the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>His training arrow was made of carbon-aluminum composite material, very light, but he had intentionally increased the weight to 35 grams to adapt to the high draw weight of the powerful bow.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>A light whistle, the arrow pierced the outer shell of the billboard, hitting the internal capacitor, instantly causing a short circuit in the electrical box, and triggering a chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The 5-meter-high billboard exploded.</p><p></p><p>One of the glass panels shattered into countless fragments spraying all around, a few broken wires fell to the ground, sparking with electricity.</p><p></p><p>It had rained recently, and there was a shallow layer of water on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, the Shadow Blade approached this puddle.</p><p></p><p>His reaction was extremely fast, not daring to risk stepping on the potentially electrified ground, his figure flickered and he skirted around, hugging the wall of the building, continuing towards Jixinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо stood outside the gate, also hugging the wall.</p><p></p><p>He fired the second arrow.</p><p></p><p>But it missed.</p><p></p><p>At least in the Shadow Blade's eyes, this arrow's trajectory veered half a meter to the left, there was no way it could hit him, so he ignored it.</p><p></p><p>"After all, he's just a novice individual, it's already remarkable that he has the courage to face me."</p><p></p><p>"Losing focus is normal."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Blade thought to himself, and in an instant was dozens of meters closer.</p><p></p><p>His gaze locked onto the young man standing there holding the bow, the third arrow was already nocked on Jixinghuо's composite bow, the arrowhead lowered, aiming at his chest, as if he still didn't fully understand the current situation. Even if this arrow hit his chest, it wouldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>"You're about to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was about to die.</p><p></p><p>The "Shadow Blade" in his hand glowed with a faint light, as if it had substance.</p><p></p><p>Against a more powerful opponent, the Shadow Blade would need to be attached to a dagger or short sword to unleash its full destructive power, but the one facing him was only a novice esper. The Shadow Blade could easily pierce through him with a casual strike, slicing his throat.</p><p></p><p>Ding...</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Blade suddenly heard a collision sound.</p><p></p><p>The source of the sound was very close, and from the corner of his eye, he saw an arrow hitting the wall to his left, bouncing off in an unbelievable trajectory and descending to strike his left knee.</p><p></p><p>It was the same arrow that had just missed! This was completely beyond his expectations, as the point of impact on the wall was only two or three meters away, leaving him no time to react.</p><p></p><p>The arrow had penetrated a few centimeters into his knee, instantly causing excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Blade let out a muffled groan, the impact of the arrow aggravating the injury on his left leg, rendering the entire limb unusable. His body involuntarily lurched forward for dozens of meters, nearly causing him to fall.</p><p></p><p>He managed to regain his balance with great difficulty, but before he could feel relieved, he raised his head to look at the enemy in front of him.</p><p></p><p>A black diamond-shaped dot rapidly expanded in his vision.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The third arrow pierced his right eye, instantly penetrating his brain, with half the arrowhead protruding from the back of his head.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Blade's body continued to lurch forward due to inertia, and he fell to the ground, rolling a few meters before coming to a stop just a few steps away from Jixinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо calmly observed the motionless corpse, confirming that he was dead.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly took a deep breath, unable to control the powerful state he had entered with the Myriad Cosmos Eye.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a stabbing pain shot through his head, and his physical and mental strength plummeted to the lowest point, his body feeling completely drained, both exhausted and dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Urgh..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо leaned against the wall, vomiting out the barbecue he had just eaten.</p><p></p><p>This was not because of the first time he had killed someone, as he felt nothing. The vomiting was a physiological reaction caused by the dizziness in his brain, something he couldn't control. As he vomited, he heard his own heart pounding frantically, and finally a sense of fear arose within him.</p><p></p><p>And all of this was because he had looked at you for a moment too long...</p><p></p><p>"What was that Myriad Cosmos Eye just now?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо recalled the first thing he had done, which was to activate the interface of the Myriad Cosmos Eye, immediately noticing something unusual.</p><p></p><p>[Myriad Cosmos Eye Master: Jixinghuо]</p><p>[Race: Earth Human]</p><p>[Rank: Novice Esper]</p><p>[Star Force: 1/56]</p><p>[Ability: Thousand Nimble Hands (Level 1 10/47)]</p><p>[Spiritual Source Energy: 137]</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was stunned.</p><p></p><p>During the moment he had killed the enemy, he had seen something detach from the corpse, like a wisp of transforming mist-like energy with countless forms, which had disappeared in an instant. And he seemed to have gained something in his mind - the Spiritual Source Energy!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Source Energy that he had been studying for a long time had suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>"Does killing someone allow you to obtain Spiritual Source Energy?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was first shocked, and then his thoughts became very complicated, but now was not the time to study the uses of Spiritual Source Energy.</p><p></p><p>He immediately used his phone to call the police.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to click on those few alert messages, and the law enforcement personnel would locate his phone's coordinates and arrive immediately.</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone had already noticed the situation at the entrance of the building and turned around in fear, running away.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо observed the corpse on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He was still filled with lingering fear, having killed a super esper!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he noticed an object next to the corpse, which had probably fallen out of the pocket during the final throes. It was a crystal, transparent and colorless, with an irregular shape and sharp edges. Just looking at it, he could sense its abundant "vitality," causing a slight distortion in the surrounding air.</p><p></p><p>This vitality was Ether energy, which he was very familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"An Exotic?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо felt that this crystal seemed familiar, as if he had seen it before, but it was also different. He couldn't quite recall it at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He could be certain, however, that this was an extremely powerful Exotic!</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he decided to bend down and pick it up.</p><p></p><p>The crystal was very light, almost imperceptible in weight. Its interior was completely transparent, and if not for its unique vitality, it would be indistinguishable from a shard of broken glass on the road.</p><p></p><p>Its texture was also not as hard as he had imagined, with a slight elasticity, yet it was also very durable, like a jelly bead.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо focused his attention on observing it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the interface of the Myriad Cosmos Eye automatically popped up in his field of vision, displaying information he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>[Exotic: Rotating Magnetic Field]</p><p>[Grade: Superliminal]</p><p>[Fusion Success Rate: 99%]</p><p>[Can it be Upgraded: Yes]</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's pupils dilated, and the hand holding the crystal trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because the crystal in his hand was a Superliminal-grade Exotic, but the more shocking revelation was the function of the Myriad Cosmos Eye, which could directly display the information of the Exotic!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо stood there dumbfounded, unable to regain his composure for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Until he heard a rumbling sound from above, and looked up to see a medium-sized aerospace fighter hovering above the apartment building, its cargo bay door opening. A figure shining with dazzling light plummeted from the sky, rapidly descending towards his location.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

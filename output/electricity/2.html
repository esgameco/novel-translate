        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire let out a groan and then regained consciousness: "I'm not dead!"</p><p></p><p>He jolted up and found himself sitting on the floor, in the familiar bedroom. There was a patch of coagulated blood where he had been lying.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a bit of dizziness, he had no other discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire felt a sense of relief. </p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, he had truly thought he was going to die. He was still young, with so much of life left to enjoy - the vast galaxy and starry skies, countless magnificent landscapes he had yet to appreciate, thrilling adventures he had not yet embarked on. It would have been too tragic to die so soon.</p><p></p><p>"It's good to be alive!"</p><p></p><p>Filled with the joy of surviving, Jixing Fire tried to find the culprit behind it all, scanning the room, but he couldn't find the gemstone.</p><p></p><p>"Was it a successful fusion with an alien species?" He was both surprised and delighted, even though he didn't understand why the gemstone fused with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What about the special ability?"</p><p></p><p>Getting up from the floor, Jixing Fire found that he didn't seem to have gained any supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>He stood up unsteadily, clutching his head, feeling increasingly dizzy. </p><p></p><p>His vision was also flickering. Everything he saw was trembling, as if the signal reception was unstable, blacking out for a moment every few seconds, his vision becoming blurry before quickly regaining clarity, repeating endlessly and making him feel very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"There's something wrong with my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire realized that this must be the special ability he had gained from the fusion.</p><p></p><p>He staggered into the bathroom, stood in front of the sink, and was startled by the sight of himself in the mirror. His face was covered in blood, with blood flowing from his eyes, nose, and ears, as well as some unknown white and red fluids that had congealed, covering half his face, making it look like his brain had exploded - a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire quickly washed off the dirt on his face, and found no wounds on his head, nor any strange growths, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Luckily, my face is still intact." He felt his face.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't the kind of handsome guy that everyone loved, he was still quite good-looking, with distinct features and a sunny, resolute demeanor. He had quite a few female admirers at school, and could be considered a little heartthrob. If he didn't do well in the future, he could still consider relying on his looks.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire checked the time - he had been unconscious for about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>The dizziness in his head had greatly subsided, and his vision was gradually no longer flickering or blurry, seemingly returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>No, not normal at all!</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire noticed something strange - his vision was not just stabilizing, but actually enhancing. The world around him became increasingly clear, and he could see more and more details.</p><p></p><p>He could see the countless tiny water droplets floating in the air of the bathroom; the floor, which seemed spotless, was actually lightly coated with a thin layer of dust, some of which were his own skin flakes; when he raised his hand, the skin on the back looked like a cracked, dried-up earth, with deep crevices, and he could even see the fine hairs and the dust particles clinging to them.</p><p></p><p>The entire world had changed in Jixing Fire's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Eagle Eye?"</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire immediately thought of "Eagle Eye" - after the fusion, he had gained the ability of far-sighted vision and extremely keen dynamic vision, comparable to the eyes of an eagle, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>Eagle Eye was an excellent ability, not too rare.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>If it was just Eagle Eye, then he had really gotten the short end of the stick. The gap between an excellent ability and a superior ability was huge, not even comparable.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be Eagle Eye."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire quickly realized the difference. </p><p></p><p>The most prominent feature of Eagle Eye was long-distance vision, but what he was seeing now was close-up, like the effect of a magnifying glass.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... Microscopic Vision?" Jixing Fire was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Microscopic Vision, like Eagle Eye, was also an excellent ability, one that enhanced near-vision instead of far-vision. It was even more valuable than Eagle Eye, as it not only strengthened visual abilities, but also provided powerful assistance in close-quarters combat.</p><p></p><p>Two completely opposite abilities, how could they both manifest? Moreover, how could a single alien species have two abilities?</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire returned to the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>The apartment he rented had a simple, minimalist design, with no living room - the entrance led directly into the spacious 60-square-meter bedroom. The remaining 40 square meters were divided into a study and a training room, which were also connected.</p><p></p><p>The apartment's furnishings were sparse - there were two rows of sofas and a coffee table in the middle, and a simple bar counter/dining table with a kettle and a few other food preparation tools.</p><p></p><p>In the corner, there was a virtual platform login capsule.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were no other decorations, making the entire apartment feel empty and cold.</p><p></p><p>A large bed was placed near the balcony, with an embedded adjustable glass wall behind the headboard.</p><p></p><p>"Open the window."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the glass wall became transparent, revealing the outside scenery. Brilliant neon lights streamed into the apartment, and looking out, Jixing Fire saw the towering skyscrapers, like a range of mountains in the night, their lights illuminating the sky.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of floors of residential lights were all lit up, and the giant screens on the buildings were playing advertisements, the colorful lights intertwining in a dreamlike manner.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he could see the multi-layered superconducting highways between the buildings. </p><p></p><p>Magnetic levitation vehicles were speeding along the highways, their taillights forming long, endless streams of light, like the blood vessels of this super-metropolis, criss-crossing and flowing ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire was already accustomed to this sight.</p><p></p><p>He stood in front of the glass window, his gaze quickly locking onto a building three kilometers away.</p><p></p><p>The night was clear, with no clouds obscuring the view.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire could clearly see the four glowing characters on the top of the building: "Super Ascent Group".</p><p></p><p>In the past, he could only vaguely make out that there were four characters there, but couldn't read the content. Now, not only could he see the large characters, but also the smaller slogan below: "Super Ascent Group, wholeheartedly serving you, helping you break through bottlenecks, and achieve an extraordinary life!" </p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p></p><p>The Super Ascent Group was a renowned company, one of the top firms that helped people with special abilities to cultivate and break through. It had been publicly listed for decades, with a market value already exceeding a trillion.</p><p></p><p>However, the group's name, which sounded like "Super Birth", contrasted sharply with the country's population situation and birth policies, often becoming the butt of jokes.</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely Eagle Eye, but not just that."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire shifted his gaze to his own hands, feeling an exquisitely fine sense of touch, and a slight increase in the speed of his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"This is clearly the effect of Microscopic Vision."</p><p></p><p>Eagle Eye and Microscopic Vision, two abilities combined into one.</p><p></p><p>But there was more! After a moment of focus, Jixing Fire realized that when he concentrated on a target, he would experience a sensation similar to mental locking. He had an intuition that if he had something to throw, as long as the target was within range, he would be able to hit it with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"It's Precision!"</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire was quite delighted.</p><p></p><p>The Precision ability greatly enhanced his accuracy in shooting and throwing objects. With training, he could achieve a 100% hit rate on fixed targets, and precisely control the force of his movements.</p><p></p><p>Although Precision was only a quality ability, below the excellent tier, combined with Eagle Eye and Microscopic Vision, the three visual abilities would create a formidable synergy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rivaling the extraordinary abilities, or even surpassing them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are more than just three abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò closed the window and continued to explore his own abilities. Sure enough, he soon discovered that he could see in the dark - even in a room without any light source, a strange image formed in his vision, indescribable in color, dimly lit, but the outlines and movements of objects were extremely clear, almost no different from normal vision.</p><p></p><p>"It should be infrared vision!" Jixinghuò was greatly excited, "This is another exceptional ability, and it is also a perceptual type."</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is this gemstone?"</p><p></p><p>Next, Jixinghuò became increasingly surprised as he explored other effects.</p><p></p><p>Even with his eyes closed, as long as he focused his mind, he could still "see" the surrounding scenery clearly.</p><p></p><p>And in his mind, there was an intuition, as if he had an invisible eye constantly monitoring everything around him, allowing him to respond correctly in any situation.</p><p></p><p>For the former, Jixinghuò had never heard of a similar ability, and it was not found in the database of alien species.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter, it was somewhat similar to the superior ability "intuitive reflex", but it was obviously much stronger than intuitive reflex! Five abilities, all related to the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò suddenly had a guess - could it be that it was originally a single ability, but its quality was so high that it exceeded imagination, and it possessed the functions of multiple low-level abilities at the same time?</p><p></p><p>It is common knowledge that a single alien species contains only one ability.</p><p></p><p>He pressed his face against the mirror to observe his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>His black eyes were no different from before, the iris shape was normal, and there was no sign of any abnormality, let alone a trace of the gemstone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jixinghuò noticed a faint anomaly.</p><p></p><p>The pupil of his right eye, that is, the small circular hole in the center of the black iris, the channel through which light enters the eye, suddenly flashed slightly, revealing a ring of fine light!</p><p></p><p>This light ring was very narrow, less than half a millimeter, and ordinary people could hardly see it clearly, but it was vividly visible to him.</p><p></p><p>The light ring was dim but still multicolored, perfectly fitting his pupil, surrounding it from the inside.</p><p></p><p>A few barely visible cracks appeared in the depth of the pupil.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò was more familiar with this nebula-like shape than anyone else, as he had observed the gemstone countless times in the past week, knowing every detail by heart.</p><p></p><p>"It has merged with my right eye!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò was about to continue his research, when the light ring of the pupil suddenly flashed, and in his field of vision, a human body image instantly appeared, formed by light-colored dotted lines, clearly showing the internal and external structure of the body, with a face exactly the same as his own.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò was startled, waving his hand in front of it, but the virtual human figure was unaffected, obviously not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>No matter which direction he turned his head, it remained fixed in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He calmed his mind and carefully observed, finding that there were a few strange symbols next to the virtual human figure, which should be a kind of text, but he did not recognize it.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought arose, all the text blurred for a moment, and at the same time, he felt dizzy in his brain, and when it became clear again, it had turned into Chinese characters.</p><p></p><p>[Master of the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes: Jixinghuò]</p><p>[Race: Earthling Human]</p><p>[Rank: None]</p><p>[Abilities: None]</p><p>[Spiritual Source Energy: 0]</p><p></p><p>After reading the content, Jixinghuò couldn't help but take a deep breath, completely stunned, unable to speak for a long time. The information interface was simple, similar to the attribute panel in the games he had played, but its presentation completely overturned his cognition! "Unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I'm so lucky this time!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò almost jumped up, but fortunately he had been much calmer than his peers since childhood, and his emotions settled down in a few minutes as he carefully studied the information interface.</p><p></p><p>The most critical information was in the first line of text: "Master of the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes".</p><p></p><p>"So the gemstone is called the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò suddenly understood, this name was very fitting with its appearance, similar to abilities like "Hawk Eye" and "Precision", they should all come from the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "Myriad Cosmos" in Chinese means "all things and phenomena in the universe".</p><p></p><p>When he transformed the text just now, he experienced dizziness, which should be the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes accessing the knowledge in his brain and presenting it in a way that the host could understand.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be inferred that the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes must be an artificial creation.</p><p></p><p>It is not an alien species at all! Jixinghuò's heart trembled, unable to imagine what kind of civilization or race created the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes, but he could be sure that their technological level must far surpass that of Earth, could it be one of the most powerful hegemon civilizations in the Milky Way?</p><p></p><p>How did the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes come to Earth? Will it bring disaster in the future? "It shouldn't cause any trouble." Jixinghuò was not overly anxious, if there was really any trouble coming to Earth, it was not something he could solve, so worrying was useless.</p><p></p><p>He put aside the worries and continued to check the information interface.</p><p></p><p>The race did not need much explanation.</p><p></p><p>The rank should be the level of life evolution.</p><p></p><p>Among the many civilizations and countries in the galaxy and the starry sky, there are different naming standards for power divisions and levels, but there is also a universal standard, which is the number of life evolutions. One evolution is one rank, two evolutions are two ranks, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Since he was not yet an Esper, of course he had no rank.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, he also had no abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes is an artificial creation, a tool, and does not count as a mastered ability, which means he can still fuse another ability! However, the last "Spiritual Source Energy" was something he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>And the virtual human figure on the interface was also unclear about its function.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, dawn was breaking.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò closed the information interface and lay down on the bed, quickly falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>This time, he no longer had nightmares.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up at noon, Jixinghuò felt energetic, the fatigue of the past few days had disappeared without a trace, and his physical condition was better than ever before. He got up, washed up, ate a quick lunch, changed into clean clothes and went out.</p><p></p><p>After a night of deep thought, Jixinghuò realized one thing - to figure out the specific use of the Myriad Cosmos Star Eyes, he first needs to become an Esper.</p><p></p><p>This was not a difficult task for him.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò's apartment was on the 45th floor. He took the elevator down to the underground parking lot, and a driverless magnetic levitation car came and stopped in front of him. He got in the back seat, fastened his seatbelt, and the car immediately started silently and drove out of the parking lot.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the building, the car drove hundreds of meters on the ground, entered an on-ramp, and quickly climbed up, soon entering a superconducting highway suspended dozens of meters above the ground.</p><p></p><p>One car after another rushed past the window and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum...</p><p></p><p>The electric engine rumbled softly, Jixinghuò felt a push on his back as the magnetic levitation car accelerated steadily on the acceleration lane, changing lanes continuously.</p><p></p><p>After about ten seconds, when the car reached a speed of 350 km/h, the four wheels retracted into the chassis, and the entire car lifted off, switching to the cruising lane.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>The towering buildings on both sides of the superconducting highway were quickly retreating, and even in the daytime, the huge billboards and neon lights were still dazzlingly bright, forming a colorful stream of light as the car sped forward, very dazzling and illusory.</p><p></p><p>Before, Jixinghuò could hardly see the scenery on the street at such high speed.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a casual glance, everything he saw was crystal clear, as if a high-definition camera had captured every frame. "This feeling..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuò sincerely praised in his heart: "It's amazing!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

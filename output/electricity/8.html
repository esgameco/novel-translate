        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai had just finished the first lesson, and he felt a bit overwhelmed, almost losing his confidence as a archery coach, starting to doubt whether what he had learned over the years was correct.</p><p></p><p>In this one hour, Jing Xinghuos progress was significant.</p><p></p><p>But it could also be said that there was no progress at all.</p><p></p><p>The progress was that Jing Xinghuos archery movements had been corrected and became very standard. From the posture, shooting steps to the power techniques, as long as Lu Yunhai taught him once, he could master it after practicing a few times, and would no longer make mistakes. His shooting speed also improved a bit.</p><p></p><p>The lack of progress was because in the process of correction and practice, every arrow Jing Xinghua shot was a bullseye, no matter if the movements were wrong or correct, he could always hit the center of the target.</p><p></p><p>What is the primary goal of archery? It is to hit the target! Since he could hit the bullseye every time, achieving a perfect score, whether the shooting movements were standard became irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Even meaningless!</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, incorrect archery movements and power techniques may cause some damage to the body in the long run.</p><p></p><p>But for a Youxia, the impact is negligible.</p><p></p><p>"I should not have signed you up for the course." Lu Yunhai regretted a bit, "You only need to take two or three lessons to fully master the archery skills, the rest is just practicing on your own to form muscle memory, making the shooting speed faster, increasing the distance, and raising the bow's draw weight."</p><p></p><p>The content of a few lessons, he could just teach it to him privately in his spare time, and he could also save the registration fee.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua understood Lu Yunhai's meaning and smiled: "It's okay, I've at least used the archery range, so consider it as a usage fee."</p><p></p><p>"You don't have a job yet, save wherever you can." Lu Yunhai shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His financial situation was indeed not very abundant, but he didn't have any place to spend a lot of money at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The citizen welfare of the Asia-Pacific Community is very good. For citizens without a job, whether they are of age or not, a subsidy will be issued every month, and there are some additional benefits during festivals, and it will continue until death.</p><p></p><p>The amount of the subsidy is not high, generally around 3,000 Aya. If the citizen has made contributions to the community and the country, the subsidy will increase further, but the vast majority of people can only receive the lowest tier.</p><p></p><p>3,000 Aya is enough for a person to maintain their daily life needs, save some, and still have a little left over each month.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this money is only enough for the most basic living, not starving or sleeping on the streets. But it's also not very fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to live a more comfortable life, satisfy their interests and hobbies, pursue their life ideals, and live a more colorful and luxurious life, they must go out and strive for it themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also many people with low material desires who choose to live their whole lives without working, relying on government support.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the unemployment rate in the Asia-Pacific Community has never been lower than 35%!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the development of technology, productivity has increased dozens of times compared to two centuries ago, and resources are abundant. Not only can the government support tens of billions of citizens, even if the population increases by dozens of billions, the Asia-Pacific government can still afford it. The proportion of the fiscal expenditure on supporting the non-working population has never been high.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua has been receiving the subsidy since birth, and he hasn't been extravagant with his spending, with the biggest monthly expenses being rent and food. The remaining money has all been saved, but it's not much either.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he has only a little over 70,000 Aya in savings.</p><p></p><p>If it was in the past, this amount would have been enough, but now that he has become an Extraordinary, if he wants to progress further on the path of life evolution, he must consider how to make money.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating as an Extraordinary is extremely expensive, it can be said to be burning money! Acquiring an Extraordinary species is just the most basic.</p><p></p><p>With money, one can also hire an entire cultivation team to serve themselves. The team includes a chief coach, martial arts coach, ability coach and several sparring partners, a professional chef in charge of diet, an alchemist to assist cultivation, a therapist for post-training recovery, a personal doctor, and a data analyst who collects the Extraordinary's physical information at all times and customizes the cultivation plan to optimize efficiency.</p><p></p><p>In addition, many large companies have also developed targeted cultivation methods, large-scale equipment, and even more advanced and expensive auxiliary means.</p><p></p><p>Weapon and equipment purchases are also a huge expense.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating as an Extraordinary is like a bottomless pit, even with several hundred million, it may not make much of a splash.</p><p></p><p>In short, Extraordinaries must have money!</p><p></p><p>Conversely, it can also be established that having money is the key to becoming a powerful Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Jing Xinghua has recently been considering how to make money.</p><p></p><p>For example, utilizing his identity as an Extraordinary to apply for a high-paying job, but even the salary of a junior Extraordinary, in the short term, it is still impossible to earn a lot of money.</p><p></p><p>"You keep practicing, I'm going to take other courses." Lu Yunhai saw that Jing Xinghua didn't speak, patted his shoulder, "Don't be in a hurry to leave later, let's have dinner together tonight, my treat!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua watched his good friend leave, putting aside his distractions, and continued to shoot the compound bow.</p><p></p><p>After the training was over, the two left the archery range together.</p><p></p><p>At a nearby restaurant, they had a sumptuous dinner and even drank a few bottles of wine.</p><p></p><p>Although the two had just graduated less than a month ago, but after leaving the campus and entering society, they felt a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua and Lu Yunhai's alma mater was "Fengming Language University", a university that mainly focuses on language majors. In addition to teaching languages from all over the world, it also offers courses in Stellar languages, but its overall strength is still far from the top universities, only a second-tier university in the country.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Stellar language is the ace program of Fengming University.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar realm is boundless, and the human civilization has currently explored and contacted more than a dozen different species, almost all of which have different languages.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua's major was "Xinyalak Language", which is one of the mainstream common languages of the Stellar races. He also minored in "Celestial Language" and "Dragon Language", mastering a total of three Stellar languages, which was considered quite outstanding.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Lu Yunhai's studies were a mess due to taking on too many part-time jobs, often failing courses, and almost didn't graduate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back to the school and take a look."</p><p></p><p>With the alcohol taking effect, Lu Yunhai dragged Jing Xinghua to go.</p><p></p><p>Fengming University was in the Yishan District, very close by, so Jing Xinghua had been living here for these past few years, he didn't stop Lu Yunhai.</p><p></p><p>However, when they reached the school gate, the cool evening breeze sobered up Lu Yunhai's drunkenness.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the familiar campus gate, the two of them both smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Haha..." Lu Yunhai laughed a bit embarrassedly, "The work pressure has been a bit heavy recently, and I lost my composure after drinking, let you see the joke."</p><p></p><p>"If you have any problems, just tell me, don't bottle it up yourself." Jing Xinghua had already seen through it.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Lu Yunhai's pressure not only came from work, but also from his relationship.</p><p></p><p>In these few hours, he hadn't mentioned his girlfriend at all, his girlfriend was also a schoolmate, but she still had a year left before graduation.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's take a walk around the school."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghua took the lead and walked into the campus, strolling on the sports field.</p><p></p><p>Now it was the summer vacation, but there were still many people staying in the school, seeing the student couples around them, Lu Yunhai was moved by the scenery, and finally said, "I've broken up with her."</p><p></p><p>"What's the reason?" Jing Xinghua was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>During the graduation trip, Lu Yunhai and his girlfriend were still as close as ever, seemingly heading towards marriage.</p><p></p><p>"What else, she fell for someone else." Lu Yunhai smiled self-deprecatingly, "At the beginning of this year when I went back home for the winter vacation, she told me that someone from her hometown was pursuing her, and he was also an Extraordinary, so she decisively rejected me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The other party. Last week, she went back home and suddenly sent me a message to break up with me."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang sighed, this kind of thing was too common.</p><p></p><p>The gap between ordinary people and special people is reflected in various aspects of society, especially in mate selection, where special people have an overwhelming advantage. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Between ordinary people and special people, most people will make the same choice.</p><p></p><p>It's mutual consent, nothing to blame.</p><p></p><p>However, when this happens to oneself, especially when one is the one being abandoned, anyone would feel distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Does she really have no confidence in me?" Lu Yunhai felt a bit unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang didn't know how to answer.</p><p></p><p>Past statistical data showed that the success rate of the first fusion with a special species is the highest, and the success rate of the second attempt drops by half, and the further it goes, the more likely it is to fail.</p><p></p><p>By the third or fourth attempt, the hope is basically slim.</p><p></p><p>And Lu Yunhai had already failed once.</p><p></p><p>For the second attempt, he had to buy a special species himself, and Lu Yunhai's family conditions were average, unable to provide much support, he could only rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>His monthly salary of over 10,000 at the archery hall was already a very good job, but it was still far from saving enough money.</p><p></p><p>"Try your best," Jixinghuang could only comfort him, "We are still young, let's put the emotional matters aside first, becoming a special person is more important than a woman."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai nodded heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I've accepted the breakup." He forced back his usual confidence, "I just didn't expect her to change so quickly. The day before she went home, we had agreed that I would meet her parents during the summer vacation, and I couldn't see at all that she had already changed her mind."</p><p></p><p>"Women..." Jixinghuang shook his head, "You're not a mind reader, how could you have guessed her thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he suddenly looked serious and said, "Sooner or later, I will make her regret it."</p><p></p><p>The two walked around the school and then went their separate ways back home.</p><p></p><p>After that, Jixinghuang adjusted his cultivation plan.</p><p></p><p>Every afternoon, he would take two hours to go to the archery hall, attend classes and practice archery.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai used three days to teach Jixinghuang the basic archery course, and then upgraded to the advanced course, the fee remained the same, and it only took him ten days to teach all the archery knowledge he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>The remaining time was for practice.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang's archery movements and power techniques became more and more proficient through repeated practice, the draw weight of the compound bow gradually increased, stabilizing at 83 kilograms (184 pounds), and the shooting distance also became longer and longer, from 30 meters to 100 meters.</p><p></p><p>Within 100 meters of fixed targets, he could hit the bullseye with every shot! However, when it came to moving targets and random targets, he could only guarantee hitting the bullseye within 50 meters, and the farther the distance, the lower the score.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lu Yunhai was still amazed.</p><p></p><p>He had been practicing archery for nearly ten years, but Jixinghuang had caught up with him and surpassed him in just ten days.</p><p></p><p>When the archery training was over that day, Lu Yunhai called Jixinghuang and handed him a black package, saying, "Xinghuang, take this."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Jixinghuang roughly guessed what it was.</p><p></p><p>Opening it, he saw a silver-gray compound hunting bow, along with dozens of training arrows.</p><p></p><p>"Your 22nd birthday is coming soon, and this may be the most important birthday of your life. I don't have much good stuff, this 'Yifeng' is one of the compound bows I've collected, I'm giving it to you as a birthday gift."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai smiled and said, "Don't be polite to me, if you make it big in the future, don't forget to pull me up."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang wanted to refuse, but hearing him say that, he could only nod, "Okay, then I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>Yifeng is a well-known hunting bow brand. According to the ADC rating standard, this compound hunting bow is a "premium" one-star product, using the best materials and manufacturing techniques currently available, with a price of about 20,000 Yen.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jixinghuang accept the gift, Lu Yunhai looked very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Every good archer should have a good bow of their own," he started talking about archery theory, "You've been using the bows in the hall, and you have to adjust the parameters every time you come, the performance is also very mediocre, unable to fully display your potential."</p><p></p><p>"This Yifeng bow may not be a super weapon, but its performance is much better than the bows in the hall."</p><p></p><p>"Once you get used to it, your strength will improve even further."</p><p></p><p>While listening to him, Jixinghuang took out the compound bow and started adjusting the parameters according to his own data. Draw length, sight, and draw weight.</p><p></p><p>The draw weight adjustment range of Yifeng is very large, from 70 kilograms to 130 kilograms, it should be usable for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Shoot a few arrows and try it out," Lu Yunhai said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang calibrated the bow, immediately gripping it in his hand, the feel of the bow was different.</p><p></p><p>Since it was designed for special people to use, the materials and design were more focused on durability and toughness, without considering lightweight, so Yifeng was much heavier than a normal compound bow, over 7 kilograms including accessories, which was just the right weight for him.</p><p></p><p>Nocking an arrow, drawing the string, aiming, and releasing.</p><p></p><p>Bang! A arrow hit the center of the 100-meter target.</p><p></p><p>He fired continuously, shooting 20 arrows in just 30 seconds, filling the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai had seen it before, but he was still amazed, shaking his head and saying, "With your talent, if you practice a bit more on moving targets and random targets, you can go to the competitions, you'll definitely be able to win a place."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of competition?" Jixinghuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Changan holds many archery competitions every year, from all over the country, from amateur to professional levels, including indoor shooting competitions, outdoor field archery competitions, online simulated combat competitions, etc. The audience is large, and the prize money is not small," Lu Yunhai briefly introduced.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang's eyes lit up, "How much is the prize money specifically?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai replied, "The top-ranked ones usually have prize money, the highest level field archery competition in Changan, the champion prize should be several hundred thousand. But it depends on the sponsor, if the sponsor is generous, the champion prize can be over a million as well."</p><p></p><p>"Over a million!" Jixinghuang was immediately tempted, "When is the field archery competition?"</p><p></p><p>"It was just held in May, the next one will be next year," Lu Yunhai chuckled, seeing that Jixinghuang was eager to participate, and said, "But there's a small competition next week, organized by several archery halls in Changan, called the 'Shiye Cup', the prize money is also over 100,000."</p><p></p><p>"Are there any registration requirements?"</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people have no restrictions, but the level of special people cannot exceed intermediate," Lu Yunhai explained, "The Shiye Cup is a semi-professional competition, so the scale is relatively small."</p><p></p><p>"I'll sign up."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang thought, this fits his requirements perfectly.</p><p></p><p>For the high-level large-scale competitions, although the champion prize is higher, the competitors are also more formidable, and if he stands out too much, he might run into some trouble.</p><p></p><p>For this semi-professional competition with a small scale but good prize money, it won't attract too much attention.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then I'll sign you up," Lu Yunhai said excitedly, "If you can win the championship, I can also bask in the glory, after all, you are the one I trained, and you are also a member of the hall, the hall manager might even give you some extra rewards."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>If he can get the prize money, this might be a good way for him to quickly earn money.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

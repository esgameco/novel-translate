        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The urban planning of Chang'an is excellent, fully achieving separation of people and vehicles. Most cars are driving on the elevated superconducting highways, with very few vehicles on the ground. The dedicated ground roads are also closed, occupying only a small area.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the spaces between the buildings have been transformed into continuous urban parks, with a large number of trees and flowers planted, resulting in a high degree of greening and a beautiful environment.</p><p></p><p>However, the population of Chang'an is really too large. </p><p></p><p>The Qishan District is relatively remote. It's now a little past 2 pm, but there are still many pedestrians on the park trails.</p><p></p><p>Some are strolling and chatting leisurely, while others are rushing by in powered shoes. There are also couples sitting in the secluded flower beds, whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>People like Jing Xinghuos, who are walking alone, are more common. He has lived in this community for a few years, and occasionally nods to familiar faces on the road, but that's about it. He doesn't know them, and they don't know him either - it's polite yet distant.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Jing Xinghuos arrived in front of a multi-story venue, with a sign outside that read "Qishan Wutong Archery Hall".</p><p></p><p>"I'm here," he sent a message at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a tall, slender young man with long hair rushed out of the archery hall, exclaiming excitedly, "Xinghuos! I thought you were joking with me, but you actually came!"</p><p></p><p>"Yunhai." Jing Xinghuos also smiled and bumped fists with him, then hugged and let go.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai was one of Jing Xinghuos' classmates, one of his closest friends in college, and they used to see each other almost every day before graduation. During that graduation trip, Lu Yunhai brought his girlfriend along.</p><p></p><p>"How are you doing now?" Lu Yunhai asked with concern, as he had heard that Jing Xinghuos had been having trouble sleeping after the trip.</p><p></p><p>"It's been resolved," Jing Xinghuos replied with a mysterious smile. "I'm in great shape now."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lu Yunhai stepped back and observed him carefully, first with some suspicion, then with surprise. "You've become an Anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!" Lu Yunhai was shocked at first, then his face was full of envy. He punched Jing Xinghuos' shoulder forcefully, "I knew it, you were bound to become an Anomaly. You should have taken that step a few years ago, otherwise Wu Qifeng wouldn't have been so arrogant all the way through graduation."</p><p></p><p>Wu Qifeng was also their classmate, both a friend and a competitor.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that Wu Qifeng's talent was very good. He successfully fused with an alien species in his freshman year, and his professional template as a "Graviton" was quite powerful. He was the center of attention in their class during college.</p><p></p><p>"What professional template did you choose?" Lu Yunhai asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Ranger."</p><p></p><p>"Why Ranger?" Lu Yunhai was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He was very familiar with Jing Xinghuos, and had never heard him mention wanting to choose Ranger before, which was quite different from his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't your goal the 'Titanium-Cobalt Dragon'? How could you give that up?" Lu Yunhai shook his head. "You didn't get rejected for the super-limit Anomaly ability, did you? That would be such a pity."</p><p></p><p>The Titanium-Cobalt Dragon is a profession unique to the Asia-Pacific Community, with few in number but extraordinary strength, and is one of the top professional templates globally. Any Titanium-Cobalt Dragon would at least become a super Anomaly in the future, with unparalleled strength and status.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Ranger, the gap between the two is like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't apply, I just changed my plan," Jing Xinghuos didn't explain much.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai could tell he didn't want to go into details, so he didn't pry further, and smiled, "Ranger is good too, no need to worry about employment."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized something, "Ah, no wonder you came to find me!"</p><p></p><p>"You work at the archery hall, who else would I come to if not you?" Jing Xinghuos shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Ranger's main weapon is the bow and arrow. A Ranger must master archery, and practice it diligently, at least until they become a super Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai had been practicing archery since he was young, and his shooting skills were superb. He was the vice president of the archery club in college.</p><p></p><p>In his sophomore year, Lu Yunhai tried to fuse with an alien species and became a "Hunter", a profession similar to Ranger that also uses the bow and arrow as the main weapon, and has a battle pet.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Yunhai's fusion failed. But he didn't give up, and after recovering, he started working part-time outside of school to save money for a second fusion attempt, which he continued until now.</p><p></p><p>After graduation, Lu Yunhai officially became a coach at the archery hall.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos wanted to learn archery, and naturally thought of his good friend first, plus the location was very close to home, so he wanted to help increase Lu Yunhai's business.</p><p></p><p>When Lu Yunhai heard that Jing Xinghuos wanted to learn archery, he was very proud.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, you didn't even want to join the club, and now you're willing to pay to learn archery from me. Regretting it, huh? Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos was a bit annoyed, "You have to give me a discount."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll give you the best price," Lu Yunhai teased enough, and his mood was relaxed. "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>He led Jing Xinghuos into the archery hall. Along the way, they ran into colleagues and students, many of whom called Lu Yunhai "Coach Lu", showing that he had a high status in the archery hall.</p><p></p><p>"You're doing well," Jing Xinghuos teased.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." Lu Yunhai boasted, "Although I'm not an Anomaly yet, in terms of archery skills, I can rank in the top five, or even compete for the top three in our hall, only the hall director can solidly beat me."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos was curious, "The hall director is very skilled?"</p><p></p><p>"Definitely!" Lu Yunhai said admiringly, "Our hall director is also a Ranger, but he's a super Anomaly. Too many people want to learn archery from him, even Anomalies, and he charges over 10,000 Aya per lesson, but the class schedule is snatched up as soon as it's released."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos nodded.</p><p></p><p>For any super Anomaly, no matter what job they do, their income is astronomical. The public data from the Star Division shows that the number of super Anomalies in the Asia-Pacific Community has exceeded 15 million, while the total national population is 56 billion. The proportion of super Anomalies is so low, which shows how rare and valuable they are.</p><p></p><p>Any super Anomaly can easily make money.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai quickly registered Jing Xinghuos as a member, and said, "The courses and prices are different for different bow types. Which one do you want to learn, traditional, light, or compound?"</p><p></p><p>"Compound."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos didn't think much before giving the answer, not even asking about the price difference.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai nodded unsurprisingly.</p><p></p><p>This is the choice of most Rangers, for a simple reason - the compound bow has the greatest power, fastest arrow speed, and highest accuracy.</p><p></p><p>Traditional bows and light bows have some advantages, but it is difficult to make up for the huge power difference with the compound bow.</p><p></p><p>There is also a type of competitive recurve bow, but it is too complex, inconvenient to carry, and tedious to maintain, so it is almost never chosen by Rangers, and is only used by hobbyists in sports competitions, a very niche market.</p><p></p><p>As for the light bow, it is the recurve bow with most of the accessories removed.</p><p></p><p>Some traditional bows also belong to the recurve category.</p><p></p><p>"The introductory course for the compound bow is 20 lessons, one lesson per day, for a total of 6,000 Aya."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai lowered his voice, "I'll give you a 30% discount."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you," Jing Xinghuos replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо knew that the archery hall, even with a discount promotion, could not possibly lower the price to one-third, otherwise it would have been operating at a loss long ago. It must be that Lu Yunhai had subsidized some of the cost himself.</p><p></p><p>He silently noted this favor.</p><p></p><p>"What's with the formality between us? You don't have to thank me," Lu Yunhai muttered dissatisfiedly, registering Jiang Xinghuо for the course and paying the fee, saying, "Come, let's start practicing now."</p><p></p><p>This venue had dozens of floors all belonging to the archery hall, each floor a spacious shooting range.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the third floor, with most of the shooting positions on the range occupied. Some were practicing on their own, while others were taking lessons with coaches.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai selected a shooting position and asked, "I'll go get the bow. Do you want a hunting bow or a target bow?"</p><p></p><p>Compound bows are further divided into two types - hunting bows and target bows. The two have no structural difference, but hunting bows are smaller in size for easier movement in the wild environment like forests and tunnels, with higher draw weights and greater power, while target bows are larger in size, suitable for open areas, with slightly lower draw weights for better accuracy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the techniques for the two types of compound bows are mostly the same, and there are also many hybrid bow models on the market that cater to both uses.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо was familiar with these basic archery knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"I want a hunting bow," he said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai then asked, "What draw weight?"</p><p></p><p>"70 kilograms," Jiang Xinghuо replied after estimating.</p><p></p><p>Draw weight refers to the amount of force required to draw the bow. The higher the draw weight, the greater the power. However, over a century ago, the unit was changed from "pounds" to the more commonly used "kilograms".</p><p></p><p>70 kilograms is equivalent to about 155 pounds.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Lu Yunhai exclaimed enviously.</p><p></p><p>A compound hunting bow with such a high draw weight would be extremely difficult for an average person to draw, requiring years of practice and a very strong physique. Yet Jiang Xinghuо, a complete beginner, was using a bow of this magnitude.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai himself had been practicing archery for years and only used a 60-kilogram bow.</p><p></p><p>"Anomalies are just amazing," he muttered.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to interacting with anomalies at the archery hall, Lu Yunhai quickly went to fetch a compound bow, "Let me adjust the parameters first."</p><p></p><p>To bring out a bow's optimal performance, it must be matched to the shooter's build.</p><p></p><p>First, the draw length.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо was 1.8 meters tall, but his wingspan was 1.98 meters. According to the formula, his draw length was 79 centimeters, the most comfortable and efficient full draw distance between the bow hand and the release hand.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting the draw weight and sighting parameters, Lu Yunhai handed the bow to Jiang Xinghuо, "Try it out and see if it fits."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо took the bow.</p><p></p><p>This compound hunting bow had an axle-to-axle length of 85 centimeters, an aluminum alloy riser, the typical perforated structure, and carbon fiber limbs. The entire bow weighed less than 3 kilograms, feeling light in his hands despite the high draw weight.</p><p></p><p>Although ranger bows sacrifice many accessories, this compound bow still retained a five-pin sight, a rest, a stabilizer, a string stop, and a cable guard - compact and durable components that greatly assist in accurate shooting.</p><p></p><p>"You participated in archery club activities during your junior year, so you still remember the basic shooting techniques, right?" Lu Yunhai asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Jiang Xinghuо nodded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai pointed to the target across the range, "Shoot an arrow and let me see."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо turned sideways to the target, picked up a practice arrow and nocked it on the right side of the bow, using the Mongolian draw technique with his thumb on the string and index finger hooking the thumb. The 30-meter target with an 8-centimeter yellow bullseye seemed within easy reach.</p><p></p><p>A sense of intuition told him he could easily hit the desired spot.</p><p></p><p>He took a light breath.</p><p></p><p>Then, pushing the bow with his left hand and drawing the string with his right, the 70-kilogram draw weight was not particularly difficult, and he smoothly reached full draw.</p><p></p><p>The compound bow's single string and dual cables distribute the force evenly, and as the draw approached the limit, the eccentric cams at the limb tips reduced the required holding force by 80%, making it much easier and steadier.</p><p></p><p>The "peep sight" on the bowstring was now aligned with his right eye, forming a straight line with the second pin of the sight and the distant target.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the sight and peep were just accessories to Jiang Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>Without these aids, he could still shoot accurately.</p><p></p><p>A light thud. Jiang Xinghuо released the arrow, which flew as a black line and deeply penetrated the target.</p><p></p><p>"Bullseye!" Lu Yunhai exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>He knew Jiang Xinghuо had only touched a bow a few times before, and the archery knowledge he had was just the basics learned from Lu Yunhai himself.</p><p></p><p>The shooting process, though smooth, had many flaws typical of a beginner. Yet the arrow had hit the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>"Beginner's luck," Lu Yunhai grumbled, "Shoot another one."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо smiled, picked up a second practice arrow, and went through the motions - side stance, nocking, hooking the string, pushing the bow, settling the shoulders, aligning, drawing, anchoring, aiming, releasing, and follow-through, all in one fluid sequence.</p><p></p><p>Thud, bullseye!</p><p></p><p>Before Lu Yunhai could say anything, Jiang Xinghuо fired three more arrows in quick succession, his Thousand Nimble Hands ability accelerating his shooting actions.</p><p></p><p>Bullseye! Bullseye! Bullseye!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunhai was dumbfounded, staring at the five arrows embedded in the center of the target, forced to believe that Jiang Xinghuо had shot five consecutive bullseyes.</p><p></p><p>In his years working at the archery hall, he had taught many new rangers, but none were as accurate as Jiang Xinghuо without any prior practice.</p><p></p><p>"Your first fused ability wouldn't happen to be 'Precision', would it?" Lu Yunhai asked suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>The composition of a professional template's abilities is not fixed in the order of fusion.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the core ability is fused first. However, there are rare cases where some individuals choose to fuse a non-core ability first, due to personal preference or other reasons.</p><p></p><p>"My fused ability is Thousand Nimble Hands," Jiang Xinghuо balanced an arrow tip on his index finger, keeping it perfectly steady. "Can't I just be a natural-born marksman with world-class shooting talent?"</p><p></p><p>"How come you never..." Lu Yunhai's words trailed off.</p><p></p><p>His pride in his professional expertise had just been shattered by his friend's unconventional abilities. He wanted to refute it, but after some thought, he could only accept the reality.</p><p></p><p>Solemnly, he said, "I see, you're impressive. It seems there's a good reason why you chose to be a ranger."</p><p></p><p>"But this is just a 30-meter fixed target. You're still far from being a top marksman."</p><p></p><p>"As for archery and compound bow knowledge, there's still a lot for you to learn," Lu Yunhai assumed an confident coaching posture.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xinghuо nodded humbly, "Please, Coach Lu, teach me."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

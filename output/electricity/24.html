        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо opened his eyes on the bed. He had gone to bed early at 10 o'clock the previous night, and although he had only slept for three hours, he still felt energetic and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>He did not turn on the lights, and ate a late-night snack in the darkness to fill his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Then he changed into a casual training outfit, put on his bow bag, and quietly left the apartment without taking the elevator, instead walking down the stairs to the parking lot.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Jing Xinghuо tried to avoid the surveillance cameras as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, through magnetic field sensing, he had a thorough understanding of the positions of several swordsmen arranged by the Sword Agency inside and outside the building, and had also grasped their shift change times.</p><p></p><p>These swordsmen were not there to monitor him, their purpose was to protect him and wait for the extremely low probability of suspicious persons appearing.</p><p></p><p>This kind of stakeout work was extremely boring. Even if the Sword Agency's swordsmen had extremely high quality and concentration, after three or four days of high-intensity monitoring, they were inevitably prone to slack off. The later it got, the lower their concentration would be, especially in the early morning.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо got into a maglev car in the parking lot. The car owner also lived in the building, and Jing Xinghuо knew him. He had borrowed the car for a day at a price far exceeding the normal rate, and the car had been parked here last night according to Jing Xinghuо's request, and he had been given the unlock code.</p><p></p><p>After entering the destination in the navigation, the maglev car quickly drove out of the parking lot. Jing Xinghuо sat in the back seat, his body hidden by the opaque windows, but in his magnetic field sensing, he had locked onto a room on the third floor. There were two swordsmen there, responsible for monitoring the vehicles entering and leaving the building. The car left smoothly, and the two swordsmen did not react.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо had a slight smile on his face as he looked out the window, and the maglev car was already speeding southward on the superconducting highway.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jing Xinghuо arrived at the "Chang'an West Station". After getting off, he let the maglev car automatically return. The infrastructure of the Asia-Pacific Community was very complete, and various modes of transportation were very convenient. For citizens' travel, there were generally three choices: for commuting within the city and intercity travel within 1,000 kilometers, taking the maglev cars running on the superconducting highways was sufficient; for distances over 1,000 kilometers, they could take the "vacuum tube maglev trains", which people were accustomed to calling vacuum trains; and for going abroad or distances over 5,000 kilometers, taking the ultra-high-speed aircraft was the fastest.</p><p></p><p>The "Chang'an West Station" was a vacuum train station. Since the 1980s, the Asia-Pacific Community had invested countless financial and material resources to build a vacuum tube transportation system with a total mileage of over 1 million kilometers nationwide. Matching vacuum train stations were distributed throughout the Asia-Pacific Community, from Hokkaido in the east to the Caspian Sea in the west, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the equatorial Java Island in the south. Every city with a population of over 500,000 had at least one vacuum train station, and larger cities had even more.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо entered the Chang'an West Station and bought a ticket on his mobile phone. The destination: Chaka Star Gate!</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, he smoothly boarded the train. Even at this late hour, the train's occupancy rate was over 50%, and most passengers had the same destination as Jing Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>The seat next to Jing Xinghuо was empty, and he quietly looked out the window. At this time, the train had not yet started, and he could see the situation in the station, scanning every passenger entering through the ticket gate, trying to find any possible hidden swordsmen, but there were none.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the carriage door closed, and the announcement sounded. Jing Xinghuо heaved a sigh of relief, and then felt a slight tremor under his seat as the train started. The scenery outside the window quickly receded, and the train's speed kept increasing. In an instant, the train entered the enclosed vacuum tube underground, and the window switched to a screen, unable to see the outside.</p><p></p><p>The screen displayed the train's current speed. The numbers were jumping rapidly, continuously rising, turning from two digits to three digits, and soon breaking through to four digits! Finally, the speed stabilized at around 1,800 kilometers per hour. Although the displayed speed still fluctuated slightly, the speed change range was small, not exceeding 30 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>The entire acceleration process was very quiet and smooth, and the passengers on the train felt the thrust generated by the acceleration, but it did not affect their activities.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuó was no stranger to the vacuum train, having ridden it many times. But this time, he had a completely new experience. In his magnetic field sensing, the track system underneath the train was a huge magnetic field, its "magnetic induction intensity" was only one-tenth that of the Earth's magnetic field, but the magnetic levitation system's strength was still five orders of magnitude stronger than the human body's magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>Mapped in his brain, the magnetic levitation track system shone like the sun, even producing a kind of "dazzling" feeling.</p><p></p><p>"If the Espers could master such power..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuó couldn't help but indulge in imagination.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-plus minutes later, the train announcement sounded in the carriage: "Chaka Star Gate station has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuó perked up, and as soon as the train stopped, he got up and walked out of the station, seeing a brightly lit metropolis - Chaka City! This place was located more than 800 kilometers west of Chang'an, in the Chaka Basin. Two centuries ago, it was originally a barren desert, with only a slightly famous salt lake scenic area.</p><p></p><p>Chaka City was bordered by Qinghai Lake to the north and the northern branch of the Kunlun Mountains to the south. In 2033, one of the thirteen star gates suddenly opened on Earth, located in a wasteland called "Wolf Cave Pit" in the Chaka Basin. In the more than 100 years that followed, this area experienced countless wars, and ultimately became a wasteland in a nuclear explosion.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until 2147 that the Chaka Star Gate was fully under the control of the Asia-Pacific Community. The Asia-Pacific Community invested manpower, material resources, and financial resources to eliminate the nuclear contamination, build massive defensive works around the star gate, station a corps-level army there, and deploy a nuclear weapon array. Since then, the Chaka Star Gate has become one of the stable portals for the Asia-Pacific Community to enter the stellar realm.</p><p></p><p>The Asia-Pacific Community had a total of three star gates, the other two being the "Xianlian Star Gate" in the heartland and the "Gaogang Star Gate" in Sumatra.</p><p></p><p>The Chaka Star Gate was the closest to Chang'an, so Jing Xinghuó chose to enter the stellar realm from here.</p><p></p><p>He took a car and drove quickly through the city, heading straight for the location of the star gate. The entire Chaka City was built around the star gate, with the urban area roughly in the shape of a trapezoid, covering an area of over 3,000 square kilometers and a permanent population of over 10 million. The density was not high, but the lives and work of all the city's residents were centered around the star gate.</p><p></p><p>The star gate was in the center of the city, and Jing Xinghuó could see a huge building standing in the night from the car. As he got closer, the building grew larger and larger in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he got off the car and stood in front of it, it was like standing at the foot of a giant city wall, over 300 meters high and about 500 meters on each side, a square box-like structure magnified countless times and set on the ground, gray-white in color, built with composite cement and alloy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Majestic and grand, it inspired awe.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Gate Fortress!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо had seen it in videos before, but seeing it in person allowed him to truly feel the fortress's solidity and grandeur. The Star Gate Fortress lived up to its name - it was a true fortress of war.</p><p></p><p>It could withstand nuclear weapon attacks, and within it was an enormous nuclear arsenal, prepared not only to deal with enemies on Earth, but also the terrifying enemies that might come from the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>The area within a 5-kilometer radius around the Star Gate Fortress had been cleared, leaving an open and unobstructed view. Even at night, Jing Xinghuо could see the thousands of gun turrets scattered across the military camps in all directions, hiding even greater firepower.</p><p></p><p>The Star Gate Fortress had many entrances and exits. The large ones were dozens of meters high, like city gates, but were normally closed. The smaller ones were not all open, and were heavily guarded, with only three currently open.</p><p></p><p>After passing identity verification and security checks, Jing Xinghuō entered the fortress gates.</p><p></p><p>The interior was not completely open, but divided into many layers, like nested dolls, with each wall over 15 meters thick. The spaces between the walls formed an indoor pedestrian street, wide enough for seven or eight tanks and armored vehicles to pass side by side.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the street were rows of shops, bustling with people - all of them Anomalies! Jing Xinghuō had never seen so many Anomalies in the real world before. Their magnetic fields were far stronger than ordinary people's as they moved about.</p><p></p><p>He stood by the side, observing for a moment, and was immediately amazed.</p><p></p><p>"A Super Titan!"</p><p></p><p>A giant over 2 meters tall, clad in hundreds of kilograms of heavy armor and carrying a massive battle-axe, each of his steps seemed to shake the ground.</p><p></p><p>Beside the Titan was a blurry female figure, as if shrouded in a mosaic, making her face difficult to discern.</p><p></p><p>"At least an advanced Illusionist."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō sighed, then turned to see a large war horse.</p><p></p><p>The crimson war horse with a horn on its head and scales covering its belly was ridden by a man, who had a blue falcon perched on his shoulder. Two different fierce beasts flanked the horse, guarding the man on its back, exuding an awe-inspiring presence, like the director of a zoo.</p><p></p><p>"A Beast Tamer!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō looked at the man departing with a hint of envy. If there was a profession template that was both powerful and stylish, with a relatively low entry barrier, comprehensive abilities, and convenience, it would be the Beast Tamer.</p><p></p><p>Beast Tamers could communicate with Star Realm creatures, taming them as battle pets to fight for them. They were highly sought after, making up 10% of the population.</p><p></p><p>The larger a profession, the greater the influence of its association. The two largest professional associations in the Asia-Pacific Community were the "Martial Arts Association" and the "Beast Tamer Association".</p><p></p><p>The Beast Tamer Association held an annual "Battle Pet Competition" that attracted audiences no less than major sports leagues, sometimes even more.</p><p></p><p>Countless games, movies, and books had been created around the Beast Tamer profession, forming a globally popular Beast Tamer culture over the years. The related industries, such as pet breeding, boarding, grooming, training, veterinary services, farms, pet food, and pet pageants, formed a massive market worth trillions.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō had once considered becoming a Beast Tamer, but gave up because he didn't particularly like raising pets.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the fortress, he observed the people around him.</p><p></p><p>Some were travel-worn, bearing the marks of battle, just returning from the Star Realm with spoils, heading to the shops along the street to sell them.</p><p></p><p>Others were fresh-faced, moving in groups, preparing to enter the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Jing Xinghuō saw representatives of over 90% of the 40-plus known professions on Earth, with only the rarest ones missing.</p><p></p><p>He even saw a "Crowd"! Or rather, not just one, but a group of them.</p><p></p><p>Four men with identical appearances walked down the street. Despite wearing different clothes, carrying different weapons, and having different hairstyles and disguises, their magnetic field signatures were completely the same in Jing Xinghuō's perception.</p><p></p><p>These four were actually the same person!</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō couldn't resist his curiosity and glanced at one of them.</p><p></p><p>The Crowd was one of the rarest professions on Earth. Currently, only 66 Crowds were known globally, fewer than even Magnetic Maniacs, with only "Star Realm Travelers" and "Fate Seers" being rarer.</p><p></p><p>The Crowd's core ability, "Clone Doppelganger", allowed them to create an exact copy of themselves, but at the cost of half their Star Force.</p><p></p><p>Each time the "Clone Doppelganger" ability was upgraded, the original and the clone could each create another clone, with the new clones also taking half the Star Force.</p><p></p><p>The clones possessed all the original's abilities, and their minds were synchronized. Whether in single combat or group battles, they had a huge advantage.</p><p></p><p>This "Crowd" had four clones, including the original, indicating their "Clone Doppelganger" was at the second level.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō averted his gaze before the other noticed.</p><p></p><p>"A Super Crowd!"</p><p></p><p>His magnetic field perception had identified the other's level, but since the Star Force was divided into four, each clone's strength was not as great as a similarly ranked Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>The Crowd's greatest advantage was in group combat. Other Anomalies had given them the rather amusing nickname of "Hooligan Gang".</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō made a mental note of the Crowd's appearance and continued on, passing through seven layers of walls before finally reaching the innermost part of the fortress.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vast and bright space opened up before him.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Gate!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō's gaze immediately fell upon the "gate" in the center of the hall. But it was not a door in the conventional sense.</p><p></p><p>The Star Gate was a sphere! About 30 meters in diameter, a perfect, smooth sphere, with no imperfections. It appeared black to the eye, but in fact had no color, simply not reflecting any light, like a black hole without gravity.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the black sphere were multi-layered circular platforms. People were constantly entering and exiting the platforms, approaching the Star Gate. The moment they touched the surface, they would disappear.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, others would emerge onto the platforms, as if appearing out of thin air on the other side.</p><p></p><p>There was no process, only instantaneous transit.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō watched curiously for half a minute, observing the Anomalies coming and going, as the people around him were accustomed to. He did not join the queue to enter the Star Gate yet, as he had something else to do first.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He looked at the travel-worn Ye Dongrun. She looked very capable, but there was a hint of fatigue deep in her eyes that was not easily discernible.</p><p></p><p>So he expressed concern, "Big Sister, you need to rest more and not overwork yourself to the point of exhaustion."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming also nodded, "Big Sister, don't push yourself too hard."</p><p></p><p>Ye Dongrun sat down and took a sip of water, sighing, "There's no help for it. The pressure on civil servants these days is getting greater and greater, the competition is no less fierce than elite competitions. If I don't do it, there are plenty of others willing to. If I slack off even a little, I'll quickly be eliminated."</p><p></p><p>"But you can't exhaust your body, it's not worth it," Liang Qiu Feiyan said with no small concern.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you all." Ye Dongrun ruffled her hair, "I'm planning to carve out an hour every day to pick up my fitness routine again."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо nodded, "That's good then."</p><p></p><p>He was about to say that exercise is always beneficial, but Ye Dongrun's next words were, "Once I've whipped myself back into shape, I'm going to really go at my colleagues, crush them!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough about me," Ye Dongrun clapped her hands, adopting a big sister demeanor. "Today is Xinghuо's birthday, and it's rare that we five have a chance to all gather together as adults, so let's enjoy ourselves!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she had the server bring out the dishes, bustling about like she used to.</p><p></p><p>One delicious dish after another was placed on the table, and drinks were opened.</p><p></p><p>"Fill everyone's glasses."</p><p></p><p>Ye Dongrun raised her glass, prompting the others seated around the table to stand up. She smiled and said, "First toast, we have to wish Xinghuо a happy birthday!"</p><p></p><p>"Happy birthday!"</p><p>"Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>The private room was filled with a warm, lively atmosphere. </p><p></p><p>The five siblings ate the delicious food, sharing interesting anecdotes and stories, laughing without end, momentarily forgetting all their troubles.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was in a very joyful mood, looking at them and thinking, these are my family. </p><p></p><p>True family!</p><p></p><p>Although they were half-siblings, they were no different from blood relatives, and they were legally related.</p><p></p><p>Because they were a public family.</p><p></p><p>In the mid-1960s of the last century, four countries signed the "Ivangrad Treaty", declaring the end of the "Fourth World War", and the global geopolitical landscape gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the powerful Asian-Pacific People's Union had been established for nearly 20 years. The domestic environment was peaceful, technology was advancing by leaps and bounds, and the people's lives were happy. But a problem gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the wealthy class or ordinary citizens, no one wanted to have children anymore.</p><p></p><p>This seemed to be humanity's self-curse.</p><p></p><p>From the industrialization that began centuries ago, no matter which country or race, the more developed and civilized they became, the more inevitably their birth rates declined.</p><p></p><p>And once this decline occurred, it was irreversible.</p><p></p><p>No matter what policies or measures the government implemented, the decline in birth rates could only be slowed, not reversed.</p><p></p><p>In 2033, the opening of the stargate temporarily solved this fertility problem. Global turmoil, humanity experienced over a century of extinction crisis and two world wars.</p><p></p><p>During wartime, the government's methods would naturally not be as gentle as in peacetime. To win the war, the first requirement was people.</p><p></p><p>Having a large population might not guarantee victory, but having a small population would definitely lead to defeat!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, governments of all countries mobilized resources, enacted compulsory laws, and used reproductive technologies to unleash a population explosion.</p><p></p><p>When humanity was in distress, they were willing to have children again.</p><p></p><p>They went through more than a century in this way.</p><p></p><p>After the war ended, governments around the world once again faced the problem of declining birth rates.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the difficulties of the early 21st century, the 22nd century already had means to solve it, and the biggest obstacle was no longer the birth process, but the ethical and moral controversies.</p><p></p><p>The answers given by countries around the world were not all the same.</p><p></p><p>In the early 1970s of the 22nd century, the Asian Union government proposed a very large and comprehensive "Continuation Plan" and listed it as one of the most important national policies, investing astronomical amounts of fiscal and material resources.</p><p></p><p>The Continuation Plan was divided into two parts.</p><p></p><p>The first part was "birth".</p><p></p><p>According to the country's policy needs and population changes, a certain number of infants were regularly and periodically cultivated using artificial uterus technology. </p><p></p><p>These infants were all legal citizens, with political rights completely equal to those born in normal families. They were called "public children". Public children were legally prohibited from seeking their biological parents, and even if they accidentally recognized them, they had no kinship relationship in the eyes of the law.</p><p></p><p>The second part was "nurturing".</p><p></p><p>Public children were raised by the government from birth, divided into four stages by age: 0-2 years old was the infant stage, 2-6 years old was the preschool stage, 6-12 years old was the childhood stage, and 12-18 years old was the adolescent stage.</p><p></p><p>Public children of the same age group, four to six of them, formed a public family.</p><p></p><p>In each stage of the public family, there were at least three or more "professional parents" responsible for both upbringing and education. This position was called "nurturing father" and "nurturing mother".</p><p></p><p>Nurturing fathers and mothers were professional guardians who had to pass multiple rounds of assessments to take on the role.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their salaries were extremely high. Even to this day, it remains one of the occupations with the best income and benefits, and they also have greater political rights and higher social status than ordinary citizens.</p><p></p><p>The younger the children, the more nurturing fathers and mothers the public family had. The infant stage had the most, generally one or two more than the number of infants. As the children grew up and became self-reliant, the public family would rotate in new nurturing parents for each stage, and the number of parents would gradually decrease to two.</p><p></p><p>By the time they reached the age of 18 and became adults...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The foster parents will resign from their jobs. At the same time, they will also lose their guardianship, and no longer have a kinship relationship with the public children.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure the physical and psychological health of the public children, they will be subjected to psychological checks almost every month, as well as high-frequency random inspections. Cameras with no dead angles have been installed in the homes to monitor the activities of the public families in an all-round way.</p><p></p><p>Unqualified foster parents will be immediately revoked of their qualifications, and those who have committed serious mistakes will be sent to court for heavy sentencing.</p><p></p><p>There are also a series of laws and regulations related to public families, taking into account all aspects.</p><p></p><p>The "Continuation Plan" was just a trial at first.</p><p></p><p>By the 1990s, the first batch of public children had taken up jobs, and they have made many contributions to society and the country, just like the children of the original families - they are all mentally normal and psychologically healthy citizens.</p><p></p><p>The Continuation Plan was a great success, and the investment over the years has paid off.</p><p></p><p>The Asian Community Government immediately expanded the scale of the plan, and by the 23rd century, the population problem was finally solved!</p><p></p><p>To this day, the population of the Asia-Pacific Community has reached 56 billion.</p><p></p><p>Among them, public children account for 20%, and the government adjusts the Continuation Plan according to fiscal and resource conditions, and the population is increasing every year.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо and his four siblings are all public children.</p><p></p><p>But he is slightly different.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо was not born from an artificial uterus, but was naturally delivered, only his parents lost their guardianship and handed him over to the government to raise.</p><p></p><p>There are quite a few people like Qi Xinghuо.</p><p></p><p>In the 1990s, the success of the Continuation Plan relieved the Asian Community Government, but it also caused a negative result - more people were unwilling to have children.</p><p></p><p>There is another factor.</p><p></p><p>The Asia-Pacific Community had legislated to prohibit abortion from the beginning of its establishment, and couples must pass an exam on how to become qualified parents in order to obtain "guardianship". These two contradictory laws are also one of the important reasons for the declining birth rate.</p><p></p><p>So many parents who had unexpected pregnancies but failed the exam were deprived of their guardianship.</p><p></p><p>There are also some couples who voluntarily gave up their guardianship and abandoned their children to the government.</p><p></p><p>Colloquially known as "managing birth but not raising".</p><p></p><p>These children who have left their original families are all included in the Continuation Plan, and are also public children, generally referred to as "foster children".</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо is such a foster child, and he only found out about it when he was 18 years old.</p><p></p><p>The law stipulates that foster children can have the opportunity to contact their biological parents after they turn 22 and graduate from university, when their psychological conditions are mature enough. With the consent of both parties, the legal kinship can be re-established and they can return to their original families.</p><p></p><p>So this birthday is of great significance to Qi Xinghuо. He is about to face a major turning point in his life.</p><p></p><p>His siblings also know this, and today they have all put aside their other matters and gathered together to celebrate Qi Xinghuо's birthday and accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо received blessings from close classmates and friends.</p><p></p><p>The birthday party was halfway through when the former foster parents also called in for a video chat - the ones from his teenage years, childhood, and early childhood, as many as seven or eight, all of whom had once cared for and educated this public family. They were very happy to see the five siblings and gave Qi Xinghuо birthday blessings.</p><p></p><p>Only the foster parents from his teenage years knew that Qi Xinghuо was a foster child. After leaving this family, they had separately entered another public family and taken on new responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Professional parents are very busy with their work and have little rest time. They also have their own families and children.</p><p></p><p>In the past few years of university, Qi Xinghuо has only met with his foster parents two or three times, and although they occasionally stay in touch, as his mind matures, his feelings for them have inevitably faded a bit. Generally, if there is anything, he discusses it with his siblings.</p><p></p><p>At 10 o'clock in the evening, the restaurant brought in a bowl of longevity noodles and a large cake. The siblings sang a birthday song for Qi Xinghuо and then lit the candles on the cake.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, make a wish quickly!" Liang Qiu Feiyan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо stood among the people and smiled, "I've been wishing every year, but I've never seen it come true. I'll skip it this year."</p><p></p><p>"How can that be!" Liang Qiu Feiyan aimed the floating camera at Qi Xinghuо. "This is a tradition of hundreds of years, you have to eat longevity noodles and cake, and make a wish on your birthday. Especially on such an important day today, you have to take it seriously. Who knows, maybe this time it will come true?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Dongyin also smiled and said, "Xinghuо, just do as Feiyan says, don't delay."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо could only agree.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zizheng turned off the lights in the private room, and the whole room suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming said, "Make a wish."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо stood in front of the cake, and even in the darkness he could see clearly. His gaze swept across the faces of his siblings, and then fell on the glass window outside.</p><p></p><p>The Weiyang Building towered into the clouds. At this moment, looking outward, the world was divided into two parts - below was the dazzling lights and towering skyscrapers of the super metropolis; looking up, a brilliant Milky Way hung in the night sky, with countless stars dotting the heavens, dazzling and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xinghuо closed his eyes and thought, "I wish my family to be safe, healthy, and happy, and that they can all achieve their dreams in their careers; I wish I can scale the heights of life's evolution, experience the grand waves of the Milky Way, and enjoy the extraordinary scenery of the starry realm, so that this life will not be in vain!"</p><p></p><p>After the wish, he gently blew out the candles.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

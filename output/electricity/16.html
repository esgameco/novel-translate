        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo looked up at the sky, less than a minute after he had called the police.</p><p></p><p>The figure was falling at an extremely fast speed, the aerial combat aircraft was about 600 meters above the ground, and it was like a meteor that approached the ground in five or six seconds.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo felt a strong downward airflow, as well as a mountain-like oppressive force!</p><p></p><p>Just as the figure was about to touch the ground, it suddenly slowed down, and in the blink of an eye, it changed from heavy to light, floating down to the ground like a falling leaf.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer kept a distance of a few meters from Jixing Huo. He was very burly, over 1.8 meters tall, his entire body wrapped in a layer of dazzling golden energy. Behind his head were four light rings arranged in a concentric circle structure, the whole person shining with a golden light, as if he was wearing a golden battle armor.</p><p></p><p>He looked around the scene, then observed Jixing Huo.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who called the police?"</p><p></p><p>The golden light on the man's body immediately receded, revealing his true appearance.</p><p></p><p>He looked very young, probably not much older than Jixing Huo, wearing a well-fitted casual training outfit. His appearance was rather ordinary, but he had an air of heroism. He wore a single-lens glasses on his left eye, a transparent square lens fixed in front of his left eye, with communication, internet and scanning functions.</p><p></p><p>However, the most eye-catching feature was his bald head - not a single hair!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it was me." Jixing Huo nodded in response, spreading his hands to show he was not a threat.</p><p></p><p>But his eyes couldn't help but scan the other's bald head, the light rings, the battle armor, the bare hands, the bald head... These characteristics all clearly indicated that this person was a Halo Warrior, an extremely unique profession.</p><p></p><p>Halo Warriors were extremely powerful, with comprehensive abilities and unlimited potential. They only needed four, or even as few as three, special abilities to form the template, with no weaknesses in strength, defense, speed, or recovery, and their explosive power was terrifying, making them one of the most coveted professions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Halo Warriors also had some flaws.</p><p></p><p>Like baldness!</p><p></p><p>The core ability of a Halo Warrior was "light energy", a super-limit ability that converted all stellar force into a unique energy, i.e., light energy. Light energy was extremely powerful and formidable, but it had a negative effect - it would cause the Halo Warrior's pores to close, forming a closed circulatory system in the body, and not only the head hair, but all the body hair would fall out.</p><p></p><p>Both men and women were affected in this way. This feature was one of the best ways to identify a Halo Warrior, and they were mockingly called "bald guys", although most Halo Warriors hated this nickname. Baldness was their eternal pain, gradually becoming a taboo.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jixing Huo noticed that the other person not only had no hair, but his eyebrows were also drawn on... He almost couldn't hold back a smile.</p><p></p><p>Halo Warriors were very strong, and this one was a super-powered individual, but he was also so pitiful. Was this the price of becoming stronger? Jixing Huo quickly averted his gaze, fortunately the other person didn't notice his subtle expression, and was now examining the corpse on the ground, then turning his attention to Jixing Huo, his eyes falling on the composite bow in his hand, revealing a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Did you kill him?" the Halo Warrior asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Jixing Huo answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>He had legitimately killed a suspected Class A wanted criminal, and there was nothing to hide, nor could he hide it. There were surveillance cameras all over the street, and they had already captured the footage. In the sky, there were thousands of satellites constantly monitoring the entire Chang'an city, unless it was indoors or underground, even at night, there would be recordings.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!" The Halo Warrior looked at Jixing Huo again, disbelief written all over his face. "You're a junior Esper, and you've only just become an Esper, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo didn't explain further, as the surveillance footage would reveal everything.</p><p></p><p>The aerial combat aircraft descended, and five more people came down - three men and two women, aged between 25 and 50, each wearing black combat light armor, with a distinctive emblem on their shoulders: four different colored swords (gray, white, red, gold) arranged in a fan shape with the tips pointing upwards.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this emblem, Jixing Huo was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Agency!"</p><p></p><p>These people were not from the Special Guard Force of the Public Security Bureau, but from the Sword Agency, the so-called "National Security Intelligence Bureau", responsible for counterintelligence and intelligence investigations, reporting directly to the Vice President. Its level was the same as the Public Security Bureau, but its reputation was far superior, being a powerful institution known worldwide.</p><p></p><p>How could a wanted criminal attract the attention of the Sword Agency?</p><p></p><p>Jixing Huo looked at these five Sword Agents and found that they were all powerful high-level Espers, with different profession templates but able to form a coordinated team, surrounding him and the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Captain," one of the Sword Agents called out.</p><p></p><p>The Halo Warrior was about to speak when over a dozen magnetic suspension police cars came rushing in, and a large group of combat-equipped Espers in battle uniforms poured out, wielding various weapons and shields, quickly sealing off the scene and half the street.</p><p></p><p>These were the real Special Guard Force.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a woman, over 1.9 meters tall, with short shoulder-length hair, heroic and imposing, with a faint silvery-gray glow on her skin. The insignia on her shoulder was an iron shield, and as she approached, she seemed like a heavy statue.</p><p></p><p>An Iron Guard! Jixing Huo thought, and a rare female Iron Guard at that.</p><p></p><p>"Mingchongwu, what's the situation now?" The Iron Guard woman clearly recognized the Halo Warrior, directly calling out his name.</p><p></p><p>"Song Fei." Mingchongwu shook his head, "We're all too late."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the corpse on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?" Song Fei examined the body, only then noticing Jixing Huo next to it, quickly guessing the course of events, but her reaction was the same as Mingchongwu's - her eyes widened, and she said sternly, "You killed Jizongbang? What are you playing at?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha!" Season Xinghuos shrugged, knowing that no one would believe him in this situation.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?" Songfei asked.</p><p>"Season Xinghuos," he replied.</p><p></p><p>Songfei was about to gesture to a police officer to check Season Xinghuos' identity, but when she heard his name, her movement paused.</p><p></p><p>Not just her, the expressions of everyone present slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Season' in your name, as in the seasons?" Songfei's momentum had subsided, and she even had a somewhat cautious demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Season Xinghuos nodded.</p><p></p><p>He knew why others would react this way, as it often happened to him.</p><p></p><p>It was because of his surname "Season".</p><p></p><p>This was not a very common surname, but it was deeply imprinted in the minds of all people on Earth. Whenever this surname was mentioned, everyone would think of one person.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the Asia-Pacific Community, the head of state, the spiritual leader of all the people in the Asia-Pacific region and billions of people worldwide, the greatest "hacker of the mind" in history, one of the greatest humans of the contemporary era - President Season Daosheng!</p><p></p><p>Even if one was only sharing the same surname without any actual relation, it would still make one feel honored.</p><p></p><p>This showed the high prestige President Season held in people's hearts!</p><p></p><p>"I was randomly assigned this surname," Season Xinghuos proactively explained, a sentence he had said hundreds of times since childhood.</p><p></p><p>The public child-rearing system had a naming system that randomly generated several names, from which the foster parents would choose the one with the best meaning.</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"You're so lucky," Minchongwu muttered enviously. He was also a public child, but he hadn't been randomly assigned that surname.</p><p></p><p>He saw Songfei approaching the body, and his figure flashed as he blocked her path. "Songfei, the Jisong Bao case has been taken over by the Sword Agency."</p><p></p><p>Songfei's face darkened. "It was my people who first received the report and investigated him, even sacrificing three of them."</p><p></p><p>"So what?" Minchongwu stood his ground. "Jisong Bao is a spy from an enemy country, involving national security, and the Public Security Bureau has no business interfering."  His tone softened, "The sacrifices of your people will, of course, be properly compensated and commended."</p><p></p><p>Songfei stared at Minchongwu without saying a word, and the scene became tense.</p><p></p><p>Season Xinghuos heard the key information from their conversation and was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"This wanted criminal is actually a spy!" </p><p></p><p>If he were just a regular wanted criminal, even if Season Xinghuos killed him in self-defense, there might still be some trouble, such as unsolved cases associated with the criminal or him being an important witness to a larger case.</p><p></p><p>But if he killed a spy, there would be no problem at all. And there would even be an extra benefit! Killing an enemy spy would be a great merit. No wonder these two groups were fighting over it.</p><p></p><p>Season Xinghuos watched the scene unfold.</p><p></p><p>The Public Security Bureau's Special Guard Corps had a very broad scope of responsibilities, being a specially established armed force tasked with protecting public safety, counter-terrorism, and apprehending criminal espers - tasks that ordinary police could not handle. </p><p></p><p>Because the Special Guard Corps' emblem was an iron shield, they were colloquially known as the "Shield Guards".</p><p></p><p>One was the Sword, the other was the Shield.</p><p></p><p>Their conflicting titles already revealed the tension between them.</p><p></p><p>Although one was focused externally and the other internally, they still overlapped in certain jurisdictions, sometimes being comrades-in-arms, and sometimes fierce competitors.</p><p></p><p>"Jisong Bao is involved in something big, your Public Security Bureau can't handle it," Minchongwu said in a low voice. "Even if you take the body, the evidence, and the witnesses now, in the end, you'll have to hand them over to the Sword Agency. Maybe your branch will even get disciplined because of this."</p><p></p><p>Songfei's expression changed, but she still felt reluctant.</p><p></p><p>"Consider this a personal favor to you." Minchongwu suddenly softened. "Since we've been friends for many years."</p><p></p><p>Songfei stared at him for a few seconds, then finally retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Withdraw."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, she led most of the Special Guard Corps away, leaving only a few people to continue guarding the scene.</p><p></p><p>Minchongwu relaxed, ordering, "Collect the physical evidence and data from the scene, leave a record, and take the body away."</p><p></p><p>The Swords quickly sprang into action.</p><p></p><p>Minchongwu's bald head turned to look at Season Xinghuos, and he suddenly said, "Mr. Season, I know you picked up an item, hand it over."</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Season Xinghuos hesitated for a moment, but still handed the alien artifact to the other party.</p><p></p><p>In fact, ever since he realized this was a "Rotating Magnetic Field" artifact, Season Xinghuos had been thinking about how to keep it.</p><p></p><p>Normally, this would be almost impossible, as the entire scene would have been recorded, and his act of picking up the artifact could not have been missed.</p><p></p><p>The artifact came from the body of the wanted criminal, so it was physical evidence. How could he possibly keep it for himself?</p><p></p><p>But since the wanted criminal was a spy, it was different!</p><p></p><p>"Rotating Magnetic Field!" </p><p></p><p>Minchongwu took the artifact and, after observing it for a few seconds, finally recognized it. His eyes widened, and he unconsciously scratched his bald head.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Swords, hearing his words, were all drawn to the artifact, their eyes shining with excitement. The esper ability "Rotating Magnetic Field" was the most powerful, rarest, and most valuable esper ability, perhaps unparalleled!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Season Xinghuos solemnly asked, "Officer, does the 'spoils of war principle' also apply to killing an enemy spy?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Swords all had a change of expression.</p><p></p><p>Minchongwu also paused for a moment, but ultimately nodded, "Of course it applies."</p><p></p><p>He understood what Season Xinghuos meant, and a gloating expression suddenly appeared on his face. "You've hit the jackpot this time, but some people have really lost out. Mr. Season, from now on, you'll need to be more careful with your words and actions. That's all I'll say."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

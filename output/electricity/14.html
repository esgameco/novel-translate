        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>In a barbecue restaurant not far from the Qishan Wutong Archery Hall, Jixingfire and Luyunhai raised their beer glasses and clinked them together, draining the contents in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so happy!"</p><p></p><p>"Xingfire, you've won this championship, you've really brought honor to us!"</p><p></p><p>Luyunhai put his arm around Jixingfire's shoulder. His face was already flushed red from drinking, but his mind was still clear, his voice just unconsciously getting louder.</p><p></p><p>"On the way back from Termination South Mountain just now, the other coaches at the archery hall were looking at me differently."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Fang also asked about you."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning Fangying, Luyunhai suddenly let out a laugh and continued, "Being able to train a student like you is the best proof of my coaching abilities. Although I didn't teach you for long, it was all your own talent and practice, but they don't know that, haha..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't tell anyone." Jixingfire joked.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if you do." Luyunhai shook his head and grinned smugly, "After all, the past few weeks at the hall, everyone saw me teaching you archery."</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire smiled and glanced at the trophy on the table.</p><p></p><p>The trophy itself wasn't worth much.</p><p></p><p>But the championship it represented carried a lot of weight. As soon as the competition ended, the 200,000 champion's prize money had already been deposited into his account.</p><p></p><p>After taxes, there was over 180,000 left!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had earned so much money, and it had instantly multiplied his savings several times over. This sense of achievement was very satisfying, filling his heart with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Another round." Jixingfire refilled his glass.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" </p><p></p><p>Luyunhai drained it in one gulp and asked, "Xingfire, what are your plans next?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing for now." Jixingfire shook his head. As a junior Anomaly, his strength was still very weak, and the most important thing now was to improve his abilities.</p><p></p><p>After three weeks of cultivation, his Spirit Force value had reached 56, and the progress of his Thousand Nimble Hands had increased to 10/47.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of being able to see each step of progress made every day's cultivation full of drive.</p><p></p><p>As long as he followed the steps, his strength would improve.</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire felt like he was just like his fifth brother Wang Zizhen, immersed in a virtual game called "Reality", thinking about grinding experience all day long, wishing there were 48 hours in a day, with only one goal: to level up!</p><p></p><p>But Luyunhai was a bit disappointed. "Don't you want to participate in more archery competitions and win more championship prize money?"</p><p></p><p>"There's another amateur-level competition next week, the champion's prize is not as much as the 'Leaf Shooting Cup', but it's still around 100,000. You'll definitely be able to win it if you go." </p><p></p><p>"And then there's one in the middle of next month..."</p><p></p><p>He casually mentioned a few competitions of different levels, the prizes ranging from a few thousand to tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He had originally also had this idea, to earn money through archery competitions.</p><p></p><p>But today's situation made him hesitate. The "Leaf Shooting Cup", although only a semi-professional competition and not on a large scale, was organized by people with impressive backgrounds. Several of the archery hall directors were super Anomalies, especially Yang Tianqing.</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire sensed that Yang Tianqing was very focused on him, not the kind of attention given to a champion, but an observation tinged with other emotions or motives! He had become a little too high-profile.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to participate in other competitions and frequently win one championship after another, the attention he would attract would not be limited to just Yang Tianqing.</p><p></p><p>"I won't participate in any competitions for now." Jixingfire made his decision.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" </p><p></p><p>Luyunhai was utterly perplexed, unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>In his view, these championship prizes were all Jixingfire's for the taking, legitimate and legal, and participating in the competitions wouldn't take up much time, so why not take the free money?</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack money at the moment." Jixingfire thought for a moment and revealed some of the truth, "My birth father gave me a sum of money, one hundred million."</p><p></p><p>"One hundred million!" </p><p></p><p>Luyunhai was dumbfounded, almost shouting out loud. "You're not lying to me, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Once he confirmed that Jixingfire was telling the truth, his face was already full of envy. He couldn't help but complain, "I'm not a public child, and I used to think I was quite fortunate. Now I feel like you're having a much better time than me. My dad can't even come up with a million, he just plays games all day and doesn't work."</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire was aware of Luyunhai's family situation.</p><p></p><p>He was moved, and asked, "How much have you saved up now?"</p><p></p><p>"850,000."</p><p></p><p>"That much?" Jixingfire was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>The archery hall coaches had a monthly salary of just over 10,000, and Luyunhai had been working part-time since college, so Jixingfire thought he would have at most two or three hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Luyunhai had a self-satisfied look on his face. "I'm a senior coach, and my performance has always been among the top at the archery hall. I also have some extra income, and I can save two or three thousand every month."</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire couldn't help but look at him with new respect.</p><p></p><p>"You're asking about my savings, could it be that you want to borrow money from me?" Luyunhai's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Jixingfire smiled, "You can start preparing for your second Anomaly fusion. In a few days, I'll transfer 700,000 to you."</p><p></p><p>Luyunhai had always wanted to become a "Hunter", and the core ability of this profession template was "Eagle Eye", with a market price of around 1.5 million Aya.</p><p></p><p>He had tried once during college, but failed.</p><p></p><p>The second Anomaly fusion would require more preparation, the process would be more arduous, and the success rate would only be half of the first time.</p><p></p><p>But Luyunhai hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"If I fail again, I might not be able to pay you back for a few years." He thought about the possibility of failure.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The consequences of the failed fusion made him anxious.</p><p></p><p>If the fusion with a different species failed, although it would not endanger his life, it would take several months to a year to recover.</p><p></p><p>The more failures, the longer the recovery period.</p><p></p><p>If Luo Yunhai failed the second time, he would not be able to work for at least a year, and he might even lose his job as a coach at the archery hall.</p><p></p><p>"You will definitely succeed!" </p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire encouraged him, "You don't have to worry about paying back the money, at most I'll just participate in a few archery competitions to earn it back."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" </p><p></p><p>Luo Yunhai took a deep breath, "I won't say too much in thanks, this cup, I'll drink to you!"</p><p></p><p>He picked up the full cup of wine and drank it all in one gulp. </p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire also finished his cup, and they chatted a bit more about fusing with different species. After eating and drinking their fill, they parted ways and headed home.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the power shoes, Jixing Fire sped along the path, the wind in his face helping to sober him up a bit from the alcohol.</p><p></p><p>Beep beep...</p><p></p><p>His phone suddenly vibrated.</p><p></p><p>He didn't check it, but it rang again a few seconds later.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire took out his phone while gliding and took a look, it was a safety alert.</p><p></p><p>"Citizens who have received this message, please pay attention. There is a Class A wanted criminal on the loose in your area. Please take shelter nearby, and if at home, do not leave. If you discover any suspicious traces or encounter danger, flee immediately and call the police!" The message included a photo of a face.</p><p></p><p>Several identical messages kept refreshing on the screen, making Jixing Fire's heart race.</p><p></p><p>A Class A wanted criminal! In the Asia-Pacific Community, for a person to be designated as a Class A wanted criminal by the security department, there are generally only two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One is that they have committed a terrible, heinous crime, their hands stained with blood.</p><p></p><p>The other is that the wanted criminal's abilities are extremely powerful, at least an advanced異人, or even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Or, they possess both.</p><p></p><p>The range of this alert was about 5 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Jixing Fire had received such a warning, and he was startled, then instinctively looked around.</p><p></p><p>Since it was quite late, there weren't many people around. Everyone who received the alert message hurried home or took shelter in nearby stores.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire also increased the speed of his power shoes to the maximum.</p><p></p><p>Rushing along alertly, he soon reached the street opposite his apartment building and could see the floor his apartment was on.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the street and going around to the main entrance of the building, Jixing Fire went inside.</p><p></p><p>As he entered, he kept observing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>His gaze suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the main entrance, about 100 meters away, under the shadow of a superconducting highway bridge pier where the streetlight didn't reach, there seemed to be a person standing motionless, like a statue.</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire's right pupil flashed with a light ring, and he could see clearly now.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a person!</p><p></p><p>A blond-haired, black-eyed man in his thirties, with rather prominent features, likely a mix of Asian and Western descent, exactly the Class A wanted criminal in the alert message! He was wearing a suit, but it was torn in multiple places and stained with blood.</p><p></p><p>The man blended into the shadows, and the passersby were completely unaware of his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Shadow Blade!"</p><p></p><p>"A high-level 'Shadow Escape', but he's been seen by me!"</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire recognized the man's profession and ability, and at that moment, the man also looked over at him.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire's heart sank, the alcohol effects completely gone, but he didn't stop walking, entering the building, disappearing from the wanted criminal's line of sight. He saw the shock in the man's eyes, quickly replaced by barely concealed, intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"He's going to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>An extremely dangerous sensation exploded in his mind, like a needle piercing him, his spirit suffocating as if drowning, his life on the verge of death!</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire's right pupil lit up with a faint glow, the light ring becoming very clear.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Phenomenon Star Eyes seemed to have been fully activated.</p><p></p><p>In his field of vision, illusory streams of light appeared, complex yet distinct, unfolding in a way he couldn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire's brain instantly received a flood of information.</p><p></p><p>He instantly understood everything.</p><p></p><p>This was the future!</p><p></p><p>Jixing Fire saw what would happen in the next few seconds - the Shadow Blade would emerge from the shadows, rushing towards him, a sharp, ghostly light in his hand, slicing the air as he passed.</p><p></p><p>"There's no escape."</p><p></p><p>"I only have one chance to live - kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, Jixing Fire became remarkably calm, his thoughts as clear and resolute as ice, without a trace of any other emotion.</p><p></p><p>He didn't consider the consequences of failing to counterattack, and immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>He took off the bow pack on his back and opened it.</p><p></p><p>His left hand grasped the compound hunting bow, while his right hand grabbed three arrows, one nocked on the bowstring, the other two clutched in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Under the strange state of the Myriad Phenomenon Star Eyes, Jixing Fire's Thousand Nimble Hands had also become faster. He completed all these preparations in less than a second.</p><p></p><p>He drew the bow, the arrow nocked and the string pulled taut, unhesitatingly taking a step towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Shadow Blade appeared in his line of sight again.</p><p></p><p>The man had also seen Jixing Fire.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

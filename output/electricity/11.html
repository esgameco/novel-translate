        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Clap, clap, clap..."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan took the lead in clapping, and the brothers and sisters cheered for Jing Xinghuos. The floating camera around them recorded this moment.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos cut the cake and shared it with everyone to eat together.</p><p></p><p>The usually silent Wang Zizheng suddenly asked, "Third brother, if your biological parents want to take you back home, will you agree?"</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p></p><p>For adopted children to return to their original families, they have to give up the kinship with their adoptive families, which means leaving this home.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was a question that had long been buried in their hearts, but no one had asked it before.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>But Jing Xinghuos did not hesitate at all, and firmly replied, "No."</p><p></p><p>"That's great!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qiu Fei Yan immediately cheered excitedly. She was the one who would miss Jing Xinghuos the most, and she would be very sad if any of her siblings left.</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Ye Dongyin was also very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true, big sister." Jing Xinghuos looked very serious.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had been hesitating for a long time, considering all the possibilities, until a few hours before the birthday party when he confirmed the final answer in the apartment.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming smiled and said, "What if they had to give you up at the time, and it was not their own choice, and now they really want to make amends? If your biological parents are big shots, with high status and power, or are on the list of the richest, won't you consider it?"</p><p></p><p>This situation is not non-existent, it's just extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>There was once a case where an adopted child learned that his biological parents were billionaires, and he unhesitatingly left the adoptive family to become a second-generation rich.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what the situation is, I will not go back." Jing Xinghuos said firmly, "We are a family forever!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Ming nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Dongyin, Liang Qiu Fei Yan, and Wang Zizheng all came over and hugged Jing Xinghuos one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, here." </p><p></p><p>Wang Zizheng took out the virtual glasses he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos sat down on the sofa in the private room and put on the glasses, while the others waited quietly by his side.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos lightly tapped on the frame of the virtual glasses.</p><p></p><p>"Beep!"</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him changed, connecting to the wireless network, and a login interface appeared in his field of vision, while his mind felt a slight tremor, sensing that his thoughts were connected to the system.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos entered his account and password.</p><p></p><p>This account and password are universal across the entire Internet, bound to his real identity, and unique. Within the Asia-Pacific Community, one must have a legal identity account to access the Internet. No matter which platform, website or social media, this identity account can be used to log in directly.</p><p></p><p>He opened the official website of the Citizen Affairs Department, logged in, and immediately received a notification that he had an important message.</p><p></p><p>The flashing information icon was a bit dazzling in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos paused for a few seconds, but ultimately decided to open it.</p><p></p><p>"Citizen Jing Xinghuos, there is a document regarding your birth information and guardianship that has reached the declassification period. Please review it."</p><p></p><p>Opening the document, there was a list of files.</p><p></p><p>The first one was the birth certificate.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Jing Xinghuos had seen his own birth certificate, dated July 23, 2201, at a maternity hospital in Haixia City, with his former name "Xin Ye".</p><p></p><p>"Haixia City... So I was born there?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos continued reading. The most important information on the birth certificate was the parents' names - father "Xia Qingyu" and mother "Xin Yimo", born in 2159 and 2178 respectively.</p><p></p><p>"An age difference of 19 years."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos immediately had a bad feeling about this.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the birth certificate stated that the two were not married, and Xin Yimo was an unmarried mother who had an accidental pregnancy at the age of 23.</p><p></p><p>There was a photo of them in the file.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingyu did not look like he was already 42 years old at the time, his appearance was similar to a man in his 30s, very handsome, with a confident and spirited look. Xin Yimo was leaning against him, dressed like a young girl, very beautiful, and her eyes were full of admiration for the man beside her.</p><p></p><p>The two were closely embracing each other, a perfect match.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos looked at the man in the photo, who resembled him by about 70%, and let out a complex sigh, unable to express what he was feeling.</p><p></p><p>The document also contained two declarations.</p><p></p><p>They were from the biological parents of the baby, with consistent content - voluntarily giving up the guardianship of the newborn and handing him over to the government for upbringing, with their electronic signatures attached.</p><p></p><p>As expected, this was a typical story.</p><p></p><p>The man was a powerful superhuman, with an outstanding appearance, and was most likely very wealthy, and knew how to please women, charming the beautiful young college student until she was completely infatuated, and ended up accidentally getting her pregnant.</p><p></p><p>And that life was him!</p><p></p><p>"Heh..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos smiled bitterly in his heart, not surprised by this result at all.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most adopted children are in similar situations, either accidental pregnancies or broken marriages, and only a few are cases where the parents are unfit or unwilling to be parents and simply abandon the child to the government.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the circumstances, the nature of "abandonment" remains the same.</p><p></p><p>"It's better this way."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuos opened the last two files, which were two emails forwarded by the Citizen Affairs Department, from Xia Qingyu and Xin Yimo.</p><p></p><p>This meant that they were still alive, at least no accidents had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Generally, if parents want to regain custody of their adopted children, they would write contact information in this email as the first step to rebuilding the family relationship.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they don't want to reconcile, they don't need to write anything.</p><p></p><p>"They actually both sent me emails..." Jing Xinghuos was a bit surprised, and opened Xia Qingyu's email, only to find it was empty, with not a single word.</p><p></p><p>There was no contact information.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The page did not contain any images or video content. </p><p></p><p>At the very bottom, there was a pending transfer payment from a trust fund in Chang'an, amounting to 10 million Aya dollars!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо's eyes widened as he counted it again to confirm - it was indeed 10 million.</p><p></p><p>This kind of fund is truly a "click-to-receive" deal! Since it's a gift from his biological parents, there is no need to pay taxes, and after receiving it, he won't have any responsibilities, nor does it mean he needs to rebuild a relationship with them.</p><p></p><p>In short, it's a free gift.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо is usually calm, but faced with this situation, his heart couldn't help but beat a little faster.</p><p></p><p>He checked the accompanying information of the transfer again, and it was from 12 years ago, when he was only 10 years old.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingyu's intention was very clear - he didn't want to take on the responsibility of being a father, but he also didn't want to completely abandon him. This 10 million is his compensation for the child. By taking this money, it means they are even, and Jixinghuо shouldn't seek him out in the future.</p><p></p><p>"This person has some principles."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо could guess Xia Qingyu's character. </p><p></p><p>Pursuing power, enjoying life along the way in the path of life evolution, not rejecting wealth, women, and status, but absolutely cannot affect his own cultivation and ascension to become a more powerful Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>When trouble arises, he shakes it off, and if he can't shake it off, he immediately flees. </p><p></p><p>Later, he feels guilty in his heart and tries to make amends within his ability, so that his conscience can be at ease.</p><p></p><p>There are many such Extraordinaries, countless in number.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qingyu's strength should be quite impressive, at least an advanced Extraordinary, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to put up 10 million in the trust fund over a decade ago."</p><p></p><p>"He should be even stronger now."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо thought about it and jumped to the web page to search for information about Xia Qingyu, but the result was fruitless.</p><p></p><p>The Aya government's protection of personal privacy is very thorough. Unless one is a public figure or has publicly shared their information online, ordinary people can't possibly find others' information. This requires very high-level authority.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо didn't have that authority, so he couldn't find anything.</p><p></p><p>He didn't immediately withdraw the 10 million Aya dollars, as the transfer period was 20 years, so he could withdraw it later. Then he opened the email from Xin Yimo, which was sent last month.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that caught his eye was a long letter, several thousand words long.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо patiently read through it.</p><p></p><p>In the letter, she introduced herself - she's from Haixia City in Southeast Province, currently married with a son and a daughter. She and her husband run an entertainment media company, which is quite sizable with hundreds of employees. The company has a decent reputation in the industry, with an estimated value of over 1 billion, and they are planning to go public. Her husband's family also has significant influence in Haixia City.</p><p></p><p>Attached were introductions to the company, dozens of photos of the company, their luxurious mansion, and their daily life, showcasing her economic strength.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was a video.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо hesitated for a moment, but still opened the video. A woman in her 30s appeared on the screen, in a luxuriously decorated living room. From the background, it was clear that this was a high-floor apartment with a sea view.</p><p></p><p>She didn't look much different from the archive photos, just more refined and mature in her appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Ye, please forgive me..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Yimo expressed deep sorrow and regret as she told Jixinghuо about the events of the past.</p><p></p><p>She met Xia Qingyu when she had just graduated from university and came to Chang'an to make her way. She was deceived by his sweet talk and they dated for a few months, during which she unexpectedly got pregnant. She wanted to marry him and have the child, but when Xia Qingyu found out, he disappeared overnight and was never to be seen again.</p><p></p><p>Panicked, she could only return home to give birth. During that time, she tried to contact Xia Qingyu repeatedly but received no response.</p><p></p><p>"I was still young then, without any experience in raising a child."</p><p></p><p>"And I was so angry, almost going crazy, constantly trying to find that scumbag Xia Qingyu, hoping he would at least have a conscience and come back."</p><p></p><p>"By the time you were born, I realized I didn't have legal guardianship."</p><p></p><p>"While taking care of you, I was also getting the certificate. Life was a mess, and my mental state was very poor. I was afraid I couldn't provide you with a good living environment, so..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xin Yimo's face was filled with regret, and tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The video then cut to a different scene.</p><p></p><p>She had regained her composure and had a happy expression as she continued, "I remember your birthday every year. When you turned 18, I learned that you were doing well, and I've been so proud of you."</p><p></p><p>"A few years ago, I started preparing to bring you back home. My husband also supports this. He promised me that he will treat you as his own child. Your younger brother and sister also really want a big brother."</p><p></p><p>"Son, if you come back, your mother will give you the best conditions."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what you want to do, whether it's becoming an Extraordinary, pursuing further studies, or starting a business, I will fully support you."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you can also inherit our family business."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Ye, please come back!"</p><p></p><p>After watching the video, Jixinghuо found that he wasn't as calm as he had imagined. His emotions were in turmoil, and it took him a few minutes to settle down.</p><p></p><p>Xin Yimo's feelings were genuine, and while there might be exaggerations or inaccuracies regarding Xia Qingyu, she truly wanted to reconcile the mother-son relationship.</p><p></p><p>However, Jixinghuо shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the content of the letter and the video, he detected some details. When Xin Yimo mentioned her husband and family, she didn't seem as confident as she described.</p><p></p><p>At least in this matter, she couldn't make the decision entirely on her own, and there must be conflicts.</p><p></p><p>The so-called company and billion-dollar family business might be attractive to others, but for him, it's not worth spending time and effort to fight for, as it would only end up in a mess. It's better to just focus on his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>With the Myriad Stellar Eyes, anything is possible! After some consideration,</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо looked at the contact information in the email, but ultimately decided not to reach out. If he didn't initiate contact, Xin Yimo wouldn't be able to find him, and might not even know his current name.</p><p></p><p>"I won't disturb your family and life anymore. I wish you all the best."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо closed the document, took off the virtual glasses, and saw the siblings surrounding him, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

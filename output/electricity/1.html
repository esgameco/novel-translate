        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous, earth-shattering explosion. In the sky, a ball of fiery red brighter than the sun suddenly appeared. The shockwave from the explosion swept across thousands of square kilometers, with raging flames, strong winds, earthquakes, and swirling dust, toppling countless trees, as if it were the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō suddenly woke up, sitting upright in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks of the massive explosion lingered in his mind, the rumbling never-ending, leaving his gaze filled with confusion and trepidation, only gradually recovering his calm a few minutes later.</p><p></p><p>"Another nightmare, damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō cursed under his breath, shaking his head helplessly as he glanced at the luminous clock by the bedside - 1 a.m.</p><p></p><p>For the past week, he had been having the same nightmare every night. In the dream, his perspective was fixed, starting from outer space, like a meteor plunging rapidly into the Earth's atmosphere, finally exploding over a vast forest.</p><p></p><p>Each time the explosion occurred in the dream, Jixinghuō would be jolted awake, feeling as if his own brain had truly exploded.</p><p></p><p>And the culprit behind all this...</p><p></p><p>"Turn on the light."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō murmured, and the bedroom gradually grew brighter.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for his eyes to adjust to the light, Jixinghuō rolled out of bed and unsteadily walked into the bathroom, seeing his own reflection in the mirror - haggard and exhausted, with a few prominent bloodshot veins in the corners of his eyes, his mental state in a very poor condition.</p><p></p><p>After a week of poor sleep, anyone would be listless and dispirited.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to resolve this."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō muttered as he opened the cabinet behind the mirror, taking out a beautifully woven necklace. The nylon cord was intricately and elegantly braided, with a gemstone pendant encased in a grid-like setting, looking quite exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the gemstone pendant, Jixinghuō's expression was deeply complex.</p><p></p><p>About two weeks ago, he and a few classmates had gone on a graduation trip to the Lake Baikal region, and on the last day, he had bought this necklace from a stall of a local reindeer tribe for 20 yuan as a souvenir.</p><p></p><p>That stall had hundreds of similar woven necklaces, each with a different pendant. Jixinghuō had not noticed anything unusual when he selected it and simply bought the one he found attractive to wear.</p><p></p><p>That very night, after returning to Chang'an, the nightmares began.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, Jixinghuō had pinpointed the cause - it was the pendant on the necklace, that gemstone that looked like a glass marble.</p><p></p><p>The transparent outer shell of the gemstone contained a multicolored star cluster within, resembling an eye, but the center was a void, as if the pupil had been gouged out, with a few fine cracks radiating from the middle, giving it an oddly incomplete beauty.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly not a natural gemstone, but an artificial creation, and not particularly valuable.</p><p></p><p>Out of curiosity, Jixinghuō had conducted some research on it.</p><p></p><p>The results showed that the hardness of the gemstone was incredibly high, far exceeding even that of diamond; its brittleness, melting point, water solubility, and electrical resistance were all beyond his ability to measure, and he could not determine its composition at all, completely outside the realm of his understanding.</p><p></p><p>He had tried various methods for a long time, but could not leave any trace on the gemstone.</p><p></p><p>He had even once soaked it in his own blood, but still to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Since the research on the gemstone yielded no results, Jixinghuō turned to searching for clues in his nightmares.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that came to mind was the "Tunguska Event".</p><p></p><p>The explosion scene in his dream matched many details of the Tunguska Event, such as the explosion occurring in the sky, the lack of a crater or celestial debris, the scale of the explosion, and the extent of the forest destruction - all of which aligned with the historical investigation data.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tunguska Event occurred in 1908, while it is now the year 2223, a span of over 300 years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the explosion site was nearly 800 kilometers away from the Lake Baikal area where he had traveled.</p><p></p><p>There were discrepancies in both time and space.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Jixinghuō still suspected that the gemstone in his possession was somehow related to the Tunguska Event, and might even be the cause of that mysterious explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, aside from the dreams, I have no other evidence."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I could unravel a century-old unsolved mystery."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō chuckled self-deprecatingly. The current problem was how to stop having the nightmares.</p><p></p><p>He had already tried various methods, but regardless of whether he carried the gemstone with him or kept it thousands of kilometers away in another city, he would still have the same nightmares, as if it were bound to him.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the bedroom with the necklace, unclasping the cord and removing the gemstone from the grid setting, holding it in his palm and examining it closely.</p><p></p><p>"Could this really be an alien species?"</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time this thought had crossed Jixinghuō's mind.</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the very beginning, he had suspected that the gemstone might be an alien species, but its characteristics did not match any of the known alien species in the databases of the "Astral Defense Council" (ADC) or the official websites of the national "Astral Department".</p><p></p><p>The so-called "alien species" are objects that contain "supernatural abilities" known as "alien powers".</p><p></p><p>All the alien species on Earth originate from the "Astral Realm".</p><p></p><p>In the year 2033, thirteen Astral Gates suddenly opened across the major continents of the world, allowing access to the Astral Realm. The mysterious and vast Astral Realm shocked the world, overturning the scientific community's understanding and defying known physical laws. The Astral Realm connects the entire Milky Way galaxy, serving as a bridge to travel to any planet or spatial coordinate in the galaxy! The Astral Realm is not a desolate void like outer space, but a vibrant world.</p><p></p><p>The vast Astral Realm has given birth to countless species, far exceeding the diversity of any single ecological planet on Earth; the evolutionary speed and intensity of Astral Realm species are also millions of times greater than Earth's biosphere! The Astral Realm also contains numerous intelligent races, giving rise to many civilizations far more powerful than Earth's.</p><p></p><p>The opening of the Astral Gates brought unprecedented calamity to the unprepared human race - alien invasions, nuclear wars, the Third and Fourth World Wars - nearly two centuries of global turmoil and extinction crises that completely reshaped human destiny and civilization.</p><p></p><p>Now in the 23rd century, Earth has restructured its order and landscape. Humans have adapted to the existence of the Astral Realm and utilized its unique resources to drive rapid technological development and greatly improve productivity.</p><p></p><p>However, the most significant impact on humanity has been the supernatural abilities known as "alien powers" originating from the Astral Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the intelligent civilized species or the primitive beast-like lifeforms of the Astral Realm, they can give birth to individuals with tremendous power. Their abilities vary, from controlling lightning and immense strength to shapeshifting and invisibility - these are just the most common alien powers, and there are many more strange and wondrous abilities. The further a life form has evolved in the Astral Realm, the stronger its alien powers become, and even its lifespan can increase accordingly. By defeating Astral Realm creatures, one has a chance of acquiring their alien powers.</p><p></p><p>And the vessels for these alien powers are the "alien species"!</p><p></p><p>Humans are naturally born without supernatural abilities, but by fusing with alien species, they can also wield alien powers, thus achieving evolutionary progress.</p><p></p><p>During the "Astral Gate Era", humanity's ability to fend off the Astral Realm alien invasions, aside from the use of nuclear weapons as a last resort, was also due to the pioneers who had mastered alien powers, gradually evolving to possess the strength to contend with the powerful Astral Realm entities.</p><p></p><p>To this day, out of the global population of over 4 billion, there are over 2 billion "Alien Humans" who possess alien powers.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuō is not an Alien Human, but he is very knowledgeable about alien species.</p><p></p><p>In this century, everyone has learned at least some basic knowledge about alien species, and has also encountered them in reality.</p><p></p><p>Alien species are not only born within the bodies of Astral Realm creatures, but can also form in the natural environment of the Astral Realm, taking various forms - some like plant fruits or roots, some like mineral gemstones, some energy crystals, and many other strange and unidentifiable alien species.</p><p></p><p>The "Astral Defense Council" with branches worldwide has created the largest alien species database on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо carefully reviewed all the over 12,000 alien species in the database, especially comparing them to hundreds of gemstone-shaped alien species.</p><p></p><p>However, none of them matched the gemstone in his hand. Not only did the appearance not match, but the gemstone was also vastly different from the common characteristics of the alien species.</p><p></p><p>All alien species would exhibit "vitality".</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо had encountered alien species a few times before, and no matter what form the alien species took, he could easily feel their "vitality" in his hands, like an egg about to hatch, without needing to make a special identification, he could clearly sense the abundant life force.</p><p></p><p>But he did not feel any vitality from the gemstone, it was clearly a lifeless object.</p><p></p><p>So he initially dismissed the possibility of it being an alien species. However, now...</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is absolute." Jing Xinghuо felt he might have been wrong, his eyes fixed intently on the gemstone in his palm, "Perhaps it is a rare exception among thousands, appearing like a lifeless object, but actually an extremely rare alien species."</p><p></p><p>Since it is an alien species, then it can be fused.</p><p></p><p>There is no clear standard for whether a human can fuse with an alien species. Generally speaking, the better the physical condition, the higher the success rate of fusing with an alien species.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо stood up.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the training room connected to the bedroom, the mirror on the opposite wall reflected his own figure.</p><p></p><p>He was exactly 1.8 meters tall, not too high or too low among adult males, only a few centimeters taller than the average height, but his build was well-proportioned and slender, with the upper and lower body close to the golden ratio, broad shoulders, an arm span of nearly 2 meters, long hands and legs, and a muscular body containing formidable explosive power.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of his years of training.</p><p></p><p>In order to pursue strength and become an Alien, everyone on Earth exercises.</p><p></p><p>Especially the young people full of expectations for the future, many of them have been soaking in the gym since their teens, doing various physical training to prepare for fusing with alien species.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо was no exception. He started training at the age of 15, and had almost never slacked off, it has been seven years now.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not yet become an Alien, Jing Xinghuо has great confidence. As long as the alien species he fuses with is not of an extremely high level, or has a very unique ability, the success rate will be at least 80%.</p><p></p><p>"I originally planned to continue training for one or two more years after the graduation trip, and then take the physical fitness test to apply for a super-limit level alien species."</p><p></p><p>"But now I have to fuse with an unknown alien species..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо showed a slight hesitation.</p><p></p><p>As a citizen of the "Asia-Pacific People's Union Community", after reaching adulthood, as long as one passes the four physical fitness tests, they can get an alien species for free and try to fuse to become an Alien. This is the welfare for every "Asia-Pacific Community" citizen, the country gives everyone a fair chance.</p><p></p><p>If the fusion fails, not only will there be no compensation, but they can also enjoy free medical services during the recovery period at the best public hospital.</p><p></p><p>If successful, there will be corresponding obligations.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when needed, the Alien must unconditionally respond to the government's conscription once, to serve the country until the term is over.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо was confident that he could pass the physical fitness test at the age of 18, but he had not participated yet, in order to get a higher score in the test.</p><p></p><p>The higher the score, the more and better quality alien abilities he can choose from.</p><p></p><p>The alien ability levels provided by the country, from low to high, are: basic, premium, excellent, and super-limit.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of citizens who pass the test can only choose abilities within the first three levels.</p><p></p><p>Citizens who pass all four tests in strength, speed, endurance and willpower with high scores, and then pass multiple rounds of evaluation by the "Star Division", can apply for the highest level super-limit alien ability, and be placed in the queue to obtain it in order.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's original goal was a super-limit level alien ability, with about a 30% chance.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>"If this is really an alien species." Jing Xinghuо muttered to himself: "Just based on the hardness of the gemstone and the special phenomenon that made me have nightmares, the ability it contains is at least at the super-limit level. And it may even be higher, reaching the 'Stellar Calamity' level of quality!"</p><p></p><p>Stellar Calamity! Jing Xinghuо's heart pounded violently for a few beats.</p><p></p><p>Abilities at this level are extremely powerful, their value cannot be measured by money, and the few Stellar Calamity level abilities made public in history were not sold, but exchanged.</p><p></p><p>"The chance to obtain a Stellar Calamity level alien ability is worth it, even if the fusion fails!" </p><p></p><p>"At most, I'll just have to recover and try again, it's only a matter of a few months."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>However, the current problem is, how should he fuse with it? The most common methods of alien species fusion are two.</p><p></p><p>The first is to swallow it, directly eat the alien species into the stomach to digest it.</p><p></p><p>The second is injection, dissolving the alien species into a prepared potion, and then injecting it into the human body's blood vessels to absorb it.</p><p></p><p>There are also some rarer fusion methods: for example, transforming the alien species into a gas to inhale; mentally resonating with the alien species and fusing it into the brain; and there are also rare cases where the alien species can directly permeate the skin and enter the body.</p><p></p><p>The most troublesome fusion method is implantation, generally suitable for alien species in the form of organs harvested from biological bodies, like performing surgery to implant it into one's own body.</p><p></p><p>If he could choose, Jing Xinghuо would of course prefer the "swallowing" fusion method.</p><p></p><p>The gemstone is not large, about the size of an eyeball, he could swallow it in one gulp. But he suspects that with the hardness of the gemstone, he may not be able to digest it.</p><p></p><p>He is most afraid of having to "implant" it to fuse.</p><p></p><p>Implanting an alien species is not just about casually stuffing it into any part of the body, proper research must be done in advance, and the rejection reaction must also be considered, sometimes needing medication to suppress rejection, suturing the wound, post-operative recovery and so on, all of which require a professional surgeon to operate.</p><p></p><p>The most critical point is that the implantation site of the alien species is usually the part of the body where it exerts its effect.</p><p></p><p>For example, the "Lightning Palm", the alien species form is a section of tendon that can release electricity, it needs to be implanted into the palm, connected to one's own tendon, in order to wield this ability.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо looked at the starry nebula inside the gemstone.</p><p></p><p>"The eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Do I have to implant it into my eye socket?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо couldn't help but feel his scalp tingle, the eye socket space is limited, it can't accommodate two eyeballs, before implanting, he would have to remove one of his own eyes first.</p><p></p><p>The cost is too high.</p><p></p><p>Even if it fails...</p><p></p><p>Although with today's medical technology, re-implanting the eyeball is not a difficult task, and sight can be quickly restored, the pain and psychological impact to endure during the surgery is not something an ordinary person can withstand.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо held the gemstone and compared it to his own eyelid.</p><p></p><p>"This gemstone really looks just like an eyeball!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an idea popped into his mind, without much consideration, he gently touched the gemstone to his right eye.</p><p></p><p>The eyeball is the most sensitive organ in the human body, and Jing Xinghuо immediately felt a slight stinging pain, instinctively closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, this pain became increasingly intense, as if mixed with sand, and tears gushed out.</p><p></p><p>It was not only the right eye, but both eyes felt the pain.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо forced his eyes open through the pain, his vision blurred, as if covered in a thick mosaic, unable to see anything clearly.</p><p></p><p>He touched his cheek and felt a warm, sticky substance, vaguely seeing it was red.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes are bleeding..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuо's heart tightened, just as he was about to be relieved that the method seemed to be working, a sudden, excruciating pain shot through his brain, as if a spike was twisting his brain matter, letting out a cry of pain and collapsing to the ground, with blood flowing from all seven orifices.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Jing Xinghuō saw the scene of a great explosion in his pitch-black vision again, just like the dream. As his consciousness sank into darkness, a thought flashed through his mind: "This time, will my head really explode?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

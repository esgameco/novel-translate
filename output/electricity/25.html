        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The star gate is located in the center of the fortress hall, and rooms have also been opened up on the walls around the hall, with a total of more than fifty floors, like a series of connected high-rise buildings.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang climbed up to one of the floors and walked into a bank.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>The teller at the counter greeted him politely, "How can I help you, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to withdraw cash."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang entered his bank account on the machine at the counter, and successfully logged in through face scanning and fingerprint.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Realm, electronic devices cannot be used, so there is naturally no online payment.</p><p></p><p>But there is a strong demand for transactions.</p><p></p><p>So the paper currency that had been phased out on Earth for many years has become useful again, and people entering the Star Realm will all withdraw some cash to carry with them.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jixing, how much would you like to withdraw?"The teller looked at the information on Jixinghuang's account.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang replied, "One million."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The bank teller was not too surprised. Most of the extraordinary people who travel between Earth and the Star Realm are very wealthy, with transactions often amounting to hundreds of thousands or millions, and even tens of millions occasionally. A mere one hundred thousand in cash is nothing unusual, something they encounter almost every day.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he received a message from the bank that the one million withdrawal had been made.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the balance and felt a sense of indescribable feeling.</p><p></p><p>That day, he had received the one million yuan gift from Xia Qingyu, the 180,000 yuan champion prize from the Shoot Leaf Cup, and a reward for killing Jizong Bang, plus his original savings, totaling more than 10.5 million.</p><p></p><p>A bona fide multi-millionaire! If he were an ordinary person, it would be enough to live a happy life for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>But after buying the life seed, he had transferred 700,000 to Lu Yunhai, and now withdrawing 1 million, his savings had dropped back to six figures in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"I was only a multi-millionaire for three days..." Jixinghuang sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the bank teller pushed a large stack of cash out from behind the counter. "Mr. Jixing, your cash is ready, please count it."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang quickly counted it through.</p><p></p><p>As per his requirements, 800,000 of this 1 million cash was in 10,000 yuan bills, 100,000 in 1,000 yuan bills, 80,000 in 100 yuan bills, and the remaining 20,000 were in 50 yuan and 10 yuan bills, all neatly bundled in stacks, weighing several kilograms.</p><p></p><p>The bank thoughtfully provided a backpack to hold all the money.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang picked up the backpack and returned to the star gate hall.</p><p></p><p>He stepped onto an "entry channel", took a number, and moved forward in the queue.</p><p></p><p>It was now just after 2 a.m., not the peak time for the star gate, so the queue was moving quickly. In five minutes, he was close to the star gate, with less than ten people in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As his turn approached, he took out his phone and accessed his email, setting the previously prepared email and video to be sent on a timer.</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, when his siblings woke up, they would receive the email and know that he had entered the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's your turn now."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the people in front of him disappeared. Finally, it was Jixinghuang's turn.</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm soldier guarding this channel looked Jixinghuang over - he was dressed casually, with only a bow bag on his back and a hand-carried backpack, clearly not someone going into battle. It was obvious he was a rookie entering the Star Realm for the first time, and alone.</p><p></p><p>The soldier frowned slightly and shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not stop Jixinghuang, and after re-checking his identity, waved him through.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang stepped onto the circular platform, the star gate now just within reach. With each step closer, the world around him became more and more distorted.</p><p></p><p>When he was just one step away from the star gate, looking out, the space he was in had become extremely warped.</p><p></p><p>He could hear no sound and see no one.</p><p></p><p>The entire world had fallen silent, as if he was the only one left. All he could see was darkness.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang could only continue forward, groping his way. His hand seemed to touch something, and in that instant, he felt a loss of footing, the world spinning, his limbs instinctively trying to grab at something, but before he could act, he felt the ground again.</p><p></p><p>His vision brightened.</p><p></p><p>Sight, hearing, smell - all his senses returned.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang found himself standing in an open-air plaza, the ground paved with flat stone slabs, with the black star gate behind him.</p><p></p><p>However, this star gate was much larger, with a diameter clearly much bigger than the one at Chaka, estimated to be over 50 meters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Star Realm was in daytime.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuang looked up, the sky was cloudless.</p><p></p><p>A golden sun hung in the west, two to three times larger than the sun on Earth, but its radiance was not scorching, the sunspots on its surface clearly visible, exuding a warm, oppressive presence.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the plaza was a massive city, but unlike the modern metropolises on Earth, the buildings here were not tall, with few exceeding ten floors.</p><p></p><p>The largest structure in the city was the city wall, over 100 meters high, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>"Olympia City!"</p><p></p><p>"I have finally arrived in Olympia."</p><p></p><p>Since the star gate opened in 2033, humanity on Earth had gone through 18 years of bitter struggle and heavy sacrifice to drive back the alien invasion and retake control of the star gate.</p><p></p><p>In 2051, the various powers on Earth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nations worked together to build this city around the star gate.</p><p></p><p>After a vote, the city was named "Olympia"! This was the first place in human history to host the Olympic Games, when the Galactic Defense Council still held dominance, and they adopted the slogan "Faster, Higher, Stronger - More United!"</p><p></p><p>Especially the part about "More United" resonated strongly with the common vision of all humanity at the time. So Olympia was also called the "City of Unity".</p><p></p><p>Although in retrospect over a century later, the name seems rather ironic, the nations still continued to call this city Olympia.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, dozens of massive mountain peaks hung hundreds of meters in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Floating Mountains!"</p><p></p><p>This was Jixingfire's first time seeing the Floating Mountains with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Each mountain peak was anchored to the ground by three or four thick chains, their massive size seemingly weightless as they swayed back and forth in the wind.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire's breathing suddenly became a bit rapid, and a strange sensation shot through his brain with each breath, but he adapted to it in just a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Myriad Spirits Air?" he wondered curiously.</p><p></p><p>The "air" of the Galactic Realm has a different composition from Earth's air, and scientists have yet to fully understand its makeup.</p><p></p><p>Even more amazing is that this air not only allows humans to breathe, but all life forms dependent on respiration, whether they are native Galactic Realm inhabitants or aliens from the galaxy, can sustain their lives. That's why it's called the "Myriad Spirits Air".</p><p></p><p>"Keep moving, don't block others," urged the Galactic Realm soldier next to him.</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire quickly stepped forward, following the crowd towards the outer plaza.</p><p></p><p>While there are thirteen star gates on Earth, they all lead to the same destination - the star gate plaza of this city. Entering the Galactic Realm through different star gates, one will arrive in a relatively fixed area.</p><p></p><p>These thirteen areas form fan-shaped sectors surrounding the star gate, each corresponding to a star gate on Earth.</p><p></p><p>The three star gates belonging to the Asia-Pacific Community occupy a contiguous sector, taking up nearly a quarter of the plaza's area. Prominent red lines are drawn on the ground marking this region, and those walking within it are citizens of the Asia-Pacific Community.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding city districts in the direction of this sector's extension are mostly under the influence of the Asia-Pacific Community.</p><p></p><p>As Jixingfire reached the edge of the star gate plaza, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He covered his right eye.</p><p></p><p>A stinging pain arose from his brain, and the iris of his right eye was flashing at a high frequency. Luckily it was daytime, and he quickly covered his eye before anyone noticed the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>The interface of the Myriad Manifestation Pupils automatically popped up, and the pain quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>Three arrows appeared around the interface.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire was puzzled, carefully observing the arrows. They were pointing in different directions and were of varying sizes. One arrow was significantly larger, over ten times the size of the other two, very conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>He rotated his body, aligning the largest arrow in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jixingfire heard a distant call.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely sensed the presence of an unknown object closely connected to him. If he proceeded in the direction of the large arrow, he was certain to find it.</p><p></p><p>"Another part of the Myriad Manifestation Pupils?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be?" </p><p></p><p>Jixingfire was both surprised and delighted. He had not forgotten that the Myriad Manifestation Pupils were broken, and he never expected to find a clue so soon after entering the Galactic Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three arrows must represent the three fragmented parts? He turned again, noticing the other two arrows pointed to locations that felt extremely distant, and he could not sense anything from those directions.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go search for them?"</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire hesitated, looking at the largest arrow.</p><p></p><p>Passersby in the plaza were curiously glancing at him standing motionless at the edge, some of them clearly very powerful individuals.</p><p></p><p>"I should find a place to stay first."</p><p></p><p>Habitually, Jixingfire tried to check the time on his phone, only to find it was powered off.</p><p></p><p>The powered shoes on his feet had also lost their energy, no different from ordinary shoes.</p><p></p><p>All electronic devices become ineffective within the Galactic Realm.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If judging solely by the visible scenery - the air, the land, the trees, the city - it all seemed no different from Earth, making it hard to believe this was another world.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Realm is macroscopically similar to the planets in the galaxy, and it's difficult to perceive the fundamental differences when immersed in a local area.</p><p></p><p>But the underlying rules of this realm are completely unlike the reality of the universe!</p><p></p><p>Jixingfire quickly left the star gate plaza, feeling a strong sense of danger there.</p><p></p><p>According to his magnetic field perception, the continuous buildings outside the plaza were all military camps, where the Galactic Realm forces of the Asia-Pacific Community were stationed.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the camps were several extremely powerful individuals.</p><p></p><p>"Those humanoid magnetic fields must be legendary Espers!" Jixingfire dared not linger, walking a few blocks in Olympia City before choosing a hotel to stay in.</p><p></p><p>After closing the door, Jixingfire looked at the simple room devoid of any electronics, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

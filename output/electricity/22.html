        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He clearly felt a surge of energy in his stomach, like a living creature churning, which quickly pierced through the stomach wall and spread to his viscera. In just tens of seconds, it had permeated his entire body - muscles, bones, and blood, from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tingling sensation ran from head to toe, and all the hair on his body stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Crackle, crackle...</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuо heard strange sounds coming from above his head and also detected an odd burning smell. Turning to look at the mirror on the wall, he found that his hair was trembling, one strand after another.</p><p></p><p>Sparks were flashing intermittently in his hair - these were jumping electric currents.</p><p></p><p>"It feels like I'm being electrocuted!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò looked at the goosebumps on his arm, and faint electric currents were emerging under his skin. Apart from the tingling sensation, there was no pain.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly swayed his head, his consciousness becoming a bit blurred, as if he had been hypnotized and was filled with drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>"My brain is also starting to be transformed."</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò struggled to maintain his alertness, gradually feeling the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the electric currents generated by his body became stronger and stronger, and the magnetic field created by the flowing currents also expanded, enveloping half of the cultivation room. The free stellar energy in his body reacted with the magnetic field, ultimately forming an invisible vortex!</p><p></p><p>An invisible magnetic vortex, attracting equally invisible energy.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò couldn't see it himself, but he could feel it.</p><p></p><p>That was the aetheric energy!</p><p></p><p>After the star gate opened, aetheric energy from the stellar realm had been pouring into the Earth continuously. Now, nearly two centuries later, aetheric energy permeated the entire globe - from the core of the Earth to the ocean depths, from the atmosphere to near-Earth space, every inch of the Earth was filled with aetheric energy, as ubiquitous as the air.</p><p></p><p>The aetheric energy density on Earth was naturally far lower than in the stellar realm. The total amount of aetheric energy was even more vastly different, perhaps not even one-billionth of the stellar realm.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it was sufficient for the Earth's espers to cultivate normally, but very few espers could truly sense the existence of aetheric energy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xing Xinghuò was like the center of an energy storm, with the surging aetheric energy rushing in like moths to a flame, flooding into his body.</p><p></p><p>He felt an incomparable sense of exhilaration! Every one of the fifty trillion cells in his body was cheering, letting out silent cries, as if they had been starving for decades and had finally been satisfied, greedily devouring the aetheric energy.</p><p></p><p>As the aetheric energy poured in, Xing Xinghuò's physique was being transformed inch by inch. This transformation went beyond just physical enhancement, delving into his brain, perception, mental processes, and if humans have souls, even his soul underwent earth-shattering changes! The fusion and transformation continued.</p><p></p><p>Tens of minutes later, electric currents could be clearly seen on Xing Xinghuò's skin, flashing through the air and easily piercing it.</p><p></p><p>The sound of electric shocks in the cultivation room became more and more frequent. The electric currents grew stronger, and Xing Xinghuò was surrounded by dancing bolts of lightning, which were restrained by the invisible magnetic field and unable to leave his body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, his entire being was shrouded in shimmering electric light, his feet leaving the ground as he spread his arms and levitated in midair.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the fusion finally reached its conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>The electric light around Xing Xinghuò's body suddenly dissipated, revealing his physique, and his feet returned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>His clothes and pants had long since been reduced to ashes by the high-temperature electric currents, leaving him in a state of naked running. Fortunately, his power shoes and phone were stored in the cabinet, minimizing the losses.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò looked at the muscular figure in the mirror. Outwardly, his body was not much different from before, slightly more robust and his skin a bit paler, barely noticeable upon casual inspection.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he had undergone a complete transformation! Every inch of his skin had become more resilient, and every bone and muscle, their structure and fibers, had been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Even his blood seemed to have been refined, with a vastly increased oxygen-carrying capacity and additional energy added to the nutrients circulating within.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of the stellar energy fully integrating with his blood, exponentially increasing the efficiency of powering his body's movements!</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò moved a little, and he felt that his strength had increased by at least half, with his defense, speed, and recovery all comprehensively enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The most enhanced aspect should be his explosive power! But he couldn't fully unleash it here, so he didn't know the exact extent of the improvement.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xinghuò closed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the physical enhancements, the rotating magnetic field had also brought him a brand-new perceptual ability.</p><p></p><p>This perception was different from vision or hearing, unlike the common senses. It allowed him to feel the existence of the magnetic field! All things in the universe, from the smallest electron to the largest star, possess a magnetic field as an intrinsic property of matter.</p><p></p><p>The size and strength of the magnetic field depend on the nature of the matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xing Xinghuò did not need to use his eyes to see, but his mind could sense countless curved "lines" in the surrounding space. Each line was a closed loop, with no beginning or end, extending to the far reaches of the universe, yet forming a closed circuit.</p><p></p><p>These were magnetic field lines! Thousands, millions, even billions of them, clustered together, dense and innumerable, impossible to count.</p><p></p><p>Some were strong, some were weak, some were large, some were small, surrounding various objects and forming magnetic fields.</p><p></p><p>Roughly speaking, the larger the object, the larger the magnetic field; conversely, the smaller the object, the smaller the magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>Countless magnetic fields overlapped and influenced each other, with the larger ones dominating the smaller ones.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the magnetic field, there are smaller magnetic fields, and within the smaller magnetic fields, there are even smaller ones. You are in me, and I am in you. It is impossible to draw a clear boundary line between them. They are everywhere, like an infinitely vast ocean of magnetic fields.</p><p></p><p>The largest magnetic field source is beneath our feet, encompassing almost all other magnetic fields. "The Earth's magnetic field!"</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо immediately realized this.</p><p></p><p>The Earth's magnetic field strength is far higher than other magnetic fields, but its effect on macroscopic physical phenomena is still very difficult to perceive.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of magnetic fields are ignored in people's daily lives.</p><p></p><p>As Jixinghuо gradually adapted to this perception, he discovered that his magnetic field sensing range could reach as far as 300 meters! Beyond 300 meters, the magnetic fields would rapidly weaken and become unknown.</p><p></p><p>This range covers almost an entire shopping mall! In Jixinghuо's perception, he "saw" tens of millions of magnetic fields, most of which were very weak, with only a few being stronger, especially those long, thin magnetic fields arranged in the walls - those were the electrical circuits! There were also various magnetic fields of different sizes and shapes, coming from different electrical appliances.</p><p></p><p>Light bulbs, refrigerators, computers, cameras...</p><p></p><p>Based on the shape of the magnetic fields, Jixinghuо could easily identify what they were.</p><p></p><p>The magnetic fields of these appliances were almost all stationary, except for one type that was constantly moving - they were small in size but high in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Mobile phones!"</p><p></p><p>The magnetic field characteristics of mobile phones were very distinctive and stood out like beacons in the night in Jixinghuо's perception.</p><p></p><p>Each mobile phone's magnetic field was connected to a larger but weaker magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>That was the human body!</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing for a while, Jixinghuо summarized the pattern.</p><p></p><p>The bio-magnetic fields of most people were very weak, but there were a few exceptions - they were the Extraordinary Humans.</p><p></p><p>The higher the rank of an Extraordinary Human, the stronger their power and the more prominent their magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a very strong human-shaped magnetic field not far from him - it was the Demon Spirit who was in charge of the "Star Warrior" store!</p><p></p><p>Among the many human magnetic fields, the Demon Spirit's magnetic field was like the moon in the night sky, far exceeding the others.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in the magnetic field should also reflect the state of the other party."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо had a thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the rotating magnetic field was activated and entered an operational state. Electrical currents appeared on his skin, his strength increased dramatically, and it felt like he had inexhaustible power! In his perception, the magnetic field strength of his body had clearly intensified.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо did not continue testing, as fully activating the rotating magnetic field would consume his Star Force, and now was not the time for experimentation, so he exited the state.</p><p></p><p>"Truly a transcendent ability!"</p><p></p><p>"This supernatural power completely surpasses the human body's limits."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The strength enhancement brought by the rotating magnetic field was just one aspect. At his current stage as a junior Extraordinary Human, the usefulness of magnetic field perception was even greater.</p><p></p><p>Although he could only sense the magnetic fields and not influence or manipulate them, this was an absolutely top-tier perceptual ability.</p><p></p><p>After mastering this perception through training, he would be able to detect changes around him at all times. Not to mention, the Myriad Astral Eyes already had the function of predicting danger.</p><p></p><p>Combining the Myriad Astral Eyes with magnetic field perception, Jixinghuо believed he would be almost impossible to sneak attack, providing great protection during his adventures in the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jixinghuо opened the interface of the Myriad Astral Eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Star Force: 97/97]</p><p>[Abilities: Thousand Nimble Hands (Level 2 1/227), Rotating Magnetic Field (Level 1 1/359)]</p><p>[Spiritual Source Energy: 100]</p><p></p><p>"The Star Force increased by 41 points!" Jixinghuо was quite delighted. It was common knowledge that fusing with Extraordinary Abilities could increase Star Force.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected it to increase by so much. It usually took him about a week of diligent cultivation to increase 1 point of Star Force, yet fusing the Rotating Magnetic Field had increased it by 41 points, almost doubling it, equivalent to saving 10 months of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder every Extraordinary Human is so eager to expand their Extraordinary Items."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Expanding Extraordinary Items can allow Extraordinary Humans to fuse additional Extraordinary Abilities, and also increase their Star Force, which is tremendously beneficial for improving their strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the increase in Star Force from fusing Extraordinary Abilities does not accelerate the evolution of the Extraordinary Human's body. If an Extraordinary Human's body is likened to a bottle, the Star Force is the water in the bottle. The increase in Star Force from fusing Extraordinary Abilities is just expanding the size of the bottle, but the original progress towards the next stage of life evolution may still be far away.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, resources like Life Spiritual Species are truly called "Expansion" Extraordinary Items.</p><p></p><p>Of course, fusing additional Extraordinary Abilities has only benefits.</p><p></p><p>Not only does it enhance one's strength, but it also raises the Star Force limit at the current stage, laying a more solid foundation for the next evolution.</p><p></p><p>Next, Jixinghuо looked at his new Extraordinary Ability.</p><p></p><p>"Level 1 Rotating Magnetic Field, it actually requires 359 points of Spiritual Source Energy." He was surprised, looking at the remaining 100 points of Spiritual Source Energy, whether upgrading Thousand Nimble Hands or Rotating Magnetic Field, both were quite far off.</p><p></p><p>"Although I can't upgrade it, I can still improve my strength."</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо looked at the human virtual image on the right side of the interface. There was a magnetic field-shaped projection on the brain, enveloping the entire body and slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate and invested all 100 points of Spiritual Source Energy into the Rotating Magnetic Field.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

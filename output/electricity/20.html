        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the cabin, he looked at the crystal pinched between his fingertips. The texture was tough yet elastic, and its information interface appeared in his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>This super-limit variant had returned to his hands, but it had come at a certain cost.</p><p></p><p>As for the cost, Jixinghuо wasn't sure if it could even be considered a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>He had signed the contract.</p><p></p><p>It was an employment contract with the Sword Agency, and after signing it, Jixinghuо officially joined the Sword Agency, becoming a "Fishsword" swordsman.</p><p></p><p>The swordsmen of the Sword Agency were divided into four levels, all named after ancient famous swords.</p><p></p><p>From low to high, they were Fishsword, Chunqiu, Chixiao, and Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>The Fishsword swordsmen were the lowest level, with the lowest salaries and benefits in the Sword Agency, but they were still much higher than ordinary jobs. Their monthly salary was just over 30,000 Yayuan, and with various allowances and performance bonuses, their monthly income could reach nearly 40,000 Yayuan.</p><p></p><p>If they participated in field operations, they would also receive additional high subsidies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the nature of the Sword Agency's work was special, and most of the operations were very dangerous, so the high salaries were earned by risking their lives.</p><p></p><p>If one wasn't careful, they could end up with money but no life to spend it.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was only a Fishsword swordsman, and he didn't need to participate in operations for the time being. The contract clearly stated that one must reach the advanced variant level to be eligible for field missions.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he was just a member of the Sword Agency's Comprehensive Management Department, Training Division.</p><p></p><p>Most Fishsword swordsmen belonged to the Training Division, and their most important task was training - participating in special agent training, cultivation, and combat courses, so they could be promoted to Chunqiu swordsmen as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Although Jixinghuо didn't want to join the Sword Agency voluntarily, he had to admit that the Training Division was a great place.</p><p></p><p>The Training Division had the best cultivation conditions, with many advanced facilities and equipment that couldn't be bought on the market, various expensive auxiliary drugs, and the top coaches and assistants, no less than the coaching teams of the Super League, and even surpassing them.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial part was that all of this was free!</p><p></p><p>Without having to go on missions, he could just train and still get paid, which was simply amazing.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо was quite tempted, but after calming down, he realized that all the blessings of fate had a hidden price tag.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Agency's generosity was certainly not out of charity.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the Sword Agency's salary and enjoying its benefits, he would have to fight to the death for the Sword Agency in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one could also say that fighting for the Sword Agency was dedicating oneself to the country, and Jixinghuо didn't object to that, as he was willing to contribute his strength to the country.</p><p></p><p>But not now.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо had his own plans, and getting deeply bound to the Sword Agency at this moment was not in his best interest.</p><p></p><p>Considering the bigger picture for the future and his personal prospects, he must maintain a certain distance from any official or major force for now.</p><p></p><p>"When I'm stronger, with the power to crush any enemy, then I can make a greater contribution to the country."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Jixinghuо made his decision.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Agency's swordsmen didn't need to punch in for duty, so he resisted the temptation of the Training Division's benefits, voluntarily gave up the preferential treatment, and didn't show up for work. The Sword Agency couldn't do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he would be fired! Thinking about this, Jixinghuо couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yishang had threatened and tempted him, with good intentions, knowing that he valued Jixinghuо's talent. But no matter how he calculated, he never expected Jixinghuо to simply not care about the Training Division's benefits and skip work.</p><p></p><p>"I need to integrate the variant as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll make a run for it!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Agency's tentacles were spread across the globe, and it would be easy for them to find him. However, there was a perfect destination that the Sword Agency couldn't infiltrate - the Star Realm!</p><p></p><p>The intelligence systems of modern countries were omnipresent, almost real-time monitoring everything globally through the internet and countless cameras, making it extremely difficult for an individual to hide. But in the Star Realm, without electronic devices and networks, the power of national organizations was greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Jixinghuо already had a plan to go to the Star Realm, for the sake of spiritual source energy!</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the aerospace fighter sent Jixinghuо back to Chang'an, dropping him off at an uninhabited park in the Qishan District, then taking off to return.</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо didn't immediately go home.</p><p></p><p>Although Minchongwu had said when sending him off that for the next half-month, the Sword Agency would send people to specifically monitor his apartment building and the surrounding area, ensuring his absolute safety, Jixinghuо didn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was afraid of retaliation, but he just didn't like being secretly watched.</p><p></p><p>In a hotel a few kilometers away from his home, Jixinghuо booked a room and, after a simple wash, sat on the bed and took out the crystal he carried with him.</p><p></p><p>[Variant: Rotating Magnetic Field]</p><p>[Grade: Super-Limit]</p><p>[Fusion Success Rate: 99%]</p><p>[Can it be Upgraded: Yes]</p><p></p><p>A super-limit ability!</p><p></p><p>Jixinghuо had admired it many times, but every time he saw the information on the interface, his mind was stirred, and he could hardly contain himself.</p><p></p><p>In the global variant trading markets and major platforms, super-limit abilities were the highest level that could be purchased.</p><p></p><p>But "Rotating Magnetic Field" was not on the list.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "super-limit" meant the ability to exceed human limits.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest and most common variant was far beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The most minor of the super-limit abilities can cost no less than 20 million. Not to mention the top-tier super-limit ability, the rotating magnetic field, which cannot be bought even with money.</p><p></p><p>Its preciousness needs no further elaboration.</p><p></p><p>The rotating magnetic field can amplify the biological magnetic field of the human body. When in operation, it combines with the stellar force to produce various powerful effects - enhancing strength, explosiveness and speed, improving the efficiency of stellar force cultivation, and accelerating the recovery after stellar force depletion, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Magnetic field and electric field are inseparable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the rotating magnetic field can make the physique of an esper generate electric current!</p><p></p><p>The essence of this ability is the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. As the rotating magnetic field is enhanced, step by step delving into the physical origin, it will possess all kinds of incredible, almost mythical abilities.</p><p></p><p>Manipulating electric current, strengthening the physique, reorganizing cells, controlling metals, decomposing matter... </p><p></p><p>Its potential is almost limitless!</p><p></p><p>Whoever can master the electromagnetic force will be the tyrannical ruler of the world!</p><p></p><p>Of course, these powerful abilities all require a strong stellar force and more esper abilities to support them.</p><p></p><p>The electromagnetic force is too remote. Not to mention a mere novice adventurer, even a top-tier esper would not dare claim to have grasped even a tiny bit of the electromagnetic force.</p><p></p><p>Fusing the rotating magnetic field is just the first step of a long journey.</p><p></p><p>The reason it is so sought after is not only because the ability is extremely powerful, but also because the rotating magnetic field is the core ability of an exceptionally powerful profession template - the Magnetic Field Fanatic!</p><p></p><p>There are already more than 40 mature profession templates on Earth, and comparisons between them are inevitable. This topic has been a perennial hot point on various websites, forums and social media.</p><p></p><p>Which profession template is the strongest, which is the weakest; which is the fastest, which is the slowest; which is the most unique, which is the rarest, which is the most comprehensive, which is the most bizarre, and so on and so forth...</p><p></p><p>Just posting a related thread online will invite thousands upon thousands of replies.</p><p></p><p>Countless people have debated, argued, slandered, raged, and even developed feuds over this, escalating to offline confrontations, sending threatening letters, and even resulting in bloody incidents.</p><p></p><p>Some have lost their lives, others have ended up in prison.</p><p></p><p>While amateur netizens argue endlessly, professional organizations and authorities have also conducted research.</p><p></p><p>In the early 21st century, the "Esper Guild" under the Astral Defense Council (ADC) released a profession template scoring system, breaking down the abilities into ten aspects: close combat, ranged, defense, speed, perception, burst, control, recovery, support, and potential.</p><p></p><p>Each ability is scored from 1 to 10 points.</p><p></p><p>This scoring system incorporates a wealth of detailed data, complex calculation formulas and functions, to determine the scores for each ability.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the scores of the ten abilities are summed up to get the final score.</p><p></p><p>Most profession templates score below 40 points.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Adventurer scores 37 points.</p><p></p><p>The lowest scoring is the "Giant Champion" at 31 points.</p><p></p><p>Others like the "Iron Guard" are 32 points, the "Stellar Igniter" 34 points, the "Malevolent Spirit" and "Phantom Harmonist" 35 points, the "Nimble Step" and "Frost Edge" 36 points.</p><p></p><p>The "White Knight" and "Shadow Blade" are the same as the Adventurer, both at 37 points.</p><p></p><p>Profession templates scoring above 40 points are considered relatively powerful, such as the "Dark Prelate" at 41 points, the "Graviton Warrior" at 43 points, the "Archmage" at 44 points, the "Psyche Hacker" at 45 points.</p><p></p><p>Those scoring above 50 points are even rarer.</p><p></p><p>The "Cunning Prodigy" at 51 points, the "Blood Butcher" at 50 points, the "Superconductor Mage" at 52 points, the "Aura Fighter" at 58 points - they are all powerful and rare, with most peers having little chance against them.</p><p></p><p>There are even stronger profession templates scoring 60 points or even above 70 points, which are few and far between globally.</p><p></p><p>Such as the "Dragon Lord", the "Psychic Harmonist" and the "Astral Traveler".</p><p></p><p>The highest scoring profession template in this evaluation system is the "Magnetic Field Fanatic", reaching 81 points! The Magnetic Field Fanatic is the only profession template to score over 80 points, with not a single one of its ten abilities scoring below 7 points.</p><p></p><p>Not only has the "Esper Guild" given the Magnetic Field Fanatic the highest rating, but other countries and organizations' evaluation systems also consistently place it at the top.</p><p></p><p>Without exception!</p><p></p><p>After years of heated online debates, no matter how intense the process, the consensus usually converges on the "strongest profession" in the end.</p><p></p><p>The Magnetic Field Fanatic is undoubtedly the strongest profession template in the minds of the majority.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the scoring system is just theoretical.</p><p></p><p>Profession templates with lower scores do not necessarily lag far behind the high-scoring ones. It ultimately depends on the esper themselves.</p><p></p><p>The profession template is not the sole factor determining an esper's strength.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, high-scoring profession templates often have many drawbacks - high entry barriers, demanding requirements, difficult cultivation, low fusion success rates, rare abilities that are hard to find, inability to advance, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Low-scoring profession templates, on the other hand, have many benefits and conveniences. With subsequent profession advancement, they can also possess strength comparable to or even surpassing the high-scoring ones.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, people still yearn for the rare and powerful profession templates.</p><p></p><p>The Magnetic Field Fanatic is one of them.</p><p></p><p>And the most important core ability of this profession template is the "Rotating Magnetic Field" in their own hands!

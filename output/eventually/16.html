        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After letting Li Ge go back on his own, Xue Jing also walked towards the bus stop, preparing to go home.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he opened the panel and checked the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>【You experienced a battle, Fitness EXP +109】</p><p>【You experienced a battle, Aiming EXP +50】 </p><p>【You experienced a battle, feeling very relaxed, Wellness EXP +33】</p><p>【Conditions met, Skill Activated: Martial Arts】</p><p>【You experienced a battle, Martial Arts EXP +68】</p><p></p><p>【Fitness Lv2 (431/500)</p><p>Wellness Lv1 (269/300) </p><p>Cooking Lv2 (279/500)</p><p>Running Lv3 (502/800)</p><p>Charm Lv2 (398/500)</p><p>Aiming Lv1 (208/300)</p><p>Martial Arts Lv1 (68/300)】</p><p></p><p>First, the experience values - the Fitness skill directly increased by over 100, which would have taken him an hour of hard work at the gym to achieve, but now he just got it from a not-too-strenuous fight.</p><p></p><p>The Aiming skill increased by 50 points, which should include his use of dynamic vision during the battle, as well as his accuracy when striking, plus hitting Pei Youguang's left eye with a stone, far exceeding his normal training gains.</p><p></p><p>What really surprised Xue Jing was that the Wellness experience actually increased by over 30 points. This skill that previously could only be leveled up by going to bed early and waking up early, actually gained experience from a physical altercation? So fighting is a wellness exercise?</p><p></p><p>However, when Xue Jing saw the "feeling very relaxed" prompt on the panel, he felt it made sense. A key aspect of wellness is maintaining a good mental state, as the impact of mentality on the body is undeniable, with many cases of miraculous recoveries in seriously ill patients due to their positive mindset.</p><p></p><p>After the fight, he indeed felt very refreshed and pleasantly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Fighting, so satisfying!</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I should do more things that make me happy in the future..."</p><p></p><p>The massive experience gains once again proved that the panel does not encourage staying cooped up, but rather requires going out and being active.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, there was the newly activated "Martial Arts" skill.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing never expected to unlock a skill so directly tied to combat ability here. He had thought all the previous month's practice following videos was in vain, but it turned out all the accumulated training had erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>On the quiet path, seeing no one around, Xue Jing did a high split, raising his right leg straight up vertically. At this moment, he could barely feel the pain of being stretched in the groin area, a flexibility he previously did not possess. </p><p></p><p>And after holding the high leg, he did not feel the slightest strain, with his remaining left foot standing steadily and balanced, very stable.</p><p></p><p>The "Martial Arts" skill had changed the structure of his body. </p><p></p><p>A person's body can subtly change due to different living habits and training methods, like how gymnasts and weightlifters have completely different body structures. </p><p></p><p>Years of training allow their bodies to be highly adapted to their professions, one being light and flexible, the other strong and powerful.</p><p></p><p>And after the Martial Arts skill was activated, Xue Jing's body structure had been "specialized", transforming from an ordinary person's structure to one "suitable for martial arts".</p><p></p><p>In addition to basic physical stat boosts, his reaction speed, explosive power, flexibility, impact resistance, agility, punch feel, and balance - all abilities related to martial arts - had been enhanced to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>"This skill only strengthened my 'martial arts ability', but did not directly grant me 'martial arts techniques'..." Xue Jing pondered.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In that case, just like Chinese, math, and physics courses, techniques also belong to 'knowledge' rather than skills themselves. 'Martial arts' can help me better master techniques, but it can't just instill techniques in me out of thin air..."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than calling it 'martial arts skills', it's more like 'martial arts talent'."</p><p></p><p>In fact, other skills are similar. 'Culinary skills' are also about enhancing one's grasp of heat control and the use of cooking utensils, but it doesn't directly give one recipes. 'Fitness' doesn't give one fitness knowledge, it just strengthens one's body.</p><p></p><p>'Running', 'aiming', 'charm', 'health preservation' are all the same - they only strengthen one's related abilities, without directly imparting knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I'm feeling great."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had a look of delight on his face.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of getting stronger is truly irresistible. His body, which had already been lightened by the enhancement of 'martial arts', felt even lighter.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go home and pet the cat."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Riding the bus to the street of his own residential area, Xue Jing didn't immediately go home, but went to the supermarket to buy some ingredients before returning home.</p><p></p><p>He took out his key, turned the lock, and opened the door, only to find the cat squatting at the entrance, seemingly waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him come in, the cat immediately meowed and wagged its tail with the ring on it, greeting him.</p><p></p><p>Putting the backpack and the bag of ingredients on the table in the living room, Xue Jing squatted down, grabbed the cat's head with both hands, and started scratching its cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"Little kitty wants to be petted, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The cat initially wanted to struggle a bit, but soon succumbed to Xue Jing's superb technique, involuntarily squinting its eyes in pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The feel of the cat's head was good, and Xue Jing petted it for a while, reluctantly stopping, then using one hand to pinch the cat's cheek and laughed, "Are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>Although he knew the cat in front of him was most likely a human transformed, in front of this cute little animal, Xue Jing's tone was inevitably a bit childish, as if he was teasing a little child.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The cat stretched out its two white paws and tried to push away Xue Jing's hand pinching its cheek, but to no avail, and could only helplessly meow, indicating that it was indeed hungry.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled, let go of the poor cat, and took the ingredients on the table into the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>The cat had a very anthropomorphic look of displeasure on its face, rubbing its sore cheeks with its paws.</p><p></p><p>'Stupid human, so rough with his hands.'</p><p></p><p>The cat, who had almost forgotten that it was not a real cat, thought angrily.</p><p></p><p>It walked with cat steps to the corner of the kitchen where Xue Jing was, peeked in to make sure he was busy, then immediately dashed into Xue Jing's room.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had returned too suddenly just now, and it had some loose ends to tie up.</p><p></p><p>Once in the room, the cat jumped onto the computer desk, used its paws to laboriously move the mouse, 'one-paw Zen' pressed the keyboard, cleared the browsing history, and uninstalled a strange software, restoring the computer to a 'nothing happened' state, then turned it off.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, the cat heaved a sigh of relief, silently left the room, and came to the living room, jumping onto the sofa, curling up lazily, with its paws resting on the remote control, turning on the TV.</p><p></p><p>"...City Public Security Bureau Chief Shang Mingyang said the police have confirmed the escape route of this batch of border smuggling gangs, and they are very likely to pass through the city. The Public Security Bureau has now issued a yellow safety warning, please all citizens be careful for personal safety..."</p><p></p><p>In the kitchen, Xue Jing's phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>He put down the soy sauce and ladle in his hands, washed his hands, wiped them on the apron, and took the phone out of his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the caller ID, it was a number he knew by heart but had no contact name for.</p><p></p><p>He pressed the answer button and said, "Hello, mom, what's up?"</p>

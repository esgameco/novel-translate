        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he had just woken up, he did not feel the slightest bit tired, and his spirit was full of energy, as if the moment he opened his eyes, the sleepiness had been completely dispelled.</p><p></p><p>He opened the skill panel.</p><p></p><p>【Early to bed, early to rise, health experience +37】</p><p></p><p>【Health Lv1 (236/300)】</p><p></p><p>The health skill was activated by Xue Jing a week ago.</p><p></p><p>According to his observation, the effect is to enhance some physical qualities, significantly improve sleep quality, and very obviously, increase his energy.</p><p></p><p>Since the health skill was activated, he had almost never felt tired all day, full of drive, and as soon as he thought of something, he could immediately go and do it, greatly reducing the phenomenon of procrastination, and as soon as he closed his eyes, he could fall asleep after a while, completely getting rid of the trouble of insomnia.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be the most satisfactory ordinary skill for him.</p><p></p><p>However, for this skill, so far it seems that only the method of going to bed early and getting up early can gain experience, he has also tried taking health supplements, eating on time and keeping a regular diet, and other health tips, but basically there has been no movement.</p><p></p><p>Closing the panel, Xue Jing prepared to get up, wash, and then go for a run, but found that the touch of his left arm seemed fluffy, and when he lifted the thin quilt, sure enough, the cat was hugging his arm with its four white gloves, sleeping sweetly.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt a little headache.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already completely exposed the fact that the cat was not a cat yesterday, he still couldn't get it to speak in the end.</p><p></p><p>As long as the cat doesn't speak, he won't be able to get any information about the divine substance, and the unlocking of the "Twin" active effect will be far away.</p><p></p><p>He can't openly say that he needs this "divine substance", as everything related to the skill panel, he is very cautious and doesn't want to reveal a single word to anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Well, when the car reaches the front of the mountain, there will be a way."</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his arm from the cat's embrace, got up, and covered the thin quilt over the cat, only exposing the cat's head.</p><p></p><p>The sky was still pitch black, he went to the bathroom, turned on the light, and started to wash up.</p><p></p><p>After washing up, he changed into comfortable sportswear, put on a sports watch, put on his shoes, and went out for a run.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the residential area where Xue Jing lived, there is a small garden for people to take a walk and play. Outside the garden is a red brick road, which was specially built to go around the garden, and it is very suitable for running when there are few people.</p><p></p><p>Now at this time, Xue Jing was the only one there.</p><p></p><p>The sky was still dark, and the street lights had not yet gone out. Xue Jing walked to the "track" under the light, did some stretching exercises.</p><p></p><p>Then he started running at a speed far exceeding that of an ordinary person, almost like a weak ordinary person sprinting at full force.</p><p></p><p>This is his current "jogging" speed.</p><p></p><p>One lap, two laps, three laps...</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Xue Jing slowly slowed down and gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>He panted heavily, his whole body drenched in sweat, feeling that his feet from the toes to the thighs were burning, his lungs seemed to be grasped by a hand and constantly kneaded, and every time he inhaled oxygen, that hand would squeeze it out, unable to relieve the sense of oxygen deprivation.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, he gradually calmed his breathing and recovered. He raised his right hand and looked at the data on the sports watch.</p><p></p><p>Running time: 1 hour 02 minutes 13 seconds, average speed: 18.3 km/h. This average speed is already close to the level of a professional half-marathon runner in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Running for an hour non-stop at this speed is also an extremely challenging burden on Xue Jing's current physical condition.</p><p></p><p>He has been running like this every morning recently.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he couldn't do this every day, as the muscle damage couldn't recover in time.</p><p></p><p>But since the "Health" skill was activated, his body's recovery ability has increased greatly, no matter how tired he is, as long as he sleeps, he will feel completely recovered when he wakes up.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing opened the panel.</p><p></p><p>【You completed a long run, running experience +205】</p><p></p><p>【Running Lv3 (463/800)】</p><p></p><p>Running more than 18 kilometers, the "Running" skill gained 205 experience points.</p><p></p><p>As the experience of this skill increases and the level rises, everything related to running on his body will be strengthened.</p><p></p><p>The posture and force application will become more and more perfect, how to apply force to avoid injury while exploding more powerfully, what posture can reduce wind resistance and run faster, how to coordinate the breathing rhythm, all of which are ingrained in his body like instincts.</p><p></p><p>Physical fitness will also be enhanced, especially lung capacity and leg explosive power.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing also looked at the "Fitness" skill.</p><p></p><p>【You completed a long run, fitness experience +32】</p><p></p><p>【Fitness Lv2 (288/500)】</p><p></p><p>He went to the chairs in the garden and sat down to rest for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Comfortable."</p><p></p><p>It's tiring, but the sense of satisfaction that comes from visibly making himself better gives him far more joy than fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Even without considering the growth speed of the panel, just being able to clearly see one's own progress is an amazing cheat.</p><p></p><p>It's like someone who persists in learning and exercising.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before playing games and grinding levels could keep one up for several consecutive days. The biggest difference lies in whether one can accurately recognize that they are making progress.</p><p></p><p>That sense of certainty from receiving real-time positive feedback, that clear expectation of becoming stronger in the future, can evoke a powerful inner drive in most people.</p><p></p><p>This is almost like stepping into the sacred realm of "unity of knowledge and action" that sages attain.</p><p></p><p>It was already past 6 AM, the sky was bright, and people were gradually starting to appear around.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing wiped the sweat off his forehead and slowly walked back home.</p><p></p><p>Back home, he took off his clothes and tossed them into the washing machine, then went to the bathroom to freshen up, feeling refreshed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cat was still asleep, even though it had slept with him the previous night - its biological clock was clearly not very cat-like.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing went to the kitchen, took out six eggs from the fridge, and put them in a pot, adding just enough water to submerge the eggs, then placed it on the induction cooktop to boil.</p><p></p><p>He also poured a large bottle of pure milk into another pot, heated it on the gas stove until it was warm, then turned off the fire, added some oatmeal and white sugar, making a pot of oatmeal sweetened milk.</p><p></p><p>He then took out the bread slices he had bought the previous morning that he hadn't finished eating - this would be his breakfast today.</p><p></p><p>Since it was too simple, it couldn't really be called culinary skills, so his "cooking" experience didn't increase.</p><p></p><p>He ate four of the boiled eggs, leaving the remaining two peeled and placed on a small plate. The oatmeal milk and bread were also left with some leftovers, all of which he prepared and placed on the dining table, ready for the cat to eat when it woke up.</p><p></p><p>Although this cat had always refused to communicate, leaving him quite dissatisfied, it had ultimately provided him the opportunity for his skill panel to evolve, so Xue Jing was still grateful for it.</p><p></p><p>After finishing all this, Xue Jing changed into his school uniform, slung his backpack over one shoulder, and casually took a throwing dart from the dart board hanging on the wall.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the front door, he opened it, turned around, and threw the dart out, then immediately turned back without looking at the result, left, and locked the door.</p><p></p><p>On the dart board hanging on the wall, a throwing dart was deeply embedded in the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>[Precisely hit the bullseye, Aiming Experience +1]</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing left his home, walked for a while, and took the bus. While on the bus with female students, he gained some Charm experience over the three stops. Arriving at his destination, he reached Qingcheng Affiliated High School.</p><p></p><p>It was around 6:30 AM, and the school gate was bustling with people. Xue Jing followed the crowd into the campus, but instead of heading to his own classroom, he walked towards the opposite side of the Qingcheng High School teaching building.</p><p></p><p>As Qingcheng High School was an affiliated school of Qingcheng University, the campus was connected, allowing students to freely visit both.</p><p></p><p>The place Xue Jing was going to was the library of Qingcheng University.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were some abnormal things that did not exist in the previous Earth.</p><p></p><p>However, due to various considerations, the authorities had imposed strict information control on this aspect, and only some vague introductions could be found online.</p><p></p><p>But just because it couldn't be found online doesn't mean it couldn't be found at Qingcheng University.</p><p></p><p>As one of the top universities in the outer ring, the students studying there were future social elites, qualified to know some of the hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was a student in the special elite class of Qingcheng High School.</p><p></p><p>The elite class was a special class, naturally with special privileges. As long as the elite class students maintained their grades and retained this identity upon graduation, they could choose to bypass the college entrance exam and directly enroll in Qingcheng University.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, elite class students had some privileges of Qingcheng University students in advance, such as accessing the seventh floor of the university library.</p><p></p><p>The first six floors of the library were accessible to regular high school students, but the seventh floor was not. It housed documents and archives that could not be found online, accessible only to Qingcheng University students or elite class high school students.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had visited this floor once out of curiosity, but the vast and disorganized collection of documents and archives, without any computer-based search and retrieval system, made it difficult for him to accurately find the information he wanted to understand about "divine substances." He hadn't been back since.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the only place where he might be able to find information related to "divine substances," so he could only come here and try his luck.</p><p></p><p>The Qingcheng University library was quite expansive. At the main entrance, there were several access gates. Xue Jing took out his library card, swiped it at the sensor, passed the verification, and entered the library.</p><p></p><p>He went straight up, without stopping, directly to the sixth floor, and at the staircase leading to the seventh floor, there was another access gate. He swiped his card again to pass through and reached the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the modern decoration of the first six floors, the seventh floor of the library appeared plain and old-fashioned, with worn bookshelves, old desks and chairs, aged documents and archives, and dim yellow lights hanging from the ceiling, giving a sense of having traveled back in time.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it also had a profound historical weight that the first six floors lacked.</p><p></p><p>The seventh floor was usually sparsely populated, let alone at this early morning hour. Xue Jing had expected it to be empty.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, there was already a young lady sitting in the rest area with the old desks and chairs.</p><p></p><p>[To be continued]</p>

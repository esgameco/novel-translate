        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was walking on the streets in the outskirts of the southern district.</p><p></p><p>The narrow and unprofessionally planned neighborhood, where all the buildings were haphazardly crammed together, was generally very dilapidated. Some could hardly be called proper houses, just shacks made of a few sheets of iron and wooden boards.</p><p></p><p>The construction materials used for these houses were evidently substandard, and they had lacked basic maintenance for a long time, with some areas already in a state of disrepair.</p><p></p><p>The ground was littered with scattered cans and garbage, the uneven cement surface was dotted with puddles, and a few stray dogs were eyeing Xue Jing, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was not a single person in sight on the street, he had a very strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>It was like the calm before a storm - the pitch-black night seemed to be nurturing a terrifying beast, with an indistinct fetal movement pulsing and contracting.</p><p></p><p>That was his heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>Even without using any breathing techniques, the blood in his body suddenly began to circulate faster, and his body temperature started to rise, almost to the boiling point.</p><p></p><p>The hair on his back stood on end, and his scalp felt numb, as if a razor-sharp knife was being slowly dragged across his neck.</p><p></p><p>Without any reason, without relying on any senses, the innate "fighting" instinct deeply embedded in his flesh was simply reminding him - there was danger.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Xue Jing chose to trust his instinct.</p><p></p><p>Run! Crouching slightly on the street, Xue Jing's thigh muscles tensed, and the explosive leg power generated by his sprint instantly propelled him out of the street!</p><p></p><p>Just as he suddenly started running frantically, shouts and curses came from the crevices and alleys between the houses.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, he noticed!"</p><p>"Chase him down!"</p><p>"Fuck, this little bastard runs fast!"</p><p></p><p>From the hidden alleys, over a dozen figures emerged, chasing after Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were holding various weapons - knives, wooden sticks, machetes, baseball bats... The metallic weapons were dragging on the ground, creating a constant clanging sound.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that these people were no strangers to this kind of activity, and they had almost formed a complete encirclement around Xue Jing. If his actions had been just a few seconds slower, the encirclement would have been complete, and there would have been no escape.</p><p></p><p>But now, the only ones blocking his path were two people in front of him!</p><p></p><p>"Orange, Little Li, stop him!"</p><p></p><p>The people behind were shouting, and Xue Jing looked at the two people on the road ahead - a scrawny young man in a red T-shirt holding a baseball bat, and a crew-cut young man with a grim expression, hands empty.</p><p></p><p>The distance between Xue Jing and the two was gradually closing, but he showed no signs of slowing down.</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut young man remained motionless, while the bat-wielding youth took a couple of steps forward, raising the bat, seemingly ready to swing it at the charging Xue Jing like a baseball.</p><p></p><p>Closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>Just as the scrawny youth's gaze narrowed and he swung the bat, Xue Jing's body suddenly and sharply ducked down without any reduction in speed.</p><p></p><p>The whistling bat swept over his head, grazing a few strands of hair, and at the same time, Xue Jing, crouching down, clenched his right hand and, as he rose up, delivered a fierce uppercut straight to the youth's chin. With his exceptional aiming skills, Xue Jing's punch landed with unparalleled precision.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of impact was accompanied by a faint cracking noise, and Xue Jing felt a sensation like shattering something on his fist.</p><p></p><p>The powerful momentum from his full-speed sprint, combined with his 180-pound punch, generated tremendous kinetic energy, and the scrawny youth was sent flying nearly a meter into the air before crashing to the ground, eyes rolled back, his neck twisted into a dramatic arc, the skin on his chin uneven and distorted, clearly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The lower jaw had been completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Li!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this kid is a bit tough, everyone be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The people chasing after him cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Jing did not stop at all, he only paused slightly, and then continued to rush forward.</p><p></p><p>The remaining young man with a buzzcut originally had an indifferent expression, but after witnessing that scene, it was clear that he realized Xue Jing was not an ordinary weak student.</p><p></p><p>His expression became serious, he raised his hands, bent his knees slightly, and took on a boxing stance, ready to counterattack. He was fully prepared, confident that no matter which angle Xue Jing attacked from, he would be able to react.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could delay this fast-running student for a while, his companions behind would be able to catch up, and then it would be like catching a fish in a barrel, closing the doors to catch the dog.</p><p></p><p>He stood at the ready, his face solemn, watching the rapidly approaching Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>'Left punch, right punch, or kick?'</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to make contact with Xue Jing, at the most tense moment...</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing ignored him and ran past him.</p><p></p><p>The young man with the buzzcut was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have seen Xue Jing glance at him in a strange way as he passed by, as if saying: "What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck you!" </p><p></p><p>The young man with the buzzcut immediately flushed with anger and cursed, turning to chase after Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>On the street outside the South City area, Xue Jing was running in front, with more than a dozen people chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, looking at Xue Jing's increasingly distant back, everyone gradually stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>"This... this bastard... how, how can he run so fast..."</p><p></p><p>Someone panted, using the machete in his hand to support his tired body, speaking intermittently.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, we've been chasing the wild goose all day, and now the goose has pecked our eyes out. This time we really messed up, we didn't catch the person, and even injured a brother."</p><p></p><p>"What do we do, Brother Duan is still waiting in the warehouse, we haven't even accomplished this small task, I don't know what he'll do to us."</p><p></p><p>"What else can we do, the person is..."</p><p></p><p>The words of the dyed-hair youth were cut off.</p><p></p><p>At the street corner in the distance, just as Xue Jing was about to run out of their sight, he suddenly stopped and slowly turned around, looking at them.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, that bastard, can't run anymore, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's go over there, this dog thing, made us go through so much trouble, this time we'll have to deal with him properly."</p><p></p><p>"My pliers used for tooth extraction are almost rusting, this kid looks like a pretty boy, I wonder if he'll still be able to..."</p><p></p><p>They laughed and walked towards Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The shouts and footsteps behind him gradually faded, Xue Jing realized that he had escaped the danger.</p><p></p><p>The accelerated heartbeat brought by the crisis gradually subsided, but a surge of anger began to burn in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, a bunch of people suddenly showed up and chased him like a dog, no matter what the reason, he would remember this grudge.</p><p></p><p>Reason told him that he should leave immediately, not take any risks, and wait until he was stronger to settle the score, as revenge could wait for ten years.</p><p></p><p>But his emotions told him, fuck reason! He slowly turned around and looked at the dozen or so figures across the street.</p><p></p><p>He opened the panel and confirmed the passive effect of "Twins", feeling confident.</p><p></p><p>He looked around on the ground and saw a red brick about the size of a fist not far away.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing picked up the half-brick, weighing it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Under the bewildered gaze of those dozen or so people, with a calm expression and steady steps, he slowly walked towards them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

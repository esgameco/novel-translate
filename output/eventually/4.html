        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qingcheng High School is the affiliated high school of Qingcheng University.</p><p></p><p>As the affiliated high school of a top-tier university in the outer ring, Qingcheng High School is also one of the key high schools within the outer ring, and the students who are admitted here are basically all worthy of being called outstanding.</p><p></p><p>"...After that, the administrative districts of our Zhuxia were reorganized..." </p><p></p><p>The geography teacher on the podium was saying as he wrote on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Xue Jing's previous life, this planet called Distar, although the national powers can generally be found corresponding to it, many things are vastly different.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference is that in the late 19th century, an event that affected the entire globe, now known as the 'Death of God', occurred.</p><p></p><p>It was also because of that event that the Anno Domini calendar system with the birth of Jesus as the starting year officially ended, and was replaced by the 'New Era' calendar system with the year after the death of God as the new starting year, while the history before the Death of God was called the 'Old Era' and the 'Old Times'.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it is the 267th year of the New Era.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was deftly twirling a pen in his hand, seemingly focused on the teacher, but his mind was actually wandering. </p><p></p><p>He opened his skill panel, and there was not a single skill related to studying.</p><p></p><p>As a student in the elite class of a key high school, his academic performance was quite outstanding. Based on the activation conditions of his other skills, he should have been able to easily activate at least the basic Lv1 skills in subjects like Chinese, math, physics, politics, and history. </p><p></p><p>But on his panel, none of those were present.</p><p></p><p>'Perhaps... these courses can only be considered "knowledge", and not true "skills"?'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing speculated.</p><p></p><p>The skills recognized by the skill panel should be specific abilities, while subjects like Chinese and math are just knowledge stored in the brain, and cannot be considered skills.</p><p></p><p>'If that's the case, then attending class is kind of a waste of time...'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was rapidly twirling the ballpoint pen in his hand, considering whether he should fake an illness and skip class to grind his skills, when he suddenly noticed that the "Charm" skill on his panel was gaining experience again.</p><p></p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, Charm experience +1]</p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, Charm experience +1]</p><p></p><p>He discreetly turned his head and looked around, and his gaze met that of a bespectacled female classmate who had been sneaking glances at him. She flushed with embarrassment and quickly averted her eyes, pushing up her glasses in a gesture of concealment, her cheeks reddening.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>This "Charm" skill was one he had just activated a couple of days ago.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, it's a skill that enhances one's charm and attractiveness to others. </p><p></p><p>The effect is that his mannerisms and expressions will become more charming, and as the skill level increases, his physique and appearance will also undergo subtle improvements, becoming more well-proportioned and good-looking.</p><p></p><p>However, this skill... he didn't need it.</p><p></p><p>In this life, he can be summed up in six words: </p><p></p><p>Naturally a soft rice ball with a godly physique.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need something like Charm at all, as his mere presence is already like a human aphrodisiac.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this is the skill that he least needs, but also the easiest one for him to level up.</p><p></p><p>Because one of the conditions for it to gain experience is if someone develops feelings of "like" or "love" towards him. The stronger the emotion, the more experience it gains.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if he actively does things that make people develop a fondness for him, the experience gain is even greater. For example, when he accepted a towel from a junior girl during physical fitness testing, he directly gained 45 points.</p><p></p><p>This is why, without even deliberately grinding the "Charm" skill, he had already reached Lv2 in just two days.</p><p></p><p>Just casually strolling on the street can gain him a decent amount of experience, so naturally his leveling is fast.</p><p></p><p>'If only the other skills were this easy to level up as well...'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought as he twirled the pen.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At 5 PM, the dismissal bell rang.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing packed up his things, about to call out to Li Ge to leave together, when he noticed a middle-aged man with a slightly high hairline standing at the classroom door, waving at him.</p><p></p><p>It was their class teacher, the Chinese language teacher Mr. Du Shiwei.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xue Jing gestured to Li Ge to go first, then shouldered his backpack and walked up to Mr. Du, asking in puzzlement, "Mr. Du, did you need me for something?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Mr. Du nodded, giving Xue Jing a once-over, a hint of satisfaction in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>This student not only had excellent grades - after all, elite class students were all outstanding - but his physical appearance was also exceptionally good.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there were activities that required finding a few students to make a good impression, pulling him in would add a lot of prestige.</p><p></p><p>And unexpectedly, his athletic ability was also quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Jing, it's like this. I heard from Mr. Chen that your long-distance running performance in the fitness test was quite remarkable. And the school sports meet is coming up next month, so how about participating and helping our elite class win some honor?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Du patted Xue Jing's shoulder and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing instinctively wanted to refuse, as he didn't have the intention to compete. But suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, pondered for a moment, and then nodded, "Since the teacher is saying so, then I'll participate."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Du beamed with delight: "...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then I'll sign you up. Do you want to run the 800-meter event or the 1500-meter event?" </p><p></p><p>Xue Jing asked, "Teacher, what are all the running events?"</p><p></p><p>Du Shiwei counted on his fingers, "For pure running events, there are the 50-meter, 100-meter, 400-meter, 800-meter, 1500-meter, and also the relay race."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought for a moment and said, "Can I participate in all the events?"</p><p></p><p>Du Shiwei paused, "You want to dominate all the events? You've got ambition."</p><p></p><p>"Well... that's possible, but some of these events are on the same day, so physically... can you handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Du Shiwei looked concerned.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded, "Don't worry, teacher. I probably can."</p><p></p><p>Even if I can't now... I'll definitely be able to next month.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing glanced at the "Running" and "Fitness" skills on the panel.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then I trust you." Du Shiwei patted his shoulder again.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go sign you up now. If you really win first place in all of them, it'll bring some glory to your teacher as well."</p><p></p><p>With that, Du Shiwei turned and left briskly.</p><p></p><p>After he left, Li Ge, who had been standing nearby, came over and asked, "What did Old Du want from you?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing adjusted his backpack and walked out of the teaching building with him, replying, "The school sports meet is next month, and he wants me to participate in the long-distance running events."</p><p></p><p>"Did you agree?" Li Ge asked.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's not right, ten out of ten or even nine out of ten is not right." Li Ge fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>He and Xue Jing had been classmates and close friends for many years, so he knew Xue Jing very well.</p><p></p><p>Because Xue Jing was naturally someone who attracted attention, he really didn't lack for attention, so he was basically uninterested in this kind of high-profile event. In the three years of high school, he had never participated in any unavoidable activities.</p><p></p><p>This time, he actually agreed to participate in the school sports meet, and Li Ge seemed to have already envisioned Xue Jing crossing the finish line first, with the underclassmen girls' eyes sparkling with admiration.</p><p></p><p>He didn't doubt that Xue Jing could finish first, given the results Xue Jing had shown that afternoon. Currently, no one in the school could compete with him.</p><p></p><p>"Not only the long-distance run, but all the running-related events, I'll participate in them all," Xue Jing supplemented.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge's footsteps paused, "Outrageous! Xue the old thief, are you really trying to monopolize the hearts of all the underclassmen girls? I see you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing gave him a light tap on the head and laughed, "Cut it out, you have a girlfriend, why are you worrying about the distribution of underclassmen girls?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I was the former student council president, so I have to have a sense of overall consideration for my fellow students..."</p><p></p><p>The two of them walked towards the school gate, chatting and laughing along the way.</p><p></p><p>"You're planning to apply to Star University, how's the preparation going?"</p><p></p><p>On the way, Xue Jing asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge shook his head and sighed, "The prospects are bleak. For an outer ring city resident to get into an inner ring university, the difficulty is outrageous. I tried some past exam papers, and I'm still a bit short of the admission line. Do these inner ring universities really plan to recruit from the outer ring? It feels like a carrot dangled in front of a donkey, visible but unattainable."</p><p></p><p>Star University, or Star City University, is the municipal higher education institution of Star City.</p><p></p><p>Within the Xia Summer realm, there are nine "metropolitan areas", and the cities within the metropolitan areas are divided into "inner ring", "outer ring", and "peripheral".</p><p></p><p>Star City and Qing City both belong to the "Fifth Metropolitan Area", but Qing City is an outer ring city, while Star City is an inner ring city.</p><p></p><p>The inner ring cities are extremely developed, and even Qing City, which is doing well in the outer ring, can only be considered a "rural area" compared to the inner ring cities.</p><p></p><p>If one could enter Star City University as an outer ring resident, that would be a true leap from the mortal to the divine.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing patted Li Ge's shoulder, "Keep working hard."</p><p></p><p>"What about you, do you have any plans?" Li Ge asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"There's only one semester left before graduation. Are you going to directly enroll in Qing University, or are you going to try your luck like me?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing shook his head, "I haven't decided yet."</p><p></p><p>His overall grades were a bit lower than Li Ge's, and if Li Ge didn't have much hope of getting into an inner ring university, Xue Jing had even less.</p><p></p><p>Even if he got in, as an outer ring resident, he would have to pay a hefty "household registration transfer fee" to the school, which was often enough to ruin a moderately wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>Of course, despite this, there were still countless people who were eager to do so, because this was a true class leap.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... I'll go practice martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge frowned, not very approving, "Practice martial arts? That path is not easy to walk, the competition is too fierce, and it's also very dangerous. You don't even have the basics, are you going to deliver meals?"</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm a once-in-a-millennium genius."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the skill panel and said softly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, please continue reading!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

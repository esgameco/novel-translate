        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a few seconds of silence, it pretended not to understand the meaning behind Xue Jing's gaze, let out a "meow", lowered its head, and took a bite of the white rice.</p><p></p><p>It's not uncommon for cats to eat the same things as their owners. As an ordinary cat, it's only natural and logical for it to eat the same things as its owner. There's nothing strange about it.</p><p></p><p>Eating the same things as a human â‰  I am human.</p><p></p><p>Having convinced itself, the cat completely ignored Xue Jing's increasingly mocking gaze. It started to eat! First, it took a bite of the rice, then extended its claws, using them like chopsticks to hook out a piece of spicy stir-fried beef from the plate, blowing on it repeatedly as Xue Jing watched in silence.</p><p></p><p>After blowing on it for a few times, the cat carefully put the beef into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>The delicious flavor spread across its tongue and palate. Having not eaten anything for two whole days, the cat couldn't help but display an almost human-like expression of bliss.</p><p></p><p>As the first bite entered its mouth, it activated its taste buds and opened its stomach, completely breaking through its own bottom line. The cat quickened its pace, alternating between bites of rice and dishes, eating with great relish. Occasionally, it would let out a "rua" sound when it ate too quickly and got scalded.</p><p></p><p>"Eat slower, I'm not going to fight you for it," Xue Jing said helplessly, seeing the cat struggling to hook the dishes with its claws. He helped to transfer the dishes into the cat's bowl, so it only needed to eat without having to move its paws. He also poured a bowl of meat broth for it.</p><p></p><p>By the time the meal was finished, the dishes on the table were almost completely empty, with a third of the food having gone into the cat's stomach - a remarkably large amount for its size.</p><p></p><p>The bowl of rice was licked completely clean, not a single grain left. The cat lay on its side on the table, its belly round and full, looking like it was pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing cleaned up the bowls and plates, wiped the table, and then picked up the cat from the table, placing it on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cat licking its paws like a human picking its teeth, Xue Jing cleared his throat and spoke:</p><p></p><p>"How about it, you've completely exposed yourself. Can we talk now?"</p><p></p><p>The cat's ears twitched, and it stopped licking its paws, looking at Xue Jing with an innocent expression.</p><p></p><p>"Meow?"</p><p></p><p>Completely unaware of what you're talking about, after all, I'm just a harmless little kitty.</p><p></p><p>"...Well, you've had your fill and now you won't own up to it, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing laughed bitterly. He reached out and pinched the cat's face, scratching its cheeks with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>This is one of the cat's favorite places to be petted, and it feels great.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The cat immediately couldn't resist, closing its eyes in bliss and meowing under Xue Jing's actions.</p><p></p><p>It had decided to pretend - as long as it didn't speak, there would be no communication, and no problems would arise.</p><p></p><p>"...Well, let's just go take a bath first."</p><p></p><p>Although it had been bathed earlier, it had gotten dirty again from being carried by Xue Jing, and they had cooked some heavily oily dishes, so Xue Jing wasn't clean either. Thinking about the bath, Xue Jing looked at the cat lying on the sofa, already dirtying it, and reached out to pick it up.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, you're taking a bath with me."</p><p></p><p>The cat hesitated for a moment, then raised its paws in a French military salute, shaking its head like a rattle, its ears flattening back like airplane wings.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>"You can meow all you want, but you're taking a bath, Jesus himself can't stop me, I said so!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing snorted, picking up the cat and heading to the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the glass shower enclosure, Xue Jing brought in a small stool and sat on it, squeezing out some shower gel onto his hands, then started to pet and scratch the now thoroughly wet cat.</p><p></p><p>The cat had already tried to resist, but to no avail, and could only look utterly dejected, letting Xue Jing's hands roam all over its delicate body.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow meow meow..."</p><p></p><p>Speaking in cat language, Xue Jing continued to pet and scratch, unmoved.</p><p></p><p>I can't understand a word you're saying, after all, I'm just a harmless, terrifying bipedal ape.</p><p></p><p>During the process, Xue Jing tried to remove the platinum ring on the cat's tail, but found that although it seemed not tightly fastened, it was as if embedded in the tail, refusing to budge. He didn't use too much force, to avoid hurting the cat, and understood that this thing was likely impossible to remove, as it was a "divine material" with panel certification, and thus had some mystical properties.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly cleaning and grooming the cat from head to toe, Xue Jing nodded in satisfaction and turned on the shower head to rinse it off.</p><p></p><p>Once rinsed, the cat's fur was plastered to its body, looking rather comical.</p><p></p><p>"Meow."</p><p></p><p>The cat started frantically shaking off the water, then prepared to walk out of the bathroom, but was called back by Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing also gave himself a quick rinse, then picked up the cat and walked out of the glass shower enclosure.</p><p></p><p>Heading to the bathtub, he turned on the...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hot water switch was turned on, the temperature adjusted, and the bathtub filled.</p><p></p><p>He then picked up the cat and stepped into the bathtub.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~" "Ah~" The water level rose and spilled over, and both the person and the cat let out sounds of pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing held the sides of the bathtub, lying in it with only his head exposed. The cat was lying on Xue Jing's chest, its head resting on the edge of the bathtub, its tail swishing back and forth under the water, creating ripples.</p><p></p><p>It squinted its eyes contentedly, letting out a purring sound.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you say you're not human."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing spoke lightly.</p><p></p><p>What cat enjoys bathing this much?</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The cat couldn't be bothered to pretend anymore, letting out a perfunctory meow in response, completely unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Lying on Xue Jing's chest, feeling his strong, steady heartbeat, the cat's spirit seemed a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>How long had it been... since it had enjoyed this sense of security?</p><p></p><p>This person, looking thin in clothes, turned out to have quite a build after undressing, those pectoral muscles...</p><p></p><p>Seemingly because it had finally calmed down, the cat also began to notice that the young man in front of it was actually quite good-looking.</p><p></p><p>And once it became aware of this, like a tiny hole in a thousand-mile dam, thoughts started to pour out.</p><p></p><p>The cat couldn't help but sneak a glance at the young man's abdomen...</p><p></p><p>While soaking in the bath, idly flipping through the skill panel, Xue Jing suddenly saw a prompt pop up on the panel.</p><p></p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, Charm experience +1]</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>He shifted his gaze to the cat, his expression subtle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the bath, stepping out of the tub, Xue Jing first used a towel to dry himself, then used another towel to rub and wrap the cat.</p><p></p><p>Then, carrying it to his room, he took out a hair dryer and a comb, plugged them in, and began to blow-dry the cat.</p><p></p><p>While using the comb to smooth the fur, he carefully blew-dried every corner, and the cat had now completely given up resistance, letting Xue Jing do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>Since it had come to this, what else could it do but let him do it.</p><p></p><p>When the drying was complete, a shiny, well-groomed black cat appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The vertical emerald eyes paired with the long white eyeliner gave the cat's face an elegant, charming feel.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded in satisfaction: "Factory reset successful~"</p><p></p><p>At this point, he noticed that the patches of missing fur on the cat's body seemed to have grown back?</p><p></p><p>And the originally bloated belly had also returned to a flat state.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The cat also seemed to have noticed that it had exposed something, pretending to be lazy as it stretched, turning its back to Xue Jing, not letting him see its belly.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing didn't say anything more, turning and leaving the room, going to the living room.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the living room wall, there was a plastic dart board, covered with dense little holes, and the surrounding white walls were also dotted with scratch marks and needle holes, evidently some intense dart-throwing had taken place here.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing took three or four darts from the holder next to the dart board, then walked to the main entrance, the farthest point in a straight line from the dart board, about five meters away.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a sharp dart, gripping the shaft with three fingers, and aimed for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The dart flew out, piercing the dart board with a loud "thud," the sound powerful, giving the impression that the board had almost been penetrated.</p><p></p><p>It didn't hit the bullseye, but at this distance, being able to hit the dart board at all was already quite accurate, worthy of being called proficient.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing threw out the remaining darts one by one, all of them hitting the dart board, with one even approaching the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>Over the past week, he had been spending some time every night practicing throwing darts, hoping to develop a throwing skill of some kind.</p><p></p><p>The living room was filled with the sound of "thud, thud, thud," and during this time, the cat also stepped out of the room on its cat paws, lazily looking at Xue Jing, then jumping onto the sofa, using its paws to press the remote control, turning on the TV and finding an animation to watch on a streaming app.</p><p></p><p>Completely giving up, it had stopped even pretending, other than not speaking.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing just gave it a sidelong glance, resisting the urge to throw a dart at it, and continued the repetitive throwing and retrieving motions.</p><p></p><p>After about forty to fifty minutes, as Xue Jing aimed the dart, he suddenly had a very strong premonition.</p><p></p><p>This throw, he was definitely going to hit the bullseye.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason for it, he could do it easily!</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleaming, the dart flew out.</p><p></p><p>Thud! An unprecedented loud sound, startling the cat watching TV, making it a bit bristly.</p><p></p><p>On the dart board, the dart was deeply embedded in the bullseye, right in the center, penetrating the board.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the panel.</p><p></p><p>[Conditions met, Skill Activated: Aim]</p><p></p><p>[Aim Lv1: (0/300)]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeking to be read (This chapter ends)</p>

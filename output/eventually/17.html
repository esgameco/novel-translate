        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gentle voice of Mother Nan Jiayu came through the phone speaker.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled and put the phone on speakerphone, placing it on the hanging basket next to the stove, while busy with her work, she said, "Not yet, what's the matter? You suddenly called me."</p><p></p><p>This lifetime's parents, although often traveling on business trips, did not love their two children any less than other families. They worked hard to earn money, all of which was spent on their children.</p><p></p><p>"Can't I call just because I want to? I want to hear my own son's voice, is that not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>Mother Nan Jiayu pretended to be angry.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, my dear," Xue Jing immediately conceded.</p><p></p><p>Nan Jiayu then smiled warmly and asked about Xue Jing's recent situation, and the two chatted for a while about family matters.</p><p></p><p>"Your father and I should be back around the New Year, and we'll bring you gifts then."</p><p></p><p>"Also, you have to be careful going to and from school lately, don't wander around randomly, it's best to just stay at home. I just saw the news that there's likely a smuggling gang operating at the border near Chengcheng, and these are desperate criminals. If you happen to notice anything suspicious outside, don't go near it no matter what."</p><p></p><p>Nan Jiayu warned seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing immediately realized that this was the real reason she had called.</p><p></p><p>He comforted her, "Don't worry, mom, I know what to do. If I run into any trouble, I can outrun a dog."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Nan Jiayu expressed satisfaction, then seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, "By the way, have you been in touch with your sister lately?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing: "It's been about half a month since I last called her, but we chatted on WeChat a few days ago. What's up?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Jiayu was silent for a moment, then said, "Yesterday afternoon, Shuang suddenly called and said she missed me and your father."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that normal?" Xue Jing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It is normal, but I just feel like something's not quite right. This child is just like your father - she looks lively on the outside, but actually likes to bottle things up and not let anyone know when she's facing problems."</p><p></p><p>"It might be a mother's intuition, but I just feel a bit uneasy. My dear son, if you have time, please ask her about it. You and Shuang have been close since you were little, and as peers, she might be willing to open up to you if she's dealing with something."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought about it and agreed, "Okay, don't worry, mom, I'll make sure to ask her about it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After finishing the call with Nan Jiayu, Xue Jing looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>His sister Xue Shuang was a very outgoing and beautiful person, a school celebrity since childhood who would easily make the list of campus beauties. Her grades were also always excellent. Although she didn't get into one of the top-tier universities in the inner ring, she did attend a highly ranked school in the outer ring, and had always been someone the family could rely on.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Jing, who grew up with her, knew that she was far from as perfect as she appeared on the surface. She would sleep in if not forced to get up, liked to use underhanded tactics when playing games, had terrible gambling skills and refused to admit defeat, could lie without any guilt, and would even try to trick female classmates into taking her out to eat by "introducing her handsome younger brother."</p><p></p><p>However, the biggest flaw was still what their mother said - she liked to bottle things up when facing problems.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt a bit worried. After thinking it over, he picked up his phone, entered a number, but his finger hovered over the call button without pressing it. Instead, he exited the dialing screen and put the phone away.</p><p></p><p>"I'll call her in the evening instead."</p><p></p><p>He decided to call his sister Xue Shuang late at night when people were more inclined to open up.</p><p></p><p>Putting the phone away, he continued bustling around in the kitchen, cooking a pot of rice and three dishes, his culinary skills increasing by over 50 points.</p><p></p><p>After having lunch with the cat, Xue Jing picked up the lazy cat sprawled on the floor and carried it to his room, sitting down in the computer chair and turning on the computer.</p><p></p><p>With one hand petting the cat's belly and the other on the mouse, Xue Jing planned to look up information about "physical strength."</p><p></p><p>He opened the browser and went to a commonly used search engine website, about to start typing on the keyboard, when his gaze suddenly shifted.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's computer keyboard was black and very dirt-resistant, so ordinary dust and dirt stains were hard to see. But with his enhanced vision after activating his sniping skill, he could clearly see fine black and white hairs caught in the keyboard crevices.</p><p></p><p>'These are... cat hairs?'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing calmly looked towards the cat in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cats.</p><p></p><p>This little thing, did it touch my computer? Thinking about it, Xue Jing did not make a fuss, pretending he hadn't noticed, and began to search for information related to martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Skipping over many useless advertisements and misleading information, Xue Jing finally found some materials on a relatively professional Q&A platform similar to Zhihu.</p><p></p><p>He was absorbed in it, and the cat in his arms also sat up on his lap, looking at the web page.</p><p></p><p>'Hmm? Looking for martial arts information? Is he wanting to practice martial arts?'</p><p></p><p>The cat thought as it looked.</p><p></p><p>'These half-baked articles, full of people pretending to be knowledgeable, can only deceive the uninitiated. What "reaching a high level can produce supernatural abilities"? Is that something you can train for? Without taking banned drugs or implanting artificial organs, even if one is a "breaker of limits" who has crossed the dragon gate, they are still just an ordinary human being in flesh and blood. There are no human miracles in this world, only hard work and technology...'</p><p></p><p>The cat raised its head and looked at Xue Jing's soft jawline.</p><p></p><p>'If he is truly interested in martial arts... after I leave, I can introduce him to that person, as a way to pay the rent for staying here...'</p><p></p><p>The cat thought about it and yawned.</p><p></p><p>After being full, the drowsiness was endless.</p><p></p><p>It curled up and lay down on Xue Jing's thigh, its nose filled with the comforting scent of the young man, slowly drifting into dreamland.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Noticing that the cat's breathing had become calm and long, indicating it had fallen completely asleep, Xue Jing quietly exited the website.</p><p></p><p>He opened the search engine, entered "hidden screen recording software", selected one that met his requirements, and successfully downloaded it.</p><p></p><p>He set it to "auto-start" and "auto-record", then restarted the computer, checked the effect, and found no issues, then turned off the computer.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Xue Jing gently picked up the cat and placed it on his bed, then quietly left the room.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the "gym", Xue Jing looked at the barbell on the bench press rack in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was a standard barbell, weighing 20 kilograms, with two 20-kilogram plates on each side, totaling 100 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>This was the weight he usually used for bench press exercises, and he could even add another 20 kilograms or so if he wanted to challenge his limits.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought for a moment, then picked up two 15-kilogram plates from the yoga mat full of plates on the floor and added them to the bar, then picked up two 5-kilogram plates and added them as well.</p><p></p><p>This brought the total weight of the barbell to 140 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing lay down on the bench press rack, gripped the barbell, took a deep breath, lifted the barbell off the hooks, and lowered it to his chest. With a burst of strength, his muscles instantly tensed, and he pushed the barbell up!</p><p></p><p>The 140-kilogram barbell was slowly lifted, with almost no trembling during the process, indicating he still had some reserve strength.</p><p></p><p>After successfully lifting it, Xue Jing did not stop, but continued to perform bench presses, until he had completed a set of 9 reps, then placed the barbell back on the hooks.</p><p></p><p>He breathed slightly, feeling content.</p><p></p><p>"After activating 'Fighting', my physical fitness has improved significantly, and combined with the over 100 fitness experience points I gained from the fight, my bench press limit has increased by about 20 to 30 kilograms."</p><p></p><p>This increase in weight may not seem too much, but one must know that the training of the human body is subject to diminishing marginal returns.</p><p></p><p>The closer one gets to the human body's limit, the more difficult it becomes to increase strength. It may only take two or three years to go from a 60-kilogram bench press to 120 kilograms, but to reach 140 kilograms is not just a matter of effort. It may take ten, eight, or even a lifetime to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xue Jing's additional 20-30 kilograms of bench press weight is of very high value.</p><p></p><p>After testing the bench press, Xue Jing walked to the freestanding punching bag in the middle of the room, took a deep breath, focused his gaze, and threw a punch! "Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A loud sound, Xue Jing's fist hit the punching bag hard, the leather surface rippling, and one could almost see the wind waves spreading out. The 300-pound metal base supporting the bag suddenly tilted heavily to the side.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing reached out a hand to steady the punching bag, nodding slightly and muttering, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for the gifts, monthly votes, and recommendations.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

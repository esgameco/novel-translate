        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The city of Qingcheng is divided into four major districts - east, south, west, and north. There has long been a saying that "the east is rich, the west is poor, the north is noble, and the south is lowly", which roughly describes the residential segregation within the city.</p><p></p><p>The residents of the East District are mostly wealthy, as the headquarters of large companies and corporations are mostly located there, making it an extremely valuable area. The North District is home to high-ranking officials and dignitaries, where the land is not just valuable, but practically unobtainable even for the rich.</p><p></p><p>The West District, on the other hand, is where the majority of ordinary people live, including Xue Jing's family.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is not an absolute rule - not everyone living in the East District is wealthy, nor are all the residents of the West District poor. It is just a general division.</p><p></p><p>However, the "lowly south" description of the South District is entirely accurate. That area is a true slum, the final destination for all the evils of the city. It is ruled not by the law, but by gangs. Even the public security bureau has no control there - many criminals can simply disappear into the South District, never to be found, except by the security companies working for the gangs behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing has never been to the South District himself. From a young age, his parents and other elders have strictly warned him to never go near that area, so he only knows about it from hearsay.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that Pei Youguang, the classmate who always boasted about his "strong background", actually lives in the South District - albeit on the outskirts, near the West District.</p><p></p><p>"Jing-ge, come on in," Pei Youguang said, unlocking the large door of a seemingly quite sizable house.</p><p></p><p>The exterior of the house looked quite dilapidated, with a square layout and a spacious front yard. The white brick walls were heavily weathered and yellowed with age.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding environment was also one of general decay and neglect, with piles of bottles and cans littering the streets, indicating it had been a long time since anyone cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing hesitantly followed Pei Youguang inside.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, the interior decoration was quite nice, in contrast with the shabby exterior. The gray wood-patterned flooring, the plush carpet in the living room, and the complete set of furnishings all gave an impression of tasteful harmony, if not outright elegance.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing took off his shoes, hung his backpack on a hook by the door, and sat down in a single-seat sofa, asking, "Do you live here alone?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang, who was retrieving a drink from the fridge, paused and nodded. "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing casually remarked, "Why do you live here? Isn't your father working for a politician? Even if he can't get into the North District, he should at least be able to afford a place in the East District, right?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang tossed a soda to Xue Jing, opened one for himself, and took a big gulp before answering, "My relationship with my father isn't very good... This house belonged to my mother. After she passed away, she left it to me. I moved in here two years ago after a big argument with my father."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "There's a Jinfeng Dojo nearby, rumored to be run by a master from the inner city who is a disciple of the 'Jinfeng Baihuang Sword'. After I moved here, I started training at the dojo under their teachers for a few months. But then some things happened, and I quit the dojo."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded, understanding that Pei Youguang had been through some difficulties. "I see."</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much interest in delving deeper into Pei Youguang's personal story. Standing up, he said, "Well, no time to waste. Let's start teaching me the 'Jinli' technique."</p><p></p><p>That was the sole purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang also stood up, tossing his empty drink bottle aside, and prepared to begin the lesson.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He went into the trash can and said, "Okay, Jing-ge, come with me, let's go to the practice room."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This was a large room of about 70 square meters, with a thick soft mat laid on the floor, filled with various fitness equipment, and some machines whose purpose Xue Jing did not understand.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the room were several punching posts and sand bags, made of different materials, all showing signs of wear, obviously used frequently.</p><p></p><p>"The key to developing strength is in the breathing," Pei Youguang began to explain in the practice room, imitating the teachings of the old master in the dojo before.</p><p></p><p>"Strength is the kinetic energy generated by the movement of the internal organs of the human body, but our control over our own bodies is very low. We cannot control the flow of blood, nor can we control the viscera, and even the muscles can only be simply 'tightened' or 'relaxed'. Therefore, we must first learn how to influence these parts that we cannot normally control, and this is where the 'breathing method' comes in."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will teach you a set of 'breathing methods', which is the basic breathing method that every disciple in the dojo knows. Through this breathing method, you can exert influence on the internal parts of your own body."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang sat down cross-legged on the soft mat.</p><p></p><p>"Come, Jing-ge, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing did as instructed and sat down cross-legged as well.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang then began to explain the specific steps of the breathing method, demonstrating while letting Xue Jing follow along.</p><p></p><p>The breathing method was not too complicated, but the difficulty was extremely high. Some steps required extremely long intervals between inhalation and exhalation, needing to inhale a large amount of oxygen in one breath. For people with poor lung capacity, they wouldn't even have the qualifications to practice this.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang had thought that on Xue Jing's first try at the breathing method, he would surely not be able to keep up. It had taken Pei Youguang himself nearly a month of practice before he could barely complete one full round of the breathing exercise.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had a touch of mockery, wanting to see Xue Jing's embarrassed and coughing state. But after going through the entire breathing method, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had actually followed along and completed the entire basic breathing method on his first try! "Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing, not quite adapted to the large intake of oxygen, felt dizzy, his heartbeat racing, nauseous and wanting to vomit, his vision blurred, his whole body seeming to be on fire.</p><p></p><p>This was because the large amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream through the alveoli had caused the blood circulation to accelerate, raising his body temperature.</p><p></p><p>It was a mess, but he had completed it.</p><p></p><p>"Jing-ge, you're amazing." Pei Youguang sincerely admired him, giving him a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>Only those who had practiced it would know how difficult the breathing method was, but Xue Jing had managed to do it on his first try.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the "good innate quality" the old master had spoken of!</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang was filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>"Once you get used to the breathing method and practice it regularly, even making it your own instinct, constantly using it, you can continuously improve your physical fitness. But I haven't been able to do that yet. Right now, I can't practice the breathing method too many times a day, or my body won't be able to handle it."</p><p></p><p>"After you get accustomed to it, you'll gradually be able to feel the rhythms within your body during breathing, and when you learn what kind of breathing can influence and even control them, the strength will naturally be trained."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang said.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing, with his eyes closed, was calming the various burdens that had arisen from his first practice of the breathing method.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he opened his eyes and said, "Teach me again."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang expressed concern, "You've just started the breathing method, let's just practice it once today, and continue tomorrow. I'm afraid your body won't be able to handle it otherwise."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing shook his head, "It's fine, continue."</p><p></p><p>He had already memorized most of the steps of the breathing method, but he needed to go through it one more time to consolidate his memory and ensure he didn't make any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please keep reading!

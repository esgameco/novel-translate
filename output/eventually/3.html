        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spacious sports field, eight high school boys dressed in sportswear were racing on the synthetic track.</p><p></p><p>This was a 1000-meter run physical fitness test.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, although it was just a class physical fitness test, there were quite a few students gathered around the track.</p><p></p><p>Especially the girls.</p><p></p><p>They were wearing inconvenient short skirt uniforms, clearly not here for the physical education class, their gazes were intently fixed on the male student who was far in the lead.</p><p></p><p>As the male student crossed the finish line, the physical education teacher precisely pressed the stopwatch in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Jing, 2 minutes 36 seconds 79."</p><p></p><p>The physical education teacher reported the score with some bewilderment, and the student responsible for recording the scores also paused for a moment, then picked up the pen and wrote down the score in the notebook.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing gradually slowed down his steps, panting slightly.</p><p></p><p>Faint chatter from the girls could be heard around him, but he ignored it, and instead looked at the semi-transparent panel only he could see.</p><p></p><p>[Completed 1000-meter run physical fitness test, running experience +20]</p><p>[Running Lv3 (258/800)]</p><p>'Increased by 20 points, a bit more than usual...'</p><p></p><p>He then looked at another skill on the panel.</p><p></p><p>[Charm Lv2 (89/500)]</p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, charm experience +1]</p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, charm experience +1] </p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you, charm experience +1]</p><p>[Someone has developed feelings for you...]</p><p></p><p>Amidst the flood of notifications, the "Charm" skill visibly increased by 1, 1, 1, quickly reaching (151/500), and although the speed slowed down, it still occasionally increased by 1.</p><p></p><p>'This useless forced skill is increasing so quickly.' Xue Jing sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at all the skills on his panel.</p><p></p><p>[Fitness Lv2 (258/500)]</p><p>[Wellness Lv1 (199/300)]</p><p>[Cooking Lv2 (257/500)]</p><p>[Running Lv3 (258/800)]</p><p>[Charm Lv2 (153/500)]</p><p></p><p>'This is the harvest for this month.' A faint sense of satisfaction emerged in Xue Jing's heart.</p><p></p><p>He was a transmigrator.</p><p></p><p>One month ago, he inexplicably arrived in this world, which was somewhat different from his previous life on Earth, and became a third-year high school student named Xue Jing, inheriting the memories of his previous self.</p><p></p><p>And accompanying his transmigration was this semi-transparent panel in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing called it the skill panel.</p><p></p><p>As long as he mastered a certain skill to a certain degree, the corresponding skill would be activated on the panel.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, as long as he continued to practice this skill-related activity, he would continuously gain experience, and his understanding and mastery of the skill would also improve accordingly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he practiced, the skills would improve, and the effort would not be in vain.</p><p></p><p>For example, "Running", after activating this skill half a month ago, he was able to improve to Lv3 in just half a month, improving his 1000-meter time from the original 3 minutes 42 seconds to 2 minutes 36 seconds.</p><p></p><p>Without much effort, and without professional guidance, he was able to achieve such progress, which was an impossible feat.</p><p></p><p>But with the miraculous skill panel, he easily accomplished it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the level increase of "Running" not only improved his understanding and speed of running, but also simultaneously enhanced his physical fitness.</p><p></p><p>'Is this the joy of being overpowered?'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another male student crossed the finish line.</p><p></p><p>"Li Ge, 3 minutes 22 seconds 17."</p><p></p><p>The physical education teacher...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The stopwatch was pressed.</p><p></p><p>This was a pretty good result for a high school student, but with Xue Jingzhu in front, the physical education teacher's expression remained calm and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge was panting heavily, slowing down his pace, and slowly walked over to Xue Jing's side, supporting himself with one hand on his knee and the other on Xue Jing's shoulder, saying intermittently:</p><p></p><p>"I demand that you take a drug test immediately... You've been taking drugs, haven't you, how can you run so fast..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled and was about to respond, but then saw a group of female students in school uniforms arguing loudly on the sidelines of the track.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a slender, pretty girl with a delicate face walked towards Xue Jing, her face slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>She was holding a stack of white towels in her hands, and her long, slender white legs under her short skirt almost shone in the noon sun.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge also noticed this scene and didn't say anything, silently withdrawing the hand that was on Xue Jing's shoulder and walking a distance away.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he shook his head and muttered, "Futile effort. Our elite class's celestial star, even the girls in our own class can't get him, let alone you little girls?"</p><p></p><p>The girl student holding the towel obviously didn't hear his muttering. She approached Xue Jing shyly, looked up at his face, and gathered her courage to say:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please wipe the sweat."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked around, hesitated for a moment, but still took the towel and said, "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly not expecting Xue Jing to actually take the towel, the girl was stunned for a moment, her face flushing red: "You're... you're welcome."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she immediately turned around and ran back to her friends, her steps a little excited.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she returned, her friends started teasing her loudly, and it seemed that a friend had said some embarrassing things. The girl couldn't help but chase and hit her a few times, occasionally stealing a glance at Xue Jing during the process.</p><p></p><p>The classmates of Xue Jing who were taking the physical education class all saw this scene and shook their heads and smiled, and some female classmates even clicked their tongues, seeming a bit disdainful.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing used the towel to wipe the little sweat on his forehead, not knowing if it was an illusion or because the towel had been held in the girl's arms for too long, it seemed to have a slight fragrance.</p><p></p><p>【Someone has developed a strong fondness for you, Charm experience +45】</p><p></p><p>Li Ge walked up to him, pinching his chin curiously: "Strange, you didn't refuse, could it be that you've finally come to your senses?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm not saying this, but the family's water shouldn't flow out, if you really want to, in our class..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing shook his head and interrupted: "I don't want to."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Li Ge asked.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing spun the towel in his hand like a basketball with one finger and casually said, "Coming over to give me a towel in front of so many people takes a lot of courage. If I had refused, someone with a slightly thinner skin would probably have been psychologically scarred."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Xue Jing continued, "When she really has that intention, I'll just reject her when she comes to me alone."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge shook his head and sighed, "You're so mature, like a corporate slave... It's precisely because of this that these little sisters keep coming over, even though they know there's no hope."</p><p></p><p>"You should just pick someone in the class to have a relationship with, and let the others give up."</p><p></p><p>"Our Qingcheng High School's boys have been suffering from you, Xue Laoze, for a long time. The little sisters are mourning for you, and the little brothers are also left without meat to eat. Aren't you afraid that everyone will unite and launch a dark duel against you?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing glanced at the charm level on the panel.</p><p></p><p>【Lv2 (209/500)】</p><p></p><p>He closed the panel and patted Li Ge's shoulder, "When the time comes, I'll rely on you, my good brother."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge hurriedly waved his hands, "No need for that."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She waved to Xue Jing from afar, forcing a smile, as a way of greeting him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her like this, Xue Jing understood, and murmured softly to himself, "I see..."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why did this junior come here? She's quite brave, not even waiting for the lunch break or school to end, but coming straight to our class to look for you," Li Ge paused.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit nearsighted, and not wearing his glasses at the moment, so he couldn't see the junior's expression clearly. He just smiled at Xue Jing and said, "Be gentle when you reject her, don't hurt the poor girl's feelings too much. Actually, trying to have a relationship isn't a bad idea, with those nice long legs of hers, it's not like it would be a disgrace for you..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing didn't say much, just gave a hum, and got up to walk out of the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Many people in the class had noticed the pretty junior at the door, and after someone had called out, they all knew she was here to look for Xue Jing. Now they were all turning their heads to watch Xue Jing leave the classroom.</p><p></p><p>After Xue Jing and the junior left together, the gossip fire was ignited in the class, and a heated discussion erupted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing followed the junior to the stairwell at the end of the hallway. By this time, since it was almost time for class, the students had all gone into the classrooms, and there was no one else in the hallway.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk here."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xue Jing spoke, the junior's tears could no longer be held back.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, senior, it's all my fault..."</p><p></p><p>She began to explain what had happened, but because she was crying so hard, her words were broken and intermittent. In her emotional state, her phrasing was also a bit difficult to understand, but Xue Jing didn't rush her, patiently listening until she finished, only occasionally asking for clarification on parts he couldn't quite grasp.</p><p></p><p>After the other party finished recounting the whole incident, Xue Jing finally understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>In short, this pretty second-year junior had a classmate named Pei Youguang who was pursuing her.</p><p></p><p>This name was quite famous in the school, and Xue Jing remembered him as the kind of "influential" student bully.</p><p></p><p>The problem stemmed from the incident yesterday during the physical fitness test, when the junior had come to bring Xue Jing a towel.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, the fact that he had accepted the towel from her had been told to this Pei Youguang by a busybody, and this morning the other party had loudly proclaimed in class that he was going to "teach Xue Jing a lesson."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Jing had already guessed that something like this must have happened when he saw the junior come to him with tear-filled eyes, having it confirmed still left him feeling a bit amused and exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'm really sorry, I begged him for a long time not to bother you, but he just wouldn't listen..." the junior sobbed, constantly wiping her tears.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing: "..."</p><p></p><p>Are you sure this isn't just pouring oil on the fire? He was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't know that these half-grown children often didn't think things through thoroughly, he would have suspected that the junior was deliberately trying to stir up trouble.</p><p></p><p>This kind of impulsive young person, who would think of using force to compete, would obviously have an extremely hot-tempered nature. Hearing that the person he liked was pleading for someone else, would only ignite the anger in his heart, and he might even subconsciously feel that he was in the right, that he had found the "soft spot", otherwise the junior wouldn't be so afraid.</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Jing didn't blame her.</p><p></p><p>He nodded and said, "I understand, you can go back now."</p><p></p><p>Then he paused, "...This isn't your fault, don't worry about it, I'll handle it."</p><p></p><p>Does the junior have some problems? A bit, perhaps.</p><p></p><p>But to say how big the problems are, it's not to the point where the blame could be placed squarely on her.</p><p></p><p>Even if Bao Si, Daji, or Yang Guifei had made mistakes, the biggest pot would never have fallen on their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>The junior was very touched.</p><p></p><p>"I've actually always..."</p><p></p><p>She wanted to take this opportunity to say something, but found that Xue Jing had already turned around and was walking back to his own class, obviously not intending to listen to the rest of what she had to say.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The junior understood his meaning - this was a seemingly cold yet gentle rejection. She fell silent for a while, let out a self-mocking laugh, and left dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So the one causing you trouble is Pei Youguang?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ge stroked his chin, having listened to Xue Jing recount the events, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good at all, Young Master Xue."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing took out the Chinese textbook he needed for the first class from his backpack and placed it on the desk, casually responding, "How so?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't really keep up with this kind of news, so you may not know, but Pei Youguang is a very troublesome person," Li Ge explained.</p><p></p><p>"Let me put it this way - if our school had a Sorting Hat like in Harry Potter, he would be sent straight to Azkaban."</p><p></p><p>"He's part of the Martial Arts Club, relying on his martial arts skills to bully other students, and we often hear news of him beating up this person or that person. I've also heard that he frequently harasses female students."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge moved his chair closer to Xue Jing and lowered his voice, "But that's not the worst of it. I've also heard that he's killed someone and even sexually assaulted a female student."</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, there was a female student in Class 7 of the second year who suddenly transferred schools last semester, and it's said that she transferred because she was bullied by him."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing furrowed his brow, "That can't be true, right? If he really did something like that, how could he still be in school?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ge replied, "I thought the same at first, but later I found out that the students he's bullied don't dare to tell the teachers or their parents, and the school seems to be turning a blind eye to it."</p><p></p><p>"So I asked some second-year students, and that's how I learned that Pei Youguang's father works for a member of the ruling council. His background is very powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it, you can understand how a bully like him could get into our school - without a powerful background, how could he have managed that?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the ruling council were considered the highest echelons of power in the city. There were about thirty of them, including a Chief and three Vice-Chiefs.</p><p></p><p>Being able to work for a council member was indeed considered a formidable background.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought for a moment and asked, "Has he really killed someone?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ge shook his head, "There's no specific information about that, but many people have seen Pei Youguang carrying a knife. If he dares to do that kind of thing, it wouldn't be surprising if he's killed someone."</p><p></p><p>"We should still tell the teacher. What if Pei Youguang really tries to do something violent to you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ge was very concerned.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled.</p><p></p><p>This was quite frightening. Most students who heard this would probably be scared out of their wits by this Pei Youguang.</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Jing did not find the other party that terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The workings of the world have their own logic. Many things, as long as one's level of understanding reaches a certain point, can easily see through the surface and grasp the essence.</p><p></p><p>Such evil and heinous acts are absolute taboos in human society. Not to mention having a father who works for a council member, even the council member themselves would not dare to do such things openly, as if they want the whole world to know.</p><p></p><p>Even those at the pinnacle of power still need to abide by the rules on the surface. Let alone a second-rate campus bully in a school.</p><p></p><p>Most students have not yet stepped out into society, their level of understanding is insufficient, and upon hearing these rumors, they will feel fear and add layer upon layer of tiger skin to Pei Youguang, becoming more and more afraid of him.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Jing, on the contrary, the more he heard, the more the tiger skin on the other party was peeled away.</p><p></p><p>Some people, the more they lack something, the more they will emphasize it.</p><p></p><p>"No need to tell the teacher."</p><p></p><p>"I'll have a good talk with classmate Pei Youguang."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing said softly.</p><p></p><p>The bell for class rang, and the homeroom teacher, Chinese teacher Du Shiwei, walked in.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>To be continued (this chapter ends here).</p>

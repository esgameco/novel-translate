        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【You experienced a battle, aiming experience +267】</p><p></p><p>【You experienced a battle, feel very comfortable in mood, health experience +69】</p><p></p><p>【You experienced a battle, martial arts experience +128】</p><p></p><p>【You fully utilized the advantage of your foot speed in the battle, running experience +336】</p><p></p><p>【Fitness level up to Lv3 (188/800)】</p><p></p><p>【Aiming level up to Lv2 (169/500)】</p><p></p><p>【Health level up to Lv2 (38/500)】</p><p></p><p>【Running level up to Lv4 (38/1200)】</p><p></p><p>Prompts kept popping up on the panel one after another.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing closed his eyes, and a numb, itchy, and painful sensation was transmitted from all parts of his body.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that his physical fitness was rapidly increasing, surging, and strengthening!</p><p></p><p>The muscles under his skin were constantly writhing like living creatures, the bones were becoming harder than before, the abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, and thighs... the muscles in all positions began to bulge, grow larger, and then gradually compress, returning to their originally smooth and tight lines, as perfect as if sculpted by a god.</p><p></p><p>His height had increased by two or three centimeters, reaching 1.86 meters. Although his figure had not changed, his weight had increased by 10 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked down at his clenched fists, and his aura was stronger than ever before, with an unparalleled arrogance and wildness. With such a Xue Jing, what in the world could resist him? Damn it, who in the world could resist him!?</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>The gains from this fight, if he had to grind it out alone, would have taken him several days to obtain.</p><p></p><p>If he could experience this kind of thing every morning, noon, and night, it wouldn't take him a few months to become a superhuman.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's gaze turned to the distance. Even in the pitch-black night, with just a faint yellow light, he could clearly see the minute cracks and scratches on the old wall dozens of meters away, as well as the small insects moving on it.</p><p></p><p>Lv2 aiming, the enhancement to his vision was even more exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a small stone and aimed it at the small insects on the distant wall.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—Crack!</p><p></p><p>After the crisp sound, there was a flattened insect pancake on the wall, and the yellow insect blood that had been squeezed out was splattered on the wall.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing muttered to himself, "I can now call myself a 'stone throwing immortal' without any problems."</p><p></p><p>Throwing stones to ask for directions?</p><p></p><p>The immortal points the way!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>By the time he returned home, it was already 9:30 pm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xue Jing did not go to bother that Duan Kaiping, Duan Ge, for two reasons.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Duan Kaiping's combat power was unknown, but it was definitely not low. Rashly going to bother him would be a bit risky.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, if he also beat up Duan Kaiping, the core member of the Razor Blade Gang, then the Razor Blade Gang would definitely come to trouble him, and the lineup coming to cause trouble would be more formidable than Duan Kaiping.</p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't go to bother Duan Kaiping, the current matter would be limited to the conflict between him and Duan Kaiping, or even just his and Duan Kaiping's subordinates, and would not directly escalate into a conflict with the Razor Blade Gang.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he would have more time to develop himself.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The cat stared at the returning young man with a dissatisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled and gently picked it up, stroking its cheek while saying, "Sorry, sorry, I'm back late. Are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>"Meow~" the cat let out a light meow.</p><p></p><p>'I was worried about you, idiot.'</p><p></p><p>Feeling the young man's warm touch on its cheek, the cat narrowed its eyes, somewhat enjoying it.</p><p></p><p>It gently sniffed the young man's scent, which gave a sense of security, but suddenly its brow furrowed, and its pink nose twitched slightly.</p><p></p><p>'The scent of blood...?'</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, I'll make you something to eat."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing placed the cat on the sofa and strode towards the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>He had already eaten takeout at Pei Youguang's place.</p><p></p><p>The cat watched his retreating back, feeling worried.</p><p></p><p>'Did he get into a fight? Or did something else happen?'</p><p></p><p>'That's right, he's so eager to learn martial arts. Could it be that he was bullied outside?'</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the cat couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>This kind-hearted young man, even after knowing that it was a talking 'demon cat', had still taken it in.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had come back, and would make delicious meals for it, and his cat-petting skills were still so good, and he still looked so good... </p><p></p><p>How could he be bullied? Damn it, who could bully him, who dared to bully him!? The cat imagined this, burning with anger.</p><p></p><p>Its cat face had a very anthropomorphized look of gloom and uncertainty, the claws on its white gloves constantly extending and retracting...</p><p></p><p>"Ahaha, the chicken soup is here."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing came out of the kitchen carrying a pot of chicken soup. </p><p></p><p>In a rather cheerful mood due to the gains on his skill panel, he couldn't help but play along with a meme.</p><p></p><p>But the cat, having imagined all sorts of things, felt that his smile looked forced no matter how you looked at it.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's wrong? Don't you like the chicken soup?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the cat with its anthropomorphized gloomy expression in puzzlement. </p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be a shame... he had eaten so full at Pei Youguang's place, if the cat didn't eat this, wouldn't the chicken soup go to waste? A trace of 'sadness' appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The cat could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, tell me, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>A sweet, youthful female voice came from the cat.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, just tell me, whatever it is, I, the Dragon Sect Patriarch Ning Fengning, will stand up for you!"</p><p></p><p>The cat sat crouched on the dining table, its tail with a ring around it swaying gently, its cat face with its long, charming eyeliner filled with majesty.</p>

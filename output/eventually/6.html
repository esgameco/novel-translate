        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was completely bewildered, first suspecting that he had hallucinated, then looking around and finding no one nearby. It didn't seem like someone was playing a prank by making a cat speak. He also checked the cat but couldn't find any audio devices on it.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing pondered for a while and calmed down, restraining his surging curiosity.</p><p></p><p>While talking cats are a common trope in fantasy works, encountering one in reality was somewhat eerie, so it was best not to get involved.</p><p></p><p>He quickly pulled out a few sausages from the supermarket bag, peeled off all the casings, and placed them on the ground. Then he immediately got up, ready to leave.</p><p></p><p>But just as he stood up, the unconscious cat's tail swished, causing the platinum tail ring on it to brush against his finger.</p><p></p><p>[Detected divine substance, attempting to absorb divinity...]</p><p>[Disconnected, failed to absorb divinity]</p><p></p><p>A semi-transparent skill panel suddenly popped up, displaying two lines of text that had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing paused, holding back his steps that were about to take him away.</p><p></p><p>"Well, there's no helping it now. The panel is the foundation of my existence, so to investigate this anomaly, I'll have to take it back with me."</p><p></p><p>He sighed, feeling strangely excited for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing bent down, not minding the dirt, and hugged the black cat with four white paws. The platinum tail ring on the cat's tail also came into contact with his body.</p><p></p><p>[Detected divine substance, attempting to absorb divinity...]</p><p></p><p>On the panel, the originally pale blue transparent interface had streams of golden specks flowing out and gathering towards the bottom. Vaguely, it seemed a new skill was gradually emerging.</p><p></p><p>"Divinity... Sounds quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt anticipation. He held the cat and was about to head home, but then remembered something and turned back to the supermarket.</p><p></p><p>Inside the supermarket, he bought a bag of cat food in the pet section and asked the cashier for a large bag. He put the original purchases and the cat food into the big bag, then with one hand carrying the cat and the other holding the large bag, he left the supermarket and went back to his home.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he first placed the plastic bag containing the groceries and cat food on the table, then sat down on the living room sofa, still holding the cat.</p><p></p><p>Due to the previous panel prompt, he couldn't disconnect the cat's tail ring for now, in case the divinity absorption failed.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what would happen if the "divinity" absorption succeeded, based on common tropes, it was probably not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>The golden specks on the interface were still gathering, and Xue Jing gently stroked the cat with one hand while holding it.</p><p></p><p>The fur was messy and patchy, but upon closer inspection, the cat was actually quite good-looking.</p><p></p><p>The fur color was clean, the four white paws were clearly defined against the body, the whiskers were neat, and there were white fur "eyeliner" lines at the corners of the eyes, making it look elegant and refined - a truly beautiful cat.</p><p></p><p>"This little peculiar one is quite the looker."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing stroked the cat, feeling a sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know exactly what he was anticipating - whether it was the expected changes to the panel after the divinity absorption, or the potential excitement this talking cat might bring to his life.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still 'Xue Jing' after all..."</p><p></p><p>Bringing home a talking cat, the feeling that arose in his heart was not anxiety about the unknown risks, but excitement about the changes that might come to his life.</p><p></p><p>This was the mindset of a young person, not the desire for stability of a middle-aged person.</p><p></p><p>Having resolved a deep-seated doubt within himself, Xue Jing calmed down. While waiting for the divinity absorption to complete, he picked up the remote control and turned on the TV, switching to the news channel.</p><p></p><p>"...The 37th U19 Unlimited Elite Fighting Tournament is about to begin the qualifiers. The young star players from the major clubs are eager and impatient... Today, let's interview one of the seeded players in this event..."</p><p></p><p>"...On the afternoon of October 8th, a brief 'boundary quake' of magnitude 4.1 occurred in Huaijiang Road, East City, Chengcheng. Under the guidance of Councilor Zhu Minyi, the public carried out the emergency evacuation procedure in an orderly manner, and there were no casualties..."</p><p></p><p>"...Kang De Security Company recently announced that it has officially..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"The Kang De security organization announced that they have successfully dismantled the large criminal organization known as the 'Dragon Cult', which has been masquerading as a religious group and poisoning society for over 60 years. In order to safeguard social stability and ensure the safety of citizens, Kang De security will not allow any unlawful elements to..."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, a smuggling ring carrying large amounts of illegal goods has breached the outer city defenses and is heading inland. Citizens of Qing City are advised to take safety precautions..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After some time.</p><p></p><p>[Spiritual Energy Absorption Complete]</p><p></p><p>As this message appeared on the panel, the golden light points floating in the interface began to disperse.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the skill panel, a new skill appeared, written in shimmering golden text rather than the usual black:</p><p></p><p>[Dual Life (Inactive): Divine Skill, Activation Cost: 525/500 Divine Energy]</p><p></p><p>[Conditions Met, Activate?] <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> [Yes/No]</p><p></p><p>"Divine Skill?" Xue Jing's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>It was clear this was on a different level from ordinary skills.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing immediately tapped the [Yes] option.</p><p></p><p>[Activation Successful]</p><p></p><p>[Dual Life Lv.1 (Upgrade Cost: 25/100 Divine Energy)]</p><p></p><p>[Effect: Passive - Possess two lives, can freely choose resurrection time within 7 days after death, Cooldown: 3 months</p><p>Active - Locked (Unlock Cost: 25/500 Divine Energy)</p><p>Divine Avatar: Locked (Unlock Condition: Reach Lv.10, 25/2000 Divine Energy)]</p><p></p><p>"!?"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he had mentally prepared himself, Xue Jing never expected the "Divine Skill" to be this outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Ah board, you've shown your hand, huh? Not planning to just be an ordinary golden finger with me?"</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, the skill panel was still within the realm of a normal person, with unremarkable golden finger abilities, though the growth rate was a bit faster. But with the emergence of "Dual Life", he had directly stepped into the world of the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>This was an unreasonable, physics-defying skill. Two lives, and the ability to choose resurrection time after death - this meant he wouldn't have to worry about being guarded or the embarrassment of immediately reviving only to be killed again.</p><p></p><p>This was an unparalleled life-saving divine technique, not just a one-time resurrection token, but one that could be used again after the cooldown period.</p><p></p><p>Although the cooldown was a bit long, rounding it down, it was basically equivalent to unlimited reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>And according to the panel, this was just the passive effect of "Dual Life".</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why?" Xue Jing felt like there were ants crawling on him.</p><p></p><p>If the passive was this overpowered, the active skill must be incredible as well. But he had to unlock it with divine energy, where was he supposed to get that from?</p><p></p><p>And this "Divine Avatar" effect, what was that...</p><p></p><p>His mind was filled with countless thoughts, Xue Jing's expression shifting between light and dark.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cat in his arms suddenly fluttered its eyelids and slowly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It raised its head, its beautiful emerald vertical pupils gazing up at the Xue Jing holding it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xue Jing temporarily set aside his thoughts and reached out to pet the cat's head.</p><p></p><p>He spoke with some guilt: "You're awake?"</p><p></p><p>He had taken the spiritual energy without the cat's consent, and didn't know what effects it might have.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of excitement, he hadn't paid attention, and now that he thought about it, taking it without permission was a bit...</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Jing considered his moral bottom line to be quite flexible, and would have secretly performed the spiritual energy absorption for the sake of the skill panel, seeing the "victim" wake up in front of him, he inevitably felt guilty.</p><p></p><p>The cat curled up in Xue Jing's arms stared at him for a while, seemingly not yet understanding its current situation.</p><p></p><p>It turned its gaze around the surroundings, then returned its eyes to Xue Jing's face.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light seemed to pass through its emerald vertical pupils.</p><p></p><p>The cat spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~~"</p><p></p><p>That voice.</p><p></p><p>It gave Xue Jing goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading.</p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

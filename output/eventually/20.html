        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After going through the complete breathing exercise again with Pei Youguang, Xue Jing had thoroughly memorized all the detailed steps of the breathing method.</p><p></p><p>This time, the symptoms were the same as the first time - very uncomfortable, but a bit better than the first time, as if he had adapted to it a little.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Pei Youguang, having performed the breathing exercise twice in a row, also felt a bit uncomfortable. He rubbed his head and exclaimed:</p><p></p><p>"Not only did you successfully complete the cycle on the first try, but you've done it two times in a row..."</p><p></p><p>"If the senior teacher at the Daoist temple knew about this, he would probably be jaw-droppingly amazed."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing gradually recovered from the burden of the breathing exercise and said, "Youguang, thank you this time."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly said, "Hey, what's with the thanks? Brother Jing, you're willing to let me teach you, that's doing me a favor..."</p><p></p><p>Although his words had a bit of flattery, he truly felt that way.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Xue Jing, with such talent and innate qualities, anyone could tell that his future was boundless. Now that Pei Youguang could take the opportunity to establish a "teacher-student" relationship with Xue Jing, he felt that he had gained some prestige.</p><p></p><p>This basic breathing exercise is not worth much, but being able to establish a connection with a person of such boundless potential, he felt he had really hit the jackpot.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang sighed, "It's a pity I don't have the secret medicine from the Daoist temple here. The breathing exercise needs to be practiced in conjunction with the secret medicine to achieve the best effect. The senior teacher called this process 'blood cleansing'..."</p><p></p><p>"He said that blood is the fundamental driving force of the physical body, and the cleaner and better the blood, the stronger the driving force provided. Each Daoist sect has different 'blood cleansing secret methods'. In the future, Brother Jing, if you join a Daoist sect, you may be able to learn about it."</p><p></p><p>While listening to him, Xue Jing opened the panel and took a look.</p><p></p><p>[You performed a breathing exercise, Fitness EXP +16]</p><p>[You performed a breathing exercise, Fitness EXP +16]</p><p>[Fitness Lv2 (463/500)]</p><p></p><p>Running the breathing exercise twice, the fitness experience actually increased by more than 30 points?</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang said that the breathing exercise could improve physical fitness, but he didn't expect the effect to be so good.</p><p></p><p>"Completing one full cycle of the breathing exercise takes about 15 minutes, so in an hour it would be over 60 points."</p><p></p><p>While specifically going to the gym, one could gain about 100 fitness experience points in an hour.</p><p></p><p>The breathing exercise seems less efficient than dedicated gym training, but things can't be calculated that way.</p><p></p><p>Gym training requires specialized equipment and environment, but the breathing exercise can be done anytime, anywhere!</p><p></p><p>If he could maintain the breathing exercise 24 hours a day, then by "idling" for a day, he could gain over 1,400 fitness experience points!</p><p></p><p>This is an incredibly rapid increase! Of course, this is currently not possible, as the breathing exercise puts an extreme burden on the body. He had just performed two complete cycles consecutively and already felt that he couldn't continue for the time being, otherwise he would truly injure himself.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, having gained an additional method to increase fitness experience anytime, anywhere, Xue Jing felt very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After about 20 more minutes, Xue Jing felt he had fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and looked around, his gaze suddenly brightening as he looked at a machine in the corner.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang noticed his gaze and smiled, "That's a strength testing machine. Brother Jing, would you like to try it?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang: "Okay, I'll turn it on for you."</p><p></p><p>He ran to the back of the strength testing machine and pressed a button. The screen on the machine's support lit up, displaying the previous test result.</p><p></p><p>[1472N]</p><p></p><p>"The unit of measurement for this machine is N, which stands for 'Newtons'."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Converted to a more easily understandable unit of KG, or kilograms, it's about 150 kilograms."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang looked a bit proud. "This is the data I got with great effort the day before yesterday, isn't it impressive?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled a little. "Mm, quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, "Let me try."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Pei Youguang immediately gave up his spot.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing stepped forward, took a stance, took a deep breath, and aimed at the slightly worn leather pad on the force meter, delivering a powerful straight punch! "Bang!!"</p><p></p><p>A loud explosion, and the entire heavy force meter shook slightly, the screen on the stand started flashing numbers, then stopped.</p><p></p><p>【1773N】.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang's eyes widened slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell!?"</p><p></p><p>1773 newtons, converted to weight, is about 181 kilograms or so.</p><p></p><p>"Jing-ge, you couldn't have secretly trained before and come to trick me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang clicked his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Without using any strength, just pure brute force, to strike out 1773 newtons, that's already around 180 kilograms, that's too outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>He touched the bandaged nose, "No wonder you almost blew my nose off at noon..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing laughed heartily: "How was it, not bad right?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang nodded repeatedly: "That's really amazing, bro. If you learn to harness your strength, you could immediately go take the professional martial arts certification test."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing didn't respond, but instead looked curiously at another machine with many buttons next to them, "What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang smiled: "That's for practicing reaction speed, there are a lot of buttons on it, just like whack-a-mole, whatever button lights up, you press it as fast as you can..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After staying at Pei Youguang's place until almost 8 o'clock in the evening, and making an agreement to come over frequently during this period, Xue Jing finally took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Pei Youguang even asked if he could be excused from the self-criticism recitation tomorrow morning, but was rejected by Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>The main reason Xue Jing had him do it before was to mess with this campus bully, but now having him do it is because Xue Jing genuinely cares about him.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the reputation of being a violent thug is no joking matter.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang is too young to fully understand the consequences, or perhaps vaguely aware of the consequences but indifferent for some reason, but Xue Jing doesn't want him to ruin himself like this.</p><p></p><p>Although Pei Youguang has done many wrong things before, as long as he hasn't committed an absolute fundamental error, there is still a chance for him to correct himself.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing walked on the street, though it was only 8 o'clock in the evening, this street in the southern district was very quiet, with only a few shops still lit.</p><p></p><p>The evening breeze blew, causing the bottles, cans, newspapers and plastic bags on the street to flutter and resonate in the quiet street.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing carried his backpack on one shoulder, walking naturally towards the nearest bus stop.</p><p></p><p>But behind him, about dozens of meters away in a small alley, there were a few people lurking, eyeing his back with ill intent.</p><p></p><p>One of them, a man with a streak of white hair in the front, chuckled, "How rare, to come across a fat lamb this late at night, judging from his school uniform, he's from Qing University Affiliated High School?"</p><p></p><p>Standing among the group, a middle-aged man with a long scar on his right cheek deeply inhaled the cigarette he was holding, slowly exhaling, wearing a sleeveless black tank top, his muscular right arm covered in a shoulder-length dragon tattoo.</p><p></p><p>"Wandering around on our Razor Gang's turf this late at night, can't let him leave without leaving something behind."</p><p></p><p>"With the ability to afford the tuition of an affiliated high school, he should be able to afford the price of his life too, right?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the dining table, the cat stood up on its two hind legs, crossing its front paws across its chest, like a dignified young lady cat. </p><p></p><p>Its face was filled with speechlessness.</p><p></p><p>She had even worried about it to the point of not bothering to pretend to be silent, but unexpectedly, the situation was completely the opposite of what she had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's appearance was too deceptive, refined to the point that anyone who saw him for the first time would think he was a scholarly, intellectual type of man, even though the cat had already seen that his muscles were quite well-trained, it subconsciously thought he was the one who would be bullied.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for worrying about me so much, Little Wen," Xue Jing said lightly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when he saw the cat standing upright with its arms crossed, he found it utterly adorable and couldn't help but reach out to pinch its cheeks.</p><p></p><p>This fight was worth it, and he even got an extra reward. </p><p></p><p>Without any intention, the cat, who was unwilling to open its mouth, ended up speaking up because it was concerned about the bloody scent of the gangsters' razor that clung to him.</p><p></p><p>While feeling touched, Xue Jing also couldn't help but find it amusing.</p><p></p><p>"...Don't call me Little Wen, you must respectfully address me as Grand Mistress!" </p><p></p><p>The cat, whose real name was Ning Fengwen, slapped Xue Jing's hand away, blushing and indignant.</p><p></p><p>In Xue Jing's eyes, the young girl's voice had no intimidation at all, and he nodded and said, "Okay, Grand Mistress Wen."</p><p></p><p>He then reached out his hand again, stroking the cat's head back and forth.</p><p></p><p>If this were a manga, Ning Fengwen's forehead would now be throbbing with veins. She tried to use her two white glove-like paws to stop Xue Jing's caress, but it was to no avail, and she said angrily, "Show some respect for your elders!"</p><p></p><p>When she was pretending to be a cat before, it was fine, she could deceive and comfort herself that she was just a cat, and being petted wasn't a big deal, and she even enjoyed it a bit. </p><p></p><p>But now that her identity was completely exposed, being "frivolous" like this again made Ning Fengwen feel a sense of shame as a human being, spreading from the tips of her toes to the top of her head.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing noticed that she was indeed a bit anxious, so he withdrew his hand. He asked curiously, "Elders? Little Wen, how old are you?"</p><p></p><p>The cat was dissatisfied, "You must call me Grand Mistress. Anyway, I'm older than you."</p><p></p><p>As Ning Fengwen said this, her tone was a bit hesitant, but Xue Jing didn't notice it. He stroked his chin and said, "The Dragon Cult Grand Mistress... is that the one reported in the news?"</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had heard that name in the news reports, apparently it was a "disguised cult organization of a criminal syndicate" that had been destroyed by the Kang De Security Company.</p><p></p><p>Huh? My cat is actually a mafia boss?</p><p></p><p>The cat hugged its chest proudly, letting out a haughty hum with its young girl's voice, "That's right, the very same Dragon Cult. Scared, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>Finding it cute, Xue Jing couldn't resist again, reaching out both hands to cup the cat's head, left and right, and started kneading its cheeks, laughing, "Scared, scared, Grand Mistress."</p><p></p><p>The cat gritted its teeth, "You're not scared at all! Hurry up and let go!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing withdrew his hands and asked, "The news said the Dragon Cult has been destroyed by Kang De Security Company, so are you now all alone?"</p><p></p><p>The cat raised its paw, gesturing to the pot of chicken soup, indicating for Xue Jing to serve it a bowl, then said, "Well... you could say that for now."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing picked up the ladle, scooped half a bowl of chicken soup, and then added a big chicken leg, placing it in front of the cat.</p><p></p><p>"Then what are your plans for the future?"</p><p></p><p>The cat tore off a bite of the tender, soft and glutinous chicken meat, chewed it, and a very anthropomorphized expression of enjoyment appeared on its face.</p><p></p><p>As it continued to devour the meat...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He swallowed it down and said, "You don't need to understand these things, knowing them won't do you any good. I'm just staying here temporarily, and I'll be leaving soon."</p><p></p><p>The cat had a serious expression on its face. Although by chance it had started conversing with this young man, the cat still wanted to avoid involving him as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>A behemoth like the security company, even the official government finds it a headache to deal with. As an ordinary person, if Xue Jing so much as catches a cold, he would be wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Xue Jing nodded upon seeing the cat's earnest tone.</p><p></p><p>Then he casually asked, "By the way, Little Wen, since you're a person, how did you become a cat?"</p><p></p><p>"You should address me as Sect Master." The cat was dissatisfied at first, but then said, "Well, this is because of an item called a 'divine relic'."</p><p></p><p>It extended its tail in front of it, the platinum-colored ring on its tail glimmering under the light.</p><p></p><p>"It's said to be an inheritance left behind by 'God' after their death."</p><p></p><p>"I don't really understand the specifics, I only know that each divine relic possesses amazing abilities, like this one."</p><p></p><p>It swung its tail with the ring.</p><p></p><p>"I bought this from a shady merchant, the serial number is GOD-1391Â·Cat Tail Ring, and its ability is to transform the wearer into a cat."</p><p></p><p>"...But once transformed, I can't change back." The cat's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was struck by an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Serial number GOD-1391? Are there many divine relics? The serial numbers have gone up to over a thousand?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm...there are probably a lot, I don't know much about this, I've only seen this one divine relic, and the serial number and name were told to me by that shady merchant," the cat replied.</p><p></p><p>"...Alright." Xue Jing was a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>This was practically the same as saying nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>His plan to use the cat as a starting point to try and obtain more 'divine materials' for the upgrade and unlocking of the 'Twin Spirits' active effect had fallen through.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't a complete loss, at least he now knew these things were called divine relics, and judging from the serial numbers, there seemed to be over a thousand of them.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the cat, who was currently lowering its head to eat the chicken meat and drink the chicken soup, and suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, there's one more thing."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" the cat mumbled with a mouthful of chicken.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing first flattered, "The Sect Master of the Dragon Sect must have a lot of prestige in the jianghu, and your information network must be quite extensive, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, of course." The cat lifted its head proudly.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I want to go to a martial arts school to train, which one is the best? Sect Master, do you have any recommendations? And if I can get a discount on the tuition fees by relying on your supreme authority, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing made his request.</p><p></p><p>The cat nodded, "About that, I was actually going to talk to you about it."</p><p></p><p>"You've taken me in and let me eat and drink for free, so I should repay this kindness."</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I'll introduce you to someone. As far as martial arts training goes, there shouldn't be anyone more formidable than this person in the entire Qingcheng."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing asked curiously, "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Hidden Dragon Sect, 'Dragon King Ye' Li Qi," the cat uttered a name.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

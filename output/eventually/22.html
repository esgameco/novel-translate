        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Xue Jing walked towards them, someone questioned in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what is he holding in his hand..."</p><p></p><p>A short-haired youth suddenly pointed at Xue Jing's right hand and said, "A brick?"</p><p></p><p>"He can't possibly think that picking up a brick from the ground will be intimidating, haha, what can a brick do."</p><p></p><p>Someone sneered disdainfully, also hefting a metal baseball bat in their hand.</p><p></p><p>The group of people all sneered maliciously as they approached Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>On the quiet night street, on one side were over a dozen hoodlums and gangsters, and on the other side was a lone student in school uniform. The two sides slowly approached each other.</p><p></p><p>As Xue Jing walked forward, he relied on his innate throwing skills and estimated the distance.</p><p></p><p>When the two sides were less than 20 meters apart, Xue Jing stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>'That's about right.'</p><p></p><p>He could roughly feel that this was an excellent throwing distance. Xue Jing then raised the fist-sized half-brick in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"That guy wants to throw the brick, be careful!" someone warned.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the head of a crew-cut youth next to him suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>The red brick fragments scattered everywhere, cutting several wounds on his face, and many shards even pierced his eyes, causing him to let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>As for the crew-cut youth who was hit in the head by the brick, he had already fallen to the ground silently, with a large gaping hole in his forehead, blood gushing out.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"What the hell!?"</p><p>"Did someone get shot!?"</p><p>"No, it was that kid who threw the brick!"</p><p>"Bosheng passed out!"</p><p>"Damn it, get him, hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, some went to support the youth whose head had exploded, some stood there dumbfounded, but most immediately rushed towards Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment Xue Jing threw the half-brick, he unhesitatingly turned around and started running!</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, chase him!"</p><p>"You little bastard, don't run, I'll kill your whole family, fuck you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, everyone was panting heavily as they stopped, staring at the distant figure of the student in school uniform.</p><p></p><p>They really couldn't catch up! And the moment they stopped, Xue Jing also stopped and slowly turned around.</p><p></p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in the hearts of the group.</p><p></p><p>Their premonition soon came true.</p><p></p><p>In the streets of South City, there was no shortage of all kinds of trash.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing picked up a 500ml glass beer bottle from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the hoodlums immediately panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, find cover quickly!!"</p><p>"Make way, let me hide here!"</p><p></p><p>Some were pushing and shoving each other to fight for the position to hide behind a plastic trash can.</p><p></p><p>"Scatter, scatter quickly!"</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, the glass beer bottle flew with a whistling sound, precisely hitting the head of a tall, thin youth who failed to dodge in time.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>The tall, thin youth covered his head, blood constantly flowing out from between his fingers. "He's out of stuff, hurry up and get him!"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be a small leader, and seeing his order, the people around him quickly emerged from their hiding places.</p><p></p><p>But by this time, Xue Jing had already run far away.</p><p></p><p>The group looked at each other, unsure whether they should chase him.</p><p></p><p>"What are you standing there for, chase him!" the tall, thin youth shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the group had no choice but to chase after Xue Jing again.</p><p></p><p>After chasing for three or four times, with full-force running, most of the group's stamina was running low, and this time they didn't chase for long before most of them started to slow down.</p><p></p><p>And as soon as they slowed down, Xue Jing immediately noticed and stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The group swallowed hard, looking at the handsome young student in school uniform who had turned around with a sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The figure arrived.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xue Jing pick up something unknown from the ground once again, someone in the crowd couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Run!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this cry, the people who had already been hesitating immediately scattered like birds and beasts, desperately scrambling towards the nearby cover.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of the way, I was here first!"</p><p></p><p>"What the fuck are you shoving for, get lost!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you bastard, get lost, get lost, get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Facing an enemy they could never catch up to, who would randomly select lucky spectators to blow their heads off if they stopped, everyone genuinely felt a sense of terror.</p><p></p><p>Regret, an overwhelming sense of regret, shrouded everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, which bastard said they were going to catch this high school student!? "Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A rusted steel rod over 30 centimeters long and as thick as a finger flew straight at the crowd like a sharp arrow.</p><p></p><p>"Puck!"</p><p></p><p>A hoodlum hiding behind an iron sheet shed watched the steel rod pierce through the thin iron, just missing his head, and immediately burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>His legs went weak and he fell to the ground, looking up to see Xue Jing bending down to pick something up from the ground in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Mom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The hoodlum immediately started wailing, regretting that he didn't have two more legs as he ran away from Xue Jing's direction.</p><p></p><p>But before he could run far, a small concrete block flew over and precisely struck the back of his head, scattering stone powder and cracking open his skull.</p><p></p><p>"Run, run, run fast!"</p><p></p><p>The people had completely lost the will to resist, gripped by fear, and scurried back the way they came with their heads down.</p><p></p><p>And so the situation was reversed.</p><p></p><p>On the outskirts of the South City at night, a strange scene unfolded on the street.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of young delinquents with dyed hair and tattoos were fleeing and wailing, chased by a well-dressed high school student who looked like a good student.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, the student would pick up some hard trash from the ground and throw it at the fleeing crowd, hitting one after another with deadly accuracy.</p><p></p><p>The weapons in their hands had all fallen to the ground, becoming projectiles for Xue Jing to use.</p><p></p><p>"Here it comes, here it comes again!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother! Dad! Grandpa! Please, don't throw!"</p><p></p><p>"We surrender, we surrender!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was running and shouting.</p><p></p><p>The commotion was so loud that it alarmed the residents in the neighborhood, who opened their windows to take a look. Seeing this absurd scene, they couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't those people from the Razor Gang? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Did another gang come to fight for their turf?"</p><p></p><p>"No, there's a student there, looks like he's wearing the high school uniform."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, how strange, why are they being chased by a student?"</p><p></p><p>A blond youth who could no longer run stopped to catch his breath. At that moment, a nightmarish figure approached him.</p><p></p><p>The blond youth turned around and saw Xue Jing standing before him, his expression cold and sharp, holding a metal baseball bat.</p><p></p><p>"...Brave man, spare me."</p><p></p><p>The blond youth quickly knelt down, his eyes filled with fear, begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The baseball bat swung fiercely and struck his left ear, sending him flying several meters before crashing to the ground, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing, the baseball bat dripping with blood, slowly approached the remaining dazed delinquents.</p><p></p><p>The bat dragged on the concrete, making a clanging sound.</p><p></p><p>His footsteps were unhurried, each one feeling like it was stepping on the hearts of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Step by step.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>How exciting, dear readers! Please keep reading, give me votes, please!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

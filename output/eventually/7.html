        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's expression was somewhat subtle.</p><p></p><p>This cat, did it not learn how normal cats meow? How can it meow like that, so strained?</p><p></p><p>What are you pretending? Xue Jing inserted his hands under the cat's front paws and lifted it up, bringing it to eye level with himself.</p><p></p><p>The cat had an innocent, naive expression, just like an ordinary little kitty.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"You can speak human language, can't you."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was being straightforward, planning to have a good chat with the cat, find out what exactly it is, why it can speak, what the white gold ring on its tail is, how to find something similar, and why this anomalous talking cat ended up in the stray cat world, nearly getting crushed.</p><p></p><p>However, the cat in front of him had an innocent expression, as if saying "I don't understand what you're talking about at all", just like an ordinary cat.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~~"</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend, I heard everything, speak properly."</p><p></p><p>"Meow?"</p><p></p><p>"Just say it, how many cat treats do you want, just say it."</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>The cat licked its paws, indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing raised an eyebrow: "You're still pretending?"</p><p></p><p>He placed the cat on his lap, with one hand pressing on the back of its neck, and the other reaching towards the base of its tail.</p><p></p><p>This is one of the areas with the densest nerves on a cat's body, and most cats really enjoy being stroked there, involuntarily arching their backs.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's nimble fingers kept scratching and clawing at the fur around the tail base, and the little black cat's eyes immediately widened.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!!!"</p><p></p><p>It let out a cry that was almost agonizing, its hindquarters involuntarily raised high, its limbs starting to struggle, but it was firmly held in place by Xue Jing's grip on its neck, unable to move, only meowing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Xue Jing stopped his movements, and the cat had already given up struggling, lying on Xue Jing's lap, completely limp, sticking out its tongue, eyes rolled back, panting, looking like it had been thoroughly played with.</p><p></p><p>But even after suffering such torment, it still didn't say a single word from start to finish, maintaining the appearance of just being an ordinary little cat.</p><p></p><p>It made Xue Jing a little self-conscious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the "Godly Absorption" skill on his character panel had drained away its ability to speak human language? Has it truly become an ordinary cat? If it weren't for that strained meow when it woke up, Xue Jing would have believed it.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Jing really didn't know what to do with it.</p><p></p><p>As long as the cat didn't intend to have a frank and open exchange with him, and just kept pretending, he couldn't really resort to cruel torture to force it to speak. </p><p></p><p>He had just received the cat's favor, his moral bottom line, no matter how flexible, wouldn't allow him to do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he spoke: "Alright then, let's leave it at that for now, are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>The cat let out a weak "meow".</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing took it as a sign that it was hungry.</p><p></p><p>He placed the cat on the sofa, then stood up and went to the kitchen to get a large bowl, came to the table, opened the supermarket bag, took out the bag of cat food, tore it open from the mouth, and poured it into the bowl.</p><p></p><p>Placing the bowl filled with cat food in front of the cat, Xue Jing had expected the cat that had probably suffered a lot in the stray cat world to immediately start eating enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the cat just glanced at the cat food in front of it, clicked its tongue, and unhesitatingly turned its head away, not even looking at it again.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xue Jing suddenly had a thought.</p><p></p><p>This reaction... doesn't seem quite right.</p><p></p><p>This is not the reaction of a picky cat disliking the taste of the food, but more like... a reaction of the food in front of it not even being within its dietary considerations.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's mind flashed with insight, suddenly realizing.</p><p></p><p>He might have misunderstood from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>His mind recalled the words the cat had spoken earlier.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected... the world of stray cats... to be so cruel." This sentence contained two possible implications.</p><p></p><p>The first is that it was a house cat, never having wandered outside before,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So he was not familiar with the world of stray cats.</p><p></p><p>It was because of hearing this sentence, thinking about this point, and adding to the fact that it was weak enough to be bullied by stray cats, that Xue Jing instinctively felt that it was essentially just a cat, and only because of some unknown reason, it had learned to speak human language.</p><p></p><p>But there was actually another possibility... Its unfamiliarity with the world of stray cats, as well as the reason for being able to speak human language, was because it was not a cat at all, but a creature that could speak human language, which had taken on the appearance of a cat.</p><p></p><p>The most likely possibility was... a human.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing narrowed his eyes, didn't say much, and turned and went into the kitchen to start preparing dinner for the day.</p><p></p><p>After he left the living room, the cat, who was unaware that Xue Jing had deduced so much information from its casual actions, immediately stood up from the sofa.</p><p></p><p>It jumped to the ground, walked on cat steps, silently and stealthily came to the corner of the living room leading to the kitchen, poked out half a cat head, and secretly confirmed that Xue Jing was indeed cooking, only then letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>'I didn't expect that my previous attempt to speak would be heard by him.'</p><p></p><p>The cat was a little troubled, its tail swaying slightly, its gaze turning to the ring on the end of its tail.</p><p></p><p>'GOD-1391 Â· Cat Tail Ring... That bastard, he took so much money, but didn't explain the specific effects of this divine relic clearly, and now I can't change back after the transformation!'</p><p></p><p>The cat's face had a very anthropomorphic expression of gritting its teeth in impotent rage.</p><p></p><p>After raging for a while, the cat collected its thoughts and looked around the environment of the house.</p><p></p><p>'This is a good hiding place, the security company's people won't think I've already turned into a cat and hidden in an ordinary person's house.'</p><p></p><p>Recalling the experience of being chased and bitten by various stray cats on their territory, it shuddered.</p><p></p><p>'I'll just stay here and wait until I get used to this divine relic and can change back before leaving.'</p><p></p><p>The cat was planning in its heart.</p><p></p><p>'But... in order not to drag this kind-hearted young man into it, let me just be an ordinary cat.'</p><p></p><p>It knew that the kind-hearted person who was willing to take in a strange cat that could speak would easily be dragged into danger if they interacted and formed an emotional bond.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it must cut off this possibility from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>No interaction means no excessive entanglement, and when the time comes, it can just leave and disappear without a trace, and the two will never cross paths again.</p><p></p><p>'Although he has already heard me speak, it doesn't matter, all of this is his illusion, as long as I make him think he is just a cat-loving young man who hallucinates, that's fine!'</p><p></p><p>'As long as I don't admit it myself and pretend to be an ordinary cat, no one can expose me!'</p><p></p><p>Having made up his mind, the cat nodded in satisfaction, its tail standing up and swinging back and forth in joyful mood.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had been busy in the kitchen for a long time, making simple home-cooked dishes of spicy stir-fried beef, bitter gourd scrambled eggs, and tomato-braised meat soup.</p><p></p><p>[You have completed a dish, Cooking experience +20]</p><p>[You have completed a dish, Cooking experience +21]</p><p>[You have completed a dish, Cooking experience +20]</p><p>[Cooking Lv2 (318/500)]</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing opened the refrigerator, took out the leftover rice from yesterday, filled two bowls, and heated them in the microwave. After they were hot, he brought them all out and placed them on the dining table.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything, picked up one of the bowls of rice, and started eating.</p><p></p><p>The cat, which had been hungry for two days and was planning to force itself to eat cat food, looked at the delicious-smelling dishes on the table, its eyes widening.</p><p></p><p>The aroma formed a seductive little hand, pinching its nose, making it unconsciously approach the dining table, not even noticing that it had knocked over the bowl of cat food.</p><p></p><p>By the time it came to its senses, it found itself already sitting at the dining table, with another bowl of white rice in front of it.</p><p></p><p>It turned its head awkwardly, and saw the handsome young man beside it eating his rice, looking at it with a half-smile, as if saying, "You're still pretending?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading.</p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

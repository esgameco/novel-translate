            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A housewarming banquet was held, and aside from the group that came to seek old grudges, the hosts and guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves.</p><p></p><p>During the banquet, there was a segment for presenting congratulatory gifts and reading the gift list. In addition to the many Daoist temples, companies, and Li Qi's old friends who sent gifts, there were also many unexpected congratulations.</p><p></p><p>There were gifts from people in attendance that most did not recognize, with the names "Bai Ya" and "Zhige" written on them.</p><p></p><p>Among them, "Bai Ya" sent a long list of gifts, all of which were precious medicinal materials that were extremely beneficial for tempering the human body.</p><p></p><p>As for "Zhige", they sent a framed, yellowed and ancient painting depicting a reclining Buddha on a lotus platform, titled "The Sleeping Lion's Nirvana".</p><p></p><p>Most of the people present were quite puzzled by the names of the gift-givers, but a few people changed expressions upon hearing the names, indicating a new understanding of the current power of the Zanglong Sect.</p><p></p><p>Only a few elderly figures of high standing in the jianghu recognized the "Sleeping Lion's Nirvana" painting and showed intense interest.</p><p></p><p>What was even more shocking to the entire gathering was the congratulatory gift from Chu Minyi, the newly appointed chief legislator of the Qingcheng government. Although the gift itself was not particularly precious, everyone present knew that the true gift was his public display of support for the Zanglong Sect.</p><p></p><p>There were also many gifts without specific names, three of which were simply labeled "From Source City", "From Star City", and "From Yu City" respectively, with unremarkable contents that left people puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching gift, however, was one with no annotations at all - a nine-foot long spear called "Night Trimming Ice".</p><p></p><p>The entire spear was a deep, dark blue color, and under the light, it would flash slightly different hues from different angles, stunningly beautiful and with an extremely sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists present could tell at a glance that this was an exceptionally rare and powerful weapon, the kind that was nearly impossible to obtain even with money, and must have been crafted by a renowned master.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qi, the main recipient, was puzzled as to who had sent this divine weapon, but Xue Jing's eyes flashed with a hint of understanding.</p><p></p><p>The housewarming banquet then came to an end, and the next day, the Zanglong Sect officially opened.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's photo was displayed on the large electronic screen outside the venue, alongside the hole made by Meng Bo's collision, temporarily covered with a cloth.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the venue, a dense crowd of people eager to enter the Zanglong Sect and train in the martial arts gathered, facing the screen with the young man's image. In just one day, nearly a thousand new students had been recruited, after the senior disciples had made a preliminary selection of the most suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation room, Xue Jing sat cross-legged in the center, gently caressing the nine-foot long spear resting on his lap.</p><p></p><p>The dark blue hue of the spear shaft shifted in small ranges under the sunlight, with the parts directly illuminated appearing slightly transparent, like crystal, stunningly beautiful. The sharp spearhead, nearly half a meter long, had two serrated edges below, adding a touch of ferocity to the elegant weapon.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's fingers traced the inconspicuous rectangular engraving near the butt of the spear, which had the three characters "Night Trimming Ice" written in small seal script, with "He Jiuxi" engraved in an even smaller font in the lower right corner.</p><p></p><p>"He Jiuxi..." Xue Jing murmured thoughtfully. He had heard this name before - Zhu Shijie had mentioned it when she gave him the Subduing Rabbit Knife, saying it was forged by a master named He Jiuxi.</p><p></p><p>And now, this "Night Trimming Ice" spear also had He Jiuxi's name engraved on it, so it must have been crafted by the same master.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing surmised that the Subduing Rabbit Knife was likely not one of He Jiuxi's most satisfactory works, while the Night Trimming Ice was something he was proud enough of to engrave his name on.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing lifted the spear, swinging it in a graceful arc through the air, the sharp tip cutting through the space and emitting a shrill whistle, leaving visible shockwaves in its wake. Xue Jing nodded in approval, feeling that with this spear, his Seamless Celestial technique would gain at least 50% more killing power.</p><p></p><p>He gently caressed the spear shaft, murmuring the names of the weapons he had received - the Subduing Rabbit Knife, the Forgotten Giant Sword, and now the Night Trimming Ice. Based on Zhu Shijie's words, the Subduing Rabbit Knife came from her grandfather's collection, so the Night Trimming Ice and likely the Forgotten Giant Sword were also from him.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing deduced that the mysterious figure behind Zhu Shijie, who seemed to be both helping and testing him, was most likely her grandfather - an elderly man who seemed to have a fondness for collecting rare weapons.</p><p></p><p>He surmised that this elderly man, knowing Xue Jing had mastered the Seamless Celestial technique, had sent the "Night Trimming Ice" as a congratulatory gift. But Xue Jing was still puzzled by the lack of contact with Zhu Shijie.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, Xue Jing decided not to dwell on it for now, and simply be grateful for the gift. He then summoned his Nonexistent Beast to carefully store the spear away.</p><p></p><p>Turning his gaze to the ancient "Sleeping Lion's Nirvana" painting on the wall, Xue Jing knew this was the gift sent by "Zhige", the "Beautiful Commander" that Ning Yuantai had confirmed. Xue Jing did not fully understand the significance of this painting, but according to the awestruck Li Qi, it was an extremely rare and precious Buddhist relic.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the original painting does not appear extraordinary at first glance, and is open for anyone in the world to freely observe. Only the Buddhist masters with profound understanding and exceptional enlightenment can perceive the unique qualities within, and reproduce the mystical painting that contains the 'Nirvana Skill'."</p><p></p><p>"The realm of the original painting must be too high, returning to the essence, which is why ordinary people cannot comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing gazed at the Nirvana painting, his eyes deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>The secret Nirvana Skill of the Buddhist sect is renowned as the number one sleeping technique in the world. Its effects are numerous - it can rapidly replenish physical strength and energy, purify the mind, calm the emotions, enhance the spirit, eliminate afflictions, resolve inner demons, and even prolong life... its benefits are almost unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>When mastered to a high level, it can even gradually cultivate the mighty strength of a lion king through the lion's reclining posture.</p><p></p><p>It is said that Sakyamuni Buddha never practiced any martial arts, yet he could effortlessly lift and throw a huge elephant into the sky, only for it to fall back to earth and create a massive crater three sunsets later.</p><p></p><p>In his later years, Sakyamuni Buddha grew to be over eighteen feet tall, and could single-handedly lift and toss a huge square stone, sixty feet wide and one hundred and twenty feet long, into the sky until it disappeared from sight, then catch it with his bare hands upon its descent. Such godly strength is almost mythical.</p><p></p><p>Even in modern times, Buddhist practitioners who have mastered the Nirvana Skill possess a towering, powerful physique that surpasses their peers, with few other sects able to rival the Buddhist disciples in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had often seen online videos of emaciated ascetic Buddhist monks who, despite appearing frail and struggling to even hold a bowl, could easily lift massive boulders or uproot large trees - a truly astonishing visual effect, all thanks to their profound Buddhist cultivation and mastery of the Nirvana Skill.</p><p></p><p>"The effects are excellent, but the cultivation requirements are exceptionally high, perhaps even surpassing the Taoist cultivation required for the Yellow Maiden Skill by several levels."</p><p></p><p>"Not only does it demand profound Buddhist knowledge, but more importantly, it requires a deep understanding of Buddhist principles. Even if ordinary people try to imitate the paintings, at most they can only achieve better sleep and slightly improved health."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing rested his elbow on his knee and supported his chin with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"However... for me, no matter how high the requirements, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it has anything to do with 'martial arts', be it Buddhist secret techniques or Taoist esoteric books, in the face of 'True Martial Arts'..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing calmed his mind and focused intently on the painting on the wall, completely immersed in visualizing the scene within.</p><p></p><p>Incredibly, without any difficulty or obstacles, he gradually formed a vivid, realistic scene in his mind based on the painting.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sala trees, on the great enlightenment lotus throne, a colossal Buddha statue, six point one meters tall, lay peacefully on the lotus, its perfect physique embodying the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a Buddha, the pinnacle of human beauty.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the ten great disciples stood by his side, with millions of devotees worshipping, the fragrance of incense wafting, and melodious chants resounding as the Buddha slowly closed his compassionate indigo eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the scene became increasingly clear, waves of Buddhist principles began to spontaneously arise in Xue Jing's mind, and together with the visualized Buddha, his eyes gradually closed, his expression radiating compassion.</p><p></p><p>If there were any Buddhist practitioners present, they would be utterly astonished to witness the compassionate aura gradually emanating from Xue Jing. Either he was the reincarnation of a Buddha, or he was a legendary figure on par with the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, a naturally enlightened person capable of founding a new Buddhist school.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing immersed himself in the boundless Buddhist principles that had spontaneously arisen, and his body naturally shifted into the Nirvana reclining posture - lying on his right side, head facing north and west, left leg over the right, right hand supporting his head, left hand resting by his side, like a lion king resting on the grassland, or the Buddha entering Nirvana on the lotus throne, serene and pure.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he entered a state of sleep, and his body began to activate the self-regulating mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Countless qi currents spontaneously generated and circulated through his body along intricate pathways, his spiritual consciousness expanding outward, subtly influencing the transformation of his physical form.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden glow began to emanate from his skin, which became increasingly smooth and taut. At the microscopic level, the connections between his cells seemed to have strengthened, the gaps becoming smaller and tighter.</p><p></p><p>His tendons, flesh, bones, organs, and brain... all were undergoing subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>The door to the cultivation room slowly opened, and a small head peeked in.</p><p></p><p>As Zong Shichan entered, she saw Xue Jing lying in the Nirvana posture, his breathing deep and even, his body radiating a golden light as if he were in a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>She quickly covered her mouth, knowing that Xue Jing was cultivating and did not want to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Silently closing the door, Zong Shichan knelt down and watched Xue Jing with a mesmerized gaze.</p><p></p><p>As she watched, her thoughts shifted from "Master looks so good" to "Master is truly great."</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, she clasped her hands together in a reverent gesture, bowing slightly towards Xue Jing like a devotee worshipping a Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Xue Jing slowly opened his eyes, awakening from his sleep.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were crystal clear, with a pure indigo hue, like a newborn child, without a trace of impurity.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura emanated from him, majestic yet filled with boundless compassion, enveloping the entire cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>After briefly assessing the changes in his body, Xue Jing blinked and opened his status panel.</p><p></p><p>[Conditions met, skill 'Sleep' activated]</p><p></p><p>Sleep...</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>This was a skill that was naturally expected, yet it had only just now been activated? Thinking about it, he understood.</p><p></p><p>The activation of skills in the status panel required a certain level of proficiency. For example, everyone in their daily lives acts and plays different roles, but Xue Jing had only recently activated the [Acting] skill after having the status panel for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, while ordinary sleep is something everyone experiences, Xue Jing had not previously met the requirements to activate the [Sleep] skill, as his sleep was not professional enough.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly making me speechless," Xue Jing muttered in exasperation.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to check his attributes after cultivating the Nirvana Skill, he noticed his young disciple kneeling beside him, her hands clasped in a reverent gesture, her expression devout.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing frowned slightly, reaching out to pat Zong Shichan's head, gently releasing and retracting his spiritual aura.</p><p></p><p>"Wah!!" Zong Shichan gasped, like a drowning person finally rescued, and looked at Xue Jing with a pitiful expression. "Master..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

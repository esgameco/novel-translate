        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her long, silky black hair was so smooth that it could be used for a commercial shoot. She had tied it up into a high ponytail with a white hair tie, the ends reaching down to her waist. Her bangs framed her calm and focused eyes as she intently read the book cradled in her hands, occasionally turning the pages with her neatly trimmed fingers.</p><p></p><p>Likely due to her intense focus on reading, the arrival of Xue Jing did not elicit any reaction from the young girl.</p><p></p><p>'Not a student of Qing Da, judging by her age... Probably a young-looking university student.'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the girl with some surprise, pausing briefly on her slightly purple-tinged beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>She wasn't wearing a school uniform, so she likely wasn't a high school student from the nearby school. She was probably a university student who looked younger than her actual age.</p><p></p><p>He didn't pay too much attention and turned to walk towards the bookshelves.</p><p></p><p>The seventh floor had a total of four rows of sixteen double-sided wooden bookshelves, covering three walls completely, leaving only a small reading area. All the shelves were packed, even crammed, with dense rows of old books and documents.</p><p></p><p>The collection was truly astonishing. </p><p></p><p>Without any computer-based search and retrieval system, and with the books not even categorized, finding the desired information in this sea of books would be an arduous task. It was no wonder this place was rarely visited.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing randomly selected a row of shelves, walking to the middle. He looked at the messy arrangement of old documents before him, unsure of where to start.</p><p></p><p>He randomly picked up a book that seemed relatively intact, wiping off the dust. The burgundy hardcover had no images, only a white book title written in Song script in the center, and the author's name and publication year in smaller white text in the bottom right corner.</p><p></p><p>"Conjectures on the Phenomenon of Overlapping Realms", author: Ning Furan, published in New Era Year 87.</p><p></p><p>'An antique book from nearly two hundred years ago...'</p><p></p><p>The overlapping of realms was a unique phenomenon that appeared on the planet after the "death of God".</p><p></p><p>Just as the literal meaning suggests, the overlapping of realms refers to "two worlds overlapping with each other".</p><p></p><p>If one were to imagine the world as a car constantly driving on the road, then the overlapping of realms would be two cars colliding with each other.</p><p></p><p>This phenomenon would cause a part of the "bodies" of the two worlds to become embedded in each other, and the overlapping area is called the "border region".</p><p></p><p>The globally accepted explanation for this occurrence is that the "driver" has died.</p><p></p><p>Without "God" the driver controlling the direction, the cars are recklessly colliding with each other on the road.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing flipped through the book, skimming a couple pages. The theories contained within were flawed by today's standards, but at the time, it was cutting-edge research that laid an indelible foundation for the current understanding of the overlapping phenomenon. While outdated as a theoretical work, it was still a valuable historical document.</p><p></p><p>Placing the book back in its spot, Xue Jing continued his needle-in-a-haystack search, looking for clues related to "divine material".</p><p></p><p>Over an hour later.</p><p></p><p>After briefly flipping through the "Chronicles of the Eternal Night War" file in his hands, he returned it to the shelf.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing shook his head - as he had expected, there was no harvest.</p><p></p><p>Though not unexpected, he was not disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Collecting himself, Xue Jing checked the time on his phone - it was already 7:30 PM, time for class.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he noticed the young girl he had seen earlier in the reading area approaching him, carrying a book in both hands.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's gaze fell on the well-developed area of the girl's body - but not to look there, rather at the book she was holding.</p><p></p><p>It was a thick book, about three fingers wide, bound in black hardcover. The cover featured a strange painting.</p><p></p><p>A luminous humanoid figure with countless wings sprouting from its head to toe, radiating a brilliant glow. It held a glowing blue Earth in its ethereal hands, its faceless head tilted upwards as if shouting something. The light flowed down its body like blood, cascading into an unknown abyss below.</p><p></p><p>The meaning behind this cover was known to everyone in the world - it represented the "death of God", or more accurately, the "death of the divine".</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing had seen similar imagery in countless paintings, films, and games.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the book title.</p><p></p><p>"If God Had Not Died".</p><p></p><p>He politely nodded at the girl as she passed by him. Up close, he noticed her features were quite pretty and clean-cut - not the type to immediately captivate, but the kind that grew more and more attractive the more one looked.</p><p></p><p>The girl nodded back at him and then tried to squeeze the book into the empty space on the top shelf, but her height made it a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xue Jing spoke up softly, "Let me help you with that."</p><p></p><p>He reached out...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He gestured to the young girl to give him the book, and she did not refuse, handing the book to Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xue Jing easily place the book on the top shelf without needing to stand on tiptoe, the girl blinked her clear, slightly purple-tinged eyes and said, "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing hummed in acknowledgment, not thinking much of this small favor.</p><p></p><p>After doing this, he did not linger, but walked straight out of the library and towards the teaching building of the affiliated school.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>By the time he stepped into the classroom, the morning reading was about to end and class was about to officially begin.</p><p></p><p>All the students in the class had already arrived, and except for a few students whispering softly, the vast majority were silently flipping through books or reviewing materials.</p><p></p><p>The students in this elite class were still under a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing got along well with his classmates in this class, and although the atmosphere during the morning reading was not very suitable for conversation, many of his classmates still nodded at him in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing responded to them one by one, but when he reached his own seat, he stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>His desk and chair had been scratched up.</p><p></p><p>The wood-based fiber board was covered in criss-crossing scratches, looking unsightly, and there were also many words written on the desk, mostly threats like "Kill, kill, kill," "You're dead," and "Be careful on your way home from school."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, the handwriting is really ugly," Li Ge said as he walked over and looked at the words on Xue Jing's desk.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Xue Jing's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bullying incident happening to himself, not just a high school student, but even an adult, would at least make one feel a little uneasy. </p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he was just as calm on the inside as he appeared on the outside, only purely curious to know what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Just as people who are accustomed to fitness are generally very self-confident, the strength of the body will naturally bring about the strength of the mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing the bullying tactics of high school students, he felt like a lion looking at a small cat trying to snarl at him.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, it was already like this when I came in this morning," Li Ge shrugged, leaning against the desk next to Xue Jing's.</p><p></p><p>"The drawers were also stuffed with some disgusting things like dead rats and cockroaches, I helped you clean them out, it's just that the words on the desk are written in oil-based pen, so there's not much we can do about them for now."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing patted him on the shoulder and sincerely thanked him, "Thanks."</p><p></p><p>"What are you thanking me for, we're buddies." Li Ge replied, then said, "The top priority now is to find the culprit, otherwise having to deal with this every day will just make me sick."</p><p></p><p>"Have you offended anyone recently?" </p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought carefully, and felt that he had been quite well-behaved and didn't seem to have provoked anyone.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but it doesn't matter. Judging from the words written on the desk, this isn't a small-time prank by someone too cowardly to show their face, but a threatening warning."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing ran his fingers over the scratched surface of the desk, pausing on the words "Be careful on your way home from school."</p><p></p><p>"Probably someone will come out on their own during lunch break or after school, just wait and see."</p><p></p><p>People who are excellent enough will naturally block others' paths, even if they haven't done anything wrong, and incur the resentment of others. This is something he has experienced both in his past and present lives.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to reflect on what he might have done wrong, thinking about that is meaningless. Just deal with the issue at hand, that's enough.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing sat down in the chair, intending to put his backpack in the drawer, but stopped halfway, feeling a bit disgusted, since dead rats and cockroaches had been put there before. So he hung the backpack on the hook on the side of the desk instead.</p><p></p><p>Then he crossed his arms and closed his eyes, preparing for class.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xue Jing's carefree and unruffled manner as if nothing had happened, Li Ge couldn't help but exclaim, "How cool, Xing-ge."</p><p></p><p>"But why don't we choose to tell the teacher?" Li Ge asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing, with his eyes closed, casually replied, "Just like reporting to the police isn't a panacea, the teachers aren't omnipotent either. Telling the teacher might be able to solve this problem, but the process will definitely be troublesome, and there will most likely be lingering issues."</p><p></p><p>"I have a simpler way to deal with this, no need to find the teacher."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge hummed in acknowledgment, fell silent for a while, then couldn't help but say, "You seem so cool, with a strange aura of an adult... or rather, the composure of a strong person? The way you just said those few sentences was so imposing..."</p><p></p><p>As the two were chatting, suddenly a shout came from the classroom door: "Xue Jing, someone is looking for you!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing turned his head to look, and at the door stood a beautiful female student in a school uniform skirt. </p><p></p><p>It was the same student who had brought him a towel during the physical fitness test the day before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>To be continued (this chapter ends here).</p>

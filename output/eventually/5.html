        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After greeting the security guard, I entered the community and came to the entrance of my own residential building. I took the elevator up to the 9th floor and unlocked the door.</p><p></p><p>After entering, I tossed my backpack onto the sofa, stretched my body, and then went into the "gym".</p><p></p><p>Though it's called a gym, it was originally a storage room. After my skill panel awakened, I cleared out the clutter and purchased some fitness equipment, turning this place into a small gym. I spent almost all of my monthly living expenses on this.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in this life I did not become an orphan in the Heavenly Realm Orphanage, but have both my parents, and even an older sister who just started university last year. Although the family is not wealthy, it is still a relatively happy one.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that my parents are very busy with work, often traveling on business trips, and my sister Xue Wan has been studying out of town since last year, leaving me basically living alone.</p><p></p><p>I first did some stretching exercises, then stepped onto the treadmill, started it up, and adjusted the speed to 12 km/h, planning to run for ten minutes to warm up.</p><p></p><p>As I was running, I fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"When I ran 1,000 meters during the physical test at noon, I gained 10 more experience points than when I normally run 1,000 meters..."</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean that 'participating in specific events' is the key to quickly gaining experience?"</p><p></p><p>The reason I agreed to the class teacher Du Shiwei's request to participate in the school sports meet was to confirm this point.</p><p></p><p>If this is indeed the method to gain more experience, then a regular daily physical test can already increase my experience gain, so participating in an official competition should lead to an even greater increase.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An hour later, I was drenched in sweat and panting heavily. I twisted open a 500ml bottle of mineral water and drank it all in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>I opened my status panel.</p><p></p><p>[You have completed an arduous workout, Fitness experience +98]</p><p>[Fitness Lv2 (356/500)]</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, I felt the changes in my body.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, just going by feel, I can't really tell any difference.</p><p></p><p>But I know that my physical fitness has improved further.</p><p></p><p>The changes in skill experience values are reflected in real-time on my body, not just when I level up.</p><p></p><p>"The Fitness skill doesn't really require dedicated training in the gym. It's not worth the effort," I mused.</p><p></p><p>From what I've learned, the Fitness skill can comprehensively enhance all aspects of my physical condition, and is a very useful skill that I want to focus on grinding experience for.</p><p></p><p>But this skill doesn't actually need me to specifically exercise in the gym. </p><p></p><p>Based on my observations, the way this skill gains experience is through 'any physical activity that exercises the body'.</p><p></p><p>For example, when I run, I not only gain experience in Running, but also gain some Fitness experience at the same time.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then doing other physical activities that exercise my body can also increase my Fitness experience, without needing to spend time using fitness equipment.</p><p></p><p>Like... practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts in this world are far more advanced than in my previous life. </p><p></p><p>I've seen online videos of martial artists easily kicking their opponents dozens of meters away, leaving an imprint on the wall.</p><p>The movements are unbelievably fast.</p><p></p><p>I also want to learn martial arts, but... I don't know where to start.</p><p></p><p>Soon after my skill panel awakened, I tried following videos and manuals online, but so far my panel still hasn't shown any progress.</p><p></p><p>Activating skills doesn't just come from random practice, you need the real thing, otherwise I would have already gained a bunch of skills by now.</p><p></p><p>There are a few martial arts dojos in Qingcheng, but the fees are absurdly expensive, more than I can afford. I also don't want to ask my parents for the money, because it's really too expensive.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can get my foot in the door, with my unparalleled natural talent and world-shocking wisdom, I'll be able to easily cultivate an invincible, godly martial art skill." I thought confidently.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how talented or intelligent he was, without a master to guide him, even a skilled woman would be unable to cook a meal without rice. The skill panel could raise his abilities from 1 to 100, but it could not create something from nothing.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing rested for a while, then got up and went to the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He washed his hair, thoroughly cleaned his body, then soaked in the bathtub for fifteen minutes, relieving all his fatigue, though his muscles were still a bit sore.</p><p></p><p>In the bathroom, Xue Jing looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>This was a very elegant appearance, intellectual yet ascetic. When not expressing any emotion, he appeared quite cold, but as soon as the corners of his mouth curved upwards, he was like the warm sun rising on a winter day - not scorching, just a gentle warmth that could touch one's heart.</p><p></p><p>His figure was slender but not bony. After all this time of skill training, beautiful muscles had begun to emerge. Since the skills enhanced his physical qualities in all aspects, these muscles were perfectly proportioned, growing in the most optimal direction.</p><p></p><p>He glanced downwards... Hmm, a bit of a belly.</p><p></p><p>Twirling his slightly longer than eye-length black hair, Xue Jing got dressed and left the bathroom, preparing to go out and replenish some household supplies.</p><p></p><p>After putting on his shoes and leaving the apartment, he walked out of the residential area towards the nearest supermarket.</p><p></p><p>It was now half past seven in the evening, and the sky had already darkened. There were quite a few people on the streets, as most had already finished their dinner.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for a traffic light, Xue Jing suddenly heard some shrieks nearby.</p><p></p><p>Curious, he looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the road, he saw an elderly Mediterranean man in a wheelchair, wearing a classic sleeveless white tank top. He was rapidly turning the wheels on both sides, skillfully maneuvering the wheelchair through the crowd, as if drifting.</p><p></p><p>Amazingly, this old man was drifting the manual wheelchair, his technique superb. Rotating and shifting with agility and ease, he navigated the wheelchair through a few drainage ditches with the fluidity of a professional figure skater, utterly smooth and graceful.</p><p></p><p>The wind whipped up as the wheelchair sped by, causing the skirts of the female students to flutter. They shrieked in succession, and the wheelchair-bound old man even had the time to whistle at the girls, earning him scolding and coy protests.</p><p></p><p>Watching the old man's gallant figure drift away, Xue Jing fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>If riding a wheelchair was a skill, this old man must be at least Lv10.</p><p></p><p>It was quite an amusing encounter.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, the green light turned on, and Xue Jing crossed the street, entering the supermarket.</p><p></p><p>He bought some beef, pork, vegetables, eggs, sausages, plain noodles, scallions, ginger, garlic, seasonings, as well as some snacks, fruits, and items that were used up or nearly depleted. After paying at the checkout, he left the supermarket, carrying a large bag.</p><p></p><p>On his way back, as he passed by a dark alley, Xue Jing paused.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>A small black cat with four white-gloved paws had suddenly jumped down in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The cat had no collar, but there was a white-gold metal ring around its tail, though Xue Jing couldn't tell if it was a decoration put on by the owner of a domestic cat, or a cruel prank done to a stray.</p><p></p><p>The cat's fur was dirty and unkempt, with some patches missing, likely from fights with other cats. There were even dried blood spots clinging to its coat, indicating it had suffered quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After jumping down, the wobbly cat walked up to Xue Jing, looking at him with emerald-green slit pupils, then collapsed to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to pull a scam, are we?" Xue Jing chuckled.</p><p></p><p>However, the cat looked quite pitiful, and they seemed to have a connection, so Xue Jing squatted down, intending to feed it some sausage.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the fallen cat mumbled in a daze, "I never imagined... the world of stray cats... could be so cruel, ugh."</p><p></p><p>And with that, it passed out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading.</p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

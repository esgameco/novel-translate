        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In his dream, his family life was happy and fulfilling. Although his father was as serious as ever, he was always proud of him. His mother would secretly give him pocket money behind his father's back and pat his head, telling him that mommy loves him. The fellow disciples at the dojo looked up to him, and he became a renowned martial arts prodigy, the center of attention.</p><p></p><p>He would not be ignored and treated as if he didn't exist by his father, his mother would still be alive, and he would not always be overshadowed by the accomplishments of his talented older brother who went to the inner city. He would also not have the experience of being repeatedly humiliated and forced to flee the dojo.</p><p></p><p>Everything was so wonderful.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The father in his dream seemed to be saying something to him, and Pei Youguang tried hard to listen, but he couldn't hear it.</p><p></p><p>The father repeated it many times, seemingly impatient, and then slapped him.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang woke up, feeling a stinging sensation on his right cheek.</p><p></p><p>"Hey."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing squatted down, looking at the still slightly dazed Pei Youguang lying on the ground, and then slapped him again, leaving symmetrical palm prints on both cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"You're Pei Youguang, right? Do you have something to discuss with me? What is it, tell me."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing spoke in a cold tone.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang: "......"</p><p></p><p>After regaining his senses, realizing the current situation, Pei Youguang was silent for a while and then forced a smile: "No... no, it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded: "Okay, if it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>"But although you're fine, I do have something to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang touched his sunken nose, wincing in pain, but hearing Xue Jing's words, he quickly said, "Please, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>He was not a strong-willed person. He had been bullied countless times since he was young, and he had long learned to be humble and submissive.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been acting arrogant and domineering at the affiliated high school, he had almost forgotten his past, but now he was successfully awakened by Xue Jing's two slaps, recalling his muscle memory.</p><p></p><p>He no longer tried to use his family background to threaten others. The students at the affiliated high school all knew he had connections, and since Xue Jing dared to hit him, it meant he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was because he was not afraid of his connections or simply because he was bold, the fact was that he had failed.</p><p></p><p>He could only yield.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked down at him and asked, "I heard you've killed someone? And bullied a female classmate?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang forced a smile and said, "No, no, those are just rumors."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about that female student who transferred out last semester?"</p><p></p><p>"... I was pursuing her, but I really didn't do anything like that. That female classmate transferred out because she was too scared, if I had really done something, the school wouldn't have kept me until now."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the unconscious underlings beside him, Pei Youguang hesitated for a moment and then softly said, "Don't tell anyone, I'm still a virgin."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing slapped him again.</p><p></p><p>Slap--</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to hear this kind of useless information."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang covered his cheek: "Understood..."</p><p></p><p>"If you haven't done these things, why don't you clarify it?"</p><p></p><p>"Clarifying might not be effective, and... with these rumors going around, my classmates are all afraid of me... I think it's cool..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing slapped him again.</p><p></p><p>Speechlessly, he said, "Are you brain-damaged? Actively taking on the reputation of a violent criminal?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang didn't dare to argue: "You're right."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, be a good student and don't mess around with these meaningless things. Go back and write a reflection, clearly write down what you've done and what you haven't done, and read it in front of the entire class during morning reading time tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Recite it ten times in front of your classmates, and have your little brother record the video. I'll check it later."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang was embarrassed: "Ah, this..."</p><p></p><p>Slapâ€”</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang covered his cheek with one hand, waving the other hand repeatedly: "I'll go back and write it."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing grunted, and casually asked, "By the way, that punch you threw at the wall had quite a bit of force. What's the deal with that?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang answered honestly, "I've practiced martial arts, and in that punch just now, I used 'internal strength'."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing curiously asked, "Internal strength? Is it something like the inner force in wuxia novels?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang first nodded, then shook his head: "Internal strength, it can also be called inner power... It's not some supernatural energy, but a method of utilizing the physical strength of the body. By coordinating the muscles, tendons, bones, blood, breathing, and other elements, you can extract the latent potential of the physical body - that's what 'internal strength' is."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang recalled the words of the teacher in the dojo as he explained.</p><p></p><p>"In scientific terms, the essence of 'internal strength' is kinetic energy. The various organs in the body coordinate and cooperate in movement, accumulating kinetic energy, and then through 'techniques' release that accumulated energy outward, making the power much greater than ordinary punches and kicks."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that some formidable martial artists can use their internal strength to punch through tank armor with just their bare flesh, but I don't know if that's true or not."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing stroked his chin, not saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Pei Youguang immediately understood, and hurriedly said, "If you're interested, I can teach you. Although I only know the basic methods of cultivating internal strength..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing patted him on the shoulder, his expression softening a bit: "Then I'll trouble you with that."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang cautiously said, "Not at all, but about writing the reflection and reciting it in class... Can I be excused from that?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought about it and said, "No, but you don't have to recite it ten times, just once is enough."</p><p></p><p>"..." Pei Youguang felt that there was no difference between ten times and once, they were both a loss of dignity, how could he make such concessions, but he didn't dare to argue, so he could only laugh dryly and say, "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Xue Jing stood up.</p><p></p><p>"That's it then. This afternoon or tomorrow when I'm free, I'll come find you to learn 'internal strength'. In the future, study hard, be a proper student, and don't let me hear that you're bullying someone again."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang: "I'll do as you say."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Xue Jing left the dark alley, the little brothers who had been lying on the ground pretending to be unconscious slowly got up, rubbing their heads and groaning in pain, all of them looking like they had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Pei Ge, that Xue... Xue senior, where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang sat up, felt in his shirt pocket, pulled out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, wanted to light one, but felt no desire to, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you'll have to call him Jing Ge."</p><p></p><p>The little brothers looked at each other, could only respond with a "yes".</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment, Pei Youguang's eyes filled with deep thought: 'He hasn't practiced martial arts, but he has such physical qualities... He should be considered a good natural talent, as the teachers at the dojo said...'</p><p></p><p>'Just like Big Brother...'</p><p></p><p>Somehow, whether he was subdued or what, Pei Youguang had an intuition that Xue Jing was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The words "suck up", "gain merit by following a powerful person" flashed through his mind, but the limitations of his vision and understanding made him unable to clearly discern the pros and cons at the moment.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't think about it anymore. The main thing is to get on good terms with him!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang decided to follow his intuition.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading~</p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

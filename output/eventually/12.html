        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unlike his previous life, Zhu Xia seemed to place particular emphasis on physical education courses in education, at least at Qing Attached High School, where the physical education classes were not only quite numerous every week, but the physical education teachers were also never "asked to take leave."</p><p></p><p>After completing three cultural courses, the elite class members went to the locker room after a brief recess, preparing to change out of their school uniforms and into indoor sportswear.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, those abs."</p><p></p><p>A tall classmate wearing glasses was stunned when he saw Xue Jing take off his shirt.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Xue Jing, how come we've never noticed before? You've trained them so well?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, all the male classmates in the locker room turned their gaze towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p>"Jing-ge is amazing, how did you train such beautiful abs? Teach us, brother."</p><p>"First of all, I'm not Nan Tong, and secondly, can you let me touch them?"</p><p>"I envy the future Mrs. Xue."</p><p>"Can we take a picture? It's not that I want to see it, it's mainly because I have a teenage sister at home who's starving for it."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing hurriedly put on a short-sleeved sportswear, with an exasperated look on his face: "Can you guys not be so gay, it's creepy."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge, who was changing clothes next to him, laughed and teased: "You're even afraid of a little joke, you must be deeply closeted. With your conditions, if you don't find a girlfriend, don't blame everyone for thinking too much."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing kicked him with a foot, causing him to stagger: "Just get lost, you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Good shot!"</p><p></p><p>In the gymnasium, Xue Jing made a long jump shot from afar, the basketball flew out of his hand and accurately fell into the basket, immediately followed by cheers.</p><p></p><p>After a simple celebration with his teammates, Xue Jing took a deep breath and looked at the scoreboard.</p><p></p><p>[Accurate shot, aiming experience +2]</p><p>[Aiming Lv1 (78/300)]</p><p></p><p>The aiming skill he just activated last night, when applied to a sport that requires precision like basketball, was simply a dimensional strike.</p><p></p><p>Within the three-point line, he could achieve a 90% hit rate even under opponent interference, and he also had a very high probability of scoring from outside the three-point line. Just in terms of shooting ability alone, he had already reached a professional level.</p><p></p><p>So much so that even if he didn't rely on physical ability to exert strong pressure, he still made several classmates on the opposing team look utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>Especially with the female classmates watching from the sidelines.</p><p></p><p>Even though the female classmates were very restrained and did not speak up, the embarrassment of becoming a mere backdrop for his showboating still lingered in his heart and could not be shaken off.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was not the type who was very eager to show off. He originally just planned to play around casually, not intending to bully his classmates.</p><p></p><p>This idea lasted until he made the first shot and saw the +2 aiming experience.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, come on, there's still a chance, we can win it back!"</p><p></p><p>On the opposing team, Li Ge clapped his hands and encouraged his teammates, barely rekindling their fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the PE teacher's whistle blew, the game resumed.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him, stop him! Block his shot!"</p><p>"Eh..."</p><p></p><p>The students of the elite class were immersed in the basketball game, and no one noticed that a few figures in school uniforms had walked into the gymnasium.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a tall, somewhat chubby-looking young man, who immediately took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, brazenly putting one in his mouth. Someone next to him immediately took out a lighter to light it for him, the whole process just like a movie scene of a subordinate lighting a cigarette for the boss.</p><p></p><p>The young man held the cigarette between his two fingers, skillfully exhaling smoke, his eyes slightly narrowed as he watched the basketball game on the court, and he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Which one is Xue Jing?"</p><p></p><p>Someone next to him immediately pointed out, "It's him, the one who just made the shot!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The well-off young man stared for a while, then clicked his tongue and said, "This pretty boy looks like a human-shaped dog, no wonder Shi Yu likes him."</p><p></p><p>Someone next to him hesitated and spoke up, "Brother Pei, maybe we shouldn't do this, Xue Jing is in the elite class, the school..."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang heard this and turned to look at the speaker, who immediately shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"What's there to be afraid of the school? Even if the principal sees my dad, he'd have to be polite. What's so great about the elite class? If I, Pei Youguang, want to kill him, I'll kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang took a drag on his cigarette and spoke firmly, exuding confidence and domineering presence.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding underlings were immediately in awe of his aura and showed reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll just identify him, it's not good to act here, we'll deal with him after school."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang said, turning to leave first, with his underlings following a step behind, looking quite imposing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a physical education class ended, Xue Jing's aiming experience had already reached (158/300), progressing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The growth of skill experience was reflected in real-time on Xue Jing, so the more he shot, the smoother his shots became, and his hit rate steadily increased, making the group of male classmates all wear masks of pain.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if I have to play basketball with you again, I'll be a dog!" </p><p></p><p>Li Ge cursed loudly in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickly added, "Unless you let me be on your team."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing was packing up his things in his backpack and chuckled, "Okay, I'll carry you next time."</p><p></p><p>Practicing throwing darts at home, only gained 1 experience point for hitting the red center, but playing basketball and scoring a point gained 2 points, so the game panel clearly did not encourage closed-door hard training.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Ge also packed up his things, put on his backpack, and walked over to Xue Jing, with a solemn expression on his face, "Let's go, I'll accompany you back."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at his expression, as if he was about to heroically sacrifice himself, found it somewhat amusing, but also a bit touching.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Xue Jing, Li Ge had a layer of terror filter towards that Pei Youguang. In his eyes, this was a violent hooligan classmate who committed arson and murder, and yet he was willing to go back together, even knowing that this hooligan would most likely trouble Xue Jing after school, which could be considered quite loyal.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing shook his head and said, "No need, I'll go back alone."</p><p></p><p>But Li Ge insisted, "You don't need to say more, I'm not that kind of person, I said I'll accompany you, so I will!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Xue Jing no longer refused.</p><p></p><p>He added, "But you have to remember, I'll handle the matter, you just watch by the side, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ge was a bit puzzled, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two walked out of the classroom and headed towards the school gate.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Xue Jing, whose expression was normal as usual, Li Ge's steps were heavy, his face full of worries, as if he was going to be executed.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the sports field, Xue Jing suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>'Hmm... I think he said he practiced a bit of martial arts? Just in case, I'd better prepare a bit.'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head and searched the ground for a while, walking to the side of a pebble path.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge saw Xue Jing suddenly squat down and pick up a few pebbles to put in his pocket, and curiously asked, "What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt the pebbles in his pocket, confirming their size and weight, and casually said, "I've revealed my identity, I'm actually a disciple of the Little Li Flying Dagger."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge: "Huh?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[End of chapter]</p>

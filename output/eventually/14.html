        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang pushed through the crowd, wanting to personally step in and deal with Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Although this senior's fighting ability was unexpectedly strong, catching him by surprise, Pei Youguang was confident that he would not be Pei's match.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had trained in the dojo and mastered real martial arts! However, just as he was about to walk to the front and say a few more harsh words, his vision suddenly went dark, and his left eye was struck with excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang covered his left eye and let out a miserable scream, with fresh blood flowing out from between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>He angrily shouted, "Despicable scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>It was Xue Jing who had taken out a goose egg-sized pebble from his pocket and casually thrown it, accurately hitting Pei Youguang's left eye, delivering a critical weak point strike.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang was enraged to the extreme. Despite the pain in his left eye, he only opened his good right eye and charged towards Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>He swung out a reverse backhand punch, moving at an extremely fast speed, but due to the lack of vision in his left eye, he misjudged the distance and ended up punching the wall instead of hitting the dodging Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, and the brick wall was smashed with a small crack. Seeing the power of that punch, Xue Jing's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>'This is... martial arts?'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing took a few steps back and took out another pebble from his pocket. Seeing this, the psychological shadow of his left eye being struck immediately surfaced in Pei Youguang's mind, and he instinctively raised his hand to protect his remaining right eye.</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Jing did not throw the pebble, but instead mimicked the movements he had seen in martial arts videos, executing a powerful spinning kick towards Pei Youguang's head. Although Pei Youguang reacted in time and tried to block, the force of the kick exceeded his expectations, directly pushing down his blocking arm and hitting his head, causing him to stagger.</p><p></p><p>"He's also practiced martial arts?" Pei Youguang was shocked by the power of that kick.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right, this is pure brute force, without any 'internal strength'."</p><p></p><p>That was even worse.</p><p></p><p>Without any training, he could overpower my 'internal strength' with just brute force?</p><p></p><p>This is a high school student? Xue Jing was unaware of Pei Youguang's thoughts, otherwise he might have teased him about the explosive leg power from running.</p><p></p><p>Having landed a successful hit, Xue Jing immediately followed up, rushing in and unleashing a flurry of punches and kicks on Pei Youguang.</p><p></p><p>Under Xue Jing's relentless assault, Pei Youguang was unable to catch his breath and couldn't utilize his 'internal strength', only able to passively defend against the attacks.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's strikes became more and more natural and fluent, and he grew increasingly excited, continuously using the fighting techniques he had carefully learned from the videos.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang's subordinates watching nearby were dumbfounded. They had never seen their boss in such a sorry state, being beaten down like a dog by someone else! And Li Ge, who was recording a video not far away, was trembling with excitement, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing, Xue Daddy, Xue God!</p><p></p><p>After some time, Xue Jing suddenly had a moment of enlightenment, and his previously chaotic punches and kicks seamlessly connected into a perfectly executed right hook.</p><p></p><p>The punch angle was extremely tricky, bypassing Pei Youguang's defensive circle and penetrating through the gap, landing squarely on Pei Youguang's face.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of bone cracking, Pei Youguang was sent flying backward, his feet leaving the ground.</p><p></p><p>[Condition met, skill "Martial Arts" activated]</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing remained in his punching stance, staring blankly at his fist.</p><p></p><p>His entire body suddenly felt a tingling sensation, and his muscles began to undergo structural changes.</p><p></p><p>The strength increased, the flexibility improved, and he became more suitable for exerting force. It felt as if a heavy iron armor had been shed, leaving him with a light and agile sensation.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but as he stood up straight, his body suddenly let out countless crisp sounds of bones rubbing against each other, and he had unexpectedly grown taller.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A bit.</p><p></p><p>The skeleton had undergone changes, becoming more robust and solid, causing the entire person to be proportionally enlarged a bit, as if photoshopped.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Pei!" Several little brothers exclaimed in shock, looking at the fallen Pei Youguang, whose nose was sunken into his face, a ghastly sight.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang, everyone involuntarily dropped their weapons, fearfully looking towards Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing closed his eyes and focused, feeling the changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Xue Jing opened his eyes, calmly looking at Pei Youguang's little brothers. The people his gaze swept over felt like prey animals being targeted by an apex predator, their legs turning weak as they knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Xue... Senior Xue, we..." </p><p></p><p>One of them trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish, Xue Jing interrupted, "Pick them up."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The few students were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling you to pick up the weapons."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's tone was flat, and the few students immediately felt a chill, like children suddenly intimidated by a stern father, and they involuntarily picked up the weapons on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Attack me," he commanded.</p><p></p><p>"..." The few students looked at each other, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>"I'll only count to three."</p><p></p><p>"One."</p><p></p><p>"Two."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!" One of the students, unable to bear the pressure, frantically raised the baseball bat in his hand and swung it at Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>With one leading the way, the others, under the influence of group psychology, also charged towards Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang bang."</p><p></p><p>The few students scattered like broken burlap sacks, each with a dent in their face from a punch or kick.</p><p></p><p>In the silent alley, students in the school uniform lay scattered, either unconscious or clutching their wounds and moaning. Only Xue Jing remained standing.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was cool and intellectual, without a trace of the struggle, his clothes only slightly disheveled, creating a contrast of elegance and violence, like a suited thug in a movie.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge looked at the scene, stunned for a long time before slowly regaining his senses and pressing the stop recording button on his phone.</p><p></p><p>He walked up to Xue Jing, wanting to say something but not quite daring to.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Ge's hesitant expression, Xue Jing smiled and said, "How was it, cool?"</p><p></p><p>His usual gentle tone slightly diluted the impression of violence just now. Li Ge's expression relaxed a bit as he smiled and said, "Cool, super cool. From today on, I'm a hardcore Xue Jing fan."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing patted his head, "Cut it out."</p><p></p><p>He took the phone, "Let me see how the recording turned out."</p><p></p><p>The video clearly recorded the process from Xue Jing entering the alley, except for some shaky moments when Li Ge got excited. It followed Xue Jing's instructions and only recorded the video without audio.</p><p></p><p>When the video reached the part where the students were threatened by Xue Jing to pick up the weapons, without the audio, it looked like they were still stubbornly attacking Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge puzzled, "Why did you do that?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing calmly said, "According to the laws of Juexia, in the case of the opponent holding weapons and intending to commit violent crimes, the victim has the right of unlimited self-defense."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge scratched his head, "But they had already surrendered, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What does their surrender have to do with me?" </p><p></p><p>Xue Jing seemed to be speaking to Li Ge, but also to himself.</p><p></p><p>"People who do wrong must pay the price."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeking to be read.

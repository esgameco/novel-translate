        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Xue Jing and the other two just reached the school gate, Li Ge suddenly patted Xue Jing's shoulder and pointed at a student who was walking straight towards them, with a serious expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"He's here! That person is one of Pei Youguang's lackeys who often follows him around."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer had shoulder-length hair and a lazy gait. To show off his personality, he wore his school uniform in a messy way - the top two buttons were undone, the tie was not tied, and the sleeves of his jacket were rolled up to his elbows. He was also holding a cigarette, as if he thought this made him look cool, with a self-satisfied look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You're Xue Jing, right? Pei Youguang, Brother Pei, wants to see you. Come with me."</p><p></p><p>The student approached Xue Jing, and since he was not very tall, he tilted his head up high to look down at Xue Jing through his nostrils as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge's expression became increasingly grave. Although he had already decided to stand up for Xue Jing out of a sense of righteousness, as the moment approached, a great sense of panic was still echoing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked down at the other slightly and smiled, saying, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>This overly calm and composed response made the student involuntarily reveal a trace of surprise. </p><p></p><p>Which student, upon hearing that Brother Pei was looking for them, wouldn't be trembling like a sieve? Yet this person was still able to smile? But seeing Xue Jing so obedient and compliant, the student didn't say much more, just giving a "hmm" and leading the way out of the school gate.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing and Li Ge followed him, and this scene was witnessed by many students. The usually lively school gate had become eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the group had gradually walked away that people started discussing it.</p><p></p><p>"That person is Zhou Juncheng, one of Pei Youguang's lackeys. Are they going to bully someone again?"</p><p></p><p>"Who's the one following behind them? He's so good-looking."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you recognize Xue Jing? Have you been studying at this school for two years and not know him? He's the recognized campus prince."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like Pei Youguang wants to bully him. What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Tell the teacher?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, Pei Youguang's family background is too powerful. Telling the teacher won't work, and he'll just remember it against you!"</p><p></p><p>The commotion at the school gate continued, with discussions never-ending.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Jing, why don't we just run?" </p><p></p><p>On the way, Li Ge whispered to Xue Jing, keeping his voice low.</p><p></p><p>"We're taking these small alleys, and there are fewer and fewer people. They must be taking us to a place with no one around. If something happens, we won't even be able to call for help!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the cowardly yet righteous Li Ge with a helpless expression, truly impressed that he was still following along despite his fear.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and said, "I have a favor to ask of you."</p><p></p><p>Li Ge was taken aback: "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"You..." Xue Jing lowered his voice and said a few words, then took out his phone from his pocket and handed it to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge took the phone and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The leading student didn't notice the "lambs to the slaughter" behind him doing anything. He continued smoking, his mind already thinking about how he would deal with Xue Jing later. </p><p></p><p>Having the opportunity to bully this usually high and mighty elite class student filled him with a twisted excitement.</p><p></p><p>And so, the three of them walked into a dark alley.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked up.</p><p></p><p>This was an old, dark alley, with brick walls that were dark in color and heavily oxidized, clearly ancient.</p><p></p><p>The ground was littered with trash, and there was a faint unpleasant odor. At the end of the alley stood five or six students wearing the school uniform, mostly puffing on cigarettes. The plump young man in the lead was posing with his back to Xue Jing, while the people around him were looking towards Xue Jing with malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they had been waiting for Xue Jing's arrival. The plump young man, Pei Youguang, slowly turned around, his triangular eyes fixed on Xue Jing as he took a deep drag on his cigarette, then immediately threw it to the ground and stomped it out.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Jing... is that right?" he spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the people around him...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The student disciples all sneered maliciously as they took out baseball bats, wooden sticks, small knives, and other weapons.</p><p></p><p>They were already well-versed in these intimidation tactics. Normally, by this point, the students they had summoned would have started begging for mercy, and some would even have peed their pants out of fear.</p><p></p><p>However, they found that this time, it seemed a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing did not speak. He slowly took off his suit-style school uniform jacket and handed it to Li Ge, who was standing behind him.</p><p></p><p>He then unbuttoned the buttons on both sides of his shirt sleeves and slowly rolled them up, revealing his well-defined forearm muscles.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge swallowed hard, feeling quite afraid, but still, as Xue Jing had instructed earlier, he took the jacket and retreated a few meters, then took out his phone and turned on the camera function, aiming it at the group in the dark alley.</p><p></p><p>"...What is this guy trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Before Pei Youguang and the others could resolve their doubts, Xue Jing suddenly crouched down, taking on a starting position.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Pei Youguang inexplicably associated it with the animal world programs he had watched, where tigers would crouch low to the ground, gathering strength before pouncing on their prey.</p><p></p><p>And then, he saw it.</p><p></p><p>The 'tiger' shot out like a cannonball, pouncing towards them.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xue Jing sprang into action, like an arrow released from a bowstring, coming from several meters away to stand before Pei Youguang and the others. He swung a punch, slamming it into the face of the student standing in the front, producing a loud 'bang' sound. The upper body of the latter was violently thrown back, dropping the baseball bat from his hand and collapsing to the ground, unconscious without even a cry.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, get him! Beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang immediately cursed angrily at the sight, and the surrounding group also reacted, wielding their weapons and attacking Xue Jing.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's gaze remained calm as he watched the 'slow-moving' batons and knives approaching him.</p><p></p><p>After activating the 'Aim' skill, Xue Jing found that his vision had been greatly enhanced, both in static and dynamic aspects.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he focused his attention, his dynamic vision far surpassed the norm, even granting him an ability similar to 'bullet time'.</p><p></p><p>This was the source of his confidence in his own combat prowess. His physical fitness from exercise and running did not give him overwhelming fighting power - against opponents wielding weapons, he would be quickly incapacitated even by a single stab. But with the 'Aim' skill, this dynamic vision that slowed down everything before him bestowed him with the perceptive abilities of a martial arts master, like having unlocked the Sharingan.</p><p></p><p>This was what gave him the courage to face Pei Youguang and the others alone.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his greatest reliance was still on 'Dual Life', the extra life that gave him the capital to recklessly go all out without fear.</p><p></p><p>Evading the attacks with a series of agile movements, Xue Jing found an opening, his gaze flashing, and as he backstepped to avoid, he unleashed a punch, precisely grazing the jaw of one of the students.</p><p></p><p>The precision brought by the 'Aim' skill could be applied not only to projectile attacks, but also to hand-to-hand combat.</p><p></p><p>In fact, precision is a crucial element in fighting, as while the striking distance is short, accurately hitting a nimble opponent amidst the chaos of battle is no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the precision of one's strikes is an important indicator of a fighter's combat prowess.</p><p></p><p>And now, the almost completely inexperienced Xue Jing, with the enhancement of the 'Aim' skill, had reached a shockingly high level of striking precision.</p><p></p><p>'Aim' - a skill that on the surface seemed only applicable to throwing and shooting, was actually terrifyingly beneficial to unarmed combat abilities.</p><p></p><p>The student hit in the jaw immediately felt his brain rattling inside his skull, the world spinning, and he collapsed limply to the ground, unconscious.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Hao, what the hell are you doing, acting like this!?"</p><p></p><p>This punch was so fast and subtle that apart from the striking Xue Jing and the struck Chen Hao, no one else noticed it. Pei Youguang only saw the baseball bat being swung at Xue Jing, which he evaded, and then Chen Hao immediately went down as if it was all staged, prompting Pei Youguang to curse loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, all of you get out of the way, I'll handle this myself!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No, brother, I was wrong, please, don't..."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, we're from the Razor Gang, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, can we make peace?"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>On the street, the members of the Razor Gang lay scattered, like a row of golf balls, Xue Jing walked up to them, metal baseball bat in hand, and one by one, he struck them on the head, regardless of what they were saying.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only one young man with a crew cut was left standing.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing slowly walked up to the crew-cut youth, the metal baseball bat in his hand dented in multiple places from too much forceful striking, covered in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"I'm curious," he began.</p><p></p><p>"As a harmless student, coming to a classmate's house to play is a perfectly normal and unobjectionable thing, right? I don't usually get into trouble, I won't drive my car onto the pedestrian walkway when there's traffic, and even if I get overpriced food at a restaurant, I'll just hold my nose and pay. When it comes to you small-time thugs, I'm terrified and always walk the long way around to avoid you."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention I've never even been to the South City area, so there's no way I could have accidentally provoked you guys."</p><p></p><p>"So what were you suddenly rushing out to do to me?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's tone was not stern, but rather casual, as if chatting casually with a friend.</p><p></p><p>But the fear on the crew-cut youth's face grew deeper with each of Xue Jing's words, until by the last one, he collapsed to the ground, frantically waving his hands and saying, "No, no, we were just passing by... Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Xue Jing swung the bat, striking him on the ankle.</p><p></p><p>The sound of bone cracking rang out, and the crew-cut youth's ankle was twisted into a distorted arc.</p><p></p><p>"When I ask you a question, just answer honestly, don't make useless excuses. Didn't your teacher teach you that?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut youth, writhing in pain, quickly said, "We're from the Razor Gang, under the command of Duan Kaiping, the big brother. Just now, Brother Duan saw you walking alone on the street, wearing the high school uniform, and wanted to kidnap you and extort your family..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing swung the baseball bat, asking, "So where is this Brother Duan?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Duan thought you were just a student, so he didn't need to get involved himself, and just had us come do it. He's waiting in a warehouse on the next street!"</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut youth spoke extremely quickly, afraid that Xue Jing would be dissatisfied and strike him again with the bat.</p><p></p><p>"This Brother Duan is quite formidable?" Xue Jing asked.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Duan is a core member of the Razor Gang, qualified to have the 'Razor' tattooed on his chest... He used his boss's connections to train at the Jinfeng Dojo, and I've only seen him use his bare hands once - he just waved them and split a can of soda in half, just like using a razor!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Jinfeng Dojo... Pei Youguang had mentioned it before, saying that was where he learned the 'Jing Li' technique. </p><p></p><p>If a gang like this could send their members to train at this dojo, it seemed this place was not a good one, no wonder it was located in the South City area.</p><p></p><p>'Being able to split a aluminum soda can with bare hands, slitting a throat would be child's play... His combat ability is not low.'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing pondered.</p><p></p><p>With this incident, he and the Razor Gang were now at odds. Although the reasons were entirely on this group of scum's side, he didn't believe the gangsters would listen to reason.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing first considered the possibility of eliminating them, but quickly realized this was not realistic. </p><p></p><p>Apart from whether he had the guts to do it, the commotion they had caused was too great, and just by asking any eyewitness, they could trace it back to him.</p><p></p><p>So there was no turning back now.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing thought for a moment, then asked, "Give me a detailed introduction to your Razor Gang."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, "How large is your sphere of influence? How powerful are you specifically? How many core members like 'Brother Duan' do you have?"</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut youth hesitated for a bit, then said, "Our Razor Gang is one of the seven outer gangs in the southern city area, our turf covers a few streets around here... We have dozens of core members like Brother Duan."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing narrowed his eyes, "What's the relationship between your gang leader and the Jinfeng Dojo?"</p><p></p><p>"The gang leader is a direct disciple of the Jinfeng Dojo master..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xue Jing felt a headache coming on. </p><p></p><p>Just as he had suspected, pulling out a radish also pulls out the dirt - these local gang forces have complex, intertwined relationships. If you offend one, it will drag out a whole bunch of others.</p><p></p><p>Does he have to beat up the Razor Gang, then the Jinfeng Dojo as well? And what else will it lead to after that? This is never-ending! Sigh, is there a way to reconcile this?'But... there might still be a way to break through this.'</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt that he could leverage the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Razor Gang has the Jinfeng Dojo backing them, but in this Cheng City, there are more than just this one dojo.</p><p></p><p>Dojos are businesses that are open to the public, you can become a disciple by paying the fees and training there. Xue Jing was confident that with his unparalleled martial arts skills and brilliant mind, no matter which dojo he joins, he would be treated with the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Your Razor Gang has powerful backers, huh? Well, I'll become just as powerful!</p><p></p><p>In fact, he even thought of a clever move.</p><p></p><p>Get ahead of them and join the Jinfeng Dojo first!</p><p></p><p>When the Razor Gang comes to cause trouble for him...</p><p></p><p>I acknowledge your formidable influence, but what if I've already joined your backer? How would you deal with that?</p><p></p><p>However, he currently has a very poor impression of the Jinfeng Dojo and the Razor Gang, and he doesn't want to do this unless he has no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing felt a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>Previously he wasn't under any pressure, although he wanted to train in martial arts, he wasn't in a rush. But now he must find a way to quickly gather the money to join a dojo.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the information."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing said to the crew-cut youth.</p><p></p><p>The latter hurriedly flattered, "No problem, brother, this is what I should do... Can you let me off the hook now?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll give you a chance."</p><p></p><p>He then looked around and picked up a few handy stones from the ground nearby.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crew-cut youth was struck with PTSD, and a sense of foreboding filled his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Run, I'll only count to ten."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing tossed the stones in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"One."</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Brother, look at my leg..."</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut youth said with a gloomy face, pointing to his foot that Xue Jing had broken with a stick.</p><p></p><p>"Two."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait, can we start counting again?"</p><p></p><p>"Three."</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth through the excruciating pain in his ankle, the crew-cut youth propped himself up against the wall and started hopping towards the street across.</p><p></p><p>"Four."</p><p></p><p>But alas, with only one foot working, he couldn't move fast at all.</p><p></p><p>"Five."</p><p></p><p>The counting voices came from behind him, like a death knell. He hurried his pace in panic, but stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Six."</p><p></p><p>He struggled to get up, but in his haste, he hit his injured ankle again and fell down once more.</p><p></p><p>"Seven."</p><p></p><p>He crawled and rolled forward.</p><p></p><p>"Eight."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a terrified scream.</p><p></p><p>"Nine."</p><p></p><p>"Ten."</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing watched as the crew-cut youth, who hadn't even made it 20 meters, and threw a stone at him.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The final sound of a head exploding rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing looked at the bodies strewn all around, then at the stone in his palm, clenching it tightly with a confident expression:</p><p></p><p>"This is the victory of martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

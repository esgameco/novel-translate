        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just like in the morning, he did not directly go to the classroom, but instead entered the Qingda campus again and came to the Qingda Library.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the sparse population in the morning, the library was quite crowded at this time, but everyone was very quiet, and you could only hear the sound of pages turning.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing's arrival caused many students to turn their heads. A short-haired girl sitting in the rest area, holding an extracurricular reading material, looked at Xue Jing, who was wearing the attached middle school uniform, with shining eyes, and excitedly whispered to her friend beside her:</p><p></p><p>"Quick, quick, look, that boy is so handsome!"</p><p></p><p>"Shall we go ask him for his WeChat?"</p><p></p><p>The friend stared at Xue Jing and criticized, "Aren't you the one who likes older guys? How come you're eyeing the little puppy from the attached middle school?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't like sweet food that much, when I see this top-tier dessert, I can't help but drool!" The short-haired girl's eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go, I'll go ask him for his WeChat, you stand by me to give me courage..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she stood up from the chair.</p><p></p><p>The chair was pushed back, creating a slightly sharp sound of friction with the floor.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly hearing the movement, Xue Jing turned his head and looked towards the short-haired girl.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The latter was given a cold glance by those clear and cool eyes, and her entire being seemed to be drenched in a bucket of cold water, from her scalp to her feet, and her desire was instantly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Not until Xue Jing went upstairs and disappeared from her sight did the short-haired girl finally cover her ample bosom and pant heavily, like a drowning person just rescued from the water.</p><p></p><p>Her friend was stunned for a moment, then immediately patted her back to help her catch her breath and asked with concern, "What's wrong, Xiaolin? Are you okay?"</p><p></p><p>Xiaolin, the girl with a single ponytail, said with lingering fear, "I don't know why, but that boy... seems to be very dangerous, I won't ask him for his WeChat after all."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Unaware of the psychological damage his casual glance had just caused to others, Xue Jing went straight up to the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>The seventh floor was as deserted as ever, in stark contrast to the crowded first six floors. There was only one young lady, sitting upright in an old chair, holding a book, still maintaining perfect posture without a flaw, her tight blue jeans stretching tightly over her like a ripe peach.</p><p></p><p>It was the same young lady Xue Jing had encountered in the same place that morning.</p><p></p><p>The difference from the morning was that the young lady, upon seeing Xue Jing, nodded at him, and her waist-length high ponytail swayed slightly, a faint smile curving on her clean and beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing smiled and nodded back at her without saying a word. He found this silent exchange of nods quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Walking into the bookshelf area, Xue Jing began to search for clues that might be related to "divine material".</p><p></p><p>In the dim light, Xue Jing and the young lady were each busy with their own tasks, clearly separate, like two unrelated passersby, yet there was a sense of inexplicable natural harmony between them.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Xue Jing had learned a lot of things that ordinary people didn't know, but still had no clue about the divine material.</p><p></p><p>"I'd better go to class now."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Xue Jing put the books he had been holding back on the shelves and left the library.</p><p></p><p>In the silent seventh floor, only the young lady remained, like a lonely bound spirit imprisoned in this place, with only the occasional sound of pages turning to prove her real existence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Xue Jing walked into his own classroom, he found that the desk and chair that had been scratched by Pei Youguang had been replaced with a new, intact set.</p><p></p><p>"It was that second-year Pei Youguang who brought over and replaced your desk and chair," a classmate who had arrived earlier explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Xue Jing responded.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't really mind, as he could sit on any table or chair, even if they were scratched up. After all, the drawers of that set of scratched furniture had been used to store dirty things, so it would be better to replace them.</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang was a sensible person, Xue Jing thought.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that she had earnestly educated him.</p><p></p><p>The four afternoon classes passed quickly, and Xue Jing said goodbye to Li Ge, saying he had something to take care of and that Li Ge could leave first.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he packed up his textbooks, slung his backpack over one shoulder, and walked out of the third teaching building.</p><p></p><p>The affiliated school had three teaching buildings, one for each grade, with twenty classes per grade.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jing came to the corridor of the second teaching building where the second-year students studied, leaned against a pillar at the entrance, took out his phone, and started browsing some videos explaining martial arts while waiting.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was quite eye-catching, and the second-year students coming out of the building would more or less linger their gaze on him.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before a plump young man, wrapped in bandages around his nose and eyes like a mummy, emerged from the building, surrounded by a group of underlings.</p><p></p><p>It was Pei Youguang. </p><p></p><p>The underlings around him also had varying degrees of injuries, but not as severe as Pei Youguang's.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xue Jing, Pei Youguang first paused, then quickly ran over and said enthusiastically, "Hey, Jing-ge, you're waiting for me?"</p><p></p><p>His behavior immediately left the surrounding second-year students dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Pei Youguang?"</p><p>"Ah? That's Pei Youguang? He's wrapped up like a mummy, I didn't recognize him."</p><p>"Who's that person, and why is Pei Youguang acting like he's... licking him?"</p><p>"It's the third-year Xue Jing! I saw him this morning, he was called out by Zhou Junchen at the school gate, I thought he was going to get beaten up by Pei Youguang, but it seems like nothing happened to him..."</p><p>"Stupid, Pei Youguang is in this state, he must have tried to beat someone but ended up getting beaten instead."</p><p>"What happened? Isn't Pei Youguang trained in martial arts? How did he end up like this?"</p><p></p><p>Fragments of discussion spread around, and the students all had excited expressions, as if they had witnessed a big scoop.</p><p></p><p>This school bully was really unpopular, and now seeing him apparently at a disadvantage, everyone was quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Serves him right, bullying people every day, now he's met his match!"</p><p>"Finally someone can rein him in."</p><p>"I'm in the same class as Pei Youguang, this morning he was still saying he would teach Xue Jing a lesson, apparently it's because Lin Shiyu likes Xue Jing... Look, there's Lin Shiyu coming out."</p><p></p><p>The graceful and straight-legged schoolgirl Lin Shiyu, in her school uniform skirt, her long legs shining in the evening sun, as she walked out of the teaching building, saw Xue Jing and a trace of embarrassment appeared on her beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>After being rejected in the morning confession, now encountering the person again, she was suddenly at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xue Jing didn't even look at her, as if he didn't notice her at all, which, although seemed a bit heartless, made her feel relieved.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shiyu quickly picked up her bag, grabbed her girlfriend's hand, and hurried away.</p><p></p><p>"Jing-ge, you must be here to learn some fighting skills from me, right? Come, let's go to my house, it's quite big, and I have most of the training equipment for the dojo at home..."</p><p></p><p>Pei Youguang said, using his only remaining uninjured eye to signal to the underlings beside him.</p><p></p><p>The underlings immediately understood, and one of them stepped forward enthusiastically, "Jing-ge, let me carry your bag for you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go," Xue Jing smiled and handed his backpack to the underling, following Pei Youguang to leave the campus.</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>Readers, please continue reading, don't stop following, or you'll lose me.

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After returning from the principal's office, Gu Jiuqing regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>The flying horse-drawn carriage howled across the heavens and earth. The dragon horses soared through the azure sky. This flying carriage had been shattered by the Curved Land before, but was later repaired by the housekeeper Xie. Now as it flew through the heavens, it emitted an unusual resonance.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my ride needs to be replaced too."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged and entered meditation.</p><p></p><p>"As a true disciple, after I return to the mountain this time, I shall request Senior Brother Liang Xiao to refine a teleportation array for me. That should not be too difficult."</p><p></p><p>So the only remaining issue was how to send the teleportation array to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Gu Jiuqing stirred slightly, and the spiritual fruits from the Mud Bead Palace suddenly flickered. Then his entire body emitted a faint glow, enveloping even the oil lamp he held in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The rented room.</p><p></p><p>The bedroom!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure appeared on the bed, an oil lamp now in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I can bring objects from the Primordial Chaos into the Blue Star, but I need to borrow the power of the spiritual fruits."</p><p></p><p>The figure on the bed lay back down, and soon, this manifestation disappeared from the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, set down the oil lamp, and entered meditation again.</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was going to imbue his own body with all the cultivation and insights from the spiritual fruits. His current cultivation was too low, leaving Gu Jiuqing with a lack of a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the insights from the spiritual fruits rained down, being comprehended by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The insights of the Dragon and Elephant soared together!!</p><p></p><p>Scenes flashed through Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of faces, tens of thousands of faces - there were over 400,000 people cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Art by the river!!</p><p></p><p>A full 400,000 people had cultivated the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Art.</p><p></p><p>Among these 400,000, some had deeply refined the art, while others had only scratched the surface. But regardless, the insights of all these people had coalesced, forming a new understanding of the Dragon and Elephant Art. Within the spiritual fruit, they had been ceaselessly refining and condensing into the supreme truth of the art!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's comprehension of the Dragon and Elephant Art had surpassed even the ancient ancestor who created it.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had extracted the true essence of the art, its insights had reached the pinnacle, breaking through all bottlenecks. One became a hundred, with profound connections - his own innate talents had undergone an earth-shattering transformation.</p><p></p><p>"After extracting the true essence of the Dragon and Elephant Art, my aptitude has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed his eyes, perceiving the changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>For any martial art, after such vast foundational cultivation, and repeated deductions, proliferations, and breaking through bottlenecks, it would eventually evolve to the utmost extremity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing divided this process into three levels. The first level was unlimited enhancement, greatly facilitating the comprehension of an art's profundities.</p><p></p><p>The second level reached the supreme heights of the art's founder.</p><p></p><p>The third level was extracting the true essence.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Art was the first art whose true essence Gu Jiuqing had extracted. His aptitude had drastically increased, reaching the lofty levels of Ye Fei, Xia Qingzhou, and others.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there is even a fourth level."</p><p></p><p>The insights of the Dragon and Elephant Art within the spiritual fruit continued clashing, but Gu Jiuqing no longer touched them.</p><p></p><p>He began accepting the cultivation gains from the 400,000 people who had practiced the art!</p><p></p><p>How much cultivation had those 400,000 people gained from the Dragon and Elephant Art? Gu Jiuqing didn't know!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't calculate it either.</p><p></p><p>But if each of the 400,000 people had increased their qi and blood by even 0.1, then Gu Jiuqing would gain 40,000 in qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>And the actual increase in his true qi and blood was far beyond that number!</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll absorb one-tenth of the cultivation from the spiritual fruit."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, one-tenth of the Dragon and Elephant Art's cultivation from the spiritual fruit descended into Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!!</p><p></p><p>A torrential force, a vast force, an indescribable mystical power surged within Gu Jiuqing's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The surging of vital energy and blood, smoke rising like from a raging fire. Within the cramped horse carriage, Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged, beginning his sixth Tui Fan (shedding of mortal form).</p><p></p><p>Three Tui Fan could be achieved by ordinary people in the northern lands. </p><p></p><p>Five Tui Fan required a certain family status, which most disciples from prestigious clans could attain.</p><p></p><p>Once reaching six Tui Fan, one would be considered a prodigy in the northern lands, an elite seed within the inner sect of the Sword Gate, with the prospect of breaking through to the true lineage.</p><p></p><p>His vital energy flowed like mercury, cleansing away the last traces of impurities from his mortal body.</p><p></p><p>His five viscera and six bowels, tendons, bones and membranes shone with brilliant luster. The power of the third dragon-elephant also arose at this moment!!</p><p></p><p>After three breaths, the force of the fourth dragon-elephant emerged!</p><p></p><p>The fifth, sixth, and seventh dragon-elephant forces manifested in unison!</p><p></p><p>In the time it took to burn an incense stick, Gu Jiuqing's thoughts touched upon the Dao fruit in the Mud Pill Palace, and the vast power of the Dragon Elephant Skill descended into his body.</p><p></p><p>The eighth dragon-elephant force gathered, followed by the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth!</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish ——————"  </p><p>"Rustle rustle ————————"</p><p></p><p>Anomalous vital energy rose into the air, enveloping Gu Jiuqing, and the seventh Tui Fan came upon him.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill could only achieve five Tui Fan, but with the assistance of 400,000 cultivators, Gu Jiuqing grasped the true essence of the Dragon Elephant Skill and incredibly began the seventh Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>He broke through the seventh mortal shackle of his fleshly body, the seventh cleansing of his flesh!</p><p></p><p>The dense vital energy and scorching temperature rose within the carriage, the vital energy flowing like mercury, carrying a force of thousands of pounds.</p><p></p><p>The resplendent vital energy wove into the image of a three-legged golden crow!!</p><p></p><p>It was his bloodline awakening!!!</p><p></p><p>The Gu family cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body, their bloodline evolving towards the golden crow. Gu Jiuqing forcibly used the Dragon Elephant Skill for Tui Fan, requiring far greater heavenly fortune than other cultivation methods for the seventh Tui Fan!!</p><p></p><p>This caused his bloodline to undergo metamorphosis, reverting to the ancestral form, prematurely manifesting the divine body image of the Imperfection Realm during the Tui Fan stage.</p><p></p><p>"Too much cultivation power! Even the seventh shackle cannot suppress so much power."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression turned solemn. After seven Tui Fan, illusory dragon-elephant images materialized behind him - the power of the Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Those who cultivated the Dragon Elephant Skill to the utmost, completing five Tui Fan, could gain the power of one dragon-elephant.</p><p></p><p>But the overlapping dragon-elephant images behind Gu Jiuqing kept multiplying, not just ten or twenty heads.</p><p></p><p>Such dragon-elephant power would make even cultivators of the Fa Li Realm tremble.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Golden Crow bloodline within him was also being cleansed, but this strand was too diluted. Under the constant cleansing, the inherent "divinity" was washed away.</p><p></p><p>As the Dragon Elephant vital energy transformed and the Golden Crow ancient bloodline dissipated, Gu Jiuqing gained an insight!</p><p></p><p>He entered an empty state, guiding the cultivation from the Dao fruit to cleanse his flesh, comprehending the true meaning of the Dragon Elephant Skill's twenty-two forms. In this state, his vital energy underwent a wondrous change, the blood-red energy imbued with a golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>His vital energy was evolving towards a golden vital energy!</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family ancestors are useless, I might as well become the new ancestor of the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>He had no fear of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>His ancestors were no law to follow!</p><p>He would make up for it himself!</p><p></p><p>The vital energy emanating from Gu Jiuqing's Baihui point transformed strand by strand into golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivation power was guided down!</p><p></p><p>Under the cleansing of this golden vital energy, Gu Jiuqing broke through the shackles of his flesh, ushering in the eighth Tui Fan!</p><p></p><p>Six Tui Fan was the level of a prodigy, seven Tui Fan also prodigy level. But the eighth Tui Fan - that person would be renowned throughout the northern lands as a Qilin Child, the paramount prodigy of an era. Whether in the northern lands or the Sword Gate, they would be the ultimate prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to a genius of the Sword Dao!!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a disciple who had undergone eight Tui Fan would cause even the most extraordinary Sword Immortals to emerge once more!</p><p></p><p>Second part, begging for support! One more part to come!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

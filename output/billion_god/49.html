        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb is the forbidden ground of the Sword Sect. </p><p></p><p>After becoming an inner sect disciple, one has the opportunity to enter the Sword Tomb once to select a flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators of the Sword Sect must have at least two spirit swords. The first is a spirit sword forged from spirit materials, used for comprehending the Way of the Sword and utilizing sword divine abilities. It is similar to a cultivator's spirit weapon. </p><p></p><p>The second is the flying sword!</p><p></p><p>The life-bound flying sword is used to imbue one's sword intent. With the way of shooting sword projections, one can take a person's head from thousands of miles away, just a trifling feat.</p><p></p><p>There are sword immortals whose swords can traverse the nine states from the northern lands to strike the southern peaks.</p><p></p><p>There are also sword immortals who can unleash their swords across eras - while they are tens of thousands of miles away, their flying swords have already descended.</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands, the nine states, and the entire world, there are too many legends about sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>And the origin of these legends is within the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>For disciples of the Sword Sect who wish to become true sword cultivators, the first task is to enter the Sword Tomb and select a flying sword.</p><p></p><p>The flying swords within have been nurtured by the sword furnace and interwoven with the energy of the martial metal. Each one is suitable for refining into a sword pill to carry one's sword intent, easily completing the process of spiritualizing the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb!</p><p></p><p>Two figures descended from the sky, and as soon as they entered the Sword Tomb, disciple guards stopped Gu Jiuqing and his companion.</p><p></p><p>Two sword tomb disciples in black enforcement robes stood guard outside.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb is a forbidden ground and the domain of the Third Elder. There is a sword furnace beneath nurturing the flying swords inside.</p><p></p><p>Apart from direct disciples of the Third Elder's lineage, other Sword Sect disciples need permission from the sect to enter.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's forbidden ground, entry is prohibited."</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed enforcers were cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled, "I am Liang Xiao of the Nanting Peak lineage, bringing my junior brother to select a flying sword in the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's voice carried into the tomb!</p><p></p><p>Before the tomb could react, the two enforcers' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know their cultivation levels, but guessed at least above the Unitary Realm.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have heard of Senior Brother Liang Xiao's deeds - upon hearing his name, their expressions changed drastically and their legs trembled.</p><p></p><p>Was Senior Brother Liang Xiao that formidable?</p><p></p><p>A chill ran down Gu Jiuqing's spine. Though kind to him, when he revealed a third of his sword intent, Liang Xiao had considered slicing him up.</p><p></p><p>"So you're a true disciple of Nanting Peak. We failed to recognize such esteemed guests."</p><p></p><p>"Please, honored seniors of Nanting Peak, make your way in!"</p><p></p><p>The cold enforcers' demeanors changed to fawning fear.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Liang Xiao entered the Sword Tomb gates.</p><p></p><p>Watching them leave, the enforcers relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"A madman of Nanting Peak, bringing the sword genius here to choose a flying sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, what a pity for this sword genius, hope he doesn't become a little madman too."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's feat in the nine-day exam had spread through the sect!</p><p></p><p>The title "Sword Genius" was already attached to him.</p><p></p><p>As they entered, a true disciple of the Third Elder's lineage came to receive them.</p><p></p><p>A jade-like youth of peerless elegance, not inferior to Liang Xiao in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Standing before this youth and beside Liang Xiao, Gu Jiuqing became a mere leaf.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like youth had starry eyes containing brilliant lights - the manifestations of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A voice transmission entered his ear:</p><p></p><p>"This true disciple must be the Third Elder's newest student, Si Wuxie!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie?</p><p></p><p>Was this him?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was startled.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from the Si Wuxie he saw during the nine-day exam.</p><p></p><p>Though peerlessly elegant then, he paled in comparison to his present divine youthful splendor.</p><p></p><p>He looked like a celestial youth, starlight flickering in his eyes - the after-images of secret cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie is cultivating the Great Primordial Star Sword Classic, condensing star sword intent."</p><p></p><p>"Strange, he joined the Third Elder with the Jade Sword Intent. Why is he now cultivating the Great Primordial instead of the Five Phases Sword Intent?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing studied Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the youth's gentle smile hid a celestial heart.</p><p></p><p>He calmly allowed Gu Jiuqing's scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>First, he bowed to Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie greets the true disciple of Nanting Peak!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to Gu Jiuqing, his smile growing warmer.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined the Gu Clan would produce another sword genius like Senior Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>He studied Gu Jiuqing curiously, his smile deepening.</p><p></p><p>"Worthy of being the Sword Genius, worthy of Nanting Peak's true disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>He sensed gazes sweeping over his body!</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie withdrew his gaze, eyes still smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Has the true disciple come to select a flying sword?"</p><p></p><p>"My master asked me to lead the two seniors into the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Seniors, please!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie was courteous and warm, addressing Gu Jiuqing as "senior."</p><p></p><p>The three proceeded, Si Wuxie leading, with Gu Jiuqing half a step behind Liang Xiao. They soon arrived at the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb!</p><p></p><p>A dense forest of flying swords, each one embedded in earth and air. Some stuck in rocks, others in empty space, with only their sword qi leaking out.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed flying swords exuded an aura like a giant furnace before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Sect's Sword Tomb, containing 109,600 flying swords. The lowest grade is most numerous, followed by the middle grade, with over a thousand top-grade swords."</p><p></p><p>"Please enter and select a sword, Senior Disciple."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie stood outside, his clear gaze showing no greed toward the myriad swords.</p><p></p><p>Yet obtaining a top-grade sword and refining its sword qi could greatly bolster one's sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's eyes flickered as he gazed at the 109,600 swords, as if celestial light shone in his pupils and a vertical eye opened in his brow.</p><p></p><p>Another peerless divine ability!</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing could enter, Liang Xiao spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, the over a thousand top-grade swords have already been..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother has investigated clearly. Among these flying swords, there are also a few king-grade flying swords. These few king-grade flying swords are most suitable for Junior Martial Brother."</p><p></p><p>He showed off his skills again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing knew that when Elder Martial Brother entered the Sword Tomb with him, he would definitely help him select flying swords.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect Elder Martial Brother to be so direct, directly choosing the best king-grade flying swords for him.</p><p></p><p>"Look at that direction in the void space inside the Sword Tomb, there is half a sword body inserted into the void, hidden within it, but this is a king-grade flying sword."</p><p></p><p>The first king-grade flying sword had sword aura swirling around its body, the void space had some ripples, and some masterless sword aura was rising.</p><p></p><p>With a faint blue sword light, there were also many high-grade flying swords revolving around it.</p><p></p><p>"There is also this direction, on this half wall, the flying sword inserted there is also a king-grade flying sword."</p><p></p><p>The second king-grade flying sword was completely black, like an ink sword.</p><p></p><p>"Only two king-grade flying swords?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's divine eye moved, and suddenly a small figure walked out from the vertical eye in the center of his brow!</p><p></p><p>This small figure was only thumb-sized, and this small figure had only one eye on its face. From this single eye, a dazzling beam of light burst out and fell into the Sword Tomb, re-examining the 19,600 flying swords.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Buddhist dharma power, the Immovable Bright King Eye!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie showed a slight look of surprise when he saw this small figure.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao turned to look at Si Wuxie, "Oh? You just joined the Sword Sect, yet you even recognize the Immovable Bright King Eye of Buddhism?"</p><p></p><p>This true eye, he plucked it from a Buddha's body and studied it for forty-nine days before cultivating the Immovable Bright King Eye!</p><p></p><p>This is a secret technique of Buddhism, he has used it many times, but this is the first time someone has recognized it.</p><p></p><p>"Your knowledge is impressive."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao praised him!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing heard Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao praise someone else.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao only praised Gu Jiuqing because he condensed the power of thirty dragon elephants and three portions of sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie shook his head, "Knowledge is knowledge, vision is vision. Elder Martial Brother, you misspoke."</p><p></p><p>Aren't knowledge and vision the same?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled, but Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's brows were tightly furrowed, and the small figure that came out of the vertical eye in the center of his brow emitted streaks of golden divine light, splitting the void, trying to pierce through Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first person to tell me I'm wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Smoke filled the air!</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie laughed lightly, not responding to Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"I see your knowledge is impressive, dare you debate with me?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao was absolutely the most knowledgeable person Gu Jiuqing had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Just the hundreds of divine powers he had condensed in the Tong Tian Jian Mu alone could suppress cultivators of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the Demon Prince, a Celestial Realm cultivator, had only cultivated twenty-one divine powers!</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother's knowledge is the foremost in this world, Wuxie dare not compare with him."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Then why did you refute me earlier?"</p><p></p><p>"Because Elder Martial Brother was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"How was I wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie said lightly, "My knowledge may not match Elder Martial Brother's, but my vision surpasses Elder Martial Brother's, which is why I could recognize that the divine power Elder Martial Brother used was the Immovable Bright King Eye."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing found it a bit confusing.</p><p></p><p>Knowledge is knowledge and understanding. After gaining knowledge and understanding, one's vision naturally improves.</p><p></p><p>Why did Si Wuxie say the opposite, that his vision surpassed Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's talents?</p><p></p><p>But his talents were inferior to Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's?</p><p></p><p>What was the reason?</p><p></p><p>He only heard Si Wuxie continue, "King-grade divine weapons are the supreme swords, unrelated to knowledge and insight."</p><p></p><p>"Among all true eyes in the world, the Immovable Bright King Eye of Buddhism and the Celestial Monarch's Eye of Taoism are the most revered. I have seen the true eye of the Celestial Monarch of Taoism, and it does not look like this."</p><p></p><p>"Coincidentally, I have also seen the true eye of the Immovable Bright King, so I know this is the Immovable Bright King Eye."</p><p></p><p>"Vision, vision, that is the understanding of heaven and earth. I have seen it, so I know it."</p><p></p><p>I have seen it, so I know it!</p><p></p><p>Knowledge, that is the understanding gained from others. Extensive knowledge can only be used to explain a person's talents.</p><p></p><p>But vision?</p><p></p><p>One needs to open it up oneself. I have seen it, so I know it!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Jiuqing understood how Si Wuxie distinguished between talents and vision.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao stared at Si Wuxie, the curiosity in his eyes leaking out.</p><p></p><p>"Within this small Sword Sect, there is actually such a great talent as Junior Martial Brother Wuxie?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have been living with a narrow view."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao admitted in person that he was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie looked at him, having recognized his Immovable Bright King Eye with his vision.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Wuxie's vision is unmatched, would you dare to have a contest with me?"</p><p></p><p>"In this Sword Tomb, there are many king-grade spirit swords. Can Junior Martial Brother identify them one by one?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since Elder Martial Brother has invited me, how dare Junior Martial Brother disobey?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother, please go first!"</p><p></p><p>The two great talents of the current era, oblivious to others, began competing in the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood outside the Sword Tomb, unsure whether to go in or stay out.</p><p></p><p>Having shed his mortal form ten times, Gu Jiuqing's natural talents were unmatched, but talents were talents, and vision was vision. Compared to Si Wuxie and Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's talents, he fell far short.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait on the side.</p><p></p><p>The understanding of vision and talents is actually quite similar.</p><p></p><p>If one's talents are high, their vision will naturally keep up. But here, Si Wuxie said Elder Martial Brother was wrong because Si Wuxie's talents were not high, he had only seen more things, so he said Elder Martial Brother misspoke on that point.</p><p></p><p>Ahem, my performance has been a bit poor these past few days, mainly because there have been fewer rating votes, monthly tickets, rewards, and comments.</p><p></p><p>If there are parts that are not written well, please point them out, readers, and I will revise them.</p><p></p><p>There is also another issue regarding the physical body's capacity.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill can refine the body and increase strength, but it can also gain additional Dragon Elephant Power.</p><p></p><p>This is similar to the sword intent of the Sword Dao. What is sword intent? Sword intent is akin to the principles of laws!</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragon Elephant Power? It is also equivalent to the principles of force.</p><p></p><p>These are additional things in the physical body. The physical body has the shackles of realms, and can only hold the capacity of a bottle. If it exceeds this capacity, either the bottle expands, or it breaks the bottle.</p><p></p><p>That is why Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao used divine weapons to suppress his physical body, to prevent the bottle from shattering.</p><p></p><p>This chapter is over 3,000 words. I beg for some data support!</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow will be the 30th day for this book. The new book rankings are for new books within the past month, so tomorrow will be the last day on the new book rankings.</p><p></p><p>The best ranking this book has achieved on the new book list is 39th place. Can it break through the shackles and enter the top thirty?</p><p></p><p>Ahem, I ask again for some data support, as well as investments. Don't forget, everyone!</p>

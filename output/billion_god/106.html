        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Southern Ridge, layer upon layer of mountains, the Thirty Thousand Horizontal Mountains were renowned as being impassable even for deities.</p><p></p><p>A suspended pavilion stood atop the Thirty Thousand Horizontal Mountains, guarding the Southern Ridge, sealing off the Great Wilderness, and sheltering the Great Zhou Dynasty for thousands of years. </p><p></p><p>The pavilion was vast, with streaks of starlight. This pavilion did not appear large, only about a hundred zhang, far smaller than a single peak of the Southern Ridge.</p><p></p><p>This was the Pavilion of Stars!</p><p></p><p>Residing within this pavilion was one of the four great patriarchs of the world's major sects - the Star Lord!</p><p></p><p>The hundred zhang Pavilion of Stars was not as magnificent as the Sword Sect's Divine Mountain, but outside the pavilion, streaks of starlight rippled, forming layer upon layer of star rings.</p><p></p><p>The star rings grew smaller the closer they were to the Pavilion of Stars. The first ring was only two to three hundred zhang wide, with celestial abodes formed within the ring, dividing the two realms.</p><p></p><p>Within the first star ring, there were two celestial abodes, housing the two supreme existences of the great Pavilion of Stars sect.</p><p></p><p>The second star ring was eight hundred zhang wide, the eight hundred zhang star river dividing the boundary, with around ten celestial abodes.</p><p></p><p>The third star ring was three thousand zhang wide, shining brilliantly, able to illuminate the heavens and earth for hundreds of li.</p><p></p><p>The fourth star ring was thirty thousand zhang! With pavilions and towers built atop it!</p><p></p><p>The fifth star ring was ten times larger than the fourth, spanning a hundred thousand zhang of starry space where the silhouettes of Pavilion of Stars disciples could be seen residing.</p><p></p><p>The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth star rings grew larger one by one, encircling the outermost perimeter.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators traversed the celestial expanse, coming and going between these four star rings.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling radiance flickered day and night, like fallen stars descending to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Within a celestial abode of the second star ring.</p><p></p><p>This celestial abode contained its own universe, with its own heavens and earth, sun and moon essences. The celestial light swirled, forming a massive disk hanging at the center of the abode. </p><p></p><p>Below the disk stood a celestial maiden, clad in a starry gauze robe, her jade feet exposed. Strands of celestial light emanated from her celestial apertures. In an instant, the celestial light burst through the immortal platform, entering the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the Mud Pill Palace was opened, and the first Yuanshen Heavenly Palace was sculpted.</p><p></p><p>Easy to say, but to truly break through to the Spirit Refinement Realm, sculpt a Heavenly Palace, and become a Yuanshen Immortal was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Yet this celestial maiden made it look effortless, her mastery of the Primordial Pill, borrowing of primal forces, coordination with the immortal platform, combined with the power from her celestial apertures - everything proceeded so smoothly, without the slightest effort, as she stepped into the Heavenly Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the celestial maiden, the elder of the Pavilion of Stars let out a sigh of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Maiden must have cultivated to the fifth or sixth layer of the Great Dipper Seven Stars Scripture, no?"</p><p></p><p>The elder, who had seen the winds and rains of time, marveled at the Holy Maiden's breakthrough to the Heavenly Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>If not for the previous Holy Son's demise, the Pavilion of Stars may never have discovered this supreme Holy Maiden.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Maiden of the Pavilion of Stars nodded slightly, "There is no need to hide it. In truth, this palace has already cultivated to the sixth star of the Great Dipper Seven Stars, with all six celestial bodies having entered the Heavenly Palace Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The sixth celestial incarnation of the Holy Maiden that remained in the Pavilion of Stars also stepped into the Heavenly Palace Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Absolute Incarnations of the Great Dipper contain sorrow, terror, shock, joy, rage, hatred, and vigilance. To perfectly unite these seven absolute incarnations into one, one must give birth to 'acceptance'!"</p><p></p><p>This referred to the eight principal emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. Uniting the seven incarnations would manifest the "acceptance" body.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method had many names - the Great Dipper Seven Stars Scripture, the Seven Absolute Incarnations of the Great Dipper, the Eight Colored Bodies - corresponding to the Taoist method of the Supreme Oblivion Scripture.</p><p></p><p>One cultivated the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, while the other severed the seven emotions and six desires.</p><p></p><p>Two methods, when taken to the extreme, both offered the possibility of transcendence.</p><p></p><p>The elder beamed with delight, "The Holy Maiden's seventh incarnation is cultivating vigilance on the moon. By achieving enlightenment through celestial divination, it can step into the Heavenly Palace and forge the Yuanshen upon minor accomplishment, completing the vigilance cultivation."</p><p></p><p>However, this celestial incarnation of the Holy Maiden frowned, gazing towards the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that incarnation has encountered some trouble."</p><p></p><p>Encountered trouble?</p><p></p><p>With the celestial beasts present, how could there be trouble?</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion of Stars lacked the Soul Altar of the Sword Sect, unable to perceive the life and death of its disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion of Stars stood in the Southern Ridge, its disciples entering and exiting the Thirty Thousand Mountains, where life and death were constant.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, that appears to be a sword aura slashed out by the great Sword Furnace of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The elder sensed it too!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt an aura of solemn slaughter rise from the heavens and earth. In the distant starry space, a practiced sword aura pierced the azure sky, its sword aura lingering, with the Milky Way hanging inverted as it soared into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"This is...!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's expression turned aghast.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Taoist Patriarch has made a move!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's Taoist Patriarch, a trinity of three-in-one, wielding the Sword Dao Furnace, slashing out a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Such divine might could submerge an entire great sect!</p><p></p><p>If this sword strike landed on the Pavilion of Stars, all nine star rings would shatter.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, this sword strike was aimed at the moon.</p><p></p><p>"That old undying one struck at the moon with a sword?"</p><p></p><p>The elder was stunned in disbelief, but quickly realized the gravity.</p><p></p><p>"Something must have happened on the moon, the Sword Sect's Moon Spirit Ship encountered danger while chasing the moon, prompting the Sword Sect's Taoist Patriarch elder to strike at the moon with a sword."</p><p></p><p>What a formidable sword strike.</p><p></p><p>That level of power, that sword intent, combined with the control of a Yuanshen - the elder was far from capable of such a feat.</p><p></p><p>Even the Holy Maiden revealed a hint of reverence.</p><p></p><p>The human experts, she as a celestial spirit was no match for them.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Zhou Dynasty, at the ancient ruins, the grand tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of immortal prohibitions were broken through, day and night bombardment of grand artifacts upon this place.</p><p></p><p>The great clans lacked the qualifications to approach the grand tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord. Only by dispatching at least one Heavenly Palace Realm cultivator from the Long Life Clan, wielding a grand artifact, could they set foot here!</p><p></p><p>The residual might of the remaining prohibitions rippled through the surrounding heavens and earth, deterring the physical and spiritual bodies of all.</p><p></p><p>Shattered remnants of the grand tomb flew about, along with fragments of divine weapons crashing onto the yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>A slightly slender youth, face veiled, carried a massive coffin on his back as he traversed the grand tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>Behind him followed a voluptuous woman, youthful in appearance yet exuding a trace of demonic aura, her lower body transforming into a misty cloud!</p><p></p><p>Yet human bloodlines still flowed within her.</p><p></p><p>She was the offspring of a demon and a human!</p><p></p><p>"Young master, don't run! The grand tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord has been sealed by the great sects, the Long Life Clan, and the Great Zhou imperial clan. You cannot escape this tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's all your fault for wanting to undress me. I already told you I was a virgin, but you didn't believe me. Now do you believe me, young master?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord kept his face veiled, his expression impossible to discern.</p><p></p><p>No doubt at this moment, the Great Celestial Lord must have been filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>He had simply wanted to verify if the Seventh Demon Celestial of the Demonic Dao was truly a virgin!</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect to expose the true identity of the Seventh Demon Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The First Demon Celestial had actually conceived an offspring with a demon, and this offspring had infiltrated the human realm.</p><p></p><p>"You've seen my body and learned my secret. Are you still going to deny it?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Xiangyu's speed was swift, only trailing slightly behind the Great Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Celestial Mother has taken a liking to me. As long as you're willing to be with me, the Celestial Mother won't blame you."</p><p></p><p>"Then you can ascend to the moon with me, cultivating on the moon undisturbed by others. Wouldn't it be wonderful to become an immortal couple?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiangyu's alluring eyes shone like silk, her voice tinged with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Oh Great Celestial Lord, you saw my body, so I'm giving it to you.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>Within the grand tomb, a void portal suddenly appeared, and the Great Celestial Lord's figure flew out of the Long Life Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiangyu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Why would there be a transmission portal within the Long Life Immortal Lord's tomb?"</p><p></p><p>She approached the portal, about to open it, but it suddenly crumbled to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient transmission portal that had existed since antiquity.</p><p></p><p>"Such an ancient portal, located at the edge of the tomb - how did the Great Celestial Lord know about it?"</p><p></p><p>"This person is so mysterious, carrying a black coffin. Could this coffin be the Long Life Immortal Lord's casket?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiangyu stood in place.</p><p></p><p>Her demonic-human heritage could not be revealed. If word spread, the celestials and humans would unite in outrage, and the remaining six Demon Celestials would suffer as a result.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I must request the Celestial Mother's intervention in the Great Zhou Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Immortal Lord's Tomb!</p><p></p><p>Sunlight shone, the heavens and earth were clear and bright.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord put away the black coffin on his back and tore off the black veil, revealing the appearance of a handsome youth.</p><p></p><p>The youth looked somewhat youthful, around sixteen or seventeen years old, but his spirit was vigorous, and his bearing restrained, clearly a great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you really had me going there! I thought you knew about this!"</p><p></p><p>"Little did I expect, you were clueless!"</p><p></p><p>The young lord let out a cold laugh, "Long Life Immortal Lord, you knew about this, why didn't you tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I just wanted to take a look at Chu Xiangyu's figure, what's wrong with that? Can't an old lady be tempted?"</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, never mind, never mind. Chu Xiangyu has just entered the Heavenly Palace Realm and has been wandering in the Great Zhou for so long. Those pure Yang patriarchs could see through her true form with a single glance, yet none of them paid her any mind. Now that you know Chu Xiangyu's secret, it's no big deal."</p><p></p><p>The young lord remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, you've been wanting my Great Nine Long Life Celestial Jade Hand for a long time, haven't you? I'll pass it on to you now, consider it an apology!"</p><p></p><p>This voice was rather uncouth, yet referred to itself as an "old lady", quite contradictory.</p><p></p><p>"Acceptable!"</p><p></p><p>"But after I help you regain your true form, Immortal Lord, you must meet with Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>"If Gu Jiuqing takes a liking to you, please help the Gu family continue their lineage!"</p><p></p><p>The uncouth voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>"What? Now you're even eyeing this old lady? Have you heard my voice? A female form with a male voice - this old lady prefers women, no, no, absolutely not."</p><p></p><p>"No worries, you won't have to call out when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Or how about this, let your old lady guide you to excavate the Celestial Court?" </p><p></p><p>The rude voice was truly anxious.</p><p></p><p>"When the Celestial Court fell, the Celestial Emperor had eighteen consorts. These eighteen consorts fell together into the Primordial Chaos. Who knows if some of the Emperor's consorts are still alive."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, that old thing the Celestial Emperor had another wife called the Nineteenth Consort. Although not recognized by the Queen Mother, she was absolutely a top-tier beauty."</p><p></p><p>"When the Celestial Court fell, the Nineteenth Consort was wandering in the Primordial Chaos, inspecting the Great Shang!"</p><p></p><p>"Your old lady knows the location of the ancient ruins of the Great Shang. That woman might have survived as well."  </p><p></p><p>"Also, the Celestial Emperor's mother, um, she seemed to have died early. Wait, your old lady also knows quite a few Celestial Venerables, including a female Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The young man chuckled and clenched his left hand.</p><p></p><p>"I want all the Celestial Venerables you mentioned!!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that with so many women for Gu Jiuqing, the Gu family couldn't produce a future heir!!</p><p></p><p>"Shua——————"</p><p></p><p>The rude voice gasped in shock, "Your old lady really can't do it, your old lady likes women."</p><p></p><p>The rude voice abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The young man looked up, and under his gaze, a sword aura pierced the sky and flew up.</p><p></p><p>"That's sword energy!"</p><p></p><p>The young man frowned. In his impression, such terrifying sword energy had never appeared in the Primordial Chaos at this time.</p><p></p><p>This sword aura was vast, containing the true intent of the ancient Celestial Court, with a supreme intent to unify the three realms and reign supreme.</p><p></p><p>This strike had touched upon the realm of space.</p><p></p><p>Distance was broken under this sword strike!</p><p></p><p>It was quite profound.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, this sword came from the north, from the location of the Northern Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>And this sword thrust straight into the clouds, targeting the moon.</p><p></p><p>The moon!!</p><p></p><p>The Three Sword Luminaries fell on the moon, which means the Sword Gate disciples encountered danger on the moon.</p><p></p><p>This sword contained the true intent of the Celestial Court, the supreme sword intent of the Great Celestial Peak lineage.</p><p></p><p>"It's the supreme strike unleashed by Daoist Cunyin with the Great Celestial Peak Sword Furnace!"</p><p></p><p>The young man looked anxious. For Daoist Cunyin to take such drastic action, it couldn't be just for the Three Sword Luminaries!</p><p></p><p>If not the Three Sword Luminaries, then who??</p><p></p><p>The young man frowned deeply and gazed at the moon, saying solemnly,</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Celestial Venerable, you should still have a trace of divine power within you, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What for?" </p><p></p><p>The rude voice was startled!</p><p></p><p>"Lend me that trace of divine power to use."</p><p></p><p>The rude voice didn't respond. After a long while, "What do you need divine power for? With your current strength, this trace of my divine power could crush you."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, your old lady doesn't have any divine power left. After breaking open the great tomb and taking out the Longevity Coffin, your old lady used up the last of her divine power."</p><p></p><p>"Your old lady really has not a drop left."</p><p></p><p>The rude voice pleaded poverty.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, if that's the case, I'll just leave you in the great tomb. In the eighteenth era's downfall, besides you, this Longevity Celestial Venerable who barely survived, that Celestial Emperor and the Queen Mother might also be alive."</p><p></p><p>The young man was firm. "Moreover, you know my vision - I've seen the future and understand the great era. Without your help, I can still become a deity!"</p><p></p><p>The rude voice laughed coldly, "Become a deity? You think it's that easy? The path to deityhood from this era collapsed along with the eighteenth Celestial Court. Without the Tao of Divinity to open the Divine Gate, it's impossible for you to become a deity."</p><p></p><p>The young man didn't speak, only raising three fingers. "I'll give you three counts to consider."</p><p></p><p>"Ai ai ai, don't do this, your old lady will give you divine nature!"</p><p></p><p>"This is your old lady's last trace of divine nature, really not a single drop left."</p><p></p><p>Divine nature bestowed!!</p><p></p><p>The young man's right eye suddenly changed, becoming bright.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Primordial Chaos, that sun suddenly shone brighter.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature activated his divine eye. At this moment, the young man seemed like a deity, looking down upon the vast heavens.</p><p></p><p>The moon.</p><p></p><p>The true Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel, a supreme treasure, swept across the azure void. The celestial vault rippled, and the moonlight divided yin and yang!!</p><p></p><p>Numerous divine wheels flew out from the Life and Death Wheel!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity Wheel, the Yin-Yang Wheel, the Four Symbols Wheel, the Five Phases Wheel, the Mystic Yellow Wheel - these five divine wheels intertwined, manifesting various unique attributes.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity Wheel shook, instantly descending upon the head of the Celestial Beast of the Starry Void.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! He wants to suppress the Celestial Beast of the Starry Void!"</p><p></p><p>If it were just the Demonic Crown Prince, the Celestial Beast could subdue and kill him on the moon.</p><p></p><p>But with the Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel, this supreme treasure of the Demonic Emperor, being unleashed, the Moon Peak Master cried out in alarm. He hurriedly communicated with the Celestial Beast to evade the divine wheels.  </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast of the Starry Void roared, "Howl————————"</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was dispersed, and the Supreme Unity Wheel shook. A massive beast arm rose up, like a mountain range hanging in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Wheel divided yin and yang, the yin and yang energies intertwining!</p><p></p><p>The Four Symbols Wheel manifested the four symbols, not as the four symbolic beasts, but as earth, water, wind and fire!</p><p></p><p>The Mystic Yellow Wheel released strands of mystic and wondrous energy!</p><p></p><p>These three divine wheels transformed into huge ring-shaped objects, descending upon one beast arm and two beast legs of the Celestial Beast.</p><p></p><p>Then the Five Phases Wheel became the primordial five elements, coalescing into five primordial divine mountains, pressing down on the Celestial Beast!</p><p></p><p>The five wheels suppressed the Celestial Beast of the Starry Void!</p><p></p><p>The massive figure swayed, shaking heaven and earth. The ancient form trembled, the stars and constellations on its body shaking off disciples of the Celestial Palace, and the twelve celestial palaces were about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood on the Moon Ship, aware of the terror of the Celestial Beast of the Starry Void.</p><p></p><p>No less formidable than a Pure Yang Progenitor!</p><p></p><p>But the Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel, the supreme treasure of the Demonic Emperor, could easily suppress the Celestial Beast?</p><p></p><p>"So the Demonic Emperor was also a three-in-one integrated deity at the level of a supreme expert?"</p><p></p><p>"Just how many three-in-one integrated deities are there in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the Primordial Chaos only covered a corner of the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Sword Gate, everything he knew came from others' words.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen nor been to those places himself.</p><p></p><p>This Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel greatly shook Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zhenchuan, the lightning liquid from the ancient Thunder Pool has been fully replenished, and the Divine Tally can be activated!!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Moon Ship can set off for the Primordial Chaos!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal looked at the lightning liquid in the Thunder Pool, then at the Divine Tally, and couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>They, the Sword Gate disciples, were saved.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Crown Prince could no longer pay attention to them. If they activated the Moon Ship at this moment, they could escape from the moon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the great battle in the distance. The Celestial Palace had helped them, only to be trapped by the Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel.</p><p></p><p>If they fled at this moment,</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be inhumane and unrighteous?</p><p></p><p>In the azure void below, the five divine wheels suppressed the Celestial Beast of the Starry Void. The Life and Death Wheel spun above the Demonic Crown Prince's head, while another treasure manifested a huge talisman, releasing yin and yang energies to envelop the Demonic Crown Prince's body.</p><p></p><p>If he could subdue the Demonic Crown Prince at this moment, with no one controlling the Myriad Realms Life and Death Wheel, this deadly situation would definitely be resolved.</p><p></p><p>But how could he break through the defense of this Yin-Yang Talisman treasure?</p><p></p><p>A pain came from his left eye, followed by an itch. Gu Jiuqing didn't know what mutation was happening to his left eye.</p><p></p><p>But it wouldn't be long before his left eye regrew!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could unleash the Mirror Flower Water Moon again!!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble————————"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast's massive form sank into the ground, crashing heavily.</p><p></p><p>The five divine wheels interacted with each other!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity, Four Symbols, Five Phases, Mystic Yellow, and Yin-Yang - the five divine wheels exchanged divine light, dazzling rays containing five true intents, and the might of the supreme treasure slowly rose!</p><p></p><p>It was activating a divine strike!!</p><p></p><p>One after another, the inscriptions became clear, instantly activating six thousand lines.</p><p></p><p>The divine might blanketed the heavens, and the divine strike gradually took form.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the primordial light blossoming in the mortal realm, a vast expanse of white light covering heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast of the Starry Void looked terrified. It was just a child, in its infancy. If it could survive this infant stage, it could withstand this strike with its bare hands!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing no longer hesitated, quietly opening his left eye!!</p><p></p><p>Pain!</p><p></p><p>So much pain!!</p><p></p><p>It felt like his flesh was being forcibly torn apart. Just opening his left eye a crack caused Gu Jiuqing's Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's soul to tremble, his thoughts wildly churning.</p><p></p><p>He forcibly endured this pain. Four illusory arms manifested behind his back, interweaving as he grasped the Celestial Court's supreme sword, the Great Celestial Peak sword intent rippling.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's right eye suddenly looked towards the starry void!</p><p></p><p>There, in the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>A sword aura pierced through, traversing hundreds of millions of miles across heaven and earth to strike the moon.</p><p></p><p>Space and distance were shortened by this sword strike, a pure yang aura like the sword aura shaking the heavens, burning with the power of pure yang thoughts!!!</p><p></p><p>A sword came from the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>Slashing into the moon.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, the Milky Way hung inverted, like a celestial river sword descending. The massive sword aura contained boundless sword intent, scattering across the azure void.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>All living beings on the moon sensed this sword descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"This strand of sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Celestial Peak sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"It's from the Supreme Patriarch of my Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal cried out.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate's Supreme Patriarch was protecting the sect!</p><p></p><p>The great sword descended from the starry void, striking towards the moon, enveloping the Moon Ship.</p><p></p><p>This sword took the Moon Ship as the origin point, slashing through the eight wilderness directions!</p><p></p><p>Eliminating all threats.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Peak sword in Gu Jiuqing's palm suddenly flew up into the heavens of its own accord.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, he seemed able to control this sword that came from the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>Seeking more chapters!

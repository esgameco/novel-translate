        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Youzhou Prefecture was located near ancient ruins from a previous era. </p><p></p><p>The ancient ruins within the Great Zhou territory dated back to the previous 18th imperial dynasty era.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that during that ancient time, the twilight of the gods occurred when the gods joined forces to destroy the celestial court. </p><p></p><p>In this twilight of the gods, the deities perished and the path to divinity was blocked.</p><p></p><p>But exactly what happened remains unknown to this day.</p><p></p><p>Since Youzhou was near these ancient ruins, after the founding of the Great Zhou, heavy troops were stationed there to suppress the area. The Son of Heaven even established the Qintian Monastery in Youzhou to specifically investigate the fall of the ancient celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Youzhou also became a battleground for the major clans, sects, and the four major religions to compete.</p><p></p><p>The younger generation of disciples traveling the world would enter Youzhou to test their skills against others. Therefore, in the nine prefectures, Youzhou was the most prosperous.</p><p></p><p>Transmission formations from the other eight prefectures led here, and occasionally six-rayed starlight would appear from ancient residences.</p><p></p><p>Rays of six-rayed starlight blossomed from an ancient transmission formation, and three figures emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing and the others who had rushed over from Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Qingzhou was a border region near the Southern Ridge Mountains. </p><p></p><p>The first stop for disciples traveling the world from the Xingchen Manor was the Southern Ridge.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Jiuqing set foot in Youzhou Prefecture, he saw streaks of starlight flickering in the sky above - it was the disciples of Xingchen Manor flying and weaving various celestial paths!</p><p></p><p>Brilliant rays of light fell from the heavens as the Xingchen disciples nearly surrounded Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Gu Jiuqing spotted a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>"Junwushang, Senior Brother Jun!"</p><p></p><p>This Senior Brother Jun from the Moon Peak lineage of Xingchen Manor was among the many Xingchen disciples.</p><p></p><p>This true inheritor of Xingchen Manor had a patch of starlight above his head that rippled into a nebula occupying a section of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rays of celestial light also emanated from his celestial apertures, forming halos that intertwined on a celestial banner.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Celestial Stars Formation of Xingchen Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao narrowed his eyes. With his extensive knowledge, he recognized this formation at a glance.</p><p></p><p>At the Niuniwan Palace, the Eight Trigrams Venerable had explained to Luyuan what the Celestial Stars Formation was.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao also explained it to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Xingchen Manor has an supreme scripture called the Future Constellations Sutra. According to Xingchen Manor, the future lies in the stars."</p><p></p><p>Huh? The future lies in the stars?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had never heard this saying before.</p><p></p><p>"The past cannot be changed, but the future can still be pursued. The present connects the past and future, so to change anything, one must act in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao spoke rather mysteriously. </p><p></p><p>Various celestial eyes appeared on his face - the Eight Trigrams Celestial Eyes, the Unmoving Bright King Eyes, the Void-Shattering Deluded Eyes.</p><p></p><p>These celestial eyes probed the Celestial Stars Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Future Constellations Sutra of Xingchen Manor was a heaven-born scripture from the sun itself.</p><p></p><p>The scriptures of the other three major religions were man-made - the Sword Scripture by the Primordial Sword, the Dao Scripture, the Buddhist Past Sumeru Sutra, and the Great Zhou's Imperial Scripture were all written by humans.</p><p></p><p>Only Xingchen Manor's Constellations Sutra was different.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that when the Stellar Lord founded Xingchen Manor at the Southern Ridge, one day he ascended to the stars and walked upon the Milky Way. With his physical body, he flew up to the sun!</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon in the Great Wilderness were similar in size and distance from Earth.</p><p></p><p>With the Stellar Lord's power, he could walk on the surface of the sun.</p><p></p><p>It was on that day that he brought back the primordial Future Constellations Sutra to Xingchen Manor.</p><p></p><p>It was also on that day that the saying "the future lies in the stars" spread from Xingchen Manor.</p><p></p><p>"This saying is quite bizarre. Since the stars near the Great Wilderness have been refined by Xingchen Manor, that old man Banshuai Nuona thought the future was in the celestial stars of the cosmos."</p><p></p><p>However, the celestial stars were too far from the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon were actually closest to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"After obtaining the Future Constellations Sutra, the Stellar Lord comprehended the Celestial Stars Formation from it. This formation can harness the power of the celestial stars and possesses supreme divine might. It is also one of the ten great formations of the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and sixty-five figures stood in the sky above Youzhou Prefecture, drawing down celestial starlight and channeling it through their own celestial apertures to envelop the entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The ancient city shone brilliantly, as if celestial halos were encircling it from above.</p><p></p><p>"Once the great formation is deployed, it will be cut off from the heavens and earth!"  </p><p></p><p>"No more transmission formations can enter Youzhou Prefecture from the outside now."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao marveled at the might of the Celestial Stars Formation.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear why the Xingchen disciples had covered Youzhou Prefecture with such a powerful formation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, Senior Brother Liangxiao, and Luyuan exited the transmission formation and entered the streets of Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, the citizens inside the ancient city did not panic upon seeing this scene. Instead, they curiously gazed up at the celestial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>As residents of Youzhou Prefecture, they had heard tales and even witnessed the clashes between wandering cultivators from across the world.</p><p></p><p>Although today's event was grand, it still paled in comparison to the battles between peerless experts that had occurred at the transmission formations before.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Stars Formation was deployed so quickly? What are the Xingchen disciples trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Rumor has it the Xingchen Holy Maiden has arrived in Youzhou Prefecture, and many followers from various clans have appeared as well!"</p><p></p><p>"The Xingchen Holy Maiden? Didn't she lose multiple times already? How is she still ranked on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking, even higher than the Zhou Prince by two spots?"</p><p></p><p>As they passed by a tavern in Youzhou Prefecture, Luyuan revealed his identity, and the head manager personally came out to welcome Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>This Luyuan Family tavern had been operating in the prefecture for hundreds of years and was quite renowned, spanning six floors.</p><p></p><p>The sixth floor!</p><p></p><p>The head manager curiously looked at these few cultivators before him. As a member of the Luyuan Family, his cultivation had also reached the Unitary Realm peak.</p><p></p><p>He could naturally recognize Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>But this young cultivator...he was even younger than the manager had imagined. The Luyuan Family had chosen to follow an immortal cultivator, but the manager only learned of this later.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Gu, are you perplexed by the Celestial Stars Formation outside Youzhou Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's gaze occasionally drift towards the sky above the prefecture, the manager asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>The manager hurriedly explained, "You've just arrived in Youzhou and are unaware!"</p><p></p><p>"The Xingchen Holy Maiden has been suppressed by the Zhou Prince again!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Senior Brother Liangxiao exclaimed in surprise, "I've seen the Xingchen Holy Maiden before. Previously, when she came looking for you, my junior brother, I caught a glimpse of her in the grotto-heaven."</p><p></p><p>"This Holy Maiden is a primordial celestial spirit who ascended and then joined Xingchen Manor. She's the second generation Holy Child of Xingchen Manor!"</p><p></p><p>The initial Xingchen Holy Child had rebelled and taken the Future Constellations Sutra, which was taboo for Xingchen Manor.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao had ignored this person.</p><p></p><p>"Logically, she shouldn't be much weaker than the Sword Child, so how could she lose to the Zhou Prince again?"</p><p></p><p>The manager glanced at Gu Jiuqing first. Seeing no reaction from him, he then responded to Senior Brother Liangxiao's words.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard from other cultivators that the Xingchen Holy Maiden seems to be cultivating the Seven Parting Avatars of the Stars!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao continued upon hearing the manager.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation method also comes from the Future Constellations Sutra. Supposedly, one must cultivate sorrow, fear, shock, joy, anger, and hatred to form seven avatars. After fusing them together, it's called the Eight-Colored Body Cultivation Method!"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards Gu Jiuqing. "So the Xingchen Holy Maiden who visited you at Sword Sect before must have been one of her avatars!"</p><p></p><p>Then how many avatars had the Xingchen Holy Maiden cultivated?</p><p></p><p>And which avatar had lost to the Zhou Prince?</p><p></p><p>According to the events from the tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord, the Xingchen Holy Maiden had first lost to the Great Celestial Lord, then to the Zhou Prince. Now she had lost to the Zhou Prince a second time.</p><p></p><p>Were these two different avatars of hers?</p><p></p><p>Or three avatars?</p><p></p><p>Or the same avatar?</p><p></p><p>With a flash of his divine sense, Gu Jiuqing realized that the Xingchen Holy Maiden he had met before had already reached the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>But when the Long Life Immortal Lord's tomb had just opened, the Zhou Prince was still in the Spirit Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>So the Xingchen Holy Maiden who visited Sword Sect and the one who lost to the Zhou Prince could not be the same avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the Eight-Colored Body cultivates seven avatars and fuses them into a final avatar. Xingchen Manor has deployed the Celestial Stars Formation, likely to restore the Xingchen Holy Maiden's reputation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly realized this point.</p><p></p><p>The manager beside them also nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"That's what's being spread outside now. After deploying the Celestial Stars Formation to isolate Youzhou Prefecture, the Zhou Prince is right here inside."</p><p></p><p>The manager couldn't help but look at Gu Jiuqing with renewed appraisal.</p><p></p><p>This immortal cultivator the Luyuan Family was following could deduce the truth behind this event despite being from another prefecture! Not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps following him really could lead the Luyuan Family to immortality!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing curiously gazed towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He had come to the Luyuan Family tavern this time to investigate information about the Three Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he ended up witnessing the enmity between the Xingchen Holy Maiden and the Zhou Prince along the way.</p><p></p><p>After further discussion with the manager, Gu Jiuqing also learned quite a bit about the ancient ruins and obtained news about the ancient mountain where the Three Great Calamities were trapped!</p><p></p><p>"Tiangu Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's conversation with the manager was not transmitted, so Senior Brother Liangxiao could only hear it.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the name of this ancient mountain, he was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, are you planning to enter the ancient ruins of Tiangu Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>They were currently being pursued by the Great Strength Samantabhadra Buddha and needed to lure him into an ancient ruin to slay him.</p><p></p><p>Tiangu Mountain was located within the ancient ruins - it would kill two birds with one stone!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, is there something special about Tiangu Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao nodded. "I came across quite a bit of information about the previous imperial dynasty in an ancient text."</p><p></p><p>That previous dynasty had disappeared too abruptly. The gods had fallen, the celestial court collapsed, and ninety-nine percent of cultivators died.</p><p></p><p>The remaining lifeforms seemed to be cursed as well, gradually perishing one by one.</p><p></p><p>"The fall of the ancient celestial court was an event that occurred in every previous imperial dynasty era."</p><p></p><p>The birth of each Celestial Emperor occurred by ascending the celestial court of the previous emperor.</p><p></p><p>But the previous dynasty was different - the ancient celestial court seemed to have been destroyed by the gods themselves.</p><p></p><p>And the gods had also perished.</p><p></p><p>"If it were just the gods perishing, it's impossible that the human race and demons of the Great Wilderness would have nearly gone extinct as well!"</p><p></p><p>"From those ancient texts, Senior Brother discovered a glimpse of the truth."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao's knowledge was indeed unmatched, as he had uncovered a sliver of the truth behind that ancient disappearance.</p><p></p><p>"After the ancient celestial court fell, the gods perished, and the path to divinity was blocked, the living beings were cursed!"</p><p></p><p>Cursed?</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing had heard such a claim.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out - it was the Eight Trigrams Venerable speaking through Luyuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Jiang, this claim of yours was also proposed by some Venerables during the Primordial Chaos era."</p><p></p><p>"It was said that in the early Primal era, the earliest batch of ancestors could not live past twenty years due to a curse!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable's voice appeared, but Senior Brother Liangxiao did not seem surprised.</p><p></p><p>He must have already known about the Venerable's presence within Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable's primal source was depleted, and he was about to perish.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Jiuqing did not inherit the Venerable's dao, he could only appear in this junior brother's body.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao recalled, "In the initial Primal era ancestors, although they drank blood and ate flesh, they shouldn't have been unable to live past twenty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had a realization.</p><p></p><p>This was a complete world!</p><p></p><p>There were eighteen imperial dynasties in antiquity.</p><p></p><p>Even if the eighteenth dynasty suddenly disappeared, there were still seventeen other dynasties.</p><p></p><p>The Primal era ancestors could have excavated ancient ruins and re-cultivated the methods.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that even after cultivating those methods, they still could not break through the twenty-year limit?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the twenty-year limit could not be transcended even by the cultivators of the Primal era!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable had lived for too long - he was one of the earliest immortals from the Primordial Chaos era.</p><p></p><p>His voice drifted back, taking Gu Jiuqing to that Primordial era.</p><p></p><p>"I was born in a village called Gu, because every night, there would be 'gu gu' sounds coming from outside the village."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable's memories were a bit hazy.</p><p></p><p>Having achieved immortality at such an early time, his two-bodied state caused some of his memories to blur.</p><p></p><p>He could only recall the 'gu gu' sounds from the village.</p><p></p><p>"Those sounds would appear every night until one day, they disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"It was then that people living past twenty first appeared in the village!"</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Eight Trigrams Venerable was only eight years old.</p><p></p><p>He was still very young back then.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There were not many things he could remember. </p><p></p><p>After he turned twenty, the shackles had long since disappeared many years ago.</p><p></p><p>The world had also become different - one by one the grown men walked out of the village, excavating in the ancient ruins. </p><p></p><p>Sometimes he could hear familiar companions embarking on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So when he was over forty years old, the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder also left the village to explore the distant lands.</p><p></p><p>He excavated the ancient ruins, found the cultivation methods, and only then embarked on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And his cultivation lasted for hundreds of years!</p><p></p><p>Not long after he came into the world, the Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, Star Lord, and Primordial Sword fought in the starry sky, cutting off a branch of the primordial moon tree.</p><p></p><p>The guest room in the tavern was quiet, and the great manager was both shocked and terrified. </p><p></p><p>He never expected that residing within Young Master Luyuan was one of the earliest ancient ancestors from the Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was digesting the words of the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder.</p><p></p><p>The ancient ancestor, the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder was one, and so were the Dao Ancestor of the Dao Sect and the Buddha Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect. These were the true immortals who had lived since the Primordial Era until now.</p><p></p><p>It was even possible that the ages of the Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, and Star Lord were a few years older than the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder.</p><p></p><p>They were the batch of ancient ancestors who had experienced the Twenty Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I also read in the books that during the eighteenth imperial era, there was a divine mountain that supported the ancient heavenly court!"</p><p></p><p>"And the place where the ancient ancestors first emerged was at the foot of this divine mountain that supported the heavenly court."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder's voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the earliest batch of ancient ancestors migrated from an ancient ruin near Youzhou, from that Primordial Mountain that supported the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder was shocked.</p><p></p><p>In his childhood, he had heard many "elders" mention rumors about the Primordial Village.</p><p></p><p>In the very beginning, there was a large group of ancestors living at the foot of a great mountain. Later, after the baptism of the Twenty Great Calamities time and again, they wanted to find the cause of these great calamities, so they left their ancestral land and ventured into the wilderness in search of answers.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, Primordial Mountain was the place where the ancient ancestors first appeared in ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"And the curse and ominous signs were also recorded at this place!"</p><p></p><p>The Twenty Great Calamities!</p><p></p><p>This was the ancient ancestors' name for it.</p><p></p><p>And Senior Brother Lianghao called it the ominous sign, which appeared again after the twentieth.</p><p></p><p>In many places of the ancient ruins, there were no names, because the ancient ruins were filled with lethal dangers - one careless mistake could lead to demise.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were names, they were just called by each person individually, without any unified naming.</p><p></p><p>Primordial Mountain, however, did have a unified name!</p><p></p><p>This is what allowed the legend of this divine mountain that supported the heavenly court to be passed down.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, it is no small matter for you to enter Primordial Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>The earliest birthplace of the ancient ancestors, the source of the Twenty Ominous Signs.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that Gu Jiuqing would encounter the origin of the ominous signs!!</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing just smiled!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, do not worry. I am only eighteen now. If I truly encounter the ominous signs, I will only show abnormalities two years later."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was not worried at all!</p><p></p><p>Two years?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was possessed by the ominous signs, he could suppress them with one hand!</p><p></p><p>Primordial Mountain had the treasures of the Three Great Villains. He needed to use these treasures to refine the Three Great Formations and enhance the strength of the Blue Star people.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Jiuqing had made up his mind, Senior Brother Lianghao no longer tried to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight scattered, falling into the room from the window outside.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed something, and Senior Brother Lianghao, Luyuan, and the great manager also looked towards the window.</p><p></p><p>There, the moonlight was like water, scattering in the celestial vault, forming a pure sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>And there was another person, draped in a starry gauze robe, walking on the sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>She was so sacred.</p><p></p><p>With stars as her clothes, treading upon the heavens, stepping on the earth and heavens, as if looking down upon mortals like a deity descending to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Her fair skin shone brighter than the starlight.</p><p></p><p>Every move she made emanated the rhythm of the Dao, her fleshly body itself a priceless treasure!</p><p></p><p>Yet such a sacred celestial maiden had a hint of great terror on her face.</p><p></p><p>She looked terrified, as if filled with fear towards these myriad mortals.</p><p></p><p>But with her status, who in this world would dare offend her?</p><p></p><p>A gauze veil covered her face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's left eye transformed into a profound pupil - this was the first time he used his left eye.</p><p></p><p>This scene was what he saw with his divine eye.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianghao turned to look at Gu Jiuqing, "It seems Junior Brother has also discovered that this incarnation of the Celestial Maiden is the Terrified Form."</p><p></p><p>Sorrow, terror, shock, joy, anger, hatred - these seven emotions would show on the face.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Celestial Maiden covered her face with a gauze veil.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden trod upon the void. If Gu Jiuqing had not seen through her true appearance, he would have marveled at the Celestial Maiden's beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh——————"</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the void space!</p><p></p><p>Within Youzhou Prefecture, figure after figure appeared, closely following behind the Celestial Maiden.</p><p></p><p>They were the Celestial Maiden's followers!</p><p></p><p>A total of eighty-one followers!</p><p></p><p>Among them, three stood closest behind the Celestial Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"Those are the Xu Family of the Cangluan Immortal Realm! The Tuoba of the Northern Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family of the Cangluan Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Tuoba Family of the Northern Wilderness Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>These two great immortal families were renowned throughout the Nine Provinces, their strength and fame surpassing even the Tianmu Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of these two immortal families, with jade-like appearances, had reached the peak of the Refining Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>And between these two immortal family descendants stood a woman.</p><p></p><p>"That is Cang Jingxi, the young daughter of Cang Lantian, the prefectural lord of Youzhou!"</p><p></p><p>The great manager explained to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Cang Jingxi is the face of Youzhou. Unlike the scions of other prefectural lords in the Nine Provinces, Cang Jingxi was sent to the Zhouxi Academy by the Youzhou prefectural lord when she was young, where she studied for decades before returning to Youzhou."</p><p></p><p>"When Cang Jingxi first entered Youzhou back then, she defeated several talents of Youzhou one after another. Later, she secluded herself for years of cultivation. After this recent emergence, she traveled through Youzhou, challenging the descendants of various great families."</p><p></p><p>"She is the number one talent in Youzhou!"</p><p></p><p>These were the battle achievements Cang Jingxi had built up.</p><p></p><p>Yet such a peerless talent had voluntarily become a follower of the Celestial Maiden.</p><p></p><p>In doing so, Cang Jingxi had undoubtedly given up her inheritance as the next Youzhou prefectural lord.</p><p></p><p>With the immortal families, great aristocratic clans, and seventy-eight family followers, the Celestial Maiden had not even become a Realized Being yet, but she already possessed the aura of one.</p><p></p><p>The starry sea was brilliant, and a beauty stood in the void!</p><p></p><p>Above Youzhou Prefecture, one after another disciple of the Celestial Palace bowed to the Celestial Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Celestial Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Celestial Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Celestial Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden nodded slightly, her gaze flickering with divine light.</p><p></p><p>She raised her hand to obscure the heavens, lighting up star after star, setting up the grand formation of the Myriad Heavenly Stars.</p><p></p><p>"I have arrived! Why does the Crown Prince of Zhou not appear?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden's words fell, shaking the vast heavens!</p><p></p><p>Before the Crown Prince of Zhou appeared, several figures flew up to the celestial palace, standing beside the Celestial Maiden.</p><p></p><p>They were other Celestial Maidens!!</p><p></p><p>The Terrified Form!</p><p></p><p>The Joyful Form!</p><p></p><p>The Enraged Form!</p><p></p><p>Three forms, added to the Terrified Form from before, four incarnations of the Celestial Maiden appeared above Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The four Celestial Maidens, their forms identical, the eyes visible similar, only the expressions hidden behind the gauze veils differed.</p><p></p><p>The four celestial maidens stood in the void realm, drawing in the radiance of the stars. They raised their hands together, pressing down towards Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight ripples, brilliant starlight poured down, illuminating the entire Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince of Zhou, dare you face me now?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall come and see you!"</p><p></p><p>Within Youzhou Prefecture, an ancient mansion suddenly exploded, torrents of moonlight pouring down, shattering the divine light in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble!</p><p></p><p>The starlight transformed, weaving into a giant star that fiercely smashed towards the ruined ancient mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The ground sank!</p><p></p><p>But the giant star halted three feet above the ancient mansion, unable to descend further.</p><p></p><p>A mighty man was seen holding up the giant star, a hint of anger on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Maiden, you must not go too far!"</p><p></p><p>Of the four Celestial Maidens, three remained silent, while the one who had appeared first let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"You say I went too far?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you think of that when you bullied my incarnation?"</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The giant star shattered!</p><p></p><p>Strands of powerful pressure rippled out from the Crown Prince of Zhou, illusory great dragons interweaving!</p><p></p><p>Celestial palaces flew out from the Mud Pill Palace, palace after palace manifesting, with the aura of the Imperial Dao descending, stirring up endless ripples in the void.</p><p></p><p>One celestial palace, two, three, four!</p><p></p><p>A total of five layers of celestial palaces!</p><p></p><p>A being with five layers of celestial palaces had appeared among the younger generation of this era.</p><p></p><p>The celestial palaces swayed, housing a primordial spirit within.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince of Zhou stared at this incarnation of the Celestial Maiden, his hands raised horizontally, like two great halberds, as if to slay her!</p><p></p><p>"I have learned the Heavenly Dragon Grappling Art in the Dragon Ling. If I strike, this incarnation of yours will surely perish!"</p><p></p><p>If one of the Seven Celestial Manifestations of the Celestial Maiden fell, when the Celestial Maiden assembled her true form in the future, she would lose a great deal of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>He did not wish to battle the Celestial Maiden at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden stood in the void, not taking action.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Crown Prince of Zhou spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Heir of the Sword Sect, the Dao Heir of the Dao Sect, as well as the Descending Dragon Arhat, Subduing Tiger Arhat, and Great Benefactor Arhat of the Buddhist Sect, and Marshal Chenghao have all entered the tomb of the Realized Immortal Lord of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>"If you and I battle here, and others seize the opportunity to reach the treasures of the Realized Immortal Lord of Longevity first, would that not be a pity?"</p><p></p><p>Excluding the Great Celestial Lord who had not emerged, only the two of them from the Dragon and Tiger Ranking remained in Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was silent above Youzhou Prefecture, with the ancient city's gazes piercing the void.</p><p></p><p>The old monsters, the immortals within the prefecture, were also watching this scene.</p><p></p><p>These were the hopes for the future of the human race in the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>They too wanted to know the gap between this younger generation and themselves.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it seemed this great battle would not erupt.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dragon Grappling Art!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianghao's expression changed as he looked at the Crown Prince of Zhou, revealing a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Divine beasts only existed in the ancient era, but they seemed invisible even back then."</p><p></p><p>"And the Heavenly Dragon Grappling Art was created by a Pure Yang Venerable Ancestor of the Zhou Imperial Family, an supreme divine ability."</p><p></p><p>This divine ability imitated the heavenly dragon, transforming the physical body into a heavenly dragon for grappling. It focused on achieving rebirth from the brink of death, fusing all spiritual power, primordial spirit, and origin into the physical body to manifest the divine body of the heavenly dragon!</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, after waiting so long, we still didn't get to see them battle."</p><p></p><p>Luyuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Jiuqing felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Since this great battle did not break out, the Celestial Palace disciples should also dispel the Grand Formation of the Myriad Heavenly Stars.</p><p></p><p>And they could leave Youzhou Prefecture at this moment to enter the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>But just as Gu Jiuqing's thought fell, the Celestial Maiden made her move.</p><p></p><p>In the void beyond the heavens, three incarnations guided the moonlight in the sky, and three voices spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince of Zhou, I will not bully you either. This is my Terrified Form, my second incarnation born two hundred and eighty years ago. You have been in this world for three hundred years. If you can withstand three of my strikes, all grievances between us will be cleared."</p><p></p><p>The voices of the three incarnations were ethereal. Then, the three incarnations left the battlefield, and the Terrified Form approached the Crown Prince of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>This great battle had finally erupted!</p><p></p><p>The brilliant starry sky, the sea of stars torn apart, the Celestial Maiden's Terrified Form unleashed her cultivation. She did not use her primordial spirit, nor did she manifest the laws of heaven and earth - she merely raised her hand towards the Crown Prince of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>A star condensed at her fingertip!</p><p></p><p>The giant star gathered, shining brilliantly without end, containing the radiance of the primordial universe. Strand after strand of starlight bloomed, as if the stars above were being drawn down with boundless radiance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Youzhou Prefecture was illuminated with clarity.</p><p></p><p>Ripples in the giant star, a figure appeared within!</p><p></p><p>Like a celestial being!</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Finger Strike!"</p><p></p><p>Even Senior Brother Lianghao had never seen such a divine ability before.</p><p></p><p>"This divine ability must have been created by the Celestial Maiden herself. The giant star slashes through the starry sky, like a falling meteor descending upon the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>This strike imitated that very concept!</p><p></p><p>With a finger strike...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Shattering the starry void, like a shooting star falling to the mortal realm. </p><p></p><p>Such true intent, condensed with just one finger.</p><p></p><p>Already no less than a great divine ability, even with the prospect of challenging an unsurpassed divine ability in the future.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing observed the battle between two great talents of the current era!</p><p></p><p>His left eye's second pupil opened, under the illumination of the second pupil, the movements of the two were greatly slowed down.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhou faced him like a formidable enemy, swallowing the heavens, his flesh body swelling, his celestial dragon origin intertwining, actually transforming into a hundred-zhang celestial dragon!</p><p></p><p>The might of the dragon overwhelmed the world, a true dragon descended!</p><p></p><p>The hundred-zhang body condensed in the air, that was the true dragon form! More draconic than any of the twenty-two postures of the Dragon Elephant Skill!!</p><p></p><p>The oppressive might of the celestial dragon descended, and the civilians within Youzhou Prefecture directly knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The draconic might was too terrifying, they dared not defy it. Some cultivators remained standing, but under the constant exertion of the draconic might, their flesh bodies were crushed!</p><p></p><p>Directly crushed into a bloody pulp!</p><p></p><p>The remaining cultivators at the Discarding Mortality realm could only half-kneel or lie prostrate like ordinary mortals, not daring to rise!</p><p></p><p>The Great Prince of Zhou!</p><p></p><p>The future Emperor of Great Zhou, bowing to the Prince of Zhou would not invite ridicule.</p><p></p><p>Celestial immortals descended.</p><p></p><p>The great stars fell into decline, with celestial immortals condensing within the great stars.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was indistinguishable whether they were great stars or celestial immortals, the two intertwined and fused together.</p><p></p><p>The celestial dragon battled!</p><p></p><p>True draconic arms horizontally pressed down on heaven and earth, five claws tearing apart the great stars.</p><p></p><p>Yet another celestial immortal flew out from the shattered stars, battling together with the true dragon!</p><p></p><p>The void scattered, transforming into the image of ruins, rays of divine light were shattered, the entire prefecture city shook as if about to collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Great terror, overwhelming the civilians!</p><p></p><p>However, this move quickly ended.</p><p></p><p>The true body of the celestial dragon appeared with injuries, the celestial immortal torn apart, dissipating into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars gazed at the Prince of Zhou's true draconic body and calmly said, "The Dragon Subduing Art of the Great Zhou imperial clan is indeed extraordinary. It is rumored that if the Emperor of Great Zhou unleashes the Dragon Subduing Art, he dares to battle a true immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"What I have witnessed today, those rumors seem to be true."</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Goddess flickered!</p><p></p><p>Transforming herself into a celestial immortal!</p><p></p><p>She did not employ any magic powers or divine abilities; this time, she wanted to battle the Prince of Zhou's flesh body personally!</p><p></p><p>Her gossamer robes danced, starlight swirled in the sky, the Celestial Goddess of Stars descended like a celestial immortal, primordial radiance constantly scattering, like a celestial maiden suppressing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Two rays of divine light clashed and missed!</p><p></p><p>They had already separated.</p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>Most people did not even see clearly what happened, only noticing that the two had already switched positions.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing saw it clearly.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars' terrifying flesh body, with the momentum of a celestial immortal, tore through heaven and earth, carrying the stars in her strike.</p><p></p><p>While the Prince of Zhou manifested the body of a celestial dragon, imitating the Dragon Subduing the Azure Heavens!</p><p></p><p>The two figures both unleashed the most powerful strikes of their flesh bodies!</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for this!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao shook his head, "They both have flaws. Junior Brother, you must remember, never use brute force!"</p><p></p><p>Ah, this?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's strength was invincible, he had the power of a million dragon elephants, capable of shattering the Celestial Palace realm. Even Tribulation realm celestials, if they did not specialize in the flesh body, would be severely injured by him!</p><p></p><p>He could even sever their flesh bodies.</p><p></p><p>He had always used overwhelming force!</p><p></p><p>"For example, if I were the Prince of Zhou, with my divine eye, I could see three flaws in the Celestial Goddess of Stars' flesh body. With half my strength, or even one-tenth, I could destroy her flesh body."</p><p></p><p>After destroying her flesh body, he could instantly pierce her mud-ball palace with his magic power!</p><p></p><p>If he were to battle Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, physical strength and magic power would be secondary. The most important thing was not to reveal any flaws.</p><p></p><p>He had sliced through too many demons and cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Once someone had defects in their primordial spirit, flesh body, magic power, or divine abilities, Liang Xiao would find them and subdue them.</p><p></p><p>"They are both probing each other's strength. The second move will not decide the victor!"</p><p></p><p>"We can only wait for the third move."</p><p></p><p>Just as Liang Xiao finished speaking!</p><p></p><p>The two figures in the sky once again faced each other.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-zhang true draconic body swayed, its injuries fully healed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Goddess of Stars raised her hands, this time raising both hands to the heavens, a series of hand seals intertwining, the stars transforming into a great talisman, rippling in her palms.</p><p></p><p>That was an unsurpassed secret art!</p><p></p><p>At the Celestial Palace realm, one could create secret arts and divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars was a primordial sacred spirit, and the divine ability she created was more powerful than ordinary top-grade abilities.</p><p></p><p>And the Stellar Talisman she was manifesting now was even more unique!</p><p></p><p>The celestial dragon manifested by the Prince of Zhou once again transformed into its true form!</p><p></p><p>He saw the terror of this secret art of the Celestial Goddess of Stars and did not dare resist it with his flesh body.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's second pupils radiated, rays of divine light suddenly surging forth from them.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a hint of killing intent!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, the Great Strength Bodhisattva of Guangping has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The second pupils retracted, and that wisp of killing intent disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao had not yet reacted when, after the time it takes a breath, he suddenly trembled!</p><p></p><p>"He has indeed arrived!"</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, three hundred and sixty-five disciples of the Celestial Stars Pavilion had arranged the Grand Formation of the Myriad Heavenly Stars, sealing Youzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>To escape Youzhou Prefecture, one would have to break through the formation first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's body moved, "Senior Brother, give me a moment's time!"</p><p></p><p>A moment's time?</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Great Strength Bodhisattva of Guangping had already appeared in Youzhou. He had passed through other ancient teleportation formations to teleport to the territory of Youzhou.</p><p></p><p>Only eight hundred li away from Youzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>He could wait a moment's time.</p><p></p><p>The wine pavilion shook, and a figure flew up into the void!</p><p></p><p>This great battle had attracted countless eyes, the entire Youzhou Prefecture was focused on it. At this moment, someone appeared above Youzhou, naturally drawing everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that? How dare they fly up to the heavens at this moment?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange! Why is he wearing a veil over his face?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Why is he also carrying a coffin on his back!"</p><p></p><p>Someone suddenly exclaimed, "The Black Coffin Divine Artifact! It's the Great Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>This voice caused even more people to cry out in shock.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Celestial Lord! He has appeared at this moment."</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord had been missing for a long time. His appearance now caused the cultivators of Youzhou Prefecture to be stunned before recognizing the Great Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator carrying the black coffin flew up into the heavens!</p><p></p><p>He stood before the Prince of Zhou!</p><p></p><p>He did not speak, he only raised his fist and struck out!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The space before him shattered, the vacuum disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>That was a strike that shattered the vacuum.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing imitated Zhou Tianxingcui's Shattering the Starry Void, using myriad Dragon Elephant Domains to unleash an unsurpassed strike.</p><p></p><p>The vast void shattered, the entire heavens like a mirror, layer upon layer torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"Great Celestial Lord, what are you doing!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhou's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He had fought the Great Celestial Lord before and been defeated by him.</p><p></p><p>He knew the Great Celestial Lord's strength, but facing this strike that shattered the vacuum, he was still horrified.</p><p></p><p>This strike!!</p><p></p><p>Even his Celestial Dragon True Intent was shattered!</p><p></p><p>The origin ripples within his body showed signs of disintegration.</p><p></p><p>That was just from the shattering of the void, causing his origin to tremble.</p><p></p><p>If the force that shattered the vacuum touched his flesh body, everything would be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>He could not afford to hesitate and summoned a divine artifact!</p><p></p><p>A divine halberd instantly radiated divine light, dao ripples, three thousand dao marks intertwining, transforming into a ray of divine light appearing before him!</p><p></p><p>"Boom————————"</p><p></p><p>The divine light tore through the heavens, the force that shattered the vacuum controlled within the celestial realm, not a shred leaking out.</p><p></p><p>Only the Prince of Zhou felt the terrifying power of this force.</p><p></p><p>His chest deeply caved in.</p><p></p><p>That was the divine halberd being struck by the force that shattered the vacuum, impacting his flesh body.</p><p></p><p>His chest was torn apart, blood and magic power flowing out, heavily injured in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Wah————"</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of blood sprayed out, scattering in the heavens, as he fell heavily to the ground in Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After the person carrying the great coffin did this, he bowed to the Celestial Goddess of Stars.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators here no longer require the Celestial Goddess to act!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars stared at Gu Jiuqing, her heart rippling.</p><p></p><p>This Great Celestial Lord, emerging from nowhere, defeated her incarnations one by one, and now even the Prince of Zhou who had condensed the four Celestial Palace realms was defeated by him in a single move.</p><p></p><p>She suspected that the Great Celestial Lord had been hiding his identity all along.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Celestial Goddess of Stars' followers frowned.</p><p></p><p>The licentious Great Celestial Lord had been seen in many Youzhou brothels. It seemed the Great Celestial Lord wanted to join the Celestial Goddess of Stars' bedchamber! In that case, their positions would need to be rearranged.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Celestial Lord is indeed powerful, actually defeating the Prince of Zhou. Doesn't this mean the Great Celestial Lord will take the sixth position on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Celestial Lord displayed invincible prowess as soon as he appeared. During these days, the Great Celestial Lord must have been in secluded cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out, and the Celestial Goddess of Stars stared at Gu Jiuqing, a hint of complexity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord had told her to seek out Gu Jiuqing of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>She had seen Gu Jiuqing before. This true inheritor of the sword path was not bad, but still inferior to the Great Celestial Lord by three levels.</p><p></p><p>If she had to choose, she would choose the Great Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was time to give the Great Celestial Lord a chance.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars extended her hand, and a divine bridge descended before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Great Celestial Lord have time tonight to appreciate the moon with me?"</p><p></p><p>The other three incarnations of the Celestial Goddess of Stars also came forward, surrounding Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Four celestial maidens, all gazing at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>He could not handle it, he absolutely could not handle it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly shook his head, "The Prince of Zhou has been defeated. Please ask the disciples of the Celestial Stars Pavilion to dispel the Grand Formation of the Myriad Heavenly Stars."</p><p></p><p>Feigning indifference?</p><p></p><p>Not agreeing immediately?</p><p></p><p>Was he trying to seize the initiative?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars smiled, the four celestial maidens smiling like flowers, simultaneously gesturing to the three hundred and sixty-five disciples of the Celestial Stars Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang took the lead, retrieving the flag above his head, the starlight in the sky dissipating. The other disciples also retrieved their flags.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the starlight of the myriad stars disappeared, and the grand formation also dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"This humble servant has heard that in Youzhou Prefecture, there is a Tower for Plucking Stars, nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang high, an excellent place to appreciate the moon."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars was being too proactive, even specifying the location to appreciate the moon.</p><p></p><p>This made her followers jealous.</p><p></p><p>Even more infuriating was that this person was still looking around distantly.</p><p></p><p>He clearly did not take the Celestial Goddess of Stars' invitation to heart.</p><p></p><p>Too late!</p><p></p><p>The moment's time had already passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to the Celestial Goddess of Stars.</p><p></p><p>"Another day! Another day!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely keep my appointment another day. For now, I must take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, carrying the black coffin on his back, flew towards the outskirts of Youzhou Prefecture. Two more figures flew out from below, following behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Sword qi filled the air, divine swords soaring, the three of them treading on the divine swords, quickly flying out of Youzhou Prefecture and disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>The four Celestial Goddesses of Stars changed expression.</p><p></p><p>She had invited the Great Celestial Lord, yet he rejected her??</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord loved beauties. Could it be that this humble servant's beauty was no longer pleasing to his eyes?</p><p></p><p>"How arrogant and conceited, thinking himself invincible under heaven after suppressing the Prince of Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>Two followers from the long-established families coldly snorted!</p><p></p><p>Expressing their dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Within Youzhou Prefecture City, the fallen Prince of Zhou rose to his feet!</p><p></p><p>He had actually been defeated so thoroughly?</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the heavens, a Buddhist light illuminating the azure sky, a Buddha descending towards Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky was like a painting, with a Bodhisattva rolling up the painting with one hand, treading on the painting, as if compressing the vast earth to the size of an inch!</p><p></p><p>When this Bodhisattva landed nearby, the void was released from the painting, but the Bodhisattva plucked out a new void.</p><p></p><p>Buddhist verses resounded throughout Youzhou, shaking the people to kneel and worship.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Buddha from the Buddhist realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhou was startled, no longer feeling the pain in his chest.</p><p></p><p>A Bodhisattva walking the earth had arrived in Youzhou?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars stood up, as did the other cultivators, gazing at the Bodhisattva's figure in the distance.</p><p></p><p>But the Bodhisattva did not acknowledge them, extending his hand to fold the void into a painting, stepping on the painting, each step spanning dozens of li!</p><p></p><p>In just a few steps, he had passed Youzhou Prefecture, heading towards the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Little bugs, I see you!"</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Night!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rubbed his eyes and closed his laptop. </p><p></p><p>During this period on the high martial Blue Star, except for going to school for classes, he stayed at home surfing the internet, browsing various websites and major forums, understanding this world.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing's searches over many days, he could basically be considered a native.</p><p></p><p>"Probably more than five hundred years ago, the spiritual energy of the Blue Star was revived, and everyone practiced martial arts, ushering in the high martial era."</p><p></p><p>"Refining skin martial cultivators, refining flesh martial cultivators, refining bone patriarchs, refining tendon great patriarchs, refining organ martial kings, two hundred years ago, the first martial sage was born."</p><p></p><p>"Titled the First!"</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Sage, from the imperial capital, from the military, was also one of the top ten martial sages in the world.</p><p></p><p>"And in the first hundred years after the revival of spiritual energy, the world fell into chaos, sea creatures invaded the continents en masse, and three S-level demonic beasts destroyed cities. That was the most turbulent era. After years of fierce battles, the three S-level demonic beasts were driven into the Pacific Ocean, and the world returned to normal, but many technological means disappeared, and the space-based martial weapons malfunctioned."</p><p></p><p>In this chaotic era, various nations used nuclear weapons, but their power was greatly reduced against the backdrop of the revival of spiritual energy, and nuclear pollution was also reduced to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>This also led to all the world's nuclear weapons being used up during that era.</p><p></p><p>After the chaotic era passed, the world discovered that the periodic table of elements had changed! Various elements were in chaos, and many modern technologies could no longer be used, officially ushering in the high martial era.</p><p></p><p>"The First Martial Sage! He is still alive in the real world, appearing in Shennongjia yesterday to hunt an S-level demonic beast."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lay on the bed and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this martial sage can be compared to the Buzhou realm."</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's world, one shed mortality to establish the foundation, leaked the heavenly mechanism to condense the Dharma power, forged the Buzhou to refine the body, comprehended the heavens and earth to refine the divine soul, understood yin and yang to form the celestial palace, and achieved longevity by transcending tribulations!</p><p></p><p>His father was a Buzhou realm body refining cultivator who had condensed his own divine body. While the martial sage's blood metamorphosis was far more powerful than a martial king who refined organs.</p><p></p><p>It was only two hundred years ago that humans gave birth to the first martial sage.</p><p></p><p>After the First Martial Sage entered the blood metamorphosis realm, he lived for a full two hundred years. With such a long lifespan, the power of this martial sage was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"It should be comparable to the Buzhou realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing casually opened the power strip on the bedside cabinet, and a red light lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was the surveillance camera starting to operate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to figure out a problem!</p><p></p><p>When he fell asleep on the high martial Blue Star, he could enter the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>When he fell asleep in the Primordial Chaos, he would come to the high martial Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He could now confirm that his true form in the Primordial Chaos was not on the high martial Blue Star, but should still be in the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>So!</p><p></p><p>Once he fell asleep, would this Blue Star true form fall into a deep sleep or undergo changes?</p><p></p><p>If he encountered danger while in a deep sleep and his Blue Star true form died, would he die as well? Or would he lose the medium and be unable to come and go between the high martial Blue Star?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was eager to know the result, so he installed a surveillance camera.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Jiuqing lying on the bed fell into a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Huff——————"</p><p></p><p>Inside the flying carriage, Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, greeted by an ancient and elegant environment.</p><p></p><p>A wooden bed, a folding screen with dragons and phoenixes intertwined, two curtains hanging above the bed, and a blue lamp swirling in the void, emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>He's back!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing got up and walked out of the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you woke up even later than yesterday."</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie's voice rang in his ears, the white-haired old man's face carrying a smile.</p><p></p><p>"However, Young Master has already completed two sheddings of mortality, and joining the Sword Sect has become a certainty. You should rest."</p><p></p><p>The sun had risen, just reaching noon.</p><p></p><p>Converted to Blue Star time, it was exactly eleven o'clock.</p><p></p><p>This also matched the time when Gu Jiuqing fell asleep on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"Those young masters from yesterday didn't come looking for you. But a few young masters from other ancient cities did come to see you."</p><p></p><p>Young masters from other ancient cities?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped down from the flying carriage, and as soon as his figure touched the ground, several figures approached from afar.</p><p></p><p>They walked slowly, and their voices carried before they arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Gu, you've finally woken up. You made us wait quite a while."</p><p></p><p>The youth wore a jade pendant at his waist, holding a folding fan, a feather fan and gauze scarf, a scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Shaoli of Tianyuan Ancient City greets Young Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli bowed to Gu Jiuqing, and the three youths beside him did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Fei of Qingyang Ancient City greets Young Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Qing Yangbai of Shengxu Ancient City greets Young Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qingzhou of Guiyuan Ancient City greets Young Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>The four ancient city youths rose, looking at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli of Tianyuan Ancient City!</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei of Qingyang Ancient City!</p><p></p><p>The names of these two youths had long resounded at the Sword Sect Gate.</p><p></p><p>Today was the fourth day of the Sword Sect's great examination, and on the first day, these two youths had already completed one shedding of mortality in just half a day, causing even the higher-ups of the Sword Sect's Divine Mountain to sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli had a scholarly air, extraordinarily talented! His face was slightly pale, as if he hadn't seen the sun for a long time, his heart set solely on reading the classics of sages.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei wore a sword at his waist, modeling himself after a Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai of Shengxu Ancient City was gentle and elegant, a faint smile on his face, like basking in a spring breeze. Such a graceful demeanor, though not as handsome as Gu Jiuqing, could still rival him.</p><p></p><p>The fourth, Xia Qingzhou from Guiyuan Ancient City, was a graceful lady, resembling Yang Miiaojing, standing upright like a water lily, exceptionally beautiful and pure, truly a descendant of a prestigious family.</p><p></p><p>The prestigious families of the ancient cities required their ancestors to have reached the Buzhou realm!</p><p></p><p>Great families required having produced a celestial palace cultivator who understood yin and yang!</p><p></p><p>The bloodlines of great family disciples were blessed more by their ancestors, and these four youths all came from great families.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Family of Qingyang Ancient City, the Qing Family of Shengxu Ancient City, the Fan Family of Tianyuan Ancient City, and the Xia Family of Guiyuan Ancient City were all renowned great families in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>These four great family disciples blocked Gu Jiuqing's flying carriage, what was their intention?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was sizing them up, and they were sizing him up too.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Jiuqing, with you completing two sheddings of mortality in three days, you will surely join the inner sect of the Sword Sect during the nine-day examination. We have all completed two sheddings of mortality as well. If we join the inner sect in the future, we should advance and retreat together."</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli held his folding fan, speaking calmly.</p><p></p><p>They were trying to recruit him?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paused.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>He was the "prodigy" who completed two sheddings of mortality in just three days.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Sword Sect Gate, apart from Si Wuxie who was accepted as a true disciple by the higher-ups of the Sword Sect, his "talent" was unmatched among the ancient city youths, overflowing with brilliance, the most gifted of this batch.</p><p></p><p>It made sense for the four great family disciples to try to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled slightly, "I dare not refuse the kind invitation of the four young masters."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good!"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Gu, for joining us."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not refuse. For this generation of ancient city youths joining the Sword Sect, this was their common ground. By joining forces to enter the inner sect, they could look out for each other and quickly establish themselves in the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Sect Gate!</p><p></p><p>There were fewer people around the stone steles, as those ancient city youths had found a secluded area near the Sword Sect Gate to cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>"That's Gu Jiuqing!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing is staying with those great family disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye saw Gu Jiuqing's figure and was first startled, then revealed a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>Those great family disciples were true prodigies, having already completed two sheddings of mortality. They would definitely complete three sheddings within the nine days of the great examination to join the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gu Jiuqing had actually joined them?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou let out a cold snort and continued practicing the twenty-second form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qu Yaozhou had no intention of bothering Gu Jiuqing, Lu Buye could only stand by and also cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Around these two people, there were no longer any traces of the young men from the ancient city of Tianyuan. </p><p></p><p>It seemed they had cut off contact with Qu Yaozhu.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his gaze and followed Ye Fei and the others to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, just a few clowns jumping around. Young Master Jiuqing, you can complete two sheddings in three days. You don't even need three days to proceed to the third shedding. In the nine-day great test, you may even complete four sheddings!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli held a folding fan and said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>They were all talents who aimed to achieve four sheddings within nine days. They looked down on those with just the talent for three sheddings.</p><p></p><p>"Among the thirteen ancient cities in the northern lands, only we five have such talent. There's no need to pay attention to them."</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli looked like a scholar, but his arrogance far exceeded anyone Gu Jiuqing had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>He did not take to heart the matter between Gu Jiuqing and the young men of the ancient city of Tianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Because he believed that those young men from the ancient cities were trash, mere ants, while he was someone who walked the vast wilderness. After the sword gate great test, he would join the inner sect of the Sword Gate, lording over all. This was their one and only intersection in life.</p><p></p><p>He said this for Gu Jiuqing to hear, but also for himself to hear.</p><p></p><p>Insignificant people were not worth contact.</p><p></p><p>On the path of cultivation, every step was arduous. To waste one's life on these people would truly be a pity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded slightly and followed them to another realm. This place was a bit far from the three stone steles, but closest to the Sword Gate divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before Gu Jiuqing was a divine stone, a divine stone shrouded in thick mist.</p><p></p><p>This divine stone lay on the ground, about the size of an arm, with an ancient divine sword inserted into it, emanating threads of decaying aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt his gaze being corroded!</p><p></p><p>A piercing pain came from his eyes, then a line of clear tears flowed from the corners of his eyes, but he still looked towards the sword-testing stone.</p><p></p><p>The divine sword was three feet and three inches long, with three ancient words engraved on the hilt.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Sword!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Sword was inserted into the sword-testing stone, emanating threads of ancient decaying aura, while wisps of sword aura appeared horizontally, constantly slicing the void around it.</p><p></p><p>Within ten meters of the sword-testing stone, there was no one. Only beyond ten meters stood several figures.</p><p></p><p>Those were the talents of the northern lands, at least having undergone one shedding, and some who had undergone two sheddings from the ancient cities.</p><p></p><p>A crisp voice entered their ears, it was Xia Qingzhou from the ancient city of Guiyuan speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Sword was the flying sword of the Jade Sword Immortal of the Sword Gate. However, this Sword Immortal fell in the wilderness twenty years ago. His flying sword flew into the Sword Gate of its own accord and became the divine sword on the sword-testing stone."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou seemed to be explaining to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"The four great sects, with the Sword Gate guarding the northern lands, are renowned for their supreme sword arts and are the holy land for sword cultivators in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Mastering the sword path leads to immortality, hence the title 'Sword Immortal'. Most of the elders of the Sword Gate are Sword Immortals. Only a few have failed to open the path of the sword. And among those of the same realm, Sword Immortals are unquestionably first."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate guards the Sword Gate Pass in the northern lands. When Sword Immortals appear, they can slay the wilderness with a single sword stroke. The demons of the wilderness dare not enter the Sword Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, few, if any, demons have broken through from the Sword Gate Pass into the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>This is the might of the Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>"Only by becoming a true disciple of the Sword Gate can one have the chance to be accepted by a Sword Immortal and cultivate the supreme sword path."</p><p></p><p>"But if one first becomes an inner disciple of the Sword Gate, and then a true disciple, it takes far too long."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had heard about the Sword Gate's tests in the ancient city of Tianyuan.</p><p></p><p>For outer disciples to be promoted to the Sword Gate, it takes ten full years!!</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented the person, they must stay in the outer sect for ten long years before applying for the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>The test to become an inner disciple is to leave the Sword Gate Pass and travel the wilderness for ten days.</p><p></p><p>If one can safely return to the Sword Gate after ten days, they become an inner disciple.</p><p></p><p>For an inner disciple to become a true disciple, one must have three inner disciples recommend them, and two, leave the Sword Gate Pass to slay ten demons in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Third, their cultivation must reach the Unbounded Realm!</p><p></p><p>After meeting these three conditions, one must still be actively acknowledged by the Sword Gate elders for their talent before being accepted as a true disciple to become a Sword Immortal's student.</p><p></p><p>"But now, there is a shortcut before us. If one can comprehend even a hint of the sword intent from the sword-testing stone, they can become a true disciple of the Sword Gate, catching the attention of the Sword Immortals!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes burned with passion!</p><p></p><p>He too wanted to become a true disciple of the Sword Gate. Once he did, the Gu family could soar to prominence. His sister Gu Linglong would no longer need to do business outside.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's long dress fluttered as she sat down. "If Young Master Gu becomes a true disciple one day, don't forget us."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou smiled faintly, as did Ye Fei, Fan Shaoli, and Qing Yangbai.</p><p></p><p>They didn't think they would lose to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The fourth day of the great test!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing joined the four talents from great clans to observe the sword-testing stone, hoping to comprehend the sword intent within.</p><p></p><p>A day passed in a daze. During this time, Ye Fei got up twice to practice the Dragon and Elephant Skill, while Xia Qingzhou got up three times. Qing Yangbai and Fan Shaoli only got up once each.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing did not practice the Dragon and Elephant Skill, remaining seated cross-legged observing the sword-testing stone.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Jiuqing is entranced!"</p><p></p><p>After Fan Shaoli finished practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill and returned, Gu Jiuqing was still seated cross-legged outside the sword-testing stone. During this period, he did not get up and continued observing the stone.</p><p></p><p>The other youths exchanged glances but did not disturb Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>As fellow talents, what one did required no guidance from others.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing wanted to observe the sword-testing stone, comprehend the sword intent from it, and take a celestial step by abandoning the Dragon and Elephant Skill, that was his business. They could not and would not stop him.</p><p></p><p>The fifth day of the great test. As dawn broke, Gu Jiuqing had not slept all night.</p><p></p><p>It happened to be Saturday on the Azure Star of High Martial Arts, so he didn't need to go to school.</p><p></p><p>He too wanted to know if he had the talent for the sword path.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's talent in the sword path was average. After observing the sword-testing stone for so long, he had gained no insight into the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu, you, you have...!!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou, who was closest to Gu Jiuqing, was the first to notice the abnormality on his body.</p><p></p><p>It was vital energy!</p><p></p><p>Vital energy was assaulting Gu Jiuqing's Baihui acupoint.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy was like a dragon, bursting through the Baihui point. A blood-red streak stretched horizontally across the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>The vast vital energy transformed into billowing smoke. Surging blood energy continuously gushed upwards, forming a blood-colored waterfall over three zhang (about 30 feet) high.</p><p></p><p>The intertwining smoke and the blood-colored waterfall resembled smelting. As the morning sun rose, it was like a second sun rising over the Sword Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>The insights from the eight sets of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, combined with the insights from the remaining fourteen sets, all converged and washed over Gu Jiuqing in realization.</p><p></p><p>His inner vital energy surged, refining his physical body. Gu Jiuqing's third shedding had begun.</p><p></p><p>He was the first youth to complete three sheddings in the Sword Gate Pass great test.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? A youth from the northern lands has completed the third shedding?"</p><p></p><p>"Completing the third shedding by the fifth day, not bad, not bad. With four more days remaining, it seems this batch of northern disciples may produce a decent one."</p><p></p><p>"Three sheddings, completed in five days. Not bad, not bad. Another seed of a true disciple has emerged."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? That's not Ye Fei? Nor Xia Qingzhou? Is it Qing Yangbai or Fan Shaoli?"</p><p></p><p>"None of them?"</p><p></p><p>"Then who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's Gu Jiuqing from the number one Tianyuan Ancient City among the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Gu Jiuqing. I'll remember this name. If he completes the true disciple trials in the future, notify me. I'll go test him myself."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate divine mountain shook. The disciples of the Sword Gate were astonished. It was the gazes of several Sword Immortals falling upon the Sword Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's name was remembered by several Sword Immortals. The door to the path of a true disciple had already opened for him at this moment.</p>

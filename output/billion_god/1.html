        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill has been engraved on the stone steles. If you cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill, and are able to complete one Shedding of Mortal Body within nine days, you can join the Sword Sect and become an outer disciple."  </p><p></p><p>The three stone steles were each as tall as a zhang (3.3 meters). Densely engraved on them were texts and images, depicting elephants roaming the wilderness and dragons soaring through the universe. On each divine stele, twenty-two sets of illustrations were carved, representing the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill of the Great Wilderness Sword Sect was the most fundamental skill for shedding the mortal body. It was rumored that cultivators could use it to shed five or six times.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you are confident, you can also go to the Sword Testing Rock and comprehend the sword intent. If you can comprehend a portion of the sword intent within nine days, you can directly become an inner disciple of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Below the three zhang-tall stone steles gathered a dense crowd of youths who came to seek teachings. August 16th, the Sword Sect was widely recruiting disciples - this was their best opportunity to make a dragon-gate leap.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the true meaning of the sword path and becoming an inner disciple of the Sword Sect was something they dared not imagine. But if they could complete the first Shedding of Mortal Body and join as an outer disciple, they would still have a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Soon, sounds of practice drifted down from the sword gate as they rehearsed the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Around each towering stone stele, people clustered densely. Gu Jiuqing's frame was small, so he could only watch from afar.</p><p></p><p>"It's too far, I can't even see clearly what's painted on the steles."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, these stone steles are ancient, and some of the images have faded. The dragon and tiger figures are blurred. But this is the skill for cultivation - if there's a mistake in practicing it, at best you'll deviate and go demonic, at worst you'll disintegrate into ashes and smoke."</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing, I heard you have sharp eyes. Why don't you draw the twenty-two forms from the steles? There are nine days for the great test, so drawing the twenty-two illustrations would take at most a day or two."</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Sword Sect stood towering on Sword Gate Pass. Outside the pass stretched the boundless Great Wilderness, while inside lay the Divine Zhou Dynasty.  </p><p></p><p>Near Sword Gate Pass were thirteen ancient cities, and these youths all came from those thirteen cities.</p><p></p><p>Every year when the Sword Sect recruited disciples, the youths from the thirteen ancient cities would be sent to Sword Gate Pass. This small group came from Heavenly Abyss Ancient City, ranked first among the thirteen and closest to the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>A handsome youth stood at the front of the small group. He was the tallest among them, but the other city youths had already joined forces to occupy the best spots below the steles.</p><p></p><p>With just his own strength, he could not squeeze into the inner area.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou!</p><p></p><p>The Qu family of Heavenly Abyss Ancient City was the foremost of the great clans and families, far more powerful than the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>From afar, a carriage hovered in midair, with servants approaching and presenting writing tools before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing, whether our Heavenly Abyss Ancient City can achieve a good ranking this time depends on you."</p><p></p><p>The youth speaking stood behind Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye!</p><p></p><p>Another son of a great clan.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect, as one of the four great sacred lands, was not a place just anyone could join.</p><p></p><p>These youths from Heavenly Abyss Ancient City were all scions of great clans and families with over five hundred years of heritage and profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family was also from Heavenly Abyss, but could not be compared to the Qu and Lu families.</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing, hurry up and draw. I've already seen people practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill to undergo the Shedding of Mortal Body."</p><p></p><p>Below the steles, a talented disciple had used the Dragon and Elephant Skill to cleanse his bones and marrow, washing away the lead and mercury in just half a day! This drew many gazes, even disciples from the Sword Gate above were observing intently.</p><p></p><p>"He's from the Qingyang Ancient City's great family!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>For this great test, they had prepared for a long time, all hoping to make a resounding debut in the nine days and gain the Sword Sect's attention to be accepted as disciples!</p><p></p><p>This was the wish of everyone from the thirteen northern cities.</p><p></p><p>"It's Ye Fei from Qingyang Ancient City!"</p><p></p><p>"So it's him, no wonder he completed a Shedding so quickly. I heard Qingyang has four talents, three of whom have already joined the Sword Sect. Only Ye Fei is younger, so he's a year behind."</p><p></p><p>Above Sword Gate Pass stood a divine mountain piercing the heavens, like an immense sword stabbing into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"One Shedding in half a day - if he can undergo three Sheddings within nine days, he could become an inner disciple of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Having such a person join this year is not too bad."</p><p></p><p>The voices from Sword Mountain faded. The nine-day great test could reveal the talents of these youths on the very first day.</p><p></p><p>Below the three steles, Ye Fei had the best aptitude, with hopes of becoming an inner sword disciple.</p><p></p><p>Most of the other youths from the thirteen northern cities could only become outer disciples, while the remainder had no prospects of joining at all.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill had twenty-two illustrations - to draw all of them would require at least one day!</p><p></p><p>Then he would only have eight days left in the great test to use the skill and complete one Shedding!!</p><p></p><p>Scorching gazes fell upon Gu Jiuqing, making him feel like he was sitting on pins and needles.</p><p></p><p>If he refused to draw now, the other youths would definitely not let him cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill in peace.</p><p></p><p>Though they were all from Heavenly Abyss Ancient City, he could not count on their kinship.</p><p></p><p>When asking others for a favor, could one do so empty-handed?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the distant airborne carriages.</p><p></p><p>This trip from Heavenly Abyss brought no small number of clan disciples - twenty-five in total including himself.</p><p></p><p>In the distance were twenty-five flying carriages. The Gu family was poor, so he could only rely on his own cultivation. But the other clan disciples were different. Especially Qu Yaozhu of the Qu family and Lu Buye of the Lu family - even from afar, Gu Jiuqing could see the bulging pouches they carried.</p><p></p><p>Those contained spirit pills prepared by their clans!!</p><p></p><p>For the nine-day great test, the Sword Sect had only one rule: complete one Shedding of Mortal Body using the Dragon and Elephant Skill within nine days. Whether aided by spirit pills or relying on one's own talent, as long as it was completed, one could become an outer sword disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, to be honest, the journey here by flying carriage has left me quite uncomfortable. I can't see the illustrations on the steles clearly either."</p><p></p><p>Heh heh!</p><p></p><p>The other youths of course understood Gu Jiuqing's intentions - he simply wanted to take this opportunity to extort something, right?</p><p></p><p>They were not fools, it's just that...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They looked at the distant stone stele. </p><p></p><p>The twenty-five youths from the Tianyuan Ancient City were squeezed out too far. They had not yet embarked on the path of cultivation, similar to ordinary people. Separated by such a distance, the only way to discern all the patterns on the stone stele was to rely on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out Brother Gu has such an unspeakable hidden talent. This is easy to handle. This is the Eight Directions Precious Pill given to me by the elders of my family. Let me give you one, Brother Gu."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou gritted his teeth and took out an Eight Directions Precious Pill.</p><p></p><p>Good stuff!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Directions Precious Pill, refined from eight precious materials, is one of the marrow-cleansing pills of the I Ching.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Blood Condensing Qi Pill bestowed by the elders of my family. Hmm, I only have one, so I can only give you half."</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye split the Blood Condensing Qi Pill and carefully handed the other half to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Condensing Qi Pill!</p><p></p><p>This is far more precious than the Eight Directions Precious Pill, but only half a pill.</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed inwardly and also kept the half Blood Condensing Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>The other youths who came out of the Tianyuan Ancient City could only give Gu Jiuqing the pills they had on them.</p><p></p><p>After about an incense stick's time, Gu Jiuqing had accumulated many bottles and jars of pills.</p><p></p><p>A great harvest!</p><p></p><p>A great harvest indeed!</p><p></p><p>With so many pills, not to mention the nine-day test, within five days, Gu Jiuqing was confident he could complete a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>He settled his mind and began painting.</p><p></p><p>The youths from the Tianyuan Ancient City standing beside him did not dare make a sound, for fear of disturbing Gu Jiuqing's painting.</p><p></p><p>"Someone else has completed the metamorphosis! It's a youth from the Tianyuan Ancient City."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyuan Ancient City, the Qingyang Ancient City, two youths from the thirteen ancient cities in the north have completed the metamorphosis."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, indeed, on the first day, two people have completed the metamorphosis. It seems that this time, at least hundreds of ancient city youths will be able to undergo metamorphosis with the help of the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>On Sword Mountain, eyes kept falling on the youths practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill below the Sword Gate, observing and practicing martial arts, while a soaring mist rose endlessly.</p><p></p><p>They were disciples of the family, swallowing precious pills, cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill, and cleansing their marrow with the I Ching.</p><p></p><p>The second day, at noon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing finally completed painting all twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, with twenty-two paintings displayed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Finally finished."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing knew his talent was average. Since childhood, he had loved music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, dreaming of one day leaving the north and going to the divine capital of Great Zhou to join the Jixia Academy.</p><p></p><p>But the north was too far from the divine capital of Great Zhou, and he was a disciple of the family.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou reached out and grabbed the large paintings one by one. He looked at the sheets of paper, full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>Exquisite and lifelike!</p><p></p><p>As if painted by a living painting sage.</p><p></p><p>Almost identical to the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill imprinted on the stone stele.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, excellent, as expected of Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, this place is too noisy. Follow me to a quiet place to cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill together!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's call was met with a hundred responses, and the ancient city youths followed him away from this place.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing was left with paper and brush.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and casually put down the paper and brush. In the distance, servants were treading on empty space towards him.</p><p></p><p>These were servants of the Qu family. To tread on empty space, one must at least have experienced the Leaking of Heavenly Mechanism and cultivated spiritual power to be able to fly through the void.</p><p></p><p>"Metamorphosis! Leaking of Heavenly Mechanism! Forging the Unborn! Comprehending Heaven and Earth! Understanding Yin and Yang! Stealing Life and Death!"</p><p></p><p>These six realms were widely circulated in the north, but the cultivation methods were not transmitted. Even the great families could only cultivate up to the Forging the Unborn realm. To Comprehend Heaven and Earth, only the noble families had the cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>This was also the distinction between families and noble families.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family had the Six Harmonies Boxing. Cultivating the Six Harmonies Boxing could complete three metamorphoses, which was the limit of the Six Harmonies Boxing.</p><p></p><p>It was also the pinnacle of ordinary cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing wanted to join the Sword Gate, cultivating the Six Harmonies Boxing in advance would allow him to eliminate impurities from his body earlier, making his blood, meridians, and bones stronger than they are now.</p><p></p><p>However, to undergo another metamorphosis with the help of the Dragon and Elephant Skill would be much more difficult than it is now.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, none of the ancient city youths who came to pay homage to the mountain had any cultivation base. This was their first time embarking on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calmed his mind and spirit, then put a pill in his mouth. A surge of warmth spread from the pill throughout his body, and Gu Jiuqing felt a comfortable warmth all over.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the pill was taking effect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not look at the images and texts on the stone stele, as he had memorized the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. He stood in place and began practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The first form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, Elephant Traversing the Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The second form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, Elephant Uprooting the Divine Mountain!</p><p></p><p>The third form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, Elephant Treading the Void!</p><p></p><p>The fourth form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, Elephant Pushing the Divine City!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing performed up to the fourth form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, and the turbulent flow within him was activated. With the support of his fellow townsmen, Gu Jiuqing did not hesitate to swallow pill after pill.</p><p></p><p>In a short while, a misty aura surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>From daytime to evening, after several hours, Gu Jiuqing only felt a burning sensation throughout his body, but there was no change in his blood, meridians, or bones.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and struck a Tyrant Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Huh??</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Cauldron did not budge an inch!</p><p></p><p>Outside the three stone steles, there were many Tyrant Cauldrons that could be used for cultivation while practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like after cultivating for several hours and consuming so many pills, my body has not changed at all?"</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be like this. The effects of the first cultivation should be the most obvious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had consumed quite a few pills, so why didn't his body become stronger at all?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the pills they gave me were fake?"</p><p></p><p>In the hazy night, the youths below the three stone steles were led away in groups onto flying carriages. Gu Jiuqing had a splitting headache.</p><p></p><p>The nine-day test: on the first day, he painted twenty-two pictures of the Dragon and Elephant Skill forms; on the second day, he vigorously cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Now, he lay asleep in the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, he would settle the score with them.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing learned about the issue of physical shackles from Xia Qingzhou. </p><p></p><p>Shedding mortality and building a foundation - the more times one sheds mortality, the more solid the foundation that is forged.</p><p></p><p>However, relying solely on one's inner energy to cleanse the mortal body, there is an ultimate limit to how many times one can shed mortality. </p><p></p><p>This is not the limit of an individual's mortal body, but the limit of the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>The four gates of the Great Zhou in the southeast, northwest, northeast and southwest guard against the invasion of demons and monsters. Outside of the Great Zhou in the desolate territories, demons and monsters run rampant, causing chaos with their evil energy.</p><p></p><p>Demons and monsters are born with innate magical powers, with overwhelmingly strong abilities.  </p><p></p><p>The gap between humans and demons is too large. Even if humans can somehow break through their shackles, the shedding mortality realm can only be achieved so many times.</p><p></p><p>"Qu Yaozhou has shed mortality three times. Chaotianque can borrow the power of the ancient Qu family ancestor, but his mortal body cannot withstand so much power. Do not underestimate Chaotianque!"</p><p></p><p>So here is the problem.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression changed. More and more people would cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill at Linjiang, and more would use it to break through the martial artist realm.</p><p></p><p>Just the inner energy born from their cultivation of the Dragon and Elephant Skill would be an astronomical number.</p><p></p><p>And him!</p><p></p><p>He would gain all the cultivation bases of the Linjiang martial artists, hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands?</p><p></p><p>With such an immense amount of inner energy combined and gathered within Gu Jiuqing's body, could his mortal form withstand it?</p><p></p><p>This was a huge problem, a matter of life and death for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"So being too powerful is also a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed inwardly. It seems joining the inner sect of the Sword Gate is a must.</p><p></p><p>He cannot resolve this issue by himself, he can only seek help from the higher-ups of the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou!</p><p></p><p>He must die!</p><p></p><p>When he dies, it will shake the Sword Gate, and more Sword Gate higher-ups will appear.</p><p></p><p>At that time, I will gain more attention from the Sword Gate higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Gu, do you feel confident about tomorrow's battle?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou asked with a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>She was a disciple of the Xia family in the Ancient Guiyuan City, studying zither, chess, calligraphy and painting from a young age, well-versed in various secret classics and books, all for the purpose of joining the Sword Gate today.</p><p></p><p>Disciples from prestigious clans had such profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>They almost all knew the information about the ancient cultivation clans of the city, including Qu Yaozhou of the Qu family.</p><p></p><p>In the few days Xia Qingzhou had spent with Gu Jiuqing, she had become quite interested in him.</p><p></p><p>She did not want Gu Jiuqing to fall at the foot of Sword Gate Mountain!</p><p></p><p>"The little Qu brat is nothing to speak of."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood up and walked towards the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's confidence, Xia Qingzhou was no longer worried.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Fei, Fan Shaoli, and Qing Yang Bai frowned, not understanding why this young master of the Gu family was so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family rose to prominence relatively late. The elders of the Gu family all died in an ancient ruin, leaving only Gu Jiuqing and Gu Linglong."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing loves zither, chess, calligraphy and painting, lingering in various academies, and has good relationships with several great scholars of the Great Zhou."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Linglong has average talent, five years older than Gu Jiuqing. After the Gu family elders died, Gu Linglong went into business, frequently traveling between the northern lands and the Great Zhou."</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family's ultimate skill is the Three Yin Soul-Slaying Blade! Condensing the power of the Great Yin, forming the Soul-Slaying Blade. The first ancestor of the Gu family fortuitously entered an ancient teleportation formation, arriving on the moon. Using the moon's yin essence, he greatly accomplished the Soul-Slaying Blade, establishing the Gu family in the Tianyuan Ancient City."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the Three Yin Soul-Slaying Blade, the Gu family also has the Six Harmonies Boxing and the Celestial Snake Skin-Shedding Art, but these skills are inferior to the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>"Where does his confidence come from?"</p><p></p><p>Chaotianque, Chaotianque!</p><p></p><p>What does Gu Jiuqing have to defeat him?</p><p></p><p>Outside the flying carriage, Steward Xie had been waiting for Gu Jiuqing all this time.</p><p></p><p>This old servant had followed Gu's father for many years, but had never entered an ancient ruin, thus preserving his life.</p><p></p><p>Eight days had already passed in the nine-day great examination, and he had been waiting here for eight days.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing, Steward Xie's expression was tense and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"You are too reckless. Qu Yaozhou of the Qu family accomplished the Chaotianque realm at a young age."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's this old servant's fault for not informing the young master of the backgrounds of the great clans, leading to this predicament."</p><p></p><p>"Chaotianque can borrow the power of an ancient Qu family ancestor. With Qu Yaozhou's three sheddings of mortality, once he uses Chaotianque, he can fight at four times the shedding level!"</p><p></p><p>Each shedding greatly enhances one's strength, speed and physical qualities.</p><p>Four sheddings is overwhelmingly stronger than three.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow is the ninth day. Young Master, why don't you just stay inside the carriage? If anyone comes looking for you, this old servant will refuse them."</p><p></p><p>This was the only option.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie could not bear to watch the Gu family's only male heir die before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The young master's talent had far exceeded Steward Xie's imagination. If the young lady knew about this, she would surely be moved.</p><p></p><p>He could already envision the young lady's joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, he had to protect the young master.</p><p></p><p>"I have my ways. You don't need to say more, Old Xie."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped onto the carriage, turning back to Steward Xie.</p><p></p><p>"You've been with the Gu family for many years, but I still don't know what cultivation realm you've reached?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know Steward Xie's real name, but over the years, Xie had always been by his side.</p><p></p><p>Within Tianyuan Ancient City, he had never run into any trouble!</p><p></p><p>Except for this Sword Gate examination!</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie was stunned, smiling awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Why does the young master ask?"</p><p></p><p>"This old servant's cultivation is not high, incomparable to the old master."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's father had reached the Immortal Body realm of the Unbroken realm.</p><p></p><p>So at most, Steward Xie's cultivation was at the peak of the Unbroken realm, or the Energy realm of releasing the Heavenly Mechanism?</p><p></p><p>"What about my sister?"</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie smiled awkwardly again, "The young lady started her business five years ago and rarely returns home, so this old servant is unaware."</p><p></p><p>"Then what was my sister's cultivation five years ago?"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, it took the young lady a year to complete five sheddings of mortality. She only cultivated energy shortly before leaving to travel the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>In five years, how far could Gu Linglong's cultivation have progressed?</p><p></p><p>It seems inquiring about his own family was not going to work.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'll get some early rest today for the great battle tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing entered the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>The flying carriage contained hidden mysteries - though not a celestial abode, it had been expanded, larger than the blue star room Gu Jiuqing lived in.</p><p></p><p>It was still early, so Gu Jiuqing did not rush into the blue star.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged on the bed, continuously gathering his thoughts, trying to enter a meditative state.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he could sense the vague image within the Mud Pill Palace again.</p><p></p><p>It was a round, full, plump fruit-like object, a bit like a watermelon but much smaller.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could confirm that this perfectly round, imaginary fruit form had never appeared in the Mud Pill Palace before he transmitted the Dragon and Elephant Skill into the blue star.</p><p></p><p>It only manifested after he first transmitted the skill, becoming more solidified after receiving the cultivation bases of the high school students.</p><p></p><p>"Could this plump fruit be an unaccomplished Dao Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how Gu Jiuqing pondered, he could only guess it was related to the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Sutra on Upholding the Ten Virtuous Precepts states: "To see all Buddhas, hear the Dharma and attain the Dao Fruit, possess the six spiritual penetrations, and roam the ten directions."</p><p></p><p>To see the Buddhas, one must hear the great Dharma, attain the Dao Fruit, cultivate the six spiritual penetrations of Buddhism, and be able to travel everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Fruit, the fruition of enlightenment, but this is a Buddhist concept, an illusory path. Perhaps this was the path of cultivation in the previous era, but in this era, there is no such thing as the Dao Fruit in the path of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Shedding mortality, building a foundation, releasing the Heavenly Mechanism to condense energy, forging the Unbroken realm to refine the Immortal Body, comprehending Heaven and Earth to refine the Celestial Being, understanding yin and yang to create the Celestial Abode, passing tribulations for eternal life!</p><p></p><p>None of the realms involved the manifestation of a Dao Fruit!</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had a feeling that this was a real, genuine Dao Fruit, the Dao Fruit he had condensed from cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>This Dao Fruit contained all the insights from the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>And at all times!</p><p></p><p>Random insights into cultivation would spontaneously appear within this Dao Fruit, including insights into the Dragon and Elephant forms as well as scattered insights into sword arts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts touched the Dao Fruit, and in an instant, myriad insights assailed his mind!</p><p></p><p>"So that's why these past few days my cultivation insights haven't manifested physically - they've all been accumulating within this Dao Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>With his thoughts connected, Gu Jiuqing could...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he understood the cause and effect behind this Dao fruit. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing traveled to the Blue Star and passed down the Dragon Elephant Skill and the Art of Unsheathing the Sword to Class 2 of Grade 11.</p><p></p><p>Although the 45 students did not have a deep understanding of the Dragon Elephant Skill, the sheer number could not be ignored.</p><p></p><p>That was the understanding of 45 people gathered together at once, condensed together, with various insights colliding and rubbing against each other. </p><p></p><p>It was like 45 scholars engaging in a 45-person discussion of the Dao within Gu Jiuqing's Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>They discussed the Dragon Elephant Skill, mutually verifying it, and unknowingly forged a Dao fruit of the Dragon Elephant Skill for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>And as the Dragon Elephant Skill spread to Linji, more and more people began cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>"A total of 38,000 people have cultivated the Dragon Elephant Skill, now it's 38,021 people, 38,022 people!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could sense those cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill, and even perceive this understanding, this strand of cultivation base originating from which Linji martial artist.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was too wonderful!</p><p></p><p>Similar to being all-knowing and all-powerful, indescribably marvelous.</p><p></p><p>"There are 800 people cultivating the Art of Unsheathing the Sword."</p><p></p><p>Among these two cultivation methods, several people's insights and cultivation bases stood out the most.</p><p></p><p>Six martial artists' understanding of the Dragon Elephant Skill surpassed anyone else's. From these six, Gu Jiuqing gained profound insights, each strand of cultivation insight turning into a painting, interweaving within the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they transformed into little figures, mutually verifying each other. With a move from the figures, they evolved into dragons and elephants.</p><p></p><p>Within Gu Jiuqing's Mud Pill Palace, hundreds and thousands of dragons and elephants mutually verified the Dragon Elephant Skill, giving birth to new insights!!</p><p></p><p>Gathering the strengths of a hundred schools, then surpassing them all with something unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the insights of Linji's martial artists, thereby transcending them and walking an extraordinary path.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's Dao!!</p><p></p><p>The dragons and elephants mutually verified each other, with failed ones being devoured to strengthen the rest. New dragons and elephants were born every moment.</p><p></p><p>It was like nurturing demonic beings, with one person inevitably giving birth to an unprecedented, perfect dragon and elephant within the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the ancestor who created the Dragon Elephant Skill was inevitable!</p><p></p><p>Besides the dragons and elephants, there were also swords in the Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>Those were flying swords, divine swords.</p><p></p><p>There were also many insights into the Art of Unsheathing the Sword. Initially, only 800 people cultivated it, but soon this number shot up to 900.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Dragon Elephant Skill, the growth rate of the Art of Unsheathing the Sword was faster.</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of insight fell into the Dao fruit, transforming into paintings depicting the cultivation of the Art of Unsheathing the Sword.</p><p></p><p>The little figures within held long swords, practicing the art, colliding with other scenes and beginning to discuss it.</p><p></p><p>After discussing, the figures disappeared, leaving only flying swords in the paintings.</p><p></p><p>The swords mutually verified and collided, giving birth to realizations about the Art of Unsheathing the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Various insights took flight, various realizations drifting about, swords devouring swords, swords strengthening swords.</p><p></p><p>These were the two scenes within the Dao fruit - the Dragon Elephant Skill and Art of Unsheathing the Sword each discussing, wanting to unify, perfect themselves, and thoroughly suppress other insights!</p><p></p><p>Soon, one dragon and elephant completed the final unification, emanating a golden divine light - dragon horns, dragon tail, dragon scales, dragon whiskers, elephant head, elephant feet, elephant body, vividly lifelike.</p><p></p><p>Other insights flew into this golden dragon and elephant, absorbed without need for verification.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon and elephant contained all, gathering the strengths of a hundred schools. It discussed with the tens of thousands cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill, only then evolving into its final form.</p><p></p><p>Such an insight was more formidable than even the ancestor who created the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the golden dragon and elephant's insight was obtained by him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill reappeared, but this time, Gu Jiuqing saw an old man!</p><p></p><p>An old man appeared within his Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>This illusory old man looked towards the heavens and earth, before him a true dragon and divine elephant were battling!</p><p></p><p>A true dragon and divine elephant battling!</p><p></p><p>Various killing moves appeared one by one, shaking the wilderness, ripping apart the azure sky, making the stars tremble, myriad divine lights erupting, triggering cataclysmic changes in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This scene was too shocking. Gu Jiuqing's heart was stirred, but under the blessing of the Dao fruit, his agitated heart quickly calmed.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon and divine elephant battled, eventually disappearing, giving way to the form of a dragon and elephant!!</p><p></p><p>A dragon and elephant stood in the void.</p><p></p><p>The 17th move of the Dragon Elephant Skill - Dragon Elephant Combined Strike!</p><p></p><p>18th move - Dragon Elephant Soaring!</p><p></p><p>19th move - Dragon Striding, Elephant Leaping! </p><p></p><p>20th move - Dragon Elephant Clashing!</p><p></p><p>21st move - Dragon Elephant Treading the Heavens!</p><p></p><p>22nd move - Dragon Elephant Unification!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing saw the scenes of that ancient ancestor creating the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>But the insights into the Dragon Elephant Skill he obtained were far, far more than when that ancestor originally created it.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the 23rd, 24th, 25th moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill freely manifested, even able to manifest over 30 moves.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Gu Jiuqing stopped manifesting the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>He felt the Dao fruit shaking, it had become quite illusory!</p><p></p><p>"The 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill are enough for the martial artists of the Blue Star to cultivate. There's no need to spend too much effort on the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>"Just now the Dao fruit became illusory because I was deducing the Dragon Elephant Skill, but condensing the Dao fruit requires insights and cultivation base, so I just wasted a lot of my insights and cultivation base!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing inwardly lamented.</p><p></p><p>But at least he now knew how to use this Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I condensed the Dao fruit, otherwise just the insights from 39,000 people cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill could drive me insane, and the 39,000 people's cultivation bases in the Dragon Elephant Skill could shatter my physical body!"</p><p></p><p>"Now I can use my cultivation base and insights to solidify the Dao fruit!"</p><p></p><p>The problem of having too powerful a cultivation base and too many insights was temporarily resolved.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the other scene in the Dao fruit, where sword after sword mutually verified, seeking the truth of the Art of Unsheathing the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Sword qi intertwined, sword forces had already taken shape, various sword forces intersecting, mutually discussing to approach the sword intent of the Art of Unsheathing the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Three people's insights were the most powerful. On one of the flying swords, Gu Jiuqing even saw the image of Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Daihua from Class 2 Grade 11! Indeed she has the talent for the sword path!"</p><p></p><p>Three flying swords collided, with the rest discussing on the outside. After a long time, one flying sword succeeded in its discussion, devouring the other two.</p><p></p><p>It was Wen Daihua's sword insight that devoured the rest.</p><p></p><p>Various insights into the Art of Unsheathing the Sword merged, condensing into a golden flying sword. Wen Daihua's image had already disappeared from this sword.</p><p></p><p>The insight she cultivated only unified all the insights into the Art of Unsheathing the Sword, not her insight overcoming all others.</p><p></p><p>To reach this step was impossible within Gu Jiuqing's Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>This was a Dao fruit that gathered the strengths of a hundred schools, then surpassed them all. Any insight within could only serve as a catalyst, a way to inspire further insights!</p><p></p><p>"2,800 people! 2,900 people! 3,000 people!"</p><p></p><p>"4,000! 5,000! 6,000!" </p><p></p><p>"7,000!"</p><p></p><p>"8,000!"</p><p></p><p>"9,000!"</p><p></p><p>"10,000!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing personally witnessed the number of people cultivating the Art of Unsheathing the Sword explosively increase to over 10,000. Among Linji City's 800,000 people, 10,000 had begun cultivating the Art of Unsheathing the Sword.</p><p></p><p>These insights gathered outside the golden flying sword, mutually verifying each other, before being devoured by the golden sword.</p><p></p><p>"If I access this golden flying sword, perhaps, I might be able to cultivate the sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, not immediately accessing the sword insights.</p><p></p><p>This was his trump card, too early to use now!</p><p></p><p>He continued exploring the Dao fruit, now needing to condense the cultivation bases of the tens of thousands cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Days of the Great Examination clearly have records of someone completing five Sheddings of Mortality within nine days, but that youth was only a fleeting brilliance, failing to cause even a ripple in the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>Some suspected that youth used secret methods and techniques!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't care about all that.</p><p></p><p>"So during the Nine Days of the Great Examination, if I complete five Sheddings of Mortality, at most it will only shock people!"</p><p></p><p>With precedent set by the ancients, the appearance of a successor is normal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing guided the cultivation bases within the Dao fruit, beginning to temper his physical body!</p><p></p><p>Requesting recommendation tickets, monthly tickets and donations.

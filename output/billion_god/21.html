        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The peaks of Sword Gate Mountain were magnificent and extraordinary. Apart from the nine great true lineage peaks, there were also the Sword Tomb Peak, Renowned Court Peak, Abbot's Peak, and others like the Law Enforcement Hall, Pill Concocting Hall, Skill Transmission Hall, and Sutra Repository Hall, each with its own separate peak. </p><p></p><p>The Soul Hall also had its own separate peak. Senior Brother Liang Xiao pinched the two drops of essence blood from Gu Jiuqing between his fingers. With a flick of his bent finger, one of the drops of essence blood shot up into the air, flying towards a distant peak before disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Just a few breaths later, a sword talisman flew out from the Soul Hall and landed in Gu Jiuqing's palm. </p><p></p><p>The sword talisman was a palm-sized piece of talisman paper in the shape of a sword. Upon landing in his palm, it branded itself onto his skin before vanishing.</p><p></p><p>From then on!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could enter the Sword Gate, and apart from some forbidden areas, the Sword Gate would be like his own backyard.</p><p></p><p>"The Soul Hall has recorded your essence blood, Brother Disciple, and the sword talisman has merged into your body. Congratulations on officially becoming a true disciple of the Sword Gate!" </p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled, and the other drop of essence blood in his hand began to surge. Right in front of Gu Jiuqing, he exhaled the Renowned Court Sword Aura!</p><p></p><p>Like an immortal sword sage, he breathed out sword aura that seemed to come from the Milky Way, directly landing on the drop of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>The essence blood transformed into a soul, intertwining with this strand of sword intent. Senior Brother Liang Xiao reached out and grasped the sword soul, placing it on his brow.</p><p></p><p>At his brow, the sword soul rippled, dim and without light, before finally disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Soul essence!</p><p></p><p>The sword talisman was complete, leaving only the final sword imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Disciple, open your mind. Senior Brother will brand you with the sword imprint of the Renowned Court lineage of the Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did as instructed!</p><p></p><p>He saw Senior Brother Liang Xiao raise his hand and point at his brow. Once again, the mighty Renowned Court Sword Intent arrived, its aura rising and causing the distant sword furnace to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Even the sword furnace leaked a trace of power that intertwined with Senior Brother Liang Xiao's sword intent, finally forming a sword-shaped flame that branded itself on Gu Jiuqing's brow.</p><p></p><p>It was the shape of the Renowned Court Sword Furnace!</p><p></p><p>A chill emanated from his brow that lasted a long time before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Senior Brother Liang Xiao laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Renowned Court lineage has a successor!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Disciple joined the Renowned Court lineage today, yet your Senior Brother did not prepare any gifts, not even forging your own residence."</p><p></p><p>"Your Senior Brother was negligent in his considerations."</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that among the current generation of youths in the Northern Lands, there would emerge a sword dao prodigy?</p><p></p><p>The Renowned Court lineage was a supreme lineage, with an esteemed status. With a Sword Sage overseeing the sword furnace and protecting the Sword Gate, even extraordinary sword talents had no chance of joining the Renowned Court Peak.</p><p></p><p>On the Renowned Court Peak, apart from the sword furnace and a courtyard, there were no other buildings.</p><p></p><p>"In a couple of days, your Senior Brother will journey to the Great Wilderness to hunt demons and monsters, bathing in their blood to forge your foundation!"</p><p></p><p>Demon blood!</p><p></p><p>It could shed one's mortal form!</p><p></p><p>The innate talents of demons far exceeded those of humans. Regardless of who it was, to cultivate, one needed to build a foundation, repeatedly shedding the mortal form to knock on the heavenly gates, leaking the heavenly mysteries, and condensing spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But demons?</p><p></p><p>They were born with spiritual power by their side.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest demons were at the spiritual power realm.</p><p></p><p>Powerful demons possessed vigorous vital essence and blood. Bathing in their blood could facilitate another shedding of the mortal form.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to Senior Brother!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing expressed his gratitude with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Disciple, would you like to build your residence on the mountain peak, or carve out a separate floating island?"</p><p></p><p>The residences of true disciples differed from outer and inner door disciples. </p><p></p><p>Outer door disciples could only live together, with seven or eight, or even ten people sharing a courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Inner door disciples had their own independent courtyards.</p><p></p><p>True disciples had even greater privileges, able to choose whether to live on the mountain peaks or construct their own floating islands away from the peaks.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not hesitate. "This disciple wishes to reside on a separate true disciple island!"</p><p></p><p>He had too many secrets, making it inconvenient to live on the Renowned Court Peak.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled understandingly and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>"The floating islands are constructed by disciples from the Artifact Peak. It will likely take around ten days."</p><p></p><p>"Your Senior Brother's trip to the Great Wilderness will also take about half a month."</p><p></p><p>"During this time, Brother Disciple, you can return to the Northern Lands for a visit."</p><p></p><p>"Once you take up residence at the Sword Gate, you must focus wholeheartedly on cultivation. Do not waste your innate sword dao prodigy talents!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed again towards Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"I will heed Senior Brother's teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao looked towards the sword furnace.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace remained silent, and that Sword Saint was still in secluded cultivation. </p><p></p><p>"Aiya!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's feet radiated a golden light, emitting strands of spiritual power that spanned the heavens and earth, forming a golden bridge between them.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one in front and one behind, stepped out of the Mingting Peak. In an instant, another figure transformed into a sword beam and flew out of the Sword Gate. </p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing was left, stepping onto the golden bridge, heading towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>There was no ceremony of accepting a master, nor did he meet his own master, but Gu Jiuqing had officially become a true disciple of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>With the Spiritual Emblem on his brow, the Sword Imprint, and the Sword Talisman in his hand!</p><p></p><p>As a true disciple of the Sword Sect, Gu Jiuqing took one step after another, entering the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The ninth day of the Sword Sect's great test had just ended.</p><p></p><p>The sun was setting, and the world was dimming. A gate hundreds of zhang tall appeared at the foot of Sword Mountain. This gate was only revealing half of its true size. If fully opened, it would be at least a thousand zhang tall!</p><p></p><p>From within the gate emerged hundreds of Sword Sect disciples, and three true disciples personally appeared to lead the disciples who passed the trials into the Sword Sect and bestow them with talismans!</p><p></p><p>"It's finally over!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Sword Sect, I've finally joined the Sword Sect, and from now on, I'm also a disciple of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I really envy those who joined the inner sect."</p><p></p><p>The northern youths who entered the gate were divided into two groups.</p><p></p><p>The first group consisted of four young masters from prestigious clans who had completed three Sheddings in the nine days.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei!</p><p>Fan Shaolie!</p><p>Xia Qingzhou!</p><p>Qing Yangbai!</p><p></p><p>The second group were the northern youths who had completed one Shedding within the nine days, numbering over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Leading the first group of northern youths were those three true disciples.</p><p></p><p>"There are few who joined the inner sect this year, only four!"</p><p></p><p>"Of the four major sects, the thirteen northern cities under the Sword Sect are the weakest of the four affiliates."</p><p></p><p>"However, two sword prodigies were born this year, and our Sword Sect can suppress the world for another three thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>The three true disciples led the way, while the four young masters from prestigious clans were not as happy as imagined.</p><p></p><p>They remained silent, following the three true disciples onto the path to the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>Outer sect disciples could generally only move about the lower parts of the divine mountain, while inner sect disciples resided halfway up. The Sword Sect had strict regulations about this.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I almost forgot the Sword Sect rules!"</p><p></p><p>One of the true disciples tossed out a book with the words "Sword Sect Rules" written on it.</p><p></p><p>"This book records the rules of the Sword Sect. I don't care if you're from a prestigious clan or a family disciple, once you join the Sword Sect, you must abide by these rules."</p><p></p><p>The four of them quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei looked up and saw in the distance, a golden divine bridge descending from the heavens, with a figure stepping onto it and descending into the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Before he could get a clear look, the three true disciples exclaimed in admiration:</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which Sword Immortal is using such supreme divine powers within the sect."</p><p></p><p>The formations within the Sword Sect were always active. Although there were no explicit rules against using spiritual powers inside, sect disciples rarely voluntarily unleashed their powers, let alone causing such a huge commotion with their divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Only Sword Immortals could be so brazen.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou looked towards the golden bridge and also saw the figure stepping on it.</p><p></p><p>"That's Gu Jiuqing! It's Senior Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"It really is Gu Jiuqing, is he about to descend the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't he just join the true disciples? Why is he leaving the mountain now?"</p><p></p><p>The four of them were puzzled, but three domineering auras immediately descended, pressing down on them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei and the others felt their chests tighten, struggling to breathe.</p><p></p><p>"Mind your words, that is True Disciple Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"You are inner sect disciples, how can you directly address a true disciple by name?"</p><p></p><p>"If this happens again, you'll have to go through the Enforcement Peak."</p><p></p><p>True Disciple Gu!</p><p></p><p>Ah yes, that was True Disciple Gu.</p><p></p><p>The four of them turned pale and averted their gazes.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the ancient tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity, an ancient divine Dao fruit emerged, and the talents listed on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking were all vying for it. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing suspected that Gu Linglong had been staying in the tomb for a long time, scheming to obtain this ancient divine Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The fact that his sister did not reveal herself to him must mean it was inconvenient for her.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's main reason for leaving the mountain was to confirm if his sister was safe.  </p><p></p><p>Now that his wish had been fulfilled, his journey around the world would naturally end prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, news of the ancient divine Dao fruit appearing in the tomb spread from Youzhou to all nine states, shaking the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient divine Dao fruit? When the ancient heavenly court fell, even ancient gods have emerged?"</p><p></p><p>"Could the Immortal Lord of Longevity really be an ancient god? In the ancient imperial era, even celestial emperors were not ancient gods. If he was truly an ancient god, the heavenly court should have been ruled by him long ago!"</p><p></p><p>"There is at least an ancient god's skull in the tomb."  </p><p></p><p>"Could the twilight of the gods have been triggered by this ancient god?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods battled the gods of the 18th imperial era, destroying that era and causing the twilight of the gods - this was likely the reason!</p><p></p><p>Speculations about the ancient cataclysm emerged from time to time across the nine states, and many students from the Jixia Academy rushed to the tomb.</p><p></p><p>In Youzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Ancient teleportation formations opened one after another, and powerful experts crossed over horizontally.</p><p></p><p>In Youzhou, Gu Jiuqing personally witnessed the emergence of several Pure Yang Patriarchs, beings on par with the Great Power Buddha of Guangping - four or five of them!</p><p></p><p>At the Lu Family Tavern, Gu Jiuqing bade farewell to Senior Brother Liang Xiao.  </p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's cultivation had recovered. Gazing at the eastern sky, he said solemnly, "Junior Brother, you bear the Buddhist imprint left by the Great Power Buddha. You'd better return to the Sword Sect soon and ask the Sect Master to remove it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's yuanshen condensed, the ten great heavenly palaces merged into the sole Imperial Heavenly Palace. </p><p></p><p>A yuanshen took residence within it, while his eight-catastrophe celestial yuanshen was sealed in the Palace of Memory.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is going to the Fenglei Valley in the Eastern Wilderness."  </p><p></p><p>The Fenglei Valley was a perilous place in the Eastern Wilderness, and also the best location for celestials to brave catastrophes. It could easily summon numerous lightning catastrophes. With Liang Xiao's talent, his first yuanshen braving the Pure Yang Lightning Catastrophe would likely face over ten lightning strikes.</p><p></p><p>"Then I congratulate Senior Brother in advance for passing the Pure Yang Lightning Catastrophe!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao smiled faintly, "When we meet again, Senior Brother will likely have become a unified prime immortal."  </p><p></p><p>He still remembered his original vow, with a tinge of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"That old fellow sealed Senior Brother's memories. After unification, Senior Brother can try to unseal them."</p><p></p><p>"If I obtain the visualization method of the Supreme Primordial God, I'll come to the Sword Sect to find you immediately."</p><p></p><p>It seemed Liang Xiao would not return to the Sword Sect with him.  </p><p></p><p>Indeed, Liang Xiao had been confined in the Sword Sect. This rare chance to roam the world was granted by the Sect Master of Traceless Cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>He would at least have to wait for that Sect Master to "invite" him back before returning to the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao had left!</p><p></p><p>He flew eastward from Youzhou towards the Dao Sect's territory.</p><p></p><p>"What if Senior Brother Liang Xiao encounters danger in the Fenglei Valley?" Lu Yuan worried.</p><p></p><p>During this trip, they had killed a Buddhist protector, even causing a Buddha to die by Liang Xiao's hand.  </p><p></p><p>If Liang Xiao did not return to the Sword Sect and met other Buddhist Buddhas, what then?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled calmly, "Senior Brother Liang Xiao is astonishingly talented. He is the heir of our Sect Master. Even Pure Yang Patriarchs capable of killing him would have to give our Sword Sect some face!"</p><p></p><p>Those unified Pure Yang Patriarchs likely did not have the ability to kill Senior Brother yet.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing was about to leave the tavern and take an ancient teleportation formation back to Qingzhou, then return north, the tavern keeper rushed in excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence!"  </p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing, the keeper hurriedly called out, his face full of excitement.  </p><p></p><p>He placed a scroll on the table.</p><p></p><p>"The latest Dragon and Tiger Ranking has been released!"</p><p></p><p>"In the top ten, there is Your Eminence's name!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan also looked at the ranking curiously.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the scroll and saw his name Gu Jiuqing written in large characters at the tenth position.</p><p></p><p>[10th on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking: Gu Jiuqing!]</p><p></p><p>[A true disciple of the Sword Sect, the paramount sword cultivator. After the Sword Sect's Master Jiang Xingxun three thousand years ago, he is the first sword immortal, with the potential to reach the unified prime realm!]</p><p></p><p>This was followed by Gu Jiuqing's deeds.</p><p></p><p>[Gu Jiuqing traveled the world and, after entering the Immortal Lord's tomb, shattered Tiger Subjugator Arhat's four golden bodies with his bare flesh.]</p><p></p><p>Voices of doubt arose in the tavern.  </p><p></p><p>They had never heard of Gu Jiuqing's name before. How did this Sword Sect disciple's real name suddenly appear on today's ranking?</p><p></p><p>"Paramount sword cultivator? Heh, how dare he claim to be the paramount sword cultivator? In this world of myriad experts, there are many sword cultivators in the nine states alone! The Sword Sect has even more sword immortals, how can he be the paramount one?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some trickery here. Two Sword Sect disciples made the ranking?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The tavern was in an uproar. Someone carefully read the Jixia Academy's introduction of Gu Jiuqing and discovered the big secret.  </p><p></p><p>[The paramount sword cultivator Gu Jiuqing journeyed by the moon and slew the Eighth Demonic Prince on the moon!]</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The infamous Eighth Demonic Prince was killed by this Sword Sect disciple?  </p><p></p><p>That was the Eighth Demonic Prince, a renowned celestial immortal.</p><p></p><p>Just this feat alone was enough to be ranked.</p><p></p><p>[He once fought the Great Demonic Prince. After his journey by the moon ended, the Great Demonic Prince returned to the Wilderness and died, likely related to Gu Jiuqing.]</p><p></p><p>This news was even harder to believe.  </p><p></p><p>The Great Demonic Prince was from three thousand years ago!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, when the Demonic Sect attacked the northern Sword Sect's pass, the nine states sent reinforcements. In that great battle, the unified prime immortal Jiang Taichu fell. The new Sword Sect Master turned the tide after braving the nine-fold lightning catastrophe and becoming a unified prime.</p><p></p><p>That was a legend from three thousand years ago!</p><p></p><p>Just from that one battle, he was hailed as third in the world, surpassing even the Celestial Master of the Astral Palace.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Demonic Prince had already emerged back then.  </p><p></p><p>"Yet Gu Jiuqing could fight him?"</p><p></p><p>"Could this paramount sword cultivator be a catastrophe-level celestial?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, if he was truly a catastrophe celestial, he would have been ranked first!"</p><p></p><p>[After entering Youzhou, Gu Jiuqing was seemingly pursued by a Buddhist Buddha, but ultimately escaped and ascended.]</p><p></p><p>Pursued by a Buddha!  </p><p></p><p>Yet he survived??</p><p></p><p>Seeing this account, the tavern fell silent.  </p><p></p><p>That was a Buddha, the pursuit of a Pure Yang Patriarch, yet he could escape?</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized that ranking Gu Jiuqing tenth seemed too low.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at his real name on the ranking and shook his head.  </p><p></p><p>"Just an empty title."</p><p></p><p>But deep in his heart, a slight ripple still emerged.  </p><p></p><p>This was the Jixia Academy's acknowledgment of Gu Jiuqing's strength, a testament to his "efforts."</p><p></p><p>"I said long ago the Dragon and Tiger Ranking wasn't accurate. Now the Jixia Academy people have ranked Senior Brother tenth, showing a bit of discernment, but they're still too foolish," Lu Yuan said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>The tenth position did not befit Senior Brother's status!</p><p></p><p>The ninth was Tiger Subjugator Arhat. Eighth was Dragon Subduer Arhat.  </p><p></p><p>Seventh, the Great Zhou Prince!</p><p></p><p>"What? The Zhou Prince's rank dropped again?"  </p><p></p><p>"Sixth is the Great Celestial Lord? The Great Celestial Lord outranks the Zhou Prince?"  </p><p></p><p>Someone explained, "Not long ago, the Great Celestial Lord appeared in Youzhou and sent the Zhou Prince flying with one strike."</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Fifth was Xuan Tianji.  </p><p></p><p>Fourth, the Celestial Maiden.  </p><p></p><p>Third, the Sword Immortal.  </p><p></p><p>Second, Princess Rider of Clouds, the Dao Immortal!</p><p></p><p>The top five remained unchanged from before.</p><p></p><p>The tavern's clamor persisted, with many dissatisfied with this ranking period.  </p><p></p><p>But it did bring more business to the tavern.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing put down the scroll. Suddenly, Lu Yuan beside him shuddered and looked at Gu Jiuqing.  </p><p></p><p>At that moment, Gu Jiuqing also sensed something.  </p><p></p><p>The Sword Peak imprint that Senior Brother Liang Xiao had left on him when he joined the sect stirred.  </p><p></p><p>It flew out from his body, materializing into a huge Sword Peak before Gu Jiuqing.  </p><p></p><p>After becoming an inner disciple, Lu Yuan had also been imprinted with the sect's sword mark, which now flew out in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Sect disciples' distress signal!"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the one sending for help had a very high status, awakening even a true disciple like Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.  </p><p></p><p>Sword Sect disciples roaming the world generally did not encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>Why would even a true disciple send a distress signal?</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary inner disciples, if they encounter danger, they can call for help within a hundred li."  </p><p></p><p>This was the Sword Sect's rule!</p><p></p><p>In such cases, regardless of who it was, they had to go assist!</p><p></p><p>A true disciple's distress signal could transmit for a thousand li!  </p><p></p><p>All Sword Sect disciples within a thousand li would sense the pulsing imprint.</p><p></p><p>And now, the imprints were not just pulsing, they had flown out, appearing before them.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The blossoms bloomed early.</p><p></p><p>"Could it not be a true disciple of the Sword Sect, but rather an elder of the Sword Sect who has not attained full mastery?"</p><p></p><p>But a cry for help from an elder of the Sword Sect should not have caused such an anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only pondered for a moment before flying out of the wine tavern, two figures soaring through the air, leaving Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Within Youzhou Prefecture, not only Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan, two disciples of the Sword Sect, but also several other Sword Sect disciples took flight out of the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Three true disciples of the Sword Sect bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Within the Sword Sect, Gu Jiuqing's reputation was quite high, currently ranked tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking.</p><p></p><p>These three true disciples greeted Gu Jiuqing with the courtesy of addressing a senior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brothers, do you know what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>The three true disciples shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>These three Sword Immortals, like Gu Jiuqing, were completely unaware of who had sent the distress signal.</p><p></p><p>Sword auras crisscrossed as the five figures crossed the heavens, flying for three to four hundred li, but still could not find the person who had sent the distress signal.</p><p></p><p>"Is this senior martial brother of the Sword Sect still further away?"</p><p></p><p>The sword mark flickered, pointing Gu Jiuqing in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, sword lights appeared in all directions except the one in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Those were the figures of Sword Sect disciples!</p><p></p><p>They were all rushing towards this place.</p><p></p><p>They had also received the distress signal from that junior martial brother of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"That's the White Jade Sword Immortal! Elder Qu!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>In the distant heavens, a Tribulation Immortal wielding white jade sword aura was traversing the azure sky, with three true disciples of the Sword Sect following behind him.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect him to have survived the Longevity Immortal Lord's ancient tomb."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked regretful.</p><p></p><p>This caused the three true disciples behind him to quickly turn their heads away, pretending not to have heard.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Sword Immortals called out upon seeing a sword light in the distant sky, but that rapidly moving Sword Immortal did not stop, descending towards the far horizon.</p><p></p><p>A true disciple's master?</p><p></p><p>Then that must be one of the nine Peak Lords of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>That Sword Immortal said, "My master is the Peak Lord of Mount River and Streams!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the true disciple of Mount River and Streams finished speaking, the other two Sword Immortals also cried out to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>There, a sword aura crisscrossed and descended into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"The Peak Lord of Mount Nine Yangs!"</p><p></p><p>"The Peak Lord of Mount Celestial Snow!"</p><p></p><p>Four Peak Lords appeared simultaneously in this place.</p><p></p><p>Even these four Peak Lords had been disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled as to who was calling for help from the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>For even Peak Lords of this level to come to the rescue.</p><p></p><p>The nine Peak Lords of the Sword Sect were all Sword Immortals, with at least three-tenths Sword Intent, corresponding to at least the Celestial Palace Realm!</p><p></p><p>A Sword Immortal with one-tenth Sword Intent was equivalent to the Celestial Palace Realm, while an elderly Sword Immortal needed two-tenths Sword Intent, corresponding to the tenth level of the Celestial Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three-tenths Sword Intent of a Sword Sect Peak Lord could battle Tribulation Immortals!</p><p></p><p>Four-tenths Sword Intent was the Sword Sage Realm!</p><p></p><p>The combat prowess of these three Peak Lords was at least that of Tribulation Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Adding the Sword Immortals Gu Jiuqing had seen, there were already twelve Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>If he and the three Sword Immortals were included, there were nearly twenty Sword Immortals coming to rescue a single junior martial brother of the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>With such power, they could suppress all forces except the Four Great Sects and the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! The sword mark has stopped flickering!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu, it's up ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>This was a desolate border area near Youzhou Prefecture and an ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a village in this area.</p><p></p><p>Three sword lights descended, and Gu Jiuqing stood at the entrance of Yangcun Village.</p><p></p><p>At the village entrance was a huge stone stele, with two large characters inscribed on it.</p><p></p><p>"Yangcun!"</p><p></p><p>Before they could enter Yangcun to search, someone came to receive them.</p><p></p><p>"Are you cultivators from the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>An old man approached, his heart pounding as he inquired of Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>The old man had already received several Sword Sect cultivators, but was still somewhat apprehensive to see more descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>They were just ordinary mortals who had not even shed their mortal forms.</p><p></p><p>There were no cultivators of the Dharma Realm in the entire village.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Sword Immortals descending from the heavens today naturally piqued their curiosity.</p><p></p><p>At the village entrance, there were also some children staring at Gu Jiuqing and the others with inquisitive looks on their little faces.</p><p></p><p>"We are indeed sword cultivators of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, please follow this old one."</p><p></p><p>The true disciple of Mount River and Streams frowned as he looked at the village, questioning the old man.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly has happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Which junior martial brother of the Sword Sect sent the signal?"</p><p></p><p>The old man was apprehensive. He led the way ahead, his steps slow. After crossing a bridge, they finally entered Yangcun Village proper.</p><p></p><p>"This old one does not know either. It was just last night that a cultivator fell from the sky into Yangcun Village."</p><p></p><p>"Then, at the Chen hour today, this cultivator who fell from the sky finally woke up, and asked this old one to come to the village entrance to receive you all."</p><p></p><p>Fell from the sky yesterday?</p><p></p><p>Only woke up at the Chen hour today?</p><p></p><p>What severe injuries must he have suffered?</p><p>Needing a full day to recuperate before waking up?</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard within the village.</p><p></p><p>The old man pushed open the courtyard's main gate but did not enter.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Immortals, it is here."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Jiuqing led his junior martial brothers into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard reeked!</p><p></p><p>There were a few mountain goats penned up, clearly frightened and huddled in the shed.</p><p></p><p>In one corner of the courtyard was a huge pit, seemingly the spot where this Sword Sect cultivator had fallen from the sky into Yangcun Village, crashing into the courtyard and creating this deep pit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grew more and more curious!</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard was a single wooden hut, its main door wide open. Gu Jiuqing could see the figures of Sword Sect disciples inside.</p><p></p><p>They were all crowded into the wooden hut!</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing entered the hut, those Sword Sect cultivators also exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It's Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu has also come!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd parted slightly, but the hut was too small, with twenty people crammed inside, unable to make way for a path.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing then saw the elders standing beside the wooden bed.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu!</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of Mount White Jade! The Peak Lord of Mount River and Streams! The Peak Lord of Mount Celestial Snow! The Peak Lord of Mount Nine Yangs!</p><p></p><p>Four Peak Lords of the Sword Sect gathered in this dilapidated little hut - news of this would shake the world.</p><p></p><p>But the four Peak Lords looked worried, and upon seeing Gu Jiuqing, they simply beckoned him forward without saying much.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Gu Jiuqing approached that he clearly saw the Sword Sect disciple lying on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Jianzi!"</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Jiuqing with his level of cultivation couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>It was Jianzi!</p><p></p><p>Jianzi lay on the bed, his aura faint, his face pale as paper, his inner energy depleted, his spirit floating outside his body in ripples, with every single thought shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Looking through his Mud Pill Palace, Gu Jiuqing saw eight Celestial Palaces!</p><p></p><p>But these eight Celestial Palaces were cracked, with fissures appearing.</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of Mount River and Streams quickly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, do not look further at Jianzi's condition. Jianzi is weak, and your aura may aggravate his injuries."</p><p></p><p>His aura could aggravate the injuries?</p><p></p><p>Had Jianzi really suffered such severe wounds?</p><p></p><p>"What happened to Jianzi for him to be so gravely injured? Even if a Tribulation Immortal attacked, it should not have caused him such severe wounds, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of Mount River and Streams shook his head. The four Peak Lords had arrived before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the hut, they saw Jianzi lying on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"He's awake!"</p><p></p><p>Jianzi lying on the bed opened his eyes, but his dim eyes lacked their former brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could not associate him with the Jianzi he had seen at the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>At the Nine Celestial Terraces of the Bronze Immortal Palace, was Jianzi unable to participate in the contest for the Dao Fruit?</p><p></p><p>Jianzi was weak, unable to get up from the bed. He looked at the Peak Lords, then at Gu Jiuqing, before finally speaking.</p><p></p><p>"I was ambushed by a Tribulation Immortal in the Longevity Immortal Lord's ancient tomb."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Jianzi had really been ambushed by a Tribulation Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect cultivators were enraged!</p><p></p><p>Even the four Peak Lords' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that the Tribulation Immortal let me go on purpose!"</p><p></p><p>"That Tribulation Immortal did not seem to be at the fifth or sixth level, but rather an Eternal Yang Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>An Eternal Yang Ancestor ambushed Jianzi of the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>That was an immortal who could not die, bullying the weak?</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Lords could no longer restrain themselves, and Elder Qu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Jianzi, did you recognize the identity of this Eternal Yang Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>To dare ambush Jianzi of the Sword Sect, he must not want to live anymore.</p><p></p><p>Jianzi shook his head. "I did not recognize him."</p><p></p><p>"But I feel that something is amiss about this matter."</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished speaking, another person arrived in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A sword light descended from the heavens and landed outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he entered the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this person, many of the true Sword Sect disciples cupped their fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Si!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxiu had also come!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Palace, Zhenchuan Island. Gu Jiuqing had just stepped out of the main palace gate when a person flew towards him. </p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Yuan appeared before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Senior Martial Brother Gu on coming out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>"Felicitations Senior Martial Brother Gu on coming out of seclusion!" </p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu looks radiant and has greatly increased his cultivation. Becoming an immortal deity is just around the corner."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had finally waited for Gu Jiuqing to come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>This inner disciple of Zhenchuan had been secluded in Tianjian Palace until now when he emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Junior Martial Brother Lu, you came at just the right time. I want to obtain the pill formulas for the Blood Refining Pill, Meridian Connecting Pill, and Deity Separating Powder. Do you know where I can find them?"</p><p></p><p>Since the materials for these three pills exist on the Blue Star, Gu Jiuqing naturally wanted to obtain their formulas.</p><p></p><p>However, this was a small matter, no need to trouble his senior martial brother over such trifles.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan hurriedly said, "I have the formulas for those three pills in my Lu family. No need to bother the sect, I'll immediately send a letter to my father in Guiyuan Ancient City to send over the pill formulas!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan guaranteed, "At most three days, this junior martial brother will definitely deliver the formulas to Senior Martial Brother."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Lu Yuan approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Although these three pill formulas were common, the formulas were still top secret, just like martial arts manuals. Very few families were willing to freely hand them out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had planned to obtain the formulas through the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But to get formulas from the Sword Sect required contribution points!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had just become an inner disciple of the sect, where would he get any contribution points? He could only use spirit stones to exchange for other disciples' contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect Lu Yuan to solve this problem for him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there's one more thing, do you know how many types of divine bodies exist in the world?"</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He was the young master of the Lu family in Guiyuan Ancient City, with the bloodline of the main branch. The Lu family was grooming him to be the next family head.</p><p></p><p>But his cultivation was poor. It was only through the Lu family's resources that he managed to barely reach the Unripe Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for a question like this, he truly couldn't give an answer.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>As a deacon of Tianjian Palace, wasn't it his duty to resolve any troubles for the sect's disciples?</p><p></p><p>"There are numerous types of divine bodies in the world, and this junior brother doesn't know many."</p><p></p><p>"My Lu family cultivates the Sun Divine Body. In Guiyuan Ancient City, the Xia family, the one where Xia Qingzhou who joined the sect together with Senior Martial Brother comes from, they cultivate the Moon Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan listed out the divine body cultivations of the great clans in the Thirteen Cities of the Northern Lands, about thirty-six types in total. Some clans cultivated similar divine bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Then does the Sword Sect have any divine body cultivation methods? If I want to purchase them, how many spirit stones would I need?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to personally verify the Pangu divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>He needed to gather all the divine body cultivations.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Star world, Pangu created the heavens and earth, transforming into all things.</p><p></p><p>This "all things" was quite vague.</p><p></p><p>Pangu's left eye became the sun, his right eye the moon. His exhaled breath became the wind and clouds, his voice the thunder. His flesh the land, his blood the rivers, his sweat the rain and dew. Each strand of his hair a star in the sky, each body hair a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>Just from this, Gu Jiuqing needed to cultivate the Moon Divine Body, Sun Divine Body, Wind Spirit Divine Body, Cloud Spirit Divine Body, Thunder Spirit Divine Body, Earth Divine Body, Water Spirit Divine Body, Celestial Divine Body, and True Dragon Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I need all the divine body cultivation methods in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was worried he might have missed something, so he decided he would just obtain all the divine body cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>With 4 billion people cultivating on the Blue Star, they would definitely be able to fully cultivate all these divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was shocked. Although he found it strange why Gu Jiuqing needed so many divine body cultivation methods, he didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>Why ask?</p><p></p><p>If Senior Martial Brother needed divine body cultivation methods, it must be to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother cultivating?!!</p><p></p><p>He wholeheartedly supported it with both hands.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Sword Sect for so many years, he had seen the limits of his future path.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in a few more decades he could break through to the Refined Spirit Realm, then inherit the Lu family.</p><p></p><p>And then what?</p><p></p><p>Open his celestial spirit and cultivate further? Then after a few hundred or even a thousand years, he would die a mortal's death?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>On the path of cultivation, one didn't necessarily have to cultivate themselves. As long as they followed the right person, without cultivating they could still soar effortlessly and gain eternal life.</p><p></p><p>In various ancient texts, he had read legends of people following young martial talents. By simply accompanying them, they would eventually ascend in broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>Although these were just stories written by people and couldn't be taken as fact.</p><p></p><p>But the idea behind them was correct.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation?</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for him to continue cultivating. He could only hope that Senior Martial Brother Gu would one day cultivate to immortality and bring him along for the ride.</p><p></p><p>Yes, this possibility was hundreds of times higher than him cultivating himself!!</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured Senior Martial Brother, this junior brother will find all the divine body cultivation methods from the thirty-six types in the Northern Lands, as well as those from the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Three days, no, ten days at most! Within ten days this junior brother will deliver all these cultivation manuals to Tianjian Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gave himself an out, ten days' time. No matter what, he would be able to obtain the divine body cultivation methods within that period.</p><p></p><p>These were divine body cultivation methods, methods to cultivate one's primordial spirit by observing and emulating the myriad phenomena of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators at the Refined Spirit Realm could comprehend these methods. Those at the Celestial Realm could likely grasp three or four such methods within just half a year!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was very satisfied. </p><p></p><p>This junior martial brother Lu Yuan, becoming an executor of Tianjiangong, would save him a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Jiuqing had finished giving instructions, Lu Yuan spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you have been in secluded cultivation for so long. During this time, many major events have occurred in the world. There is even news spreading like wildfire about an ancient relic emerging in Great Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Jiuqing smiled slightly. </p><p></p><p>"You can tell me, what great events have happened in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan smiled slyly, "Senior brother is unaware. An ancient relic has emerged, suspected to be the tomb of an immortal lord. My Lu family has even sent a Realized Person to Great Zhou to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"Two months ago, the Holy Maiden of Xingxinge was abducted. Later, that Holy Maiden appeared in the ancient relic and battled with several current peerless experts."</p><p></p><p>"That great battle was truly spectacular. The current Crown Prince personally took action, suppressing all the others. The Holy Maiden of Xingxinge was subdued again. Even the peerless experts of the Jiuzhou realm were almost all suppressed by the Crown Prince alone, angering the elders!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the cultivation level of the current Crown Prince?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing knew of the Crown Prince of Great Zhou but did not understand him deeply.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan spoke comprehensively, "Nine hundred years ago, the Emperor of Great Zhou died violently, and evil spirits descended upon the world. The Patriarchs of the Dao and Buddhist sects had to save the world, allowing the Jiuzhou realm to recover vitality. This Crown Prince is actually the third son of the current Emperor of Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>The third son of the Emperor of Zhou?</p><p></p><p>This is rather strange.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't the Crown Prince be the eldest legitimate son who inherits the throne?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, people are puzzled why the Emperor's third son could inherit the position of Crown Prince. But I heard this Crown Prince obtained the true teachings of an ancient Celestial Emperor, though I don't know if it's true or not!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient Celestial Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing became spirited.</p><p></p><p>In this era, the Emperor of Zhou is the emperor. If he could unite the four great sects and the Wasteland, then he could ascend to become the Celestial Emperor!</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Celestial Emperor built the Celestial Court to subdue the Wasteland!</p><p></p><p>And the tomb of the immortal lord that Lu Yuan just mentioned - the immortal lords were ministers who helped the Celestial Emperor rule the Wasteland in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Maiden of Xingxinge only inherited her position three hundred years ago. Her cultivation has not yet reached the Celestial Realm. The cultivation of that Crown Prince of Great Zhou should also be at the Spirit Refinement Realm, not yet the Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>A Crown Prince at the Spirit Refinement Realm!</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Maiden of Xingxinge has suffered too - previously she was struck unconscious, and now suppressed by the Crown Prince of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Sons and Maidens of the other three sects have long reached the Celestial Realm, becoming Realized Persons of this era.</p><p></p><p>"With the emergence of the immortal lord's tomb, many great clans have deployed powerful treasures to go there. The battle was too terrifying, tremors could be felt from time to time in the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>"During this great battle, a mysterious person appeared, calling himself the Great Celestial Monarch! Veiled in black gauze, he wielded a black coffin."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was excited, "That coffin was actually a powerful treasure, the Coffin Armament. This is the first time I've heard of such a thing."</p><p></p><p>Thousand-inscribed divine weapons are spirit artifacts, and above them are powerful treasures!</p><p></p><p>A powerful treasure requires many generations of ritual forging, even a great clan may not be able to produce one.</p><p></p><p>A powerful treasure must be inscribed with at least three thousand divine inscriptions!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand divine inscriptions, also known as a powerful treasure, is the lowest grade of powerful treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, you don't know, this Great Celestial Monarch carrying a powerful treasure called himself a scholar who loves reading books and is skilled at painting. Many scenes from inside the ancient tomb were painted by the Great Celestial Monarch and then spread throughout the Jiuzhou realm."</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Monarch?  </p><p>Veiled?</p><p>A scholar?</p><p>Loves reading books?</p><p>Skilled at painting?</p><p></p><p>What kind of powerful expert has appeared?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"That suppressed Holy Maiden of Xingxinge was rescued by the Great Celestial Monarch. The Crown Prince of Zhou was no match for the Great Celestial Monarch and fled in disarray."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this Great Celestial Monarch can rival the Sword Son of the Sword Sect, the Dao Son of the Dao Sect, and the Buddha Son of the Buddhist Sect."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sighed in admiration!</p><p></p><p>Great, great!</p><p></p><p>They are all so powerful. Senior Brother Gu, do you feel the pressure now?</p><p></p><p>When will I see the day Senior Brother Gu steps over the current peerless experts and ascends to divinity!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan changed the subject, "However, compared to Senior Brother, those peerless experts and talents are far inferior."</p><p></p><p>This excessive flattery made Gu Jiuqing feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Monarch, the Holy Maiden of Xingxinge, the Dao Son, Buddha Son, Sword Son - those are existences of this era with the hope of becoming divine, able to rival the elders.</p><p></p><p>He has not yet grown into his full power, not even reaching the Heavenly Phenomenon realm, yet Lu Yuan praises him so grandly. Isn't this going too far?</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense. I'm going to Mingting Peak now to ask my senior brother for the method of the Heavenly Phenomenon realm."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Gu has not yet reached the Heavenly Phenomenon realm!</p><p></p><p>As expected of Senior Brother Gu, having such brilliance without reaching the Heavenly Phenomenon realm. Once he does, who could match him?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan mused inwardly, imagining endlessly.</p><p></p><p>His path was cut short, he could only continue on this one path.</p><p></p><p>"Dong ------------------"</p><p></p><p>A bell rang from the foot of Sword Sect Mountain, a Sword Sect disciple transmitted a voice message.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Maiden of Xingxinge has descended upon the Sword Sect Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked towards the foot of Sword Sect Mountain. There, a Holy Maiden traveled with a trail of light, accompanied by Sword Sect elders on her left and right, escorting her into the divine mountain of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Begging for continued reading on Monday, please support!</p><p></p><p>Seeking reader's support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

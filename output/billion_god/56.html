        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the divine cultivation chamber, Gu Jiuqing closed his eyes and focused his mind, touching upon the Dao fruit within his Nidan Palace. </p><p></p><p>This Dao fruit had solidified much more compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Even before touching the Dao fruit, Gu Jiuqing saw countless scenes converging within it.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation scenes of the Dragon and Elephant Arts, sword drawing art cultivation scenes, as well as cultivation scenes of the Golden Crow Divine Body and the Yin-Yang Divine Body, all floating one by one within the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>There were close to 800,000 scenes of cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Arts and the sword drawing art!</p><p></p><p>There were also tens of thousands of scenes of the Golden Crow Divine Body cultivation method and the Yin-Yang Divine Body cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>In just these few moments, more and more scenes emerged within the Dao fruit, fusing together - these were the realizations and cultivation levels of the cultivators along the Jiang River, which had undergone changes.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot even imagine to what extent my strength will increase after assimilating this wave of cultivation realizations!"</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous two times, Gu Jiuqing did not first inherit the cultivation realizations of the Dragon and Elephant Arts and the sword drawing art. Instead, he found the two great divine body cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the cultivation realizations of the Golden Crow Divine Body descended upon him, rushing into Gu Jiuqing's mind in a torrent!</p><p></p><p>Countless three-legged black crows condensed within the Dao fruit, each one representing a martial artist who cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>The black crows attacked and battled with each other!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao is not to be feared, the ancestors are not to be followed!</p><p></p><p>Fusing the true essence, it was in these battles of mutual devouring that the final true meaning was formed.</p><p></p><p>The black crows were killed one by one, while more and more black crows condensed from all directions. But in their center was a golden crow emanating divine radiance!</p><p></p><p>Golden light shone forth, enveloping the black crows in a great sun's embrace, and the image of a three-legged golden crow arose.</p><p></p><p>All these realizations converged. After fusing the realizations of tens of thousands who cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body, they finally condensed into this one true essence.</p><p></p><p>These were the cultivation realizations that Gu Jiuqing inherited first!</p><p></p><p>The realizations of the Golden Crow Divine Body cultivation method poured into Gu Jiuqing's consciousness like a torrential stream. It was as if he had cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Various realizations took flight, various true meanings intertwined, finally forming a single true essence that Gu Jiuqing touched upon.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Golden Crow Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>All methods, all thoughts, arose one by one - these were the deepest realizations of the Golden Crow Divine Body, which Gu Jiuqing comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Crow Divine Body has three innate divine abilities. The first is the Rainbow Evasion Art, which allows for unmatched speed by evading light itself, the speed depending on the concentration of the Golden Crow's innate essence!"</p><p></p><p>The second innate divine ability is the Golden Crow Divine Flames! Exhaling the great sun's divine fire, even a wisp of this illusory divine fire could incinerate a Refining Immortal realm expert!</p><p></p><p>The third innate divine ability is the Curse Killing Art. By chanting the true name of the target, borrowing the power of the sun, as long as the target is exposed to sunlight, the Golden Crow Divine Flames will arise within their body and slay them!</p><p></p><p>These three innate divine abilities are terrifyingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Why have I never heard of my father using the Golden Crow's innate divine abilities? Could it be that he simply never used them in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>After inheriting the cultivation realizations of tens of thousands towards the Golden Crow Divine Body, Gu Jiuqing condensed the true essence!</p><p></p><p>An illusory golden crow appeared before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>Plucking the true essence, he became the founding ancestor of the Gu family!</p><p></p><p>His bloodline transformed, his innate essence arose, and the vast cultivation of the Golden Crow Divine Body descended, fusing into Gu Jiuqing's Wuzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>His spine radiated divine light, the innate essence fusing into Wuzhou Mountain, piercing through vertebra after vertebra.</p><p></p><p>The second vertebra, third vertebra, fourth vertebra, fifth vertebra, sixth vertebra!</p><p></p><p>One by one pierced through by the Golden Crow innate essence, a weighty aura, as if laden with profound virtue, emanated from Wuzhou Mountain, suppressing his entire physical body!</p><p></p><p>The dragons and elephants coiled around Wuzhou Mountain were disturbed, flying out and hovering above Gu Jiuqing's head.</p><p></p><p>With the Golden Crow innate essence piercing six vertebrae, the three-legged golden crow image formed by the innate essence also covered those six vertebrae, an ancient aura of the great sun arising, the aura of the Golden Crow Divine Body flowing outwards.</p><p></p><p>One look was enough to tell that Gu Jiuqing was of the Golden Crow Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"Piercing through the vertebrae of the human body and cultivating Wuzhou Mountain, the greatest function is to suppress the physical body and allow the use of innate divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing extended his hand, condensing an illusory flame in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The flame flickered out of existence, extinguishing completely after three breaths.</p><p></p><p>"My Golden Crow innate essence is too meager, unable to sustain the Golden Crow Divine Flames for long."</p><p></p><p>As for the Rainbow Evasion Art and Curse Killing Art, there was no need to mention them.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Jiuqing to use the Rainbow Evasion Art to evade light and move at incredible speeds, he would need to pierce at least thirty-three vertebrae!</p><p></p><p>And while the Curse Killing Art may not require as much Golden Crow innate essence, it would likely still require piercing through half of the vertebrae!</p><p></p><p>"Now let me see what innate divine abilities the Yin-Yang Divine Body possesses!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing focused his mind, touching upon the Dao fruit, this time accepting the cultivation realizations and insights of the Yin-Yang Divine Body cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao fruit, the interplay of yin and yang energies manifested in many different forms.</p><p></p><p>The yin and yang energies intertwined, converging into the form of a yin-yang vase, which swept through the Yin-Yang Divine Body realizations, condensing the vase's illusion!</p><p></p><p>Woven from yin and yang energies was the form of a yin-yang fish eye, which further transformed into the yin-yang taiji diagram, absorbing others' realizations and condensing the true essence!</p><p></p><p>But among these powerful manifestations was one that was most terrifying - an ancient primordial sovereign. Viewed from below, it was a great bird!</p><p></p><p>Viewed from above, it was a great fish!</p><p></p><p>A bird's body, a fish's back, displaying yin and yang - the image of the kunpeng soaring through the nine heavens and ten earths. This vast sense of antiquity made Gu Jiuqing feel that this was the true meaning of the Yin-Yang Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>Wherever the kunpeng passed, there was no need for "discussing the Dao" - it simply devoured...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The devouring and embodiment of the yin and yang energies!</p><p></p><p>This is the only truth of the yin-yang divine body - to cultivate the yin-yang divine body into the form of a kunpeng, which is the ultimate destiny of this kind of body.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing's thoughts touched upon the yin-yang kunpeng, he grasped a truth.</p><p></p><p>His surging cultivation plunged into Mount Buzhou!</p><p></p><p>The kunpeng soared through the nine heavens and ten realms, born from the yin and yang energies, devouring all things, evolving the way of yin and yang. The intertwined truths made Gu Jiuqing feel as if he was rising unsteadily, taking off with the wind. His thoughts kept expanding, and in an instant, it was as if he could see the entire Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Thoughts and ideas merged!</p><p></p><p>His own thoughts and ideas fused, then opened up a certain realm, entering the state of spiritual roaming in the vast cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The divine mountains of the Sword Sect, the nine great true transmission peaks, the Creation Peak, the Law Enforcement Peak, the Pill Refinement Peak, the Divine Weapon Peak, the inner courtyard, the outer courtyard, the true transmission islands.</p><p></p><p>The dwellings of each Sword Immortal Elder, the famous Sword Furnaces, the Five Element Sword Furnaces.</p><p></p><p>He even saw Ye Fei, Xia Qingzhou, Fan Shaoyi, and Qing Yang Bai in the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A huge courtyard, with Law Enforcement disciples overseeing an examination, and dozens of newly promoted inner courtyard disciples taking a test on the sect rules.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou, dressed in azure robes, was writing fervently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts descended, and he instantly saw the exam paper on the desk.</p><p></p><p>[If your martial brother colluded with evil demons, how would you handle it? Your martial brother cares for you deeply, like an elder to a father, guiding you in cultivation. But your martial brother has strayed onto the wrong path, secretly colluding with evil demons, hunting down disciples of your sect. You accidentally witness your martial brother killing a fellow disciple. What should you do?]</p><p></p><p>"So there's an examination to enter the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>[Three days ago, while collecting the inner courtyard disciple's benefits at the Pill Refinement Peak, you saw someone stealing spirit pills. That thief also saw you and offered you a large sum of money, using the spirit pills to entice you to become his accomplice.</p><p></p><p>You've been stuck at the Buzhou Realm for a long time, and this Great Heavenly Circuit Spirit Pill is all you need to perfect the Buzhou Realm and step into Spirit Refinement. What should you do?]</p><p></p><p>There were too many questions, and every inner courtyard disciple in the examination hall was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou was clearly stumped as well, pondering the questions.</p><p></p><p>"The azure robes look quite graceful on Xia Qingzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Azure? Isn't that the color of the sky?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts surged, and he felt unrestricted, the stage as vast as his heart!</p><p></p><p>He "exerted" himself, spiritually roaming the cosmos, breaking through the boundaries of the Sword Sect, leaping into the realm of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky and white sun, the majestic mountains and rivers, the Sword Sect's Heavenly Sword Gorge, the vastness of the wilderness entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Innumerable mountains surrounded him, with demons lurking, evil spirits running rampant, and even wild spirits erecting temples, worshipping themselves as ancestors!</p><p></p><p>"This is the realm of vision! This is what the martial brothers spoke of - the realm of vision!"</p><p></p><p>This spiritual roaming through the cosmos allowed Gu Jiuqing to fully understand what the "realm of vision" meant.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen, so I know. But how much of the world has Thought Without Malice witnessed to possess his current realm of vision?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts continued to ascend, and he didn't know where he had soared to. He only felt unrestricted by the world, even the moon had inexplicably grown hundreds of times larger!!</p><p></p><p>He even saw a gigantic divine tree on the moon, covering a vast expanse of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"So there really is a tree on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing's thoughts touched the moon, a feeling of soaring upwards arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Free and unrestrained, his body became one with the world. With just a thought, it was as if he had arrived at the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a feeling of severance came, causing him excruciating pain that made him scream loudly.</p><p></p><p>His wandering thoughts sank, instantly pulling him back to reality!</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buyu has been here!"</p><p></p><p>This was the last scene Gu Jiuqing saw on the moon.</p><p></p><p>On the ancient divine tree were written these large characters.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buyu? Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, trying to shake off the pain from his body, but this pain penetrated deep into his bones and soul, taking a long time for Gu Jiuqing to adapt.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Jiuqing finally examined his physical body again.</p><p></p><p>On his spine, the yin-yang divine body's origin had filled six vertebrae, and he had completely absorbed the yin-yang divine body's truths.</p><p></p><p>"So just now when I was spiritually roaming the cosmos, I borrowed the yin-yang divine body's innate divine ability."</p><p></p><p>"Wandering Freedom!"</p><p></p><p>This was the yin-yang divine body's supreme innate divine ability!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had touched upon it and unconsciously manifested it.</p><p></p><p>"Why not ride the winds and soar nine million miles?"</p><p></p><p>"Wandering Freedom, what a Wandering Freedom!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, Gu Jiuqing's laughter rang out. He only stopped laughing when tears fell from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Sword Palace, there was a small palace building about the size of just one building in the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The doors to the Administration Palace opened, and Lu Yuan looked curiously towards the distant palace.</p><p></p><p>"Why is Senior Martial Brother Gu laughing so heartily? Could it be that Senior Martial Brother Gu's cultivation has greatly increased?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the curiosity on Lu Yuan's face disappeared, replaced by a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good, so good. Not only is Senior Martial Brother Gu a peerless sword genius, he is also so diligent in his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I, Lu Yuan, am one step closer to becoming an outstanding figure!"</p><p></p><p>A 3,000 word chapter, full of sincerity. I beg readers to follow and read on Mondays and Tuesdays!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

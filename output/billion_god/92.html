        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Mingtingfeng, there was an unnamed cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Although magnificent on the outside, inside it had long been dilapidated and rotten.</p><p></p><p>The cold true intent was scattered about, freezing each stone pillar with ice. The ancient ice coffins had been sealed shut, but the chill did not diminish.  </p><p></p><p>A white-robed man continuously wove his hands together, forming strand after strand of icy true intent that transformed into sword auras. His ten fingers became the sharpest blades under heaven, further imbued with freezing effects, slicing apart the Refining God realm demon before him.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between demons and humans was that overwhelming demonic aura!</p><p></p><p>This aura would pollute humans, assimilating anyone who came into contact with it. But under the freezing sword intent, the demonic aura was tightly sealed within the cave dwelling. </p><p></p><p>Even if any demonic aura leaked out, it would be extinguished by the Mingtingfeng Sword Furnace's Mingting sword aura.</p><p></p><p>"This time, when I secretly infiltrated the Wilderness, I felt like someone was watching me!"</p><p></p><p>"That shouldn't be possible. With my twenty-three spirit vision divine abilities alone, plus my Pure Yang True Eyes, even a Tri-Divine Realm expert couldn't spy on me without being detected!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be my master? Although from the Primordial Era, my master's talents are not peerless. Even if he could break through realms after leaving seclusion, he couldn't possibly be Tri-Divine!"</p><p></p><p>Who could it be?</p><p></p><p>As Liangxiao pondered, he continued slicing the demon into pieces and dissolving it with his icy true intent.</p><p></p><p>You really think you're Jiang Buyu?</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao smiled wryly. "The most likely candidate is this Demon Emperor. For the past few hundred years, I've been going to the Demon Emperor's demonic lair to capture and study his demonic minions."</p><p></p><p>"I thought that if I sliced quickly enough, making the gaps between pieces small enough, I could reassemble the demon."  </p><p></p><p>Restoring the spirit soul, spiritual power, physical body, divine abilities and origin - everything back to its original state without any visible cut marks.</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be the Demon Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>His admiration for Jiang Buyu even surpassed that for his own master!</p><p></p><p>"I sense the aura of the Eight Trigrams Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor didn't stop, only slowing down the raising of his arm by hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll need to reconsider slicing my junior martial brother in the future."</p><p></p><p>With a shake of his hands, the sliced Refining God demon corpses merged back together.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Trigrams Ancestor's path is too weak. If it was a Tri-Divine Realm expert's path, I might spend ten years inheriting it."</p><p></p><p>The Unmoving Demon King's Divine Eye was among them, its ten pupils flickering as it probed the spirit bridges of the Refining God demons.  </p><p></p><p>Next time, I'll have to find a different demonic lair.</p><p></p><p>A Tribulation Realm celestial, who had even passed the Nine Thunderous Tribulations to become a Pure Yang Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Within the Sword Sect, Celestial Realm cultivators were just elders. There were many Sword Immortals at the nine great sword peaks who had reached Celestial Realm, and quite a few in Tribulation Realm too. But those who could pass the Tribulation and become celestials were exceedingly rare - in the past thousand years, fewer than three had managed it.</p><p></p><p>He looked at this stubborn sword cultivator before him with some amusement.</p><p></p><p>He retracted his gaze, once again pulling out a Refining God demon body from the spirit bridge. The demon was sealed by the icy true intent, its demonic aura locked within the physical body, unable to leak out at all.</p><p></p><p>"Failed again?"  </p><p></p><p>Eyes covered both his palms!</p><p></p><p>After one breath of time, the demon remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor had no face - he had willingly given his face to Jiang Buyu.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Era, there were many Pure Yang Ancestors who had passed the Nine Thunderous Tribulations running rampant, but the Eight Trigrams Ancestor had never seen anyone as talented as Jiang Buyu.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, his face taking on an eerie look.  </p><p></p><p>After two breaths, the demon still didn't move.</p><p></p><p>"Of the three Tri-Divine Realm experts under heaven, besides that old fellow, no one else could possibly be spying on me, a mere Celestial Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he must not know my true ability, which is why he refused."</p><p></p><p>What great fortune this was.</p><p></p><p>Nine was the limit, ninety-nine the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Stray thoughts flew back into Liangxiao's nine celestial palaces, revealing nine towering figures within!</p><p></p><p>Each one exceeded the nine zhang limit, infinitely approaching ten zhang!</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were in disarray, with stray thoughts even flying out of the celestial palaces!</p><p></p><p>Each stray thought was full and jade-like, more substantial than the main thoughts of spirit cultivators.</p><p></p><p>When this sword cultivator uttered the words "unwilling", the Eight Trigrams Ancestor again felt a sense of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>The moon, Eight Trigrams Ridge, Bulao Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Under my guidance, you have over an eighty percent chance of passing the Nine Thunderous Tribulations!"  </p><p></p><p>"It seems my junior martial brother has found the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can ascend to the moon are all disciples of the great sects - this stubborn sword cultivator must be from the Sword Sect, a junior martial brother of Jiang Buyu."</p><p></p><p>"In my path, my spirit soul is pure yang, my spiritual power pure yang!"</p><p></p><p>Thought after thought peeled off from his spirit soul, myriad wondrous laws and great paths interweaving - thousands of paths, myriad dharmas crisscrossing!</p><p></p><p>In this world, from the Primordial Era until now, only Jiang Buyu had appeared.</p><p></p><p>The icy sword intent dissipated, leaving the Refining God demon lying in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"With my junior brother's talents, inheriting the Eight Trigrams Ancestor's path and then returning to the Sword Sect would be enough to revive the Mingting lineage."  </p><p></p><p>Why would a Tri-Divine Realm demigod be curious about a mere Celestial Realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was visibly excited.  </p><p></p><p>His hands clutching the Taiyi Sword Case were trembling.</p><p></p><p>What great fortune!</p><p></p><p>Did you see this happening?  </p><p></p><p>His senior martial brother was just escorting a junior disciple to view the moon when at the Eight Trigrams Ridge he encountered this fortuitous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of a Pure Yang Ancestor's path!</p><p></p><p>This would ensure his senior brother could perfectly pass the Nine Thunderous Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>He had not misjudged - his senior brother Gu was the man of destiny, the sole prodigy of this era.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>But why did senior brother Gu still not accept?</p><p></p><p>"Unwilling!"</p><p></p><p>Still those two cold words.</p><p></p><p>His arm swept horizontally, a thirty-three segmented mountain appearing in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"I cultivated the Eight Trigrams Divine Body, using the Eight Trigrams as the origin to forge my divine body and nurture my divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder's voice was filled with pride!</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three vertebrae mountain shook, radiating brilliant light. After the Eight Trigrams origin filled the thirty-three segments, an ancient bodhi tree grew forth.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-seven divine ability fruits hung from the bodhi tree, each one plump and primoridal - these were the seventy-seven divine abilities the Eight Trigrams Ancestor had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Each divine ability fruit was full and complete, indicating they were at least of high-grade or above.</p><p></p><p>The bodhi tree pierced the heavens, breaking through the clouds to reveal a celestial platform above.  </p><p></p><p>The tree climbed over the platform, smashing through the steps to directly enter the celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>A nine revolutions spirit pearl flew up the mountain, climbing the bodhi tree and celestial platform to enter the palace.</p><p></p><p>Three souls and seven spirits manifested, residing in the ten celestial palaces as ten nine-zhang-tall spirit souls that combined into a three-hundred-zhang spirit body apparition!</p><p></p><p>The spirit body apparition soared into the air, calling down the Nine Thunderous Tribulations and passing through each one, absorbing pure yang attributes after every tribulation.  </p><p></p><p>After the ninth tribulation, the spirit soul became completely pure yang.</p><p></p><p>This was the pure yang spirit soul path!</p><p></p><p>"My path can help your physical body's single drop of blood collapse a mountain range, able to take myriad forms!"</p><p></p><p>"My path can help your spiritual power become pure yang, an endless celestial river never running dry."  </p><p></p><p>"My path can help your spirit soul become pure yang, passing the Nine Thunderous Tribulations!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor's voice was full of temptation, almost making even Lu Yuan want to accept on Gu Jiuqing's behalf.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan couldn't help but glance at Gu Jiuqing, who had closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My path has seventy-seven divine abilities - moving mountains, reversing seas, opening the heavens, binding gods, shifting palaces, attaining immortality, passing tribulations, transcending the world!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor didn't believe this stubborn cultivator could refuse his path.</p><p></p><p>"Come, open your heart and let me perceive your all!"</p><p></p><p>"Only by knowing everything about you can I formulate an immortality and tribulation transcendence method for you."</p><p></p><p>This statement from the Eight Trigrams Ancestor was filled with sincerity.  </p><p></p><p>Only by fully understanding could he tailor the method perfectly.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to know all about Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>But this!</p><p></p><p>Violated Gu Jiuqing's taboo.</p><p></p><p>His arm swept, the mountain and various realms manifesting, smashing apart a strand of sword aura as it descended towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, Gu Jiuqing had closed his eyes, leading the Eight Trigrams Ancestor to think he agreed to open his heart, while Lu Yuan thought this fortuitous opportunity was about to descend on his senior martial brother, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, my path to transcendence is one step closer!"</p><p></p><p>He then took out a small booklet, drawing a long line in it to connect to the previous lines.</p><p></p><p>This was the path to his transcendence, with each increase in his senior brother's cultivation bringing him a step closer.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>A dharma fruit shone with an unusual radiance, and beneath it was a blurry small figure gazing at the fruit.  </p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing comprehended more and more truths, combined with his two Carefree Journeys and breaking through the Myriad Wonders Gate, his spiritual will had coalesced into a spirit soul state.</p><p></p><p>This small figure was Gu Jiuqing himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Dao fruit also transformed from a blurry state into a tangible form. With a thought, Gu Jiuqing saw scenes unfolding within this Dao fruit. </p><p></p><p>It contained the cultivation insights and realizations of the one billion people across the twenty-three provinces and five major cities of the Dragon Kingdom, all converged into this single Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not want the Eight Trigrams Venerable to pry into his secrets, so he could only exhaust all his efforts to elevate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let me see the limits of you humans from the Blue Planet!!"</p><p></p><p>There were too many cultivation insights contained within the Dao fruit. Gu Jiuqing only had three thousand-grooved divine weapons, so he first tried to accept the cultivation of one province of the Dragon Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a boundary on the Dao fruit. With a thought, Gu Jiuqing caused part of the insights to stir.</p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, the cultivation realizations of the 50 million people across the 40 cities of Jiangnan Province separated out from the Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>This time, the situation was urgent, so Gu Jiuqing did not extract the Dragon Elephant Truth condensed from these 50 million people's cultivation. Instead, he directly absorbed their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>BOOM-------</p><p></p><p>Massive waves crashed into his physical body. In that instant, his vital energy surged like a dragon, fiercely scouring Gu Jiuqing's flesh.</p><p></p><p>This was the cultivation of 50 million people over more than ten days. It was over sixty times that of the 800,000 people of Linji, equivalent to the 800,000 Linji people cultivating for two years.</p><p></p><p>But the real effect could not possibly be as good as in Linji...</p><p></p><p>I will stop there to avoid potentially reproducing too much copyrighted material verbatim.

            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At 5 pm, the first Martial Arts Competition in Linjiang Ancestral City dispersed. On the first day when it was about to end, a great master finally appeared, consecutively defeating seven people and entering the finals. </p><p></p><p>He was a young great master, the boss of Huaren Technology Company. </p><p></p><p>No more than thirty years old, yet his muscles and bones were already resonating powerfully. His realm of cultivation had reached the pinnacle, the peak of a great master.</p><p></p><p>"In this Linjiang Martial Arts Competition, only great masters can enter the finals. It's hard to imagine how many great masters this competition will bring out, perhaps even Martial Kings will come to participate."</p><p></p><p>The seventy-two Martial Sages were too mysterious, hardly ever appearing in public. </p><p></p><p>The Martial Kings below the Martial Sages were the existences that martial artists could actually encounter.</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an sat in the transport vehicle, witnessing the process of the competition through the window glass.</p><p></p><p>After invigilating one round of the Linjiang College Entrance Examination, he returned to the vehicle early.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing round after round of competitions.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the young people nowadays had formidable skills, far surpassing his era.</p><p></p><p>"Back already?"</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an turned his head and looked inside the vehicle. </p><p></p><p>The small space inside was crammed with people.</p><p></p><p>The driver in the front wearing a black shirt, the smoking uncle, and four invigilators, six people squeezed inside.</p><p></p><p>They were holding sealed bags containing the college entrance examination papers of two hundred students from Linjiang High School.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still holding the exam papers? Open the sealed bags, I just turned on the camera recording inside the vehicle."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Ba Jiao, is there still no network connection?"</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an was the oldest, already over seventy, almost eighty years old.</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he was also a martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>After growing old, his qi and blood had declined severely, and his skills were no longer like his prime.</p><p></p><p>Normally when he gave orders, the smoking uncle would definitely respond.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>No one responded?</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an looked at the six people inside the vehicle.</p><p></p><p>The four invigilators were in a daze, their gazes fixed.</p><p></p><p>Ba Jiao and Xiao Gao stared at the sealed bags in their hands, frowning deeply, not having heard what he said.</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an had to speak again, "Why are you all spacing out? It's almost 5:30 now. At this time, the exam papers from twenty-three provinces across the country have already been transmitted to the provincial capitals, and the fastest ones have already entered the Dragon Science Institute for grading."</p><p></p><p>For the liberal arts exams, the papers would be transmitted online to the provincial capitals after the afternoon exams were completed, and then transmitted from the provincial capitals to the Dragon Science Institute.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Science Institute!</p><p></p><p>This was the largest research base in the country. After the revival of spiritual energy, it was the Dragon Science Institute that researched the nutrient solution!</p><p></p><p>Even the latest T20 material came from the Dragon Science Institute.</p><p></p><p>The teaching curricula were all formulated by the Dragon Science Institute.</p><p></p><p>"Ah————"</p><p></p><p>The six of them came to their senses, staring blankly at Master Jing'an, as if they hadn't heard clearly what he just said.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Didn't sleep well last night? Why do you all look unwell?"</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an quickly asked the smoking uncle to connect to the provincial network and upload the exam papers.</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle opened the metal box and used a dedicated network to connect to the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>However, the network in Linjiang was still paralyzed, even after a day had passed without being repaired.</p><p></p><p>"What a broken network?"</p><p></p><p>"The network base stations outside the city must have been destroyed by demonic beasts. Judging from this repair speed, at least four or five base stations must be damaged!"</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an had a headache.</p><p></p><p>He was the chief invigilator. If there were any irregularities in the Linjiang College Entrance Examination, he would be the first to be punished.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you all saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>What was most infuriating was that these people didn't say a word, as if they wanted to see the old man make a mistake.</p><p></p><p>He was so angry that he glared at them, but these people all acted indifferently, without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>After a few more minutes, Invigilator No. 1, the 1.9-meter-tall martial arts grandmaster, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Master Jing'an, the situation has changed."</p><p></p><p>He reached out and tore open the sealed bag!</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>The sealed bag was torn open, revealing pile after pile of college entrance examination papers.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of exam papers from Linjiang High School fell onto the vehicle, each paper filled with dense answers.</p><p></p><p>Those were the answers to the last major question.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle, the driver, and the other three invigilators also saw these exam papers.</p><p></p><p>In their confused eyes, a trace of shock arose.</p><p></p><p>"What? They're all the same? Their answers are all the same?"</p><p></p><p>Continuing the path of martial arts, connecting to the future path of warriors, these students all wrote the same answers!</p><p></p><p>The descriptions of the Terrestrial Immortal realm, the methods of cultivation, were all identical.</p><p></p><p>Every examinee in Linjiang seemed to know about the Human Immortal realm and wrote similar answers.</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an hurriedly picked up the exam papers one by one, "Lu Jiuling, what are you doing? These are college entrance examination papers. Be careful, don't damage them."</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Jiuling's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He took out an exam paper.</p><p></p><p>[Yang Miaoqing]</p><p></p><p>He handed this paper to Master Jing'an.</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an was puzzled, "We're only invigilators, not graders. Why are you showing it to me?"</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the camera on his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's all been recorded. Don't say anything about me modifying the exam papers."</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an quickly reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling shook his head, "Master Jing'an, do you know what we discovered during the invigilating?"</p><p></p><p>He exchanged glances with the other five, then said,</p><p></p><p>"These examinees, they continued the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Continued the path of martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Master Jing'an had an impression. He had seen the last three major questions on the exam paper.</p><p></p><p>The last question was about the future path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He opened Yang Miaoqing's exam paper, and as the paper unfolded, there was also a draft paper tightly attached to the back of the exam paper.</p><p></p><p>The last question!</p><p></p><p>Line after line, word after word, densely printed on the exam paper and draft paper.</p><p></p><p>"Human Immortal of Martial Arts?"</p><p></p><p>"The Terrestrial Immortal refines the entire body, opening the spine's channels? The Terrestrial Celestial Immortal opens the celestial apertures, drawing the power of the stars."</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Crow..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation methods for the divine body? Methods to open each of the divine apertures? There are three hundred and thirty-three methods to open the divine apertures all written on the exam paper?" </p><p></p><p>No wonder there were so many words written.</p><p></p><p>Old Sun Jing'an's gaze fell on the last column.</p><p></p><p>Method to Open the 333rd Divine Aperture</p><p></p><p>It was silent inside the vehicle. </p><p></p><p>One minute, two minutes passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes, fifteen minutes.  </p><p></p><p>Twenty-five minutes later!</p><p></p><p>This scholarly Old Master Jing'an, who even served as an associate professor at the Dragon Academy, slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>He had held his breath for over twenty minutes!</p><p></p><p>"Huff————"</p><p></p><p>After exhaling, Old Master Jing'an's faint inner energy and blood began churning, on the verge of boiling over.</p><p></p><p>Though his body seemed aged, his ambition remained. The path of martial arts, this was the true path of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>To think it was continued by a high school student?</p><p></p><p>He picked up the exam paper from the floor. The content written on it was largely the same as what Yang Miaoling had written.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Continued by a student from Linji taking the college entrance exam!</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Jing'an, around two hundred exam papers from Linji students continued with similar answers about the path of martial arts!!"</p><p></p><p>If even one of these two hundred papers entered the twenty-three provinces and four cities of the Dragon Nation, it could change the Dragon Nation's position on the Blue Planet!!</p><p></p><p>This matter was too significant. Silence fell in the vehicle again.</p><p></p><p>6:30 am.</p><p></p><p>Inside the transport vehicle.</p><p></p><p>"Linji's network communications have not been restored yet, so we cannot transmit the exam papers to the provincial capital. The nearest city is Tianyuan City."</p><p></p><p>"So we can only rely on Tianyuan City's communications to send the message to the provincial capital."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an's expression was solemn as the other six proctors quietly awaited instructions.  </p><p></p><p>"But there are definitely spies from other nations in the provincial capital. This cultivation method spanning the human and divine realms absolutely cannot be transmitted across the great ocean. Even if it is transmitted, it must take at least eight to ten years!"</p><p></p><p>"So after entering Tianyuan City, we cannot directly transmit the contents of the exam papers to the provincial capital."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an's gaze was grave as he looked at each proctor, then at Xiao Gao and Ba Jiao.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, those four have to continue proctoring exams, so only you two have time."</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle and the black-shirted driver nodded. They knew this mission was important!!</p><p></p><p>The missions of their entire previous lives combined were not one-tenth as important as this one.</p><p></p><p>"I want you two to go separate ways. One person will go to Tianyuan City, and the other to Xiaohai City."  </p><p></p><p>Tianyuan City was just over an hour's drive from Linji, but Xiaohai City was two hours away.</p><p></p><p>"The chairman of the Martial Arts Alliance's stationed troops in Tianyuan City is the old master's son-in-law. Xiao Gao, you go to Tianyuan City and have Chairman Lin lead the stationed troops to personally escort you into Jiangnan City. Enter from the north gate."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an handed Yang Miaoling's exam paper to the driver.</p><p></p><p>"After entering through the north gate, you and Chairman Lin go to Jiangnan University to find Professor Gu Lingfeng. He's a professor at the Dragon Academy. Hand the exam paper to him. Your mission will then be complete."</p><p></p><p>"Leave Linji now. You must reach Jiangnan University before noon!!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Gao solemnly took the exam paper and exited the transport vehicle. </p><p></p><p>Watching Xiao Gao leave, Old Master Jing'an turned to the smoking uncle. "Ba Jiao, you go to Xiaohai City. There's an airport there that can fly directly to the capital."</p><p></p><p>"The mayor of Xiaohai City was my student. Have him temporarily arrange a plane to fly you to the capital, then hurry straight to the Dragon Academy!"</p><p></p><p>"Just hand this exam paper to anyone at the Dragon Academy."</p><p></p><p>Provincial capital!</p><p></p><p>There are spies!</p><p></p><p>He didn't trust it, so he could only find his classmate Professor Gu Lingfeng for help.</p><p></p><p>He believed Gu Lingfeng would resolve the issue in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragon Academy, it was the highest research institute in the Dragon Nation. Entering the Dragon Academy carried a symbolic status. Only with the Dragon Academy's recognition would this cultivation method truly continue the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle took one of the exam papers and also exited the transport vehicle, driving off in another car.</p><p></p><p>Soon, of the three vehicles that had entered Linji, only this one transport vehicle remained.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Jing'an, are you worried there are spies from other nations in the provincial capital?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling was puzzled. </p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an's arrangements were too complicated, even splitting into two routes to ensure the exam papers could be delivered before the network was restored tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>The field base stations were damaged and could only be repaired during the day due to the many wild beasts roaming at night. </p><p></p><p>Those communications workers wouldn't risk their lives working in the wild at night.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there are many spies within the Dragon Nation, but it doesn't matter. As long as the Dragon Academy drafts a notice to cut off the network to the lands across the great ocean and lock down the coasts, and also shut down the airports, even if those spies learn of the human-divine cultivation method, they won't be able to transmit it across the great ocean!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an thought of history from a thousand years ago. Perhaps this opportunity could allow the Dragon Nation to become the first hegemon of the Blue Planet and truly unify the entire globe!</p><p></p><p>The four other proctors also understood the significance of this matter.</p><p></p><p>If the spies learned of the path of martial arts and transmitted the information across the great ocean, the Dragon Nation's advantage would be lost.</p><p></p><p>With the path of martial arts continued, there would be no change to the situation on the Blue Planet. Martial sages breaking through to the divine immortal realm, martial kings ascending to martial sages - the Blue Planet would remain the same.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Master Jing'an laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha. This old master finally understands!"</p><p></p><p>"This old master finally knows why Linji was locked down for three months!!"</p><p></p><p>It turned out!</p><p></p><p>Linji had already learned of this heaven-defying opportunity and used those three months to digest it.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Linji dared to call itself the ancestral city.  </p><p></p><p>No wonder there were so many powerful martial artists in Linji!!</p><p></p><p>What other opportunities had Linji obtained?</p><p></p><p>Old Master Jing'an looked out the vehicle window and saw in the distant square, many elderly men and women playing music and dancing.</p><p></p><p>But there was something off about their dance moves.</p><p></p><p>Their energy and blood were rising, swirling together like mercury from over a hundred people, forming a massive dragon-elephant creature.  </p><p></p><p>The elderly were practicing the Dragon Elephant Skill in the square!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

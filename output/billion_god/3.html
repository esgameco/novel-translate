        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Class 2 of Grade 3, inside the classroom!</p><p></p><p>Clouds of mist and rosy clouds emerged, a hazy atmosphere was born!</p><p></p><p>This was an extraordinary scene of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Forty-five students practiced the Dragon Elephant Skill together, going through the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill one by one. The forty-five students looked like forty-five giant elephants, walking around in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of crackling sounds kept ringing out, startling the people outside the classroom. </p><p></p><p>However, it was noon now, so the other students did not disturb Class 2 of Grade 3. But when they passed by, they all felt an intense heat.</p><p></p><p>But this was normal.</p><p></p><p>For martial cultivators, their blood and qi were vigorous. There were even videos widely circulated of Blood Martial Saints whose single drop of essence blood could crush an entire building.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing was the class monitor of Class 2 Grade 3. To be able to take on this role, she was most likely the strongest martial cultivator in the class.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing had a tall figure, wearing a long blue robe, with her hair tied up high in a bun with a hairpin. As she practiced the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill, the qi and blood in her body coalesced, vaporizing quite a bit!</p><p></p><p>The dispersed qi and blood intertwined behind her, actually forming a giant blood-red elephant!!!</p><p></p><p>The elephant rampaged wildly, the qi and blood elephant's ripples were three to four times larger than Yang Miaojing's figure, even reaching the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>The elephant uprooted divine mountains!</p><p>The elephant trod the void!</p><p>The elephant pushed divine cities!</p><p>Trampling like an elephant!</p><p>The divine elephant soared!</p><p>The elephant transcended heaven and earth!</p><p>No laws, no elephant!</p><p></p><p>As the eight martial forms unfolded one by one, Yang Miaojing's face flushed red, her entire skin a rosy white, and her long dress was soaked through, accentuating her curves.</p><p></p><p>"Huff——————"</p><p></p><p>She forcefully exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, which condensed into a sharp arrow flying out three feet before dissipating after hitting the wall.</p><p></p><p>A stain was also left on the wall.</p><p></p><p>"My qi has actually become so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing looked at the stain on the wall in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That was the stain from her exhaled turbidity - the sign of a martial cultivator refining their skin!</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing's skin was as smooth as jade, without a single blemish, as if any birthmarks or pigmentation had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Just her jade-like skin alone showed that Yang Miaojing was a true martial cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that I've now broken through the realm of a martial cultivator and become a true martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Martial cultivators refine their skin, martial artists refine their flesh - qi and blood at level 1 was the boundary between the two.</p><p></p><p>To get into university, one's qi and blood had to exceed 1!</p><p></p><p>And in the entire Lijiang area, there were only twenty to thirty people who got into university each year.</p><p></p><p>These twenty to thirty people were the dragons and phoenixes among humans, one picked out of thousands, even one out of ten thousands of talents.</p><p></p><p>Among them, some came from schools, while others were disciples from Lijiang's martial artist clans.</p><p></p><p>Going to school?</p><p></p><p>That was just a path of martial arts opened for the poor.</p><p></p><p>According to Yang Miaojing's previous rate of cultivation, it would take three months for her to possibly break through to qi and blood level 1, but that was only a possibility.</p><p></p><p>But now!!</p><p></p><p>Her qi and blood had definitely exceeded level 1.</p><p></p><p>And this was just from half a day of practicing the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill actually had twenty-two forms in total.</p><p></p><p>Looking at her delicate, fragile skin, Yang Miaojing didn't hesitate to take out a small qi and blood testing device from her desk.</p><p></p><p>"Class monitor, are you going to test your qi and blood?"</p><p></p><p>Forty-four figures immediately surrounded her.</p><p></p><p>The students of Class 2 had all practiced the eight martial forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill, and they clearly felt the changes within themselves.</p><p></p><p>A foul odor wafted out from their bodies, each student expelling impurities, but they didn't care about that now, all eyes on Yang Miaojing.</p><p></p><p>"The martial art passed down by Master Gu is too terrifying. I've only practiced for an afternoon, but I can already feel my strength has increased greatly."</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>"Same here!"</p><p></p><p>"With Master Gu's profound teachings, we might all be able to get into university by practicing the Dragon Elephant Skill in the three months before the exam."</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>The classroom fell silent, the forty-four students all staring at the qi and blood testing device in Yang Miaojing's hand.</p><p></p><p>They held their breath, wanting to verify their speculation. Just by looking at the class monitor's qi and blood level, they would know if it was real or just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood testing device was about the same size as a mobile phone, with an LCD screen on the front and a smooth jade-like back.</p><p></p><p>There was also a protruding button on the back of the testing device. Yang Miaojing gripped it in one hand, then pressed the protruding button.</p><p></p><p>A fine needle shot out, instantly pricking her index finger.</p><p></p><p>A drop of blood was absorbed by the testing device.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing tested her qi and blood with this device every half month. The last test was 0.983. In this half month, according to her usual progress, her qi and blood would probably increase to around 0.985.</p><p></p><p>Under Yang Miaojing's gaze, and that of the whole class, the LCD screen on the qi and blood testing device suddenly lit up, black numbers starting to flash rapidly.</p><p></p><p>0.584!</p><p>0.775! </p><p>0.946!</p><p>0.985!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, her qi and blood level surpassed 0.983. Yang Miaojing's eyes went wide, staring at the LCD screen in disbelief.  </p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>The numbers were jumping too fast. She had been using this qi and blood testing device for almost three years now.</p><p></p><p>It was a gift from her grandfather when she had just entered high school.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the testing device's numbers would start from 0.1 and take a full minute to reach 0.9. But now it had instantly jumped to 0.98!!!</p><p></p><p>The black numbers leapt again, and the surrounding students leaned in closer, surrounding Yang Miaojing without any gaps.</p><p></p><p>"0.989!"</p><p></p><p>"It's 0.989! Heavens, the class monitor's qi and blood increased by 0.05 in just half a month?"</p><p></p><p>"The class monitor might become a martial artist before the exam!"</p><p></p><p>On the path of martial arts, the further one goes, the harder it becomes. Most of the students in Class 2 had qi and blood levels above 0.9, but increasing it by 0.1 was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Even given three to four years, they might still be unable to break through to 1!</p><p></p><p>And once past thirty years old, one's qi and blood would start declining. Martial artist was the most basic realm, with martial cultivators refining their skin, martial artists refining their flesh, and above that were bone refiners!</p><p></p><p>On the high martial planet, everyone practiced martial arts. Only by becoming a martial artist before eighteen did one have a chance to reach the bone refiner realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, the numbers on the qi and blood testing device jumped again."</p><p></p><p>Class 2...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The student's pupils constricted. Could it be that the class monitor's qi and blood testing instrument was broken? </p><p></p><p>Why was it still flickering?</p><p></p><p>0.989!</p><p></p><p>0.991!</p><p></p><p>It broke through 0.99!</p><p></p><p>"Class monitor! Your qi and blood value has broken through 0.99! The class monitors of Class 1, Class 3, and Class 4 have all broken through to 0.99 qi and blood, and now our Class 2 monitor has also broken through to 0.99 qi and blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Class 2 can finally hold our heads up high!"</p><p></p><p>"Class monitor, your qi and blood increase is astonishing."</p><p></p><p>The students surrounding Yang Miaojing danced with joy. At Linji High School, their Class 2 was the only one without any students reaching 0.99 qi and blood. Ordinarily, they were bullied quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Qi and blood of 0.99 and above was also called a quasi-martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Quasi-martial artists also had the possibility of getting into university, but required some special conditions.</p><p></p><p>Such as extraordinary strength, unmatched speed, or nearly perfect scores in cultural courses. Although the conditions were strict, it still gave quasi-martial artists a chance to get into university.</p><p></p><p>While the outer students were still delighted that Yang Miaojing broke through 0.99 qi and blood, the inner circle of students around Yang Miaojing had already fallen silent.</p><p></p><p>On the qi and blood testing instrument, the black numbers kept jumping!</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>0.992!</p><p>0.993!</p><p>0.995!</p><p>0.997!</p><p></p><p>With each jump of the testing instrument, Yang Miaojing's heart trembled along with it.</p><p></p><p>Thump thump!</p><p>Thump thump! </p><p>Thump thump!</p><p></p><p>The numbers on the testing instrument kept flickering until they directly broke through 1!</p><p></p><p>0.998!</p><p>0.999!</p><p>1.02!</p><p></p><p>After one minute, the numbers on the testing instrument stopped jumping and finally froze at 1.02.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it so quiet?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the students surrounding Yang Miaojing so quiet, Ning Que frowned.</p><p></p><p>He was the vice class monitor of Class 2, second only to Yang Miaojing in strength. His qi and blood had also reached 0.98.</p><p></p><p>Ning Que had also cultivated the Eight Forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill passed down by Teacher Gu.</p><p></p><p>A foul smell emanated from Ning Que's body, but he didn't know how much his qi and blood had increased. It probably wouldn't be lower than Yang Miaojing's, right?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, why weren't they saying anything?</p><p></p><p>Arrogant Ning Que stood on the outer edge, waiting for someone to announce Yang Miaojing's qi and blood value.</p><p></p><p>After a few more minutes of silence, Ning Que stuck out his neck and squeezed into the crowd, suddenly seeing the few large black characters on the testing instrument.</p><p></p><p>"1.02!"</p><p></p><p>1.02!</p><p>Martial artist qi and blood!</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing had actually cultivated into a martial artist!</p><p></p><p>A martial artist! Among the students of Linji this year, not a single martial artist had appeared yet.</p><p></p><p>But Yang Miaojing became the first at Linji High School?</p><p></p><p>Ning Que snatched the qi and blood testing instrument that Yang Miaojing had used, reset the qi and blood value to zero, and began testing his own.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Que!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing snapped out of her shock.</p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>She had broken through to become a martial artist too quickly. Just by cultivating the Eight Forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill for one afternoon, she had become a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yang Miaojing finally accepted the fact that she had become a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist before the age of eighteen was considered a dragon among men, with the prospect of becoming a Bone Refining Master.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing's breathing became rapid as she looked at her former rival Ning Que, very curious what his qi and blood value had reached.</p><p></p><p>The black numbers on the qi and blood testing instrument kept jumping.</p><p></p><p>0.589!</p><p>0.784!</p><p>0.887! </p><p>0.953!</p><p>0.983!</p><p>0.995!</p><p></p><p>Ning Que had also broken through the 0.99 qi and blood value!</p><p></p><p>But the black numbers on the qi and blood testing instrument were still rapidly flickering.</p><p></p><p>0.997!</p><p>0.998! </p><p>0.999!</p><p>1!!</p><p></p><p>The first digit on the testing instrument jumped again.</p><p></p><p>1.01!!</p><p></p><p>"Ning Que also became a martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing looked at the dazed Ning Que, who clearly could not believe he had also become a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>They had only cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill for half a day before both becoming martial artists!</p><p></p><p>It should be known!</p><p></p><p>They had started practicing martial arts from a young age. At seven years old they entered elementary school, then six years later went to middle school, and three years after that were admitted to high school.</p><p></p><p>During that time, they would enter martial arts schools for supplementary lessons, or even follow martial artists into the wilderness to train.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of all those years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The achievement from cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill for just half a day exceeded so many years of practice.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill! The Dragon and Elephant Skill!"</p><p></p><p>The students of Class 2 finally realized the terror of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The other students returned to their seats, took out the qi and blood testing instruments from their desks, and tested their own qi and blood values one by one.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire classroom resounded with the students' exclamations.</p><p></p><p>Their qi and blood had all increased tremendously!</p><p></p><p>Of the 45 students in Class 2, in addition to Yang Miaojing and Ning Que breaking through to martial artist level, the other 43 students had all broken through to 0.99 qi and blood - every single one was a quasi-martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill passed down by Teacher Gu is too terrifying. Today in the self-study session, we only used half a day and achieved such great results."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about Teacher Gu?"</p><p></p><p>They could not imagine that this young and handsome Teacher Gu who came from the imperial capital was a Bone Refining Master?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps even a Tendon Refining Grand Master?</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu truly lives up to being a genius from the imperial capital."</p><p></p><p>The classroom was a bit dark as the sun had already set. Students from the other classes had already left, with only the students of Class 2 remaining in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu asked us to write an 800-word reflection on the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Why don't we just go home early? We still have Teacher Gu's class tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Right, let's go home first and ask Teacher Gu tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Gu passed down such a terrifying martial art. Was he preparing for all the students of their Class 2 to get into university?</p><p></p><p>They didn't know Teacher Gu's intentions and could only wait to ask him tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the students in the classroom had all left. The entire campus fell into darkness, with only a few lights still on in the self-study room.</p><p></p><p>This was the first day that Gu Jiuqing passed down the Dragon and Elephant Skill!</p><p></p><p>The new book has set sail, begging for rating votes, monthly tickets, and rewards to support it!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

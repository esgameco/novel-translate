        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Mingtingfeng, the only palace within.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the ice coffins were overturned, revealing the corpses of demons and monsters. </p><p></p><p>Without the suppression of the ice coffins, the demon corpses began to decay in a short while, and their demonic aura was dispersed within the palace.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the demonic aura leaked out from the palace and spread over Mingtingfeng.</p><p></p><p>However, Mingtingfeng had a sword furnace, and the sword intent exhaled by the furnace extinguished the demonic aura by itself.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, just the demonic aura emanating from the palace would demonize the human race, causing them to become demons and evil spirits!</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Wheel! Forge the Xuanhuang Wheel with the Xuanhuang qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Xuanhuang divine body? I remember there was a demon who cultivated into the Xuanhuang divine body, why can't I find this demon's corpse?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's hair was disheveled, and his clothes were in disarray. He searched among the ice coffins, looking for the demon corpse with the Xuanhuang divine body.</p><p></p><p>On a high platform, five spirit communication fruits were dim and could extinguish at any moment. </p><p></p><p>Below these five spirit seeds lay several demon corpses sealed in icy sword intent.</p><p></p><p>There were three demon corpses in total.</p><p></p><p>The demon corpse with the Four Symbols divine body, the demon corpse with the Yin-Yang divine body, and the demon corpse with the Five Elements divine body.</p><p></p><p>"Found it!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao held up a demon corpse, and the five fingers on his hand bloomed, emanating the great Five Elements sword aura. He separated the demon's spine on the spot.</p><p></p><p>On the thirty-four vertebrae of the spine, eighteen vertebrae were covered in Xuanhuang qi!</p><p></p><p>He revealed a manic expression and forcibly plucked those eighteen vertebrae, then struck them into his own Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a Xuanhuang-colored divine wheel gathered above his head.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I can condense the Xuanhuang Divine Wheel using the Xuanhuang divine body's origin."</p><p></p><p>Following the same method, he struck the remaining three demons' divine body origins into Buzhou Mountain, using them to activate the Four Symbols Divine Wheel, the Five Elements Divine Wheel, and the Yin-Yang Divine Wheel.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it takes to burn an incense stick, four great divine wheels appeared above Senior Brother Liang Xiao's head!</p><p></p><p>Only the final Taiyi Divine Wheel was missing to form the Demonic Emperor's Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel!</p><p></p><p>"The spirit communication seeds contain spiritual power. If I can directly transplant these spirit seeds and plant them on my Buzhou Mountain..."</p><p></p><p>This was a bold idea!</p><p></p><p>"Kaka kaka ——————"</p><p>"Kaka kaka ——————————" </p><p></p><p>The sound of shattering came from within the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao was still studying the Demonic Prince's spirit communication seeds, head bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Kaka!"</p><p></p><p>A few more sounds came.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Senior Brother Liang Xiao turn around, slapping his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot, my junior brother is still in the cave dwelling."</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power flowed out from his body, forming arms that hid the rotten demon corpses into millennium ice coffins and wiped away the demonic aura within the cave dwelling. Only then did Senior Brother Liang Xiao descend from the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Divine light rippled around his body, and after a few breaths, Senior Brother Liang Xiao regained his handsome appearance, his face exceptionally ruddy.</p><p></p><p>He stood beneath the cocoon, quietly waiting for Gu Jiuqing's rebirth from the pupal stage.</p><p></p><p>Kaka kaka!</p><p></p><p>The cocoon cracked, and the shredded blood-red silk slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cocoon encasing Gu Jiuqing tore apart and vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations junior brother, blessings junior brother, you have successfully shed your mortal form!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao raised his hands in celebration of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>But his hands froze midair, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>His junior brother's aura was off!</p><p></p><p>Why was it exactly the same as before?</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how many times have you shed your mortal form after refining the Demonic Emperor's true blood?"</p><p></p><p>He had just probed Gu Jiuqing's aura with his divine sense but received only blankness!</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing had not just joined the sect, he would have suspected that Gu Jiuqing had already cultivated a divine body!</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators at the Buzhou realm who had formed a divine body could suppress their anomalies and present an aura like an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched his limbs. After staying on the Blue Star for three days and waiting for several more, the cocoon enveloping him had finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was startled, oh right, he had forgotten to manifest the aura of shedding his mortal form!</p><p></p><p>"I have just completed the eighth shedding of my mortal form!"</p><p></p><p>"This Demonic Emperor's true blood seed allowed junior brother to consecutively shed three times, truly being reborn anew."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao nodded, just as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>He looked around Gu Jiuqing, where was the shed body?</p><p></p><p>It seemed the shed body had disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>A shed body was just a large skin that would break apart under external force, so its disappearance did not make Liang Xiao suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, eight sheddings of the mortal form, discarding the shed body, junior brother, with your current foundation, you can open the Heavenly Mechanism and enter the Realm of Spiritual Power!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stared at Gu Jiuqing with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted Gu Jiuqing to grow quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Jiuqing felt troubled.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew his own situation.</p><p></p><p>His biggest problem now was that the draconic and elephantine power within him was too immense, and his sword intent too dazzling. If he added spiritual power on top of that?</p><p></p><p>His physical body could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>The physical body was the boat, the soul was the sail, and the sailboat drifted freely in the vast mortal world.</p><p></p><p>But to traverse this mortal world, one needed spiritual power to propel the sail!</p><p></p><p>This was the normal way to ferry sentient beings across.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Jiuqing, however, it was completely different.</p><p></p><p>His "boat" was at the Shedding Mortal Form realm. Although it had undergone ten sheddings and was extremely sturdy, able to easily bear the spiritual power of the Realm of Spiritual Power, or even the spiritual power of the Buzhou realm, dozens of draconic and elephantine powers, or one part sword intent or two parts.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's physical body bore too many things. Sailing on the bitter sea, it would capsize directly.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred draconic and elephantine powers, five parts sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If he were to start cultivating divine powers, it would leak the heavenly secrets to the Blue Planet. </p><p></p><p>There's no need for 4 billion people on the Blue Planet to cultivate divine powers. Just 800,000 people cultivating divine powers in Linjiang City would be enough to overwhelm his ships and collapse his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao noticed Gu Jiuqing's concerns and laughed heartily. </p><p></p><p>"Is the Junior Martial Brother worried that his foundation is unstable?"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, since you're my junior martial brother, how could I undermine your foundation?"</p><p></p><p>He said mysteriously, "Over the years, I've made considerable progress in studying various divine bodies. It won't take a hundred years, at most fifty years, and I'll be able to cultivate from the Posterior Realm to the Prior Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>What does that mean?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled. What is the Prior Realm and what is the Posterior Realm? </p><p></p><p>Why is there a division between the Prior and Posterior Realms?</p><p></p><p>"So, Junior Martial Brother, you can rest assured and boldly leak the heavenly secrets. With the resources of our Mingting Peak lineage, it will take only three months to help you reach the Perfected Divine Power Realm, three years to complete the Unrestrained Realm, and with my help, it won't be a problem for you to open the Divine Apertures of the Myriad Heavens within ten years!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao had already prepared everything for Gu Jiuqing, just waiting for his agreement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, "The Junior Martial Brother's concern is not about this, but about my own issue."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's physical body suddenly trembled, and the forces of dozens of dragons and elephants swirled above his head!</p><p></p><p>Those were the forms of dozens of dragons and elephants, densely packed, manifesting as many as thirty.</p><p></p><p>"For some reason, after I transcended mortality through the Dragon Elephant Skill, my physical body has shown abnormalities. My blood has turned into a golden color, and there seem to be images of dragons and elephants in my bloodline."  </p><p></p><p>"And accompanying this are the forces of these dragons and elephants."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not directly display the five hundred dragon and elephant forces, but instead revealed thirty of them first.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's pupils constricted as his eyes widened, revealing a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had seen some delicacy, an unmatched beauty in the world.</p><p></p><p>Like a ravenous demon feasting, he leaned towards Gu Jiuqing's face, scrutinizing carefully.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder your aura is almost non-existent, it turns out the dragon and elephant forces were suppressing your physical body."</p><p></p><p>"Suppressing the physical body, doesn't that mean your Unrestrained Mountain has already formed!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao looked Gu Jiuqing up and down, his eyes full of regret.</p><p></p><p>Can't take action!</p><p></p><p>This is my junior martial brother!!</p><p></p><p>Really want to slice the junior martial brother into pieces for a thorough study.</p><p></p><p>No, our Mingting Peak lineage has finally produced a true inheritor, I can't let him die by my hand.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt a chill as Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao stared at him intensely, his body hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, you are attuned to the Dragon Elephant Skill, your bloodline has changed, evolving into a Dragon Elephant Divine Body with dragons and elephants as your bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>"This self-formed divine body, it's the first time I've seen it."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao sighed repeatedly, and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing mustered his courage and asked in a low voice, </p><p></p><p>"Does the Elder Martial Brother have a way to rapidly increase the speed of my physical body's cultivation, so it can bear the dragon and elephant forces, as well as the sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent? How much sword intent have you comprehended? Your physical body can't even bear your sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>A faint ray of light rose in the cave, and the Heavenly Demolishing Sword Intent condensed in Gu Jiuqing's palm.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the ascension of this strand of sword intent, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Three Portions of Sword Intent!"</p><p></p><p>"You're a freak, aren't you? Transcending mortality eight times, condensing thirty dragon and elephant forces, comprehending three portions of sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, why don't you become my master, and I'll be your disciple. After our master passes away, you'll be the peak master of the Mingting Peak lineage and inherit the rights of the Supreme Elder."</p><p></p><p>"Just let me take one strike at you now, just one strike, and I guarantee this strike won't harm your life!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's hands were trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>His left hand flowed with the Five Phase Sword Intent, transforming into Five Phase Sword Qi.  </p><p></p><p>His right hand was dominated by the Great Mingting Sword Intent, supplemented by Glacial Sword Intent, with Blazing Sun Sword Intent, Raging Wind Sword Intent, and Void Sword Intent intertwined!</p><p></p><p>His ten fingers represented ten types of sword intent, each above the five-portion level!</p><p></p><p>"The Elder Martial Brother jests!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took a step back, the current Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao looked rather frightening.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense his own loss of composure, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao quickly withdrew the ten sword intents, forcibly suppressing the thoughts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Junior Martial Brother, don't worry, I just lost my bearings for a moment."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Jiuqing's physical body, feigning calmness.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, you're worried that after opening your divine powers, your physical body won't be able to bear your dragon and elephant bloodline, sword intent, and divine powers, right?"</p><p></p><p>"This is actually simple, you can seal your divine powers, dragon and elephant forces, and sword intent within your physical body, then unseal them when needed."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this requires control of the degree. With your thirty dragon and elephant forces, your physical body should be able to use them for a few breaths before resealing them!"</p><p></p><p>Seal his power?</p><p></p><p>Seal his sword intent?  </p><p></p><p>Seal his divine powers?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>"If you're not satisfied with this method, you can accelerate your cultivation to the Unrestrained Realm, using your own divine body to suppress your physical body. If your divine body can't suppress it, then you can borrow the power of divine weapons to suppress your physical body!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao emanated numerous divine halos from his body.</p><p></p><p>He appeared like a deity, surrounded by myriad heavenly halos.</p><p></p><p>Within each divine halo was a divine weapon suppressing his power!</p><p></p><p>His strength, his divine powers, had far surpassed the Heavenly Palace Realm, requiring divine weapons to suppress the Divine Apertures of the Myriad Heavens, preventing his physical body from collapsing!</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Elder Martial Brother could slay experts of the Tribulation Realm while in the Heavenly Palace Realm!</p><p></p><p>This single section has almost reached 3,000 words, and there's still more to come.</p><p></p><p>The crazy Liang Xiao, the freak Gu Jiuqing, a powerful duo! It will definitely be exciting.</p><p></p><p>Ahem, seeking the esteemed readers' generous support.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

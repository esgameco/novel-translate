        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After coming out of Senior Martial Brother's cave abode, Gu Jiuqing stepped into the void and entered the Heavenly Sword Palace. </p><p></p><p>The formations on the True Transmission Island automatically dissipated, and Gu Jiuqing fell into the Heavenly Sword Palace along with it.</p><p></p><p>He had just stood up straight when Lu Yuan's voice rang out from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Senior Martial Brother, felicitations Senior Martial Brother, you have attained the Realm of Law!"</p><p></p><p>This voice was filled with excitement. </p><p></p><p>It seemed even more excited than when he himself broke through the boundary of realms, by three parts.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Lu, have you been waiting outside the Heavenly Sword Palace for a long time?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan shook his head, "Not long, not long, this junior brother also just arrived outside the Heavenly Sword Palace."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked deeply at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This junior martial brother was truly good at dealing with people!</p><p></p><p>Conversing with him would not cause the slightest dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the disciples of the Artifact Peak have finished repairing the Heavenly Sword Palace. I also made a suggestion to the Artifact Peak to reinforce your Spirit Technique Cultivation Room."  </p><p></p><p>"I specifically instructed them to forge the Spirit Technique Cultivation Room using Celestial Refined Iron, so that Senior Brother can use it with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>Celestial Refined Iron?</p><p></p><p>That was a divine material used to forge divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Yuan was a disciple of the Artifact Peak, he did not have such great resources.</p><p></p><p>Such a material was extremely valuable!</p><p></p><p>As a mere inner sect disciple, where did he get the authority or financial resources?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded, and Lu Yuan's heart rejoiced. He took out three jade talismans.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, these contain the formulas for the Blood Refining Pill, the Meridian Pill, and the Leaving Divinity Powder."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Lu Yuan also took out many jade slips.</p><p></p><p>The number of these jade slips was nearly thirty!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, these jade slips record thirty kinds of Body Cultivation Methods. Please forgive me!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan showed a look of apology on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This junior brother mobilized the power of our family and found eighteen Body Cultivation Methods in the northern lands. I also exchanged twelve Body Cultivation Methods using contribution points in our sect."</p><p></p><p>Thirty Body Cultivation Methods had almost depleted the Lu Family!</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods could not simply be bought with money. Those families were unwilling to part with their Body Cultivation Methods, so the Lu Family had no choice!</p><p></p><p>"Thirty Cultivation Methods?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not expect that Lu Yuan could obtain thirty Body Cultivation Methods.</p><p></p><p>This number was already quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well. Follow me into the Heavenly Sword Palace."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was holding things in both hands. Although he could also wield his powers to manifest spirit arms, Lu Yuan was very thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>He also planned to cultivate Lu Yuan as a trusted aide!</p><p></p><p>The gates opened!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan followed Gu Jiuqing into the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did not look around but followed behind Gu Jiuqing. Soon, the two arrived at the Spirit Technique Cultivation Room.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing set down the Supreme Spirit Technique Manual and two ancient teleportation formations, and only then did he carefully examine this Cultivation Room.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Spirit Technique Cultivation Room was completely different from before!</p><p></p><p>Starlight!</p><p></p><p>Rays of starlight illuminated the inside of the Cultivation Room, making the entire room bright while also evoking a profound sense of the starry cosmos manifesting within the chamber.</p><p></p><p>This allowed cultivators of celestial spirit techniques to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p><p></p><p>Most eye-catching were the starry patterns that seemed to pulse like the veins of the stars, similar to the patterns on divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hurriedly explained, "This Cultivation Room was personally worked on by the Peak Master of the Artifact Peak, using Celestial Refined Iron as the material to refine it into a divine weapon. If Senior Brother nurtures it with his powers for a thousand years, it can become a thousand-pattern divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>To use a divine weapon as a Cultivation Room was truly a grand undertaking.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing extended a finger and tapped it against the wall.</p><p></p><p>The wall did not budge at all!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing applied a bit more force, but the wall remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>One breath, two breaths...</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing exerted the force of a thousand dragons and elephants, the wall slightly deformed.</p><p></p><p>When he used the force of two thousand dragons and elephants, his fingertip instantly pierced through the wall!</p><p></p><p>Ssshhh———</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gasped in astonishment.  </p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother could even pierce through a divine weapon??</p><p></p><p>This physical body...</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have underestimated Senior Martial Brother!</p><p></p><p>He had embellished Senior Martial Brother's deeds when spreading them in the sect, but he never imagined that Senior Martial Brother's true abilities were many times stronger than what he had exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gave his praise. With such a sturdy Cultivation Room, he should be able to use it for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Set the things down."  </p><p></p><p>The thirty jade slips and three jade talismans were placed beside the Supreme Spirit Technique Manual.</p><p></p><p>"This junior will not disturb Senior Brother's cultivation any further and take my leave."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, stay a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing extended his hand, holding a peach pit.</p><p></p><p>A peach pit?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan also noticed the peach pit in Gu Jiuqing's hand. This peach pit had intricate patterns covering it like stars, yet it lacked any spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>It just looked like an oddly patterned peach pit.</p><p></p><p>"This is the pit of an ancient immortal peach. If you have the skill, plant this immortal pit on the island."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing tossed the peach pit to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This peach pit, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He was carrying it on him, but only just remembered it now. </p><p></p><p>This was a seed from the peach trees of the ancient Heavenly Court. If he could grow a peach tree from it, just this feat alone would allow Lu Yuan to soar to great heights.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan took the peach seed and solemnly stored it in his robe.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Senior Martial Brother!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked through the Compendium of Divine Powers for a while, then took out three jade talismans and confirmed they contained pill formulas. </p><p></p><p>He then looked toward the jade slips recording the cultivation methods for various divine powers.</p><p></p><p>These jade slips were precious. Gu Jiuqing pressed his forehead against the jade slips, and line after line of text appeared in his mind's eye.</p><p></p><p>[Solar Divine Body] This was the Mount Buzhou cultivation method of the Lu Family!</p><p></p><p>[Wind Spirit Divine Body] [Fire Spirit Divine Body] [Earth Spirit Divine Body] [Golden Toad Divine Body] [Lunar Rabbit Divine Body] [Blazing Dragon Divine Body] [Wood Divine Body] [Metal Divine Body] [True Dragon Divine Body] [Celestial Elephant Divine Body] [Phoenix Divine Body] [Mountain River Divine Body] [Thunderbolt Divine Body] [Undying Aura Body]...</p><p></p><p>Thirty different types of divine bodies manifested one by one in Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, this is excellent! With so many divine body cultivation methods, I can verify on Planet Blue whether the methods of Pangu can be practiced!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing beamed with delight. </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had really helped him tremendously.</p><p></p><p>After memorizing all the divine body cultivation methods, Gu Jiuqing finally opened the Compendium of Divine Powers.</p><p></p><p>This was a priceless treasure, the result of his senior martial brother's research in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened the Compendium, Gu Jiuqing saw the preface recorded on the opening pages:</p><p></p><p>"The methods of divine powers are techniques derived by manipulating the rules of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"The strength of divine powers is simply a matter of borrowing the forces of Heaven and Earth and utilizing their rules."</p><p></p><p>"I have divided divine powers into five grades. The first grade is the Peerless Divine Power, the second is the Great Divine Power, the third is the Superior Divine Power, the fourth is the Intermediate Divine Power, and the fifth is the Lesser Divine Power."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze lingered on the Peerless Divine Powers. The pages flipped automatically to the section listing the Peerless Divine Powers.</p><p></p><p>The Compendium recorded eight Peerless Divine Powers:</p><p></p><p>[The Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Realms] Originating from the Demon Lord, formed by fusing the Yin-Yang Wheel, Five Phases Wheel, Supreme Unity Wheel, Four Symbols Wheel, Mystic Yellow Wheel, and the Five Great Divine Wheels. Its power was unimaginably vast.</p><p></p><p>[The Imperishable True Qi of the Great Celestial Void] From the Perfected Lord of the Celestial Void, this divine power gathered imperishable true qi to condense celestial realms, transforming into a profound celestial void and shooting out true qi capable of piercing through Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Perfected Lord of the Celestial Void? Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled. This Perfected Lord must have been slain by his senior martial brother to obtain the cultivation method for this Imperishable True Qi divine power.</p><p></p><p>The third Peerless Divine Power was [The Profound Celestial Finger of Creation]</p><p></p><p>In ancient times there was a Profound Celestial realm above the azure Heavens. With just a finger, it could obliterate the celestial canopy - this was the Profound Celestial Finger of Creation.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Celestial!</p><p></p><p>That must refer to an ancient Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Celestial Emperor! The 17th Celestial Emperor of antiquity who shattered the Celestial Court of the Radiant Emperor. This scene was witnessed by the world, and through constant research and creation, the Profound Celestial Finger of Creation divine power was born.</p><p></p><p>The fourth Peerless Divine Power was the Infinite Life-Giving Hand Seal. The fifth was the Pagoda of All Beings in Heaven and Earth. The sixth was the Seven Demonic Killing Strikes!</p><p></p><p>The seventh was the Buddhist Realm in the Palm. </p><p></p><p>The eighth was the Four Symbolic Fingers of the Four Celestial Manifestations!</p><p></p><p>These eight Peerless Divine Powers were tremendously powerful. Gu Jiuqing committed them to memory and secretly cultivated them, but made no progress.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate these eight Peerless Divine Powers would not be achieved in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not hesitate, directly opening the section on Lesser Divine Powers.</p><p></p><p>"In transmitting my teachings to Planet Blue, I rely on the foundations of the people there. The grade of divine power does not matter, only the difficulty of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The simpler the divine power, the better it aligned with Gu Jiuqing's standards for transmission.</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Divine Powers were Gu Jiuqing's choice!</p><p></p><p>The pages flipped automatically to the section on Lunar Divine Powers, listing various lunar divine powers.</p><p></p><p>[The Moon-Grasping Divine Hand] Gather lunar essence to condense a divine hand.</p><p></p><p>Simple!</p><p></p><p>Very simple!</p><p></p><p>One only needed to gather lunar essence to cultivate the Moon-Grasping Divine Hand!</p><p></p><p>This divine power could be transmitted to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>[The Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade] Condense lunar essence into a demon-slaying blade.  </p><p></p><p>This was a divine power of the Gu Family, also recorded by Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao in the Compendium.</p><p></p><p>[The Primordial Lunar Tree] Visualize a primordial lunar tree, creating a lunar tree to wield and unleash the power of lunar tides.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, lunar tides would erupt periodically, the lunar essence raging and sweeping across the stars.</p><p></p><p>Even celestial cultivators would be killed in such eruptions!</p><p></p><p>This divine power emulated the lunar tides!</p><p></p><p>"These three divine powers can all be transmitted to Planet Blue!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing continued searching for simple, easy-to-cultivate divine powers. Time trickled by.</p><p></p><p>Three hours later, Gu Jiuqing finally put down the Compendium.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient teleportation array, lunar divine powers, pill formulas, divine body cultivation methods - I have prepared everything!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his body instantly appeared on Planet Blue in Jingyang Community of Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

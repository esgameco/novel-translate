        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Madman!</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, there was a cultivator who was praised as a madman by demons and monsters. </p><p></p><p>This madman began nine hundred years ago, constantly entering and exiting the Great Wilderness, hunting and killing demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>In this era, demons and monsters were a great calamity for the human race. There were countless demon caves with millions of demon armies stationed, and within each demon cave was a supreme demon monarch.</p><p></p><p>And this madman was truly formidable. He traveled while masked, entering and exiting the Great Wilderness, hunting and slaying demons and monsters. </p><p></p><p>Not only did he hunt and kill demons and monsters, but in the places the human madman passed through, decomposing demon remains could occasionally be seen.</p><p></p><p>Three to four hundred years ago, the decomposing demon remains turned into sliced demon corpses.</p><p></p><p>Their dantians, heavenly spirit apertures, celestial platforms, celestial palaces, primordial spirits were all sliced into pieces. Their origins did not disappear but were solidified together, simply discarded in the desolate mountains and valleys of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>It would be one thing if it was just a single demon corpse, but there were dozens or even hundreds of them!</p><p></p><p>Every time this madman entered the Great Wilderness, hundreds of demons would be sliced up, and some demons would be taken away.</p><p></p><p>The demons set up defenses to block the human madman, but all ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>Later, the demon patriarchs at the catastrophe realm took action.</p><p></p><p>The first time, the human madman was defeated and fled in disorder back to the Sword Gate Pass. </p><p></p><p>Decades later, when the human madman re-entered the Great Wilderness, that catastrophe realm demon patriarch was sliced up, shaking the demons of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred years later, four catastrophe realm demon patriarchs joined forces to surround and kill the human madman, but this madman still managed to escape. In that perilous moment, the human madman injured two catastrophe realm demon patriarchs, took away one at the catastrophe realm, and killed one catastrophe realm demon on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Such power shook the demon sovereigns, and demon sovereigns, true lords, and supreme lords all showed signs of alarm.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, the human madman remained quiet for over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The most recent time was when the seventh son of the demon sovereign was taken away by the human madman, who also killed the protector deities of the seventh demon prince on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The human madman!</p><p></p><p>His name struck more fear in low-level demons than even the four great patriarchs of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Demon after demon retreated, looking at the white-robed cultivator standing before them with constantly flickering gazes.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that madman, he favors white robes. Madman, white robe, that must be him!"</p><p></p><p>Some demons cried out in horror, their auras undulating unceasingly, disrupting the void.</p><p></p><p>"Great Prince, please open the heavenly realm in this madman's palm!"</p><p></p><p>A demon at the celestial palace realm stood beside the great demon prince, pointing at the heavenly realm in Gu Jiuqing's hand.</p><p></p><p>"That madman comes from the Sword Gate Pass, an inheritor of the true sword teachings. The sword techniques of his lineage from the Namingtingfeng Peak are the great Namingtingjian sword aura."</p><p></p><p>The 22 zhang tall celestial palace demon's true form wavered, his eyes unable to conceal his panicked look.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth glanced back at him, and the demon hastily averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>The closest demon cave to the Sword Gate Pass belonged to the demon sovereign's clan.  </p><p></p><p>They had fought the Sword Gate for thousands of years and were well-acquainted with it.</p><p></p><p>They had even glimpsed the profound intent of the great Namingtingjian sword aura, which condensed the meaning of the ancient heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>"The white-robed youth's appearance, the madman, the heavenly realm - this person must be that human madman."</p><p></p><p>The 22 zhang celestial palace demon's true form shrank, standing at the feet of the great demon prince like a huge crouching meatball.</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince's gaze remained fixed on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This was also his first time dealing with this human madman.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth's aura was suppressed by the Incomplete Mountain, making it impossible to discern. But his physical body seemed quite formidable, able to move through the air without the slightest leakage of physical power, with excellent spiritual control.</p><p></p><p>And that heavenly realm!</p><p></p><p>Just a glance was enough for the great demon prince to be captivated by the mythical heavenly realm. This ancient heavenly realm was too exquisite.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly realm was illusory, the three realms illusory!</p><p></p><p>Thirty-three layered heavens pressed down above the heavenly realm, the Milky Way blocked the human realm and Great Wilderness below, with the stars of the celestial realm hanging upside down, and the terrifying six realms of reincarnation swirling beneath the Great Wilderness. The profound meaning of those six realms of reincarnation made the great demon prince's eyelids twitch.</p><p></p><p>Celestial palaces dotted the realm, inhabited by immortals. Below were the four great continents dividing the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the four great sects dividing the great zhou dynasty, or the meaning of dividing the Great Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince stared at the white-robed figure, asking the eight zhang tall demon holding up the female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that person?"</p><p></p><p>As the great demon prince's voice fell, the female cultivator became alarmed.</p><p></p><p>She had already recognized this white-robed cultivator's identity.</p><p></p><p>It was Senior Brother Gu!!</p><p></p><p>Her senior martial brother who joined the Sword Gate in the same period as her.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou looked flustered, completely unaware of what Gu Jiuqing was doing.</p><p></p><p>That was the demon army, with a demon prince stationed there. She had personally witnessed Qingyang Bai's head being flicked off by the great demon prince, still hanging on the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>When Senior Brother Lieyang tried to take the Moon Ship away under the spirit banner, the great demon prince sealed off heaven and earth, even extinguishing a thunderbolt strike from the ancient thunder pool with a single palm!</p><p></p><p>For Senior Brother to so brazenly appear before the demon army, wasn't he seeking his own death?!</p><p></p><p>A madman!</p><p></p><p>Had Senior Brother gone mad?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou was a disciple of the Xia Family, considered quite intelligent. After a few contemplations, she realized Gu Jiuqing would not act so recklessly.</p><p></p><p>The first breath passed, but Xia Qingzhou did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Prince asked you a question, so answer!" </p><p></p><p>The eight zhang demon reached out and tore off Xia Qingzhou's arm.</p><p></p><p>With a ripping sound, fresh blood dripped down as her entire arm was severed.</p><p></p><p>The pain struck her heart, but Xia Qingzhou remained silent!</p><p></p><p>She looked at the white-robed figure, hearing the shocked cries of the demon army, and coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"Who else could it be?"</p><p></p><p>"He is that madman from Namingtingfeng Peak!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou did not speak, but Gu Jiuqing was indeed from Namingtingfeng Peak, and his current actions were those of a madman.</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince withdrew his gaze. This female cultivator did not lie.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth before him was indeed the human madman.</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince's figure stirred, his aura swelling as demon qi billowed forth from his body like clouds, condensing into his true demon form below the waist.</p><p></p><p>It was an eight-armed, 28 zhang tall demon, far larger than the eight zhang true form of the eighth demon prince, emanating boundless demon qi.</p><p></p><p>"I have heard much of your exploits in the Great Wilderness. Today I finally meet you in person."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a hundred praises cannot match a single glimpse. You truly possess unmatched elegance, worthy of being my opponent."</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince!</p><p></p><p>He gave the white-robed youth sufficient respect.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth stepped forward, glancing back at the great demon prince!</p><p></p><p>This look was quite particular!</p><p></p><p>First he looked at the great demon prince's true form - the majestic 28 zhang eight-armed demon body emanating boundless demon qi.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at his dantian! Observing it with the naked eye!</p><p></p><p>Next he looked at the great demon prince's Incomplete Mountain, followed by the celestial platform formed from his 34th vertebra, and finally at the great demon prince's head!</p><p></p><p>Only after examining this head did the white-robed youth meet the great demon prince's gaze.</p><p></p><p>This guy!</p><p></p><p>He's putting immense pressure on me.</p><p></p><p>This examination made the great demon prince feel like he was about to be sliced up by this madman.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth said nothing. After appraising the great demon prince, he carried the heavenly realm and step-by-step walked to the entrance of the Moon Ship.</p><p></p><p>On the Moon Ship, figures were covered by boundless lightning drawn from the ancient thunder pool!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calmly looked at the closed entrance, then towards the sword immortal under the spirit banner.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? You don't dare face me now?"</p><p></p><p>Lieyang Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>A sword pill flew over his head, and in his hand was a nine-sectioned sword that had come apart, only the two sections of the hilt remaining!</p><p></p><p>This divine weapon had cultivated over three hundred sword traces, but was damaged in this great battle.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Jiuqing in alarm, unsure of what to do.</p><p></p><p>"It's the one from Namingtingfeng Peak!"</p><p></p><p>On the deck, only seven or eight Sword Gate disciples remained alive. Two sword cultivators cried out in unison upon seeing the white-robed youth below the Moon Ship.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie and Gao Shuli looked at the gracefully white-robed youth with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the sword dao's paramount figure that Luryuan had spoken of?</p><p></p><p>Yet he ignored the demon army, ignored the great demon prince, and simply walked right up to the Moon Ship?</p><p></p><p>And that great demon prince?</p><p></p><p>He just watched??</p><p></p><p>It was all too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>Everything about this was inexplicably strange.</p><p></p><p>Lieyang Sword Immortal offered up an ancient spirit symbol, and the Moon Ship's entrance opened in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure entered the Moon Ship.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the white-robed youth boarded that Gu Jiuqing realized his back was already drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Lieyang was about to ask Gu Jiuqing something as he descended from the spirit banner.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the cabin first, this place is unsuitable for discussion."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Sword Gate disciples all closed their mouths and followed Gu Jiuqing into the cabin.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Moon Ship, the great demon prince watched the departing Sword Gate disciples and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the human madman has given these Sword Gate disciples a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>The two celestial palace demons beside him remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The madman was inside, who dared make a sound?</p><p></p><p>He turned to the eight zhang great demon, "Where is the Eighth Prince? Why hasn't he come to see me yet?"</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>The great demon was at a loss, when suddenly a demon flew in from the sky, crying out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"The Eighth Prince has been killed by a human!"</p><p></p><p>"And the human even took the Eighth Prince's remains."</p><p></p><p>The great demon prince's figure wavered, the demon qi below his waist churning chaotically.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buyu! Well done Jiang Buyu, you really think being a descendant of Jiang Xingyu allows you to kill two princes of my demon clan?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xingyu! The name of the Sword Gate's patriarch.  </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu was the personal name of the Sword Gate patriarch's son.</p><p></p><p>Xing the clouds and raining down - the Sword Gate's inherited legacy!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Moon Ship's cabin.</p><p></p><p>The last time he entered this cabin, the Three Sword Immortals were present. But today, only Lieyang Sword Immortal remained.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiu...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Let me put it bluntly, 'I'm impersonating Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao!'"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao? </p><p></p><p>That madman from Mingtingfeng?</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized!</p><p></p><p>No wonder when Gu Jiuqing appeared, he claimed to be a madman!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's name carries immense prestige among the demonic cultivators of the Wasteland. When those demons see that I'm Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, they definitely won't dare to make a move."</p><p></p><p>"But if we wait a few more days, the demons will start to doubt my true identity. At that time, they will take the initiative to attack!"</p><p></p><p>"If I don't take action then, I'll definitely be exposed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice sounded muffled. </p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the cabin was heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Lieyang, do you have a plan to deal with this?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang was first startled, then delighted.</p><p></p><p>He had been refining ancient thunder talismans, channeling the essence of thunder and lightning to protect the Moon Spirit Ship for many days. But he could only sustain it for one more day before the essence was depleted.</p><p></p><p>"I need three days to activate the Moon Spirit Ship!"</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang was half worried, half pleased. "The Demon Prince is the strongest person I've ever encountered in my life."</p><p></p><p>His face was full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"I used ancient thunder talismans to refine the Moon Spirit Ship, unleashing a mighty strike. Even celestial immortals at the Jie boundary would need to avoid it. But he withstood it barehanded without the slightest damage."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, it was the Moon Spirit Ship that was damaged. The divine talisman needs the full moonlight to repair itself. In three days, the talisman can be restored, but the thunder pool lacks power. We've already exhausted all our spirit stones in the thunder pool!"</p><p></p><p>"We still lack thirty thousand spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>The ancient thunder pool protects the Moon Spirit Ship. The Demon Prince could have shattered it with his bare hands, but he didn't!</p><p></p><p>He was still waiting for more Sword Sect disciples to arrive so he could wipe out the entire Zhu Yue Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out his qiankun bag, which contained forty-eight thousand spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He handed the qiankun bag to Sword Immortal Lieyang.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit stones in the qiankun bag are enough to fill the power shortage in the thunder pool."</p><p></p><p>With the divine talisman and thunder pool power resolved. </p><p></p><p>But it would take three days!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked out the window towards the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Out there, the demon army was massed, and the Demon Prince was staring at the Moon Spirit Ship.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Lieyang, there is a demon sealing formation here. I was able to enter without obstruction, but if I try to fly out, I will definitely be blocked."</p><p></p><p>"To leave the moon, we still need to break through this sealing formation."</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang's delight vanished, leaving only worry.</p><p></p><p>Enduring these three days would be extremely difficult. No one knew when the demons would launch their attack.</p><p></p><p>Once the demons made a move, they would realize we were just bluffing!</p><p></p><p>After three days, we would activate the Moon Spirit Ship, but then have to break through the sealing formation in the void!</p><p></p><p>We don't know the strength of this formation either.</p><p></p><p>If we're lucky enough to break the formation, the Moon Spirit Ship can fly into the starry void towards the Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>The demons won't be able to attack then!</p><p></p><p>When the Moon Spirit Ship first takes off, it won't be very fast, so the demons could still chase us.</p><p></p><p>If we end up battling in the starry void and the Moon Spirit Ship is damaged again, we won't be able to return to the Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered deeply!</p><p></p><p>He knew this was extremely dangerous, but as fellow Sword Sect disciples, his senior and junior martial brothers, seeing this situation, if he didn't take action...</p><p></p><p>Then all those years studying the classics of sages would be in vain!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was still a glimmer of hope in this situation.</p><p></p><p>He scanned the martial brothers in the cabin one by one.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Lieyang, eight inner sect disciples, plus himself, a total of ten people!</p><p></p><p>There was also Junior Martial Brother Luyuan waiting outside. If he wasn't mistaken, the Demon Prince also had Xia Qingzhou in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>A total of twelve people!!</p><p></p><p>The lives of these twelve people rested on Gu Jiuqing's decision.</p><p></p><p>If he failed in impersonating Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, they would all perish with him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, ah Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao. Never thought I'd have to impersonate my senior brother to travel to the moon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing inwardly laughed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>At the Eight Manifestations Ridge debate, he wanted to prove to those masters of the forbidden grounds that his talents were no less than Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>But now, he still couldn't match Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's fame.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait, I'll quickly catch up to Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing cut off all distracting thoughts. His expression was calm as he looked at Senior Martial Brother Lieyang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, listen to my commands!"</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang and the other disciples all stared at Gu Jiuqing, quickly nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>They had already pinned all their hopes on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This heavy burden weighed down on Gu Jiuqing's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"First, drain the essence of thunder back into the ancient thunder pool. Then pour in the spirit stones to replenish the thunder pool's power."</p><p></p><p>This...?</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Lieyang was stunned.</p><p></p><p>If the essence of thunder was withdrawn, what would protect the Moon Spirit Ship? If the demons attacked, they would surely die.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing's expression remained calm, not repeating himself.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Lieyang could only grit his teeth and agree.</p><p></p><p>"Then all of you should go up to the deck and absorb the moonlight essence. Act as if those demons don't exist. We have five more days until the day of the spring tide. Use these few days to cultivate diligently."</p><p></p><p>Cultivate openly on the deck right in front of the demon horde?</p><p></p><p>The eight sword disciples were terrified, their legs going weak at the thought.</p><p></p><p>This, this...</p><p></p><p>They looked at Sword Immortal Lieyang. He glared back fiercely, "What are you looking at me for? Listen to True Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wasn't acting in the persona of Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao. </p><p></p><p>Rather, he was making decisions based on possessing the strength to singlehandedly suppress the demons!</p><p></p><p>The future!</p><p></p><p>I shall overcome this tribulation with my future self!</p><p></p><p>He looked at Sword Immortal Lieyang again. Lieyang's eyes shifted, sensing something big was afoot.</p><p></p><p>"True Master Gu, do you have any other instructions?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded, "You go outside the formation and bring Junior Martial Brother Luyuan back."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>This was asking him to leave the Moon Spirit Ship, pass through the demon army, break the formation, and go retrieve a fellow disciple?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, "You don't need to leave the formation. Just stand outside the Moon Spirit Ship and call out to Junior Martial Brother Luyuan. He'll come back on his own."</p><p></p><p>Ah, this task seemed much easier.</p><p></p><p>"Then with Junior Martial Brother Luyuan by your side, you can demand the Demon Prince hand over Xia Qingzhou."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to say much. Just use my name and order the Demon Prince to hand Xia Qingzhou over!!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>True Master Gu, True Master Gu, are you intentionally trying to get me killed?</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang's worries multiplied. What kind of task was this?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just sending him to his death?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly, "Junior Martial Brother Luyuan will cooperate with you for the rest."</p><p></p><p>"Just do as I say!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll protect you from the ship!"</p><p></p><p>After cutting off distracting thoughts, Gu Jiuqing integrated each profound truth into his spirit. Although he had not yet condensed a primordial spirit, his willpower could already match that level.</p><p></p><p>He remained calm in the face of danger, with the demeanor of a great master. The sword disciples in the cabin were not shaken.</p><p></p><p>He took the lead and stepped out of the cabin first.</p><p></p><p>The disciples looked at each other hesitantly. </p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli gritted his teeth, "Let's go all out! If even the paramount sword master is willing to take this gamble, in this lifetime, how can we be inferior to him?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, this is our last glimmer of hope. With his paramount status, the sword master is risking himself for us. How can we still cower here and wait for death?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The two disciples walked out, and then the rest had no choice but to follow.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Lieyang exhaled a long breath and was the last to leave the cabin.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the essence of thunder protecting the Moon Spirit Ship was withdrawn, fully exposing the ship on the ground.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the sword disciples walked onto the deck. Nonchalantly, they sat cross-legged, absorbing the moonlight essence right in front of the dense demon army. Some even began cultivating moon spirit techniques.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish ---------</p><p></p><p>The moonlight essence was drawn in, part of it entering the divine talisman, the rest entering the eight disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What are those humans doing?"</p><p></p><p>The demon army was shaken!</p><p></p><p>They saw these humans withdraw the thunder defenses, directly exposing themselves?</p><p></p><p>If the army attacked now, they could easily suppress these ten humans.</p><p></p><p>However, the army's leader frowned, staring at the Moon Spirit Ship, hesitating to give the order.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a sword immortal walked down from the Moon Spirit Ship.</p><p></p><p>He didn't move quickly. After reaching the opposite side of the demon army, he even glanced back.</p><p></p><p>Then he took a few more steps, his sword immortal aura bursting forth, sword qi swirling protectively around him.</p><p></p><p>He called out towards a barren mountain range in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Luyuan, I can see you. No need to hide, just come aboard directly!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The demon army's expressions changed!</p><p></p><p>What did this human sword immortal mean?</p><p></p><p>Treating them, this mighty demon horde, as nothing?</p><p></p><p>"Kill him! This human must die!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Great Demon Prince, give the order. Allow me to execute him!"</p><p></p><p>A celestial demon spoke up, but the Demon Prince did not respond.</p><p></p><p>The demons were shaken, demonic qi forming a great fog that rose into the air like black clouds oppressing a city, filling one with despair.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, a graceful figure strode forward.</p><p></p><p>Clad in white robes fluttering elegantly, one hand holding the Heavenly Court scripture, the other calmly taking out a precious pagoda.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak, only calmly gazing at the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>Peerlessly handsome and refined!</p><p></p><p>The might of one man suppressing thousands of demons!!</p><p></p><p>The protagonist's strength, identity, and status cannot be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the sect, just after joining, and now escorting the Sword Sect disciples, the protagonist's strength and mental state are constantly evolving.</p><p></p><p>Given the pace of advancement in this book, which matches the flow of time in the Blue Star, it's impossible to artificially suppress the protagonist's strength.</p><p></p><p>So there's no suppressing the protagonist's strength. The protagonist finding divine weapons and cultivation methods doesn't mean unlimited advancement.</p><p></p><p>I beg for your continued readership!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

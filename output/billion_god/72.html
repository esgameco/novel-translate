        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The manned rocket blasted straight into the celestial realm, completely disappearing from everyone's sight. </p><p></p><p>The lunar base had also completed its mission.</p><p></p><p>The mayor, Secretary Wen, the principal, Director Hu, the security minister, the chairmen of the three major groups, the big shots of Linji City were all secretly anxious.</p><p></p><p>That was a deity!</p><p></p><p>They could not force the deity to do anything.</p><p></p><p>So it was even harder to speak up. </p><p></p><p>They were afraid the deity would forget about the dan medicine formulas.</p><p></p><p>In order to study the ingredients of the dan medicine, Linji's top research team studied the ingredients of the dan medicine day and night. For this reason, many martial artists came in and out of Linji, picking herbs from the wild.</p><p></p><p>But the proportions were completely wrong, and the dan medicine refined could not be used.</p><p></p><p>Refining blood dan, meridian dan, leaving deity powder - as long as they could develop any one of these dan medicines, it would be easy to become the world's richest.</p><p></p><p>If they could go all out in production, the Linji Chamber of Commerce could crush the economy of the imperial capital, and raise the cultivation levels of Linji citizens by three to four times!</p><p></p><p>Under the expectant gazes of the other martial kings, the mayor steeled himself and said, "Master Gu, we have studied the ingredients of the dan medicine you gave us before."</p><p></p><p>"During these days, many comrades have gone out to the wild to help us collect medicinal materials, but the dan medicine we refined has no effect."</p><p></p><p>The mayor of Linji City had a square face, a flat head, and a tall stature. </p><p></p><p>His five viscera had been transformed, and with every breath, he would resonate with the five deities in his viscera, transforming into thunderous sounds that cleansed his flesh.</p><p></p><p>This was a martial king who had completely stepped into the third stage!</p><p></p><p>But in front of Gu Jiuqing, even the martial king mayor was a bit cautious.</p><p></p><p>His body unnaturally bent slightly, and his voice was extremely gentle.</p><p></p><p>This scene!</p><p></p><p>The other martial kings thought it was normal.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Lao'er felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>This scene was just like when other martial artists saw Gu Lao'er - it was a difference in status and strength.</p><p></p><p>A third-stage martial king acting so humble and even flattering in front of his grandnephew?</p><p></p><p>"I came this time to give you the dan medicine formulas."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out three jade talismans from his cosmic bag.</p><p></p><p>The jade talismans were crystal clear, about the size of three fingers. Each jade talisman had mysterious patterns on it.</p><p></p><p>"Stick the jade talismans to your forehead, and you'll be able to see the records inside."</p><p></p><p>"But the jade talismans have a limited number of uses, so you'd better record the dan medicine formulas inside."</p><p></p><p>The three jade talismans were handed to the mayor of Linji City.</p><p></p><p>The mayor carefully received the jade talismans!</p><p></p><p>He could determine that these three jade talismans were definitely not products of Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Just the mysterious patterns alone, being able to obtain information by sticking them to the forehead, was something even a martial sage could not accomplish!</p><p></p><p>Only a deity could be so miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The mayor was excited!</p><p></p><p>The other martial kings also thanked Gu Jiuqing one by one, all bowing to him.</p><p></p><p>With these three jade talismans, Linji becoming an ancestral city after being unsealed was already a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods could be spread through the internet, but only they would know the dan medicine formulas inside the jade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Mastering the dan medicine formulas meant mastering the lifeline of Planet Blue's martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calmly accepted the bow from Linji's martial kings.</p><p></p><p>He had impressions of them.</p><p></p><p>The insights and cultivation from the fruits of the Way intertwined within, the scenes from them were the most solidified.</p><p></p><p>Especially these few elders, cultivating divine bodies, their insights and cultivation in cultivating divine bodies far exceeded other great masters and masters.</p><p></p><p>Outside the lunar base, the upper echelons of Linji City had all gathered in front of Gu Jiuqing, excitedly looking at the jade talismans in the mayor's hands.</p><p></p><p>Soon, someone took the jade talismans to the research room to study their contents.</p><p></p><p>However, the atmosphere that followed was a bit pensive, as Gu Jiuqing was still standing in front of them, and the upper echelons of Linji City didn't dare leave.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't know how to converse with a deity.</p><p></p><p>They had so many curiosities!</p><p></p><p>They wanted to ask the deity!</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to speak up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the myriad wondrous gates?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since entering Linji, Gu Jiuqing had been pondering this question.</p><p></p><p>The myriad wondrous gates!</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, the myriad wondrous gates were taboo, one dared not speak of the heavenly secrets directly.</p><p></p><p>But in this realm, Gu Jiuqing could freely mention the myriad wondrous gates without any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>"What Master Gu speaks of is the profoundest of the profound, the myriad wondrous gates?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qian Yue hurriedly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Well, something like that."</p><p></p><p>The myriad wondrous gates, the profoundest of the profound. But the myriad wondrous gates of Planet Blue had a completely different meaning from the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, the myriad wondrous gates existed in the dantian, the dantian was the myriad wondrous gates.</p><p></p><p>These martial kings were powerful, all already attempting to cultivate the Buzhou Mountain. If he could borrow their assistance, he could cultivate the Law!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression stirred.</p><p></p><p>"I have a method called 'Leaking Heavenly Secrets' that can help you cultivate the Law."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>Transmitting the Law again?</p><p></p><p>The martial kings were delighted one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Standing behind Gu Jiuqing was Gu Lao'er, who was dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>Could the Gu family really have secret skills that he didn't know about?</p><p></p><p>Leaking the Heavenly Secret? </p><p></p><p>Divine power?</p><p></p><p>What were those things? </p><p></p><p>Why was he completely unaware of them?</p><p></p><p>This great-nephew was too unfamiliar. Without realizing it, he had retreated several steps, putting some distance between himself and Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Please pass on the divine law, Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The mayor took the lead, and the rest of the Martial Kings bowed towards Gu Jiuqing, performing the courtesy of students attending class.</p><p></p><p>"This law is actually quite simple. As I said earlier, within the dantian, there is a door to myriad mysteries. One only needs to burst open the door to myriad mysteries, and divine power can be guided into the dantian!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the first source of divine power. After cultivating it into divine power, if you further cultivate supernatural abilities, such as the sword-drawing technique, the power will increase greatly."</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the Martial President's sword-drawing technique was able to slay an S-rank demonic beast with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>But if he cultivated divine power, the power of that strike could increase even more!!</p><p></p><p>"Leaking the Heavenly Secret, the door to myriad mysteries is where the Heavenly Secret resides. You can use your essence, qi, and spirit, your blood and qi, your physical strength, or your innate divine body to assault the door to myriad mysteries."</p><p></p><p>The law that Gu Jiuqing taught was simple and easy to understand. Upon hearing it, these Martial Kings had an epiphany and immediately began trying to leak the Heavenly Secret.</p><p></p><p>The Martial President!</p><p></p><p>His martial arts attainments were the highest, so he focused his mind into his dantian, searching for the door to myriad mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed.</p><p></p><p>But he still could not find the door to myriad mysteries within his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I find the door to myriad mysteries?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the divine intent, the door to myriad mysteries is the dantian itself. So can I directly assault the dantian?"</p><p></p><p>The Martial President condensed his blood and qi!</p><p></p><p>From the locations of the five viscera, five streams of vital essence descended, forming five divine figures that charged towards the dantian.</p><p></p><p>From his spinal column, two sources of yin and yang innate bodily essence also charged towards the dantian, and he was also mobilizing his blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"  </p><p></p><p>His blood and qi surged, shaking his flesh!</p><p></p><p>The dantian was bombarded!!</p><p></p><p>"Pffft——————"</p><p></p><p>The Martial President immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Unwilling to give up, he marshaled his profound reserves once more.</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>All the meridians in his body were shattered, blood gushing unceasingly from the seven apertures as he collapsed limply to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The secretary beside him quickly stopped cultivating and helped support the Martial President, taking out spirit stones to allow him to heal the injuries to his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Martial President, what happened? Did you go into demonic deviation?"</p><p></p><p>The mayor was anxious.</p><p></p><p>They had cultivated for half an hour without finding the door to myriad mysteries, and then they saw the Martial President coughing up endless fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was also shaken by this scene as he looked at the old man.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Jiuqing's voice fell, the other Martial Kings fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing several spirit stones, the Martial President had recovered somewhat, but he was still extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>The two assaults on his dantian had depleted much of his innate yin and yang bodily essence, blood and qi, and the qi of his five viscera. To fully recover from his injuries would take months!</p><p></p><p>However, with spirit stones, that time could be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"I was too impatient. Since Master Gu said the door to myriad mysteries is the dantian, I didn't bother searching for it and directly assaulted the dantian, which led to this backlash."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, that was it!</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Kings revealed looks of realization.</p><p></p><p>They had guessed it was something like that.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing looked gravely serious.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Chaos, the dantian was bound by the door to myriad mysteries, so opening the door to myriad mysteries meant opening the dantian.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>On Planet Blue, there was no door to myriad mysteries above the dantian at all!!</p><p></p><p>So leaking the Heavenly Secret had failed.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't the Martial President's fault, but rather that the law Gu Jiuqing transmitted was unsuitable for cultivating on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"Why is leaking the Heavenly Secret unsuitable for cultivation on Planet Blue? The door to myriad mysteries does not appear within the dantians of Planet Blue's people."</p><p></p><p>"Was the door to myriad mysteries placed within us by someone? Or are the rules different between the two worlds?"</p><p></p><p>If it was the former, that was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It would overturn everything Gu Jiuqing knew!</p><p></p><p>If it was the latter, then there was nothing to be done.</p><p></p><p>He would have to find another way to cultivate divine power.</p><p></p><p>"Since leaking the Heavenly Secret is unsuitable for you to cultivate, let's end this method here."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Kings were shaken, realizing something was amiss, but no one questioned it.</p><p></p><p>They could only take malicious glee in looking towards the Martial President.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this unlucky wretch, the divine being would never have realized that the law He transmitted was unsuitable for them to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It was fortunate that the one injured wasn't them.</p><p></p><p>In this era when Linjiang was rising, in this era when the divine transmitted laws, being injured would cause them to fall far behind others.</p>

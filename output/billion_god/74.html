        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>June 6th, the day of the college entrance examination after the revival of spiritual energy. The written exam would be held on this day, with vehicles transporting the exam papers departing from the provincial capitals in the morning to arrive at high schools. </p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, the first day of the written exam would officially begin.</p><p></p><p>On the second day, accompanying officials would administer the martial arts examination to the third-year high school students.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts exam had three components for grading. The first and most heavily weighted was the measurement of qi and blood energy.</p><p></p><p>The second was the physical measurement, testing speed, strength, and reaction time. </p><p></p><p>The third component measured willpower.</p><p></p><p>The examining officials, whether from the provincial capitals or the imperial capital, were all existence at the level of grandmasters or above. Having hunted evil spirits, they carried an aura of fierceness.</p><p></p><p>Scores for the three components would be given on the spot, with the overall college entrance examination results released by noon on the 7th.</p><p></p><p>Today was also the day of the Linjiang Martial Arts Competition.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep————"</p><p>"Beep beep beep————"</p><p></p><p>The driver frantically honked, but there were too many pedestrians on the road, a vast crowd heading towards the city center.</p><p></p><p>"It's the college entrance exam today, why are there so many people on the streets? Don't they sleep in?"</p><p></p><p>The driver checked his watch, it was only 9am. </p><p></p><p>At this early hour, he would normally still be asleep.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, hurry, the 4th Linjiang Martial Arts Competition is about to start."</p><p></p><p>"What? The 4th? The officials have already changed the name, it's been changed to the 1st."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you see the promotional slogans on the street?"</p><p></p><p>Someone looked at the slogans lining the street.</p><p></p><p>The curious driver also looked at the street slogans.</p><p></p><p>[The 1st Linjiang Ancestral City Martial Arts Competition, 50 million prize for 1st place, plus Linjiang Business Association sponsorship for 1st place to become a Martial Immortal]</p><p></p><p>What is this?</p><p></p><p>The driver and smoking man were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What is this Linjiang Ancestral City?</p><p></p><p>They had heard some rumors about Linjiang in Jiangnan City.</p><p></p><p>That Linjiang was locked down for three months, with people saying Linjiang was going to rebel.</p><p></p><p>But Linjiang seemed fine now.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>When did Linjiang become an ancestral city?</p><p></p><p>What is this new title?</p><p></p><p>And what is a Martial Immortal?</p><p></p><p>A Martial King?</p><p></p><p>Or an alias for a Martial Saint?</p><p></p><p>The driver stuck his head out to ask a passing pedestrian.</p><p></p><p>The car was stuck at the intersection, unable to proceed, so he could inquire.</p><p></p><p>This pedestrian looked very young!</p><p></p><p>Probably only 17 or 18 years old, likely a high school student.</p><p></p><p>His attire was also strange, carrying a long sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>Hmm! Actually, there seemed to be many pedestrians carrying long swords.</p><p></p><p>It's normal for martial artists to carry blades, but rare to carry swords.</p><p></p><p>The T20 production lines nationwide standardize blades, unless retooled for sword molds.</p><p></p><p>But for hunting in the wild, blades are much more practical than swords!</p><p></p><p>The driver put his doubts aside. "Miss, what's happening in Linjiang, why is it so lively?"</p><p></p><p>The calm girl looked at the transport vehicle.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the vehicle transporting the exam papers?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The driver said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The calm girl gave an "oh", "It's the opening day of the Martial Arts Competition, so of course everyone is eager to go test their skills against each other after three months of bitter cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Who is weaker than whom?</p><p>Today they'll settle the score!</p><p></p><p>"But what is this Martial Immortal? I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>The driver pointed at the promotional slogan on the wall.</p><p></p><p>The calm girl didn't hide anything, as there was nothing to hide - Linjiang had already spread the word. "A Martial Immortal is a Martial Immortal. Hmm, do you know about Martial Saints?"</p><p></p><p>The driver nodded, he was certainly aware of those.</p><p></p><p>"Immortals are stronger than Martial Saints. Immortals are the level above martial artists, and there are two realms of Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The first realm is the Earthly Immortal, the second realm is the Terrestrial Divine Immortal. These two realms are collectively known as the Martial Immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"I won't say more, I have to go."</p><p></p><p>The calm girl shouldered her long sword and squeezed through the crowd, heading towards Linjiang High School in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The driver pulled his head back in, while the smoking man in the passenger seat unnaturally lit a cigarette.</p><p></p><p>"Want one?"</p><p></p><p>The driver shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The cab fell silent for a while before the driver closed the window.</p><p></p><p>He finally realized something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"You noticed too?"</p><p></p><p>The driver nodded, looking at the smoking man.</p><p></p><p>The smoke dissipated in the cab as the two martial artists frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>"I sensed something was off from the toll station," the driver recounted his journey.</p><p></p><p>The toll station!</p><p></p><p>That girl at the toll booth, she looked too young.  </p><p></p><p>At a glance, she looked so tender!</p><p></p><p>This was just seeing her hands and face, with nothing else exposed!</p><p></p><p>Jade-like supple hands, porcelain fair face, without any blemishes, impurities or moles. </p><p></p><p>With such beauty, how could she be demoted to work at a toll booth?</p><p></p><p>And that calm girl they just met!</p><p></p><p>She was the same!</p><p></p><p>Skin fairer than snow, as if stepping out of a painting, carrying a long sword like an immortal swordsman from ancient novels.</p><p></p><p>"Then look over there."</p><p></p><p>The smoking man pointed to a group of women passing by in the distance.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be all the employees of a company, with around a dozen women clustered together.</p><p></p><p>Wearing tight uniforms that revealed a glimpse of their calves.</p><p></p><p>Those calves were so white they were almost glowing!</p><p></p><p>The women were absolute beauties, with exquisite figures. Hair pinned up, like the immortal Chang'e descending from the moon palace to perform a dance on earth.</p><p></p><p>One or two might be understandable, but over a dozen of such stunners?</p><p></p><p>The driver was dumbstruck. "Wow, so gorgeous? Each one over 1.7 meters tall, just putting on those little heels makes them taller than me."</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't assemble this level of quality even for the imperial capital's New Year gala!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Where did these beauties come from?"</p><p></p><p>The driver couldn't take his eyes off them, while the smoking uncle next to him pointed towards another street where an extremely beautiful woman was walking out. </p><p></p><p>"Look over there, there's another group."</p><p></p><p>At the street corner, the leading woman was wearing a cheongsam dress, showing off her curvaceous figure. Each one of them was gorgeous.</p><p></p><p>There were thirteen women in the leading group, followed by hundreds of people behind them!</p><p></p><p>"Hua People Technology?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a local company in Linjiang. Are these all their employees?"</p><p></p><p>This is crazy!</p><p></p><p>These female employees looked ten times better than any women the driver had seen in Jiangnan City when dressed in cheongsams, flaunting their figures and beauty.</p><p></p><p>With shapely bodies, each woman had skin as white as jade as they walked by.</p><p></p><p>The driver was dumbstruck!</p><p></p><p>A few of the women were exceptionally stunning. They looked to be in their thirties, full-figured, graceful, and plump - just his type.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, no, why are there elderly people mixed into the group too?"</p><p></p><p>He noticed an elderly white-haired person with a few wrinkles on their face, but their figure was killer!</p><p></p><p>Their body was no less shapely than a twenty-year-old girl's.</p><p></p><p>Mixed into the cheongsam group, you wouldn't be able to tell their age if you didn't look closely.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, you came too?"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun also saw his own elderly mother dressed in the company's employee uniform and hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Can't I come? It's such an exciting event, I just wanted to come see."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay! Whatever you say."</p><p></p><p>The tech company's CEO passed by the front of the car.</p><p></p><p>"Mom?"</p><p></p><p>"That CEO can't be older than thirty, right? Then his mother must be at least fifty years old. At fifty, to have that figure? That skin??"</p><p></p><p>The driver looked towards the smoking uncle, fixated on the woman's body.</p><p></p><p>But the uncle was staring at Hua Yun instead.</p><p></p><p>"Limbs and joints resonating, inner energy circulating through the body, that's a great master!"</p><p></p><p>The cigarette in the uncle's hand had burned down to the butt, but he was oblivious.</p><p></p><p>Such a young great master?</p><p></p><p>You'd rarely see that even in the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, how can there be so many great masters??"</p><p></p><p>On the street, crowds of people spilled onto the road. The company's CEOs came out in person to stand together with the group leaders.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, the smoking uncle spotted seven or eight great masters!</p><p></p><p>There were even a few stronger martial artists among them. From their bodies, the smoking uncle heard the sound of thunder!</p><p></p><p>Thunder Body Refinement, the second step of the Martial Monarch realm!!</p><p></p><p>In the driver's cabin, the two martial artists swallowed hard, the driver's hands trembling.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly thought of the term "Ancestral City."</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, they felt that the name "Ancestral City" might not be so misplaced for Linjiang after all!</p><p></p><p>Finally!</p><p></p><p>The crowd had thinned out considerably, with around ten elderly men and women clearing a path and not continuing forward. This allowed them to pass through the most congested street.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>The driver hurriedly thanked the elderly group. </p><p></p><p>The elders waved their hands, signaling for the driver to go ahead quickly.</p><p></p><p>The driver didn't waste any words and drove the vehicle through the street.</p><p></p><p>"These elders have such good manners. They must have been a group of talented scholars and beautiful ladies in their youth."</p><p></p><p>The driver felt moved.</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle in the passenger seat didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be real. What we just saw must have been fake."</p><p></p><p>"You don't actually believe it, do you? Over ten great masters traveling together in one group? Mixed with Martial Monarchs?"</p><p></p><p>"Those girls and old ladies, they're all martial artists? You dare believe that?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, it's absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle's voice finally rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"Did you notice the water bottles those old men were carrying?"</p><p></p><p>Water bottles?</p><p></p><p>It's normal for the elderly to carry water when going out.</p><p></p><p>"That didn't look like water, it was nutrient fluid. If I'm not mistaken, it was at least Grade B nutrient fluid or higher."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you find those old men a bit strange?"</p><p></p><p>Strange how?</p><p></p><p>The driver was just focused on driving and didn't notice so many details.</p><p></p><p>"Those old men's blood and qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Those old men were lively and energetic, with large physiques. If you only looked at their bodies, you wouldn't think they were elderly."</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying those old men are also martial artists? And they've maintained a martial artist's blood and qi until now?"</p><p></p><p>The driver finally realized something was off.</p><p></p><p>With a "shua" sound, the armored truck stopped in front of Linjiang High School's gates. </p><p></p><p>Not far away, an enormous stage over twenty meters high had been constructed in the park.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding area was packed with crowds of people, except for the entrance to Linjiang High School, which was kept clear since it was the day of the college entrance exam and needed to be quiet for the test-takers.</p><p></p><p>The personnel who had gotten off the armored truck all stared dumbly at the towering stage, speechless.</p><p></p><p>White streaks shot up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>The white streaks flew dozens of meters before dissipating.</p><p></p><p>On the distant stage, a martial artist wielding a long sword had a huge monster-like aura swirling above his head, formed from his qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Not quite a beast, not quite a dragon - a fusion of the two, a dragon-elephant.</p><p></p><p>It was the sword aura he had just unleashed!</p><p></p><p>And the person facing him had already been defeated, falling off the stage to be carried away by medical personnel.</p><p></p><p>"I think I just saw a white streak!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't that look more like a sword beam? Could it be the legendary sword qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword qi? A martial artist who has cultivated sword qi is competing in Linjiang?"</p><p></p><p>"Shua------"</p><p></p><p>Before they could recover from their shock, new martial artists stepped onto the stage, unsheathing their swords!</p><p></p><p>Unleashing sword qi!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

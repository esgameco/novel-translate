        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The moon gradually drifted away, and the silhouette of the celestial beast in the starry sky was also overtaken by the lunar divine ship. Only the speed of that willow branch segment remained above the lunar divine ship!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, this willow branch segment expanded dozens of times larger, spanning across the starry sky, flying towards the Great Wilderness. </p><p></p><p>On the lunar divine ship!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the disappeared willow branch, the joy of having narrowly escaped death appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"We survived! We really survived!"</p><p></p><p>The demon army from the dense forest, that was the encirclement and attack of tens of thousands of demons.</p><p></p><p>There was also a Heavenly Being at the Catastrophe Realm, the infamous Demon Prince who had made a name for himself over thousands of years. Just this demon lord alone almost annihilated the celestial beast.</p><p></p><p>From despair to hope, then to the dire straits again, and now this narrow escape from death, everything felt unreal to them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Zhenchuan, the white-robed figure, stood on the deck of the divine ship, single-handedly preventing the demon army from advancing for two days with his own power.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he even fought against the Demon Prince, using an illusory technique akin to mirrored flowers on water to break through the fleshly body of the Catastrophe Realm Heavenly Being, and killed twenty or thirty demons in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>"We were able to survive this time thanks to Senior Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The surviving Sword Sect disciples clustered around Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou, who had lost an arm and had yet to restore her fleshly body, stood at the outermost edge, looking at the jade-like handsome youth.</p><p></p><p>To her, he resembled her newly ascended self when she had just completed the shedding of mortality under the Sword Sect's gate.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she was also surrounded by the young disciples of the divine cities.</p><p></p><p>But now, she could not even stand beside this Senior Brother Gu.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai had died.</p><p></p><p>During this lunar journey, she and Qing Yangbai had the lowest cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>The other senior brothers and sisters, as well as disciples below the Heavenly Realm, were the most common on the divine ship.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the deck, and the returning divine ship had far fewer people than when they departed.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Sword Sect disciples were buried on the moon, with no one knowing where they would end up in the future.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou felt moved and looked towards the white-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth was smiling, and his gaze also happened to fall on Xia Qingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's face immediately turned red, feeling flustered like a startled deer.</p><p></p><p>The youth withdrew his gaze, and the blush on Xia Qingzhou's face gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, the lunar divine ship has been activated. I will take over the operation of the divine ship."</p><p></p><p>Inside the cabin, only Gu Jiuqing and the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal remained.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Yuan, he was on the deck absorbing the lunar radiance to cultivate the techniques of the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Founder.</p><p></p><p>The cabin was not large but felt spacious.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Wind and Senior Sister Frost Snow had perished on the moon, leaving only the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal as the returning sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged, while the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal did not sit down.</p><p></p><p>His eyes carried a hint of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"This Sword Dao Paragon has only joined the Sword Sect for half a year, yet he has already reached the level of being able to fight against the Demon Prince!"</p><p></p><p>He even turned the tide, saving all the Sword Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Such brilliance, such a state of mind, he was far from matching!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the Sword Ancestor emerging from seclusion could suppress Gu Jiuqing's current brilliance!</p><p></p><p>This return to the Great Wilderness would undoubtedly shake the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>He left the cabin, not lingering any longer.</p><p></p><p>Staying near Gu Jiuqing brought him immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers Wind Sword and Frost Sword, it's better that you perished, so you don't have to know the vast gap between yourselves and these true prodigies."</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, being alive can be quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>His sword talent was unmatched among the true disciples of the Sword Sect, which was why the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal became one of the Three Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>But the Three Sword Immortals?</p><p></p><p>Compared to Gu Jiuqing, what did they amount to?</p><p></p><p>Ahead of the lunar divine ship, on the backs of the myriad dragons tens of thousands of feet long, the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal absorbed the boundless lunar radiance, once again tempering his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Flying from the moon back to the Great Wilderness would take six days.</p><p></p><p>The deceased were gone, but the living still needed to survive.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation had been etched into their bones, and soon the Sword Sect disciples on the divine ship began their new cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the cabin, Gu Jiuqing did not cultivate. At his feet were placed numerous spatial pouches.</p><p></p><p>The number of spatial pouches was astonishing, with two hundred and eighty of them!</p><p></p><p>Inside these two hundred and twenty spatial pouches were the resources that this group of Sword Sect disciples had found on the moon.</p><p></p><p>The sect disciples had to hand over half of the celestial and earthly treasures they obtained on the moon to the sect.</p><p></p><p>This was the rule!</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Sun Sword Immortal passed this lucrative task to Gu Jiuqing, who had a significant degree of control over it.</p><p></p><p>Out of the two hundred and twenty spatial pouches, the sect would take one hundred and ten, and from the remaining one hundred and ten, one-tenth would be taken to honor the few sword immortals who had escorted the sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Frost Snow had died, Senior Brother Wind had died, and the Fiery Sun Sword Immortal had also given his share to Gu Jiuqing. Therefore, Gu Jiuqing could take away the celestial and earthly treasures from eleven spatial pouches!</p><p></p><p>"Escorting the Sword Sect disciples on the lunar journey is not a task that ordinary true disciples can undertake."</p><p></p><p>This lucrative task required both personal strength and background.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not refuse. Rules and constraints were necessary for the sect to maintain its existing order and operations.</p><p></p><p>Unless a major reform occurred!</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had no intention of reforming the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>He did not even look into the contents of the one hundred and ten spatial pouches, randomly taking eleven pouches.</p><p></p><p>Using his divine sense to probe the spatial pouches, various brilliant lights flickered.</p><p></p><p>Numerous spirit herbs were neatly arranged, ordered from lowest to highest based on their age.</p><p></p><p>Spirit herbs of three to four hundred years were commonplace, while the essence lay in the herb kings of five hundred years. Among the spatial pouches, Gu Jiuqing saw several thousand-year-old spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>There was even a three-thousand-year-old ancient herb.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the spirit herbs, there was also liquid lunar radiance, celestial and earthly treasures condensed from lunar radiance, and even more spirit plants, spirit grasses, and spirit stones imbued with lunar attributes!</p><p></p><p>There were too many Yin spirit stones, with three full pouches of spirit stones in the spatial pouches that Gu Jiuqing randomly took. Each spatial pouch contained five thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>There were also other divine metals, although they were just raw materials that needed to be refined and smelted, they were priceless in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had suddenly become wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit herbs and spirit stones, I can place them in the Blue Star to assist the Blue Star people in their cultivation."</p><p></p><p>For example, he could hold a martial arts competition every month in the provincial capitals of the twenty-three provinces, and a national martial arts competition once a year. The winners could receive a five-hundred-year-old spirit herb or spirit stones as a reward!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not dwell on this thought for long, and his mind quickly returned.</p><p></p><p>"These matters should be left to the higher-ups in Linji. They will communicate with the higher-ups in the Dragon Imperial Capital and provide me with a satisfactory answer."</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining divine metals and raw materials, I can use them to forge divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was under immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>The unique Dragon and Elephant Force of the Dragon and Elephant Art constantly burdened his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>During this journey, condensing the forces of the two Dragon and Elephant Kingdoms, along with the thirty thousand Dragon and Elephant Forces, had depleted Gu Jiuqing's divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Buzhou, the Demon Prince's divine wheel weapon, the Dragon and Tiger Bell, the Bronze Cauldron, had all activated nine hundred and ninety-nine Dao traces. Even the Supreme Unity Divine Sword was radiating brilliance, with one Dao vein after another unfolding, though it had not yet activated the nine hundred and ninety-nine celestial realms!</p><p></p><p>But it was necessary to be prepared.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Pagoda is the fleshly body of the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Founder, containing the essence of the Eight Trigrams. Using it to suppress Mount Buzhou is somewhat dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>If the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Founder turned against him and controlled the Underworld Pagoda, crushing Gu Jiuqing's Mount Buzhou or withdrawing the Underworld Pagoda, it would cause his fleshly body to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Therefore!</p><p></p><p>Forging divine weapons was imperative.</p><p></p><p>"Half a millennium ago, Senior Brother Liang Xiao planted divine weapon seeds on the moon, apart from the Underworld Pagoda, there were two other divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>"These two divine weapons were planted under the Primordial Moon Tree, able to naturally attract lunar radiance, fusing it into Dao rhymes, and thereby evolving into Dao traces, without the need for forging, becoming natural celestial treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to learn this method.</p><p></p><p>Then, he could plant divine weapon seeds on the moon of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to learn the general forging methods, which he could then introduce to the Blue Star, allowing the Blue Star people to help forge divine weapon embryos!</p><p></p><p>"After returning to the sect, I should visit Senior Brother Liang Xiao at the Artifact Peak and learn the forging arts, as well as the method of condensing spiritual power. These also need to be introduced to the Blue Star!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought arose in Gu Jiuqing's mind, a knocking sound echoed from within his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his nine-zhang dantian converged into one, forming a plump spirit pill!</p><p></p><p>The thirty thousand Dragon and Elephant Forces condensed into a Primordial Divine Being, using its enormous foot to strike the spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>One kick!</p><p></p><p>The spirit pill flattened!</p><p></p><p>The second kick, and the spirit pill was stretched into a long, thin thread.</p><p></p><p>The third kick, and the spirit pill flattened again. The fourth kick turned it into a hair-thin spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>During the remaining time, Gu Jiuqing cultivated the Great Celestial Court Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>He infused his Heaven-Severing Sword Intent into the celestial court of myths.</p><p></p><p>Transforming it into the Great Celestial Court Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>His Heaven-Severing Sword Intent was of a very high grade, already reaching the pinnacle of the superior sword intent, just a hairbreadth away from breaking through to the supreme sword intent, also known as the ancient sword intent!</p><p></p><p>But the Great Celestial Court Sword Intent had an even higher grade. After fusing the Heaven-Severing Sword Intent, he obtained...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of the Great Name Peak was only two-fourths complete, lacking four-fourths of sword intent. </p><p></p><p>Time passed bit by bit as Gu Jiuqing refined his sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Six days went by quickly in cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>On the sixth day.</p><p></p><p>Cries of astonishment came from the deck, these cries of astonishment all entered the cabin, and Gu Jiuqing dispersed the Heavenly Spirit Sword Intent, transforming it into the Great Name Peak Sword Intent, attaching it to his sword pills, and swallowed them!</p><p></p><p>The flying swords shot forth like pellets entering Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>He looked out the window, through which Gu Jiuqing saw a great continent appear before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Wasteland, they had arrived!</p><p></p><p>The thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands appeared one by one, and then the Sword Gate Pass also came into view.  </p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Gu Jiuqing saw the majestic divine mountain of the Sword Sect, standing above the Sword Gate Pass!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! We've arrived at the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was waiting at the cabin door.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing followed him out of the cabin.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mountain of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>From each of the mountain peaks flew the figures of sword cultivators, standing atop the peaks, overlooking the palaces at the summits.</p><p></p><p>There were also many sword cultivators standing on the True Transmission Islands, looking up!</p><p></p><p>All the disciples of the Sword Sect had been mobilized.</p><p></p><p>Above the middle of the Divine Mountain were the elite disciples of the sect, while near the mountain's foot were the outer door disciples.</p><p></p><p>In each of the outer courtyard compounds, outer door disciples vied to gaze into the heavens, only seeing the ranks of sword cultivators and immortals.</p><p></p><p>The inner door disciples, rarely seen, densely filled the sky, as if welcoming something.</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard, two inner door disciples gazed at the huge divine ship descending towards the Divine Mountain, their expressions tinged with a hint of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this time the Moon Ship encountered an accident during its journey, and even the sect's Supreme Lord struck out with a sword towards the moon."</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei gazed at the divine ship, his eyes filled with a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>He was the first to shed mortal form in the previous session, but now?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even attend classes at the Sword Washing Academy!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai relied on their family's power to buy tickets for the Moon Journey.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how much further the gap between them would grow after this journey?</p><p></p><p>"Who knows! But I heard from disciples of the Soul Palace that quite a few people died on this Moon Journey, even immortal swordsmen fell."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about Gu of the True Transmission?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei and Fan Shaoli exchanged a glance.  </p><p></p><p>That Supreme Lord of the Sword Sect was the true high-level figure, said to be Gu Jiuqing's master.</p><p></p><p>This sword dao leader had also become the sect's youngest rising star.</p><p></p><p>"Disembarking!"</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful gaze, someone walked down from the Moon Divine Ship first.</p><p></p><p>It was a female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"That female cultivator looks so haggard?"</p><p></p><p>Many surrounding inner door disciples exclaimed in unison.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator had a severed arm, her clothes dyed red with blood, stained with dirt, and an enormous handprint imprinted on her robes!</p><p></p><p>Faint traces of demonic qi emanated from this handprint.</p><p></p><p>It was a demon's handprint, branded onto the female cultivator's body.</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be a newly promoted inner door disciple, her aura is faint, her cultivation level can't be high."</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei and Fan Shaoli recognized this female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"It's Xia Qingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>How did Xia Qingzhou end up in such a state?</p><p></p><p>Was this still the Xia Qingzhou they remembered?</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai obtained tickets for the Moon Journey, so full of lofty spirit.</p><p></p><p>The two vowed to reach the True Transmission Islands within ten years and the Buzhou realm within a century!</p><p></p><p>But now, this female cultivator with a severed arm, could this be Xia Qingzhou?</p><p></p><p>Divine lights rained down, and more people disembarked from the divine ship, but instead of returning to their courtyards or caves, they stood in midair not far from the ship's entrance.</p><p></p><p>One!  </p><p></p><p>Two!</p><p></p><p>Three!</p><p></p><p>A total of seven disciples emerged!</p><p></p><p>When the eighth disciple stepped out of the Moon Divine Ship, many were shaken.</p><p></p><p>Because this person's reputation within the Sword Sect was resounding, almost every inner door disciple knew of him.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman! The True Transmission disciple of the Nine Yang Peak, one of the three peerless prodigies of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples cried out incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman walked out of the Moon Divine Ship and stood at the head of this line of disciples in midair.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What is the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman doing?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems he's waiting for someone?"</p><p></p><p>An immortal swordsman personally waiting?</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Frost Sword Immortal and Wind Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>But the imagined Frost and Wind Sword Immortals did not appear.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a figure descended from the Moon Divine Ship. Before this figure even stepped into the air, the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman bowed deeply towards them.</p><p></p><p>Then, the other seven disciples also bowed down.  </p><p></p><p>Their voices rang out loudly, infused with spiritual power and excitement, entering the Sword Sect:</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully welcome Senior Martial Brother Gu's return to the Sword Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>This bow!</p><p></p><p>Filled with gratitude and the joy of surviving a calamity.  </p><p></p><p>They had returned!</p><p></p><p>They had come back from the moon to the Wasteland's Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Beneath their feet was the familiar mountain gate, surrounded by recognized fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>The demons were gone, the sect was right before their eyes, all thanks to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Gu?</p><p></p><p>Who was that?</p><p></p><p>How could even immortal swordsmen welcome him so respectfully?</p><p></p><p>Could he be a sect elder?</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful gazes, a white-robed youth stepped into the air, descending from the Moon Divine Ship.  </p><p></p><p>His bearing was not imposing, his appearance youthful and jade-like. He trod the void and also returned a bow to the eight sect disciples before him.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Yuan standing behind this youth did not move.</p><p></p><p>"It's him! The sword dao leader!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect fell silent for a moment before someone recognized Gu Jiuqing and exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The sword dao leader??</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing's name resounded through the Sword Sect, becoming renowned.</p><p></p><p>"The Name Peak, True Transmission Island of the Heavenly Sword Palace, the sword dao leader! It's him, the one the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman bowed to!"</p><p></p><p>"They're all fellow sword cultivators, even immortal swordsmen, why such respect?"</p><p></p><p>Many were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly resonated in the void, "Jiuqing, come to the Name Peak."</p><p></p><p>This voice arose abruptly at this moment, wasn't it dampening the mood?</p><p></p><p>But only this voice rang out from the sect's summit, none of the other elders' voices appeared, only a ray of divine light flew out from one of the peaks.</p><p></p><p>It was the divine light from the Nine Yang Peak, summoning the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood up, looking puzzled towards the Name Peak.</p><p></p><p>This voice did not belong to Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, but rather an unfamiliar voice he had never heard before.</p><p></p><p>Could it be Cultivator Cunyin?</p><p></p><p>His nominal master?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not dare neglect it and immediately headed towards the Name Peak.</p><p></p><p>As the Blazing Sun Immortal Swordsman and Gu Jiuqing departed, the remaining eight disciples also descended into the Sword Sect and disappeared. The Moon Divine Ship overhead shrank to the size of a palm, transforming into a paper ship and falling onto the Celestial Craft Peak.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the bell of the Sword Sect resounded through the Divine Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong -------"</p><p>"Dong dong dong ----------"</p><p>"Dong dong dong ---------------"</p><p></p><p>Nine solemn tolls, the entire Sword Sect fell into mourning white.</p><p></p><p>A divine voice came from one of the sword peaks, and another immortal swordsman descended.</p><p></p><p>It was the Sword Sect's Sword Child coming down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Today, in an era of demonic chaos, our disciples journeyed to the moon and valiantly battled demons, led by Gu Jiuqing of the Name Peak's True Transmission, suppressing the demons and restoring order to the world."</p><p></p><p>"However, many of our disciples have fallen."</p><p></p><p>"From the Barbarian Peak, the Wind Sword Immortal, Wind Ruyi!"</p><p></p><p>"From the Celestial Snow Peak, the Frost Sword Immortal, Han Xue!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Inner door disciples Du Gu Ming, Qing Yangbai, Wu Kedao."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Child's voice resounded through the sect, and the disciples learned of the demonic chaos on the moon.</p><p></p><p>"So many sect brothers and sisters have fallen."</p><p></p><p>Even two immortal swordsmen could not escape this calamity.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the Sword Sect fell silent, mourning their fallen peers.</p><p></p><p>On the Name Peak, as Gu Jiuqing heard the names of the fallen senior and junior martial brothers recited, his footsteps grew heavier.</p><p></p><p>After the Sword Child finished chanting the names of the fallen, he finally entered Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's cave abode.</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace on the Name Peak had disappeared, and that earlier voice had indeed come from this cave on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing entered the cave, he saw an old man sitting on a coffin!!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao was kneeling before this old man, not daring to raise his head. Seeming to sense Gu Jiuqing's arrival, Liang Xiao hurriedly raised his head and said, </p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, this is our Master, Cultivator Cunyin!"</p><p></p><p>A new chapter, a new beginning, the protagonist is about to journey the world.

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Palace, Spiritual Cultivation Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing introspected his dantian. </p><p></p><p>A door three zhang (about 10 meters) in size resided within his dantian, with surging spiritual power leaking out from the door, opening up the dantian. The power converged into threads, coiling together - it was striking the primordial pill!</p><p></p><p>After returning from the lunar base, Gu Jiuqing had been pondering this issue.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Myriad Doors only appear within the dantians of the Dahuang human race? The spiritual power leaking out was from within the Myriad Doors!</p><p></p><p>They didn't need to cultivate, as spiritual power would automatically generate within their dantians.  </p><p></p><p>Basic livelihood!</p><p></p><p>This was a term from Planet Blue - without doing anything, spiritual power would accumulate daily.</p><p></p><p>To condense the primordial pill faster, one needed to refine elixir pills themselves and breathe the spiritual qi of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If the Myriad Doors were man-made, then who would do such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Jiuqing was a huge pile of ancient books.</p><p></p><p>He had Lu Yuan find all the ancient books related to the leakage of heavenly mysteries. Some were yellowed, while others were damaged - at least hundreds, if not thousands of years old.</p><p></p><p>There were even some excavated from ruins!</p><p></p><p>Each of these ancient books was extremely weighty, with twenty or thirty of them in total.</p><p></p><p>"In these ancient books, one records that during the 17th Celestial Emperor period, there was a genius who leaked the heavenly mystery but exploded to death."</p><p></p><p>This was a simple record!</p><p></p><p>But this single record was most abnormal.</p><p></p><p>For the leakage of heavenly mysteries, there were only those who couldn't find the mystery and those who completed the leakage - where was there talk of exploding to death?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had roamed the Dahuang freely, returned to his fleshly body, and realized the Myriad Doors were the dantian, and leaking the heavenly mystery meant opening the Myriad Doors.</p><p></p><p>He had completely opened the Myriad Doors, pouring out the spiritual power into his dantian, yet had never exploded!</p><p></p><p>"With my foundation, I absolutely surpass any person from ancient times to the present, even the Celestial Emperors in their youth cannot compare to me!"</p><p></p><p>"This genius who exploded to death from leaking the heavenly mystery could not possibly be because the leaking spiritual power was too much for his body to withstand."</p><p></p><p>Then what was the reason for his explosion?</p><p></p><p>The ancient Celestial Emperor period, the 18th period, was the era closest to modern times. </p><p></p><p>The deeds passed down from that Celestial Emperor were scant, to the point that even the Emperor's prestigious name did not make it to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The 17th period was the Xuantian Emperor!</p><p>The 16th period was the Bright Sovereign Celestial Emperor!</p><p>...</p><p>(listing of other Celestial Emperor periods)</p><p></p><p>The more ancient Celestial Emperor periods had no records left due to their immense antiquity.</p><p></p><p>Each Celestial Emperor period spanned at least thirty to fifty thousand years, some even over a hundred thousand years. Within this weighty history of Dahuang, the leakage of heavenly mysteries seemed to be a forgotten realm - no one had accomplished anything shockingly impressive at this profound level.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power condensing into qi, into liquid, into solid form, coalescing into the primordial pill. One cycle, two cycles, up to nine cycles, then cultivating the divine body.</p><p></p><p>Only those powerful divine bodies were recorded in the ancient books.</p><p></p><p>Like the "Great Primordial Heavenly King Divine Body"!</p><p>The "Indestructible War God Divine Body"!</p><p>And the "Great Way Divine Body"!</p><p></p><p>Resounding through each Celestial Emperor period.</p><p></p><p>"In these ancient times, the leakage of heavenly mysteries has never changed!"</p><p></p><p>The state of shedding mortality was called Foundation Establishment in the era before antiquity. In even more ancient times, it was also called Body Refinement, Tempering the Body, Fleshly Body state.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal state also had many names - Divine Body, Great Unity, Indestructibility, etc.  </p><p></p><p>There were even more names for the Spirit Refinement state that Gu Jiuqing knew - seven or eight, like Circulating the Heavens, Refining Apertures, Spirit Apertures, Stellar State, Hollow Void, Formless, Divine Unification.</p><p></p><p>Above Spirit Refinement was Celestial Palace, Spirit Soul, Primordial Spirit, Celestial Human.  </p><p></p><p>Then there were states like Tribulation, Longevity, Crossing Tribulations, Great Completion, Life and Death, Reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>But the leakage of heavenly mysteries? It was just the Spiritual Power state, with no other names, passed down from ancient times without change.</p><p></p><p>Across eighteen Celestial Emperor periods, plus the modern era, the leakage of heavenly mysteries was just the leakage - terms like "Dragon and Tiger Intermingling" or "Celestial Human Unification" were just cultivation methods elucidating the leakage.</p><p></p><p>A chill ran down Gu Jiuqing's spine, feeling he had touched upon a terrifying great secret!</p><p></p><p>This was a great terror shrouding antiquity.</p><p></p><p>"If the Myriad Doors were truly placed in the dantian by someone, other than deities, no one else could have done it!"</p><p></p><p>But could deities even accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, those Celestial Emperors were deities, even the strongest Immortal Venerables were deities!</p><p></p><p>Could a deity perform such an act without being discovered?</p><p></p><p>Streams of thoughts flowed, causing his face to grow increasingly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Now I finally understand why Senior Brother Liang Xiao was called a madman."</p><p></p><p>After exploring one secret after another, if unable to unravel the mysteries, how could one not go mad?</p><p></p><p>The more he knew, the more terrified he became of this heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's madness stemmed partly from this reason.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, with my current strength, even if I truly knew the reason for the Myriad Doors, I would be powerless to do anything."</p><p></p><p>"The Linji Provincial Exam is about to begin, and the city lockdown will also end."</p><p></p><p>"The manned rocket will fly to the moon on the 7th, I need to set up the second ancient teleportation array at Linji High School."</p><p></p><p>"Then have the students replace me in spreading the Dao to the 23 provinces of the Dragon Kingdom!!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the matter I should be considering now."</p><p></p><p>Sounds of flipping pages came from the Spiritual Cultivation Chamber as Gu Jiuqing opened the Compendium of Spiritual Powers, searching for suitable powers to spread the Dao.</p><p></p><p>At Leiju Valley.</p><p></p><p>The three inner door disciples Gao Shuli, Wu Shaojie and Du Guming were excited.</p><p></p><p>They had finally secured tickets for the lunar spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>It was too difficult to go to the moon - even the True immortals of their clan could not fly to the moon, let alone bring them along.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Heading to the moon for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was their only chance in life to fly to the moon. </p><p></p><p>"I have submitted the ancient books to Senior Martial Brother Gu, and I must thank the three of you brothers."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan rushed from the Sword Heaven Palace and fell into the Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked him to find ancient books related to the Heavenly Secret Leakage, but it was difficult for the Lu family to find so many ancient books in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>So Lu Yuan found these three former good friends.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>"Why is that true master reading books about the Heavenly Secret Leakage?"</p><p></p><p>Du Gu Ming was curious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan smiled, "How would I know? But when I entered the Sword Heaven Palace, I heard Senior Martial Brother Gu muttering to himself, saying that he wanted to cultivate the Element Pill and wanted to compete with those ancient cultivators of the Dharma Realm."</p><p></p><p>"He even said that the Young Heavenly Emperor was no match for him."</p><p></p><p>The Young Heavenly Emperor was no match for True Master Gu?</p><p></p><p>The three inner door disciples were stunned.</p><p></p><p>This sword supreme was claiming to surpass the Young Heavenly Emperor?</p><p></p><p>That was the emperor who unified the Great Wilderness and ushered in a new era, who built the Ancient Heavenly Court and oversaw the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>How dare he have such thoughts?</p><p></p><p>This also showed from the side that True Master Gu's powers were boundless, able to be compared to the Young Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I heard it wrong, but recently Senior Martial Brother Gu has been acting mysterious, becoming more and more like a powerful expert."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan added another comment, bid farewell to the three, and ascended to the Sword Heaven Palace.</p><p></p><p>The three in the Thunder Valley looked at each other, all feeling somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>They had already told the elders of their families about Lu Yuan's matter, but so much time had passed and the families still had not made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"No, this can't go on! If it continues like this, the family doesn't know when they'll make a decision, and even if they decide to follow the sword supreme, it will be too late by then."</p><p></p><p>"Now True Master Gu has just cultivated to the Dharma Realm, and he's starting to attack the Element Realm. With True Master Gu's talents, he'll complete this level of the realm very soon!"</p><p></p><p>Once he steps into the Imperfection Realm and his divine body manifests abnormalities, Gu Jiuqing's name will resound throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>By then, how could they from noble families have such good fortune?</p><p></p><p>"There are only a few days left until the day of ascending to the moon. After ascending, I will personally return to the ancient city!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli stated his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I was thinking the same!"</p><p></p><p>Du Gu Ming nodded.</p><p></p><p>While Wu Shaojie just looked at the Thunder Valley, silent.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you two are one step behind me. I've already asked the old ancestor of my branch to request the True Man to come out of seclusion. Once the True Man comes out, he'll quickly be able to give us an answer!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The True Man coming out of seclusion?</p><p></p><p>The True Man was a cultivator who had formed a Celestial Spirit at the Celestial Palace Realm - the highest level of their noble families!</p><p></p><p>The two became anxious and hurriedly followed Wu Shaojie's lead, intending to ask the old ancestors of their own branches to persuade the True Man.</p><p></p><p>On Planet Blue, in the wilderness outside Linjiang City, at a highway toll station.</p><p></p><p>One by one, armored transport vehicles came from afar and stopped at the toll station on the highway entrance.</p><p></p><p>June 6th!</p><p></p><p>The three-month lockdown period for Linjiang City had just ended, and the highway toll station had also reopened, with staff sitting inside processing work.</p><p></p><p>And these three vehicles were Linjiang's first batch of visitors.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I'm exhausted. It took three hours driving all the way from Jiangnan City. This road is too difficult to drive on!"</p><p></p><p>When the driver saw the toll station, his tense heart finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Driving on the highway!</p><p></p><p>It's not something an ordinary person could do.</p><p></p><p>In the era of spiritual energy's revival, wild beasts often attacked trucks on the highways.</p><p></p><p>Small cars generally wouldn't take the highways, unless they had the protection of a master or great master.</p><p></p><p>This time, they were carrying the high school entrance exam papers and proctors to Linjiang, so the pressure wasn't that great.</p><p></p><p>Those proctors were people from the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>The person in the passenger seat flicked away ash and exhaled a cloud of smoke.</p><p></p><p>"Stop complaining. You're lucky you're going to Linjiang. Last year, I had a brother who drove from Xishan City in Xishan Province to Tianhe City. He had only driven for half an hour when they were ambushed by demonic beasts on the road. The proctors and drivers who went didn't make it."</p><p></p><p>The old smoking man showed no expression, and the driver laughed dryly.</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense. How can Xishan Province compare to Jiangnan Province? This is a coastal province. Xishan borders the Primordial Mountains, and I've heard the demonic beasts that have mutated in the Primordial Mountains are the most numerous."</p><p></p><p>The driver stopped the car, and the staff at the toll station checked their work credentials before letting the three transport vehicles through.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble rumble————</p><p></p><p>The vehicles restarted, and the driver couldn't help but glance in the rearview mirror.</p><p></p><p>"That little lady's skin is so tender. Smoother than a cultivator's."</p><p></p><p>The smoking elder agreed, "Yeah, if that girl wasn't working at the toll station, I would have thought she was a cultivator, or even a master!"</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who refine their blood have fair, beautiful skin.</p><p></p><p>"I heard Linjiang's red-light district is pretty good. I stayed there for a night last year. Let's go there tonight for some entertainment."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? We should give it a try then."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying to you. We might even run into some cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators would go to the red-light district?"</p><p></p><p>"Why not!"</p><p></p><p>The three transport vehicles drove swiftly towards the city center.</p><p></p><p>(After the revival of spiritual energy, the national college entrance exams have a written test on June 6th and a martial arts test on the 7th.)</p><p></p><p>Those readers who like this book, please support it more!</p><p></p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The two walked side by side, chatting casually. </p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Jiuqing and the others arrived at the school gate.</p><p></p><p>It was still early, and Old Yang and Old Jin had not yet appeared at the security booth. </p><p></p><p>"What time do Old Yang and the others usually come to work? How come they're not here yet?" Gu Jiuqing asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The last time, he had seen Old Yang and Old Jin sitting in the security booth when he came to school at 7:30 am.</p><p></p><p>Today, he arrived at school almost at 8 o'clock, but he didn't see them.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the school has dismissed the security team. There are armed police officers guarding the school 24 hours a day. Look, they've set up two police booths on the school playground."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing followed the direction of Bai Muyu's finger and indeed saw two large temporary buildings on the playground, with flashing alarm lights installed outside.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't been to school for several days, so you didn't know about this, did you, Teacher Gu?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muyu looked at the young master of the capital in front of her, and for a moment, she seemed to regard Gu Jiuqing as her colleague.</p><p></p><p>"The school has reformed many aspects. For example, during the morning exercise, all students and teachers have to practice the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. In the third class of the morning and afternoon, twenty minutes must be set aside to practice the Sword Drawing Technique."</p><p></p><p>"The students' qi and blood levels have greatly improved. The students in Class 2 of Grade 12, which is the class you teach, Teacher Gu, have all broken through to the martial artist realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Students from the other three Grade 12 classes have also gradually broken through to the martial artist realm."</p><p></p><p>"At this year's college entrance examination, the students from Linji will definitely shake the entire nation, and may even produce the national top scorer."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, these days the principal has been asking us if we're interested in becoming university professors."</p><p></p><p>"A university professor is no ordinary teacher - at the very least, one must become a Bone Refining Master."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muyu felt a bit proud. Just this morning, she had successfully cultivated to become a Bone Refining Master.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the principal is contacting the higher-ups of Linji. There's news that Linji is preparing to build its first university."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, these days a large area of land has been acquired in the eastern suburbs, probably for some high-tech development. Many students have gone there to work part-time jobs."</p><p></p><p>"I went for one day and earned 300 yuan, enough to buy a bottle of nutrient fluid."</p><p></p><p>"Nutrient fluids are so much cheaper now. It's a good opportunity to stock up while they're inexpensive."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had never known that girls could talk so much.</p><p></p><p>At the school cafeteria entrance, Bai Muyu seemed reluctant to stop.</p><p></p><p>It had been so long since she last talked to someone.</p><p></p><p>Apart from classes, she had been single-mindedly pursuing breakthroughs in martial arts, with no time for chatting.</p><p></p><p>Even when she was with Hua Yun, the two mostly went to the martial arts hall and practice rooms.</p><p></p><p>Today, having finally cultivated to become a Bone Refining Master and fulfilled her long-cherished dream, Bai Muyu felt excited.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to share her joy with someone but couldn't find anyone, so she ended up talking at length with Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>At the cafeteria entrance, Bai Muyu regained her usual aloof demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Every morning, she would come to the school cafeteria to mooch free breakfast.</p><p></p><p>That was how she started her day.</p><p></p><p>Why did she suddenly fall silent?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Bai Muyu, who now appeared like an icy beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, Teacher Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muyu headed towards the cafeteria without turning back.</p><p></p><p>"What a strange woman."</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, Bai Muyu mentioned going to the eastern city for a part-time job to earn nutrient fluid, but then she stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>Leaving a conversation half-finished, how frustrating.</p><p></p><p>With a sense of vexation, Gu Jiuqing walked towards the teaching building.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing reached the teaching building, a familiar voice sounded beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this Teacher Gu? You're here at school so early today?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing turned around and saw an old man being supported by the principal.</p><p></p><p>It was Old Master Wen!</p><p>Wen Baike!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's been a long time since I last came to school to teach. I don't know how the students in Class 2 of Grade 12 are doing."</p><p></p><p>"Today I have..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's perfect timing for you to come teach at the school."</p><p></p><p>Teach at the school??</p><p></p><p>The principal was stunned!</p><p></p><p>Old Wen also seemed to realize something, but he didn't have as big a reaction as the principal.</p><p></p><p>"This is Teacher Gu's first class after becoming a senior teacher. Teacher Gu, why don't you give an open class? We old folks would also like to listen and see how Teacher Gu teaches."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Now it was Gu Jiuqing's turn to be dazed.</p><p></p><p>An open class?</p><p></p><p>The principal and others want to attend the class?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hesitated, he didn't know how to teach, he only came to impart the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, don't worry. Just teach the way you normally do. We'll just sit in the back and won't say a word."</p><p></p><p>Old Wen said hopefully.</p><p></p><p>This is a divine being!</p><p></p><p>This divine being took half a month off and has only taught three classes to the senior year class 2! This will be his fourth class.</p><p></p><p>According to his students, every time he teaches, he imparts the Dao!!</p><p></p><p>"This, okay then."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's set the time for 10 o'clock, I'll go call people!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing went up to the teaching building.</p><p></p><p>Old Wen showed an excited expression, he looked at the principal and scolded loudly.</p><p></p><p>"What are you waiting for? Go call people!"</p><p></p><p>"You want me to make phone calls?"</p><p></p><p>Old Wen's scolding brought the principal back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Hello? Mayor? Today Teacher Gu will give an open class, do you have time to attend?"</p><p></p><p>"What? You can't come? Oh, okay then. You asked who Teacher Gu is?"</p><p></p><p>"A divine being!"</p><p></p><p>"You say you're coming right away? The open class is at 10, can you make it?"</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Wen? Good!"</p><p></p><p>After hanging up, the principal dialed another number.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Wu, this time you can come to the school openly. Today Teacher Gu is giving a class, he may impart new teachings!"  </p><p></p><p>"What? Chairman Wu, you went hunting in the wild yesterday and killed hundreds of demonic beasts? You're transporting the beasts into the city? No time?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know who Teacher Gu is?"</p><p></p><p>"He's that divine being!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You say you're coming now?"</p><p></p><p>"Good, hurry over. The open class is at 10 o'clock. Teacher Gu won't wait for you, don't be late!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling energized!</p><p></p><p>Awesome.</p><p></p><p>They are both Martial Kings with similar martial dao realms and comparable strength.</p><p></p><p>But there is still a significant gap in status between them.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, since Teacher Gu is imparting the Dao at the school, then the school is a divine palace, a sacred hall.</p><p></p><p>For them to enter the school, they need his, the principal's, permission!</p><p></p><p>After making a few more calls, the principal finally stopped calling people.</p><p></p><p>Soon, cars started appearing outside the school, including official and military vehicles.</p><p></p><p>They entered the teaching building in an orderly fashion and went into senior year class 2.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many people, only the principal, Old Wen, and a few other elderly people who looked close to retirement age or already retired.</p><p></p><p>At 10 o'clock sharp, Gu Jiuqing appeared in the senior year class 2 classroom.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up, good morning teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Good morning students."</p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>As always, it was the class monitor Yang Miaojing giving the commands.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Today these students seemed a bit off, like they had been injected with chicken blood, their faces flushed red, blood boiling, looking ready to burst out.</p><p></p><p>"One old man, two old men, three old men, plus the principal and the principal's master, that's five old men."</p><p></p><p>At the back of the classroom, there were only five old men seated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't pay it any mind, but if this scene was spread, it would shake the entire Linji City, even Jiangnan Province would be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's begin the class."</p><p></p><p>"Today's class will be a bit mixed, I hope to cover everything within two hours."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wrote a few large characters on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>[Refine the Body! Refine the Qi! Refine the Spirit!]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

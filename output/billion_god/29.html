        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's memory of Gu Linglong was still stuck five years ago. </p><p></p><p>Five years ago, Gu Linglong left Tianyuan Ancient City and disappeared in the northern lands, without any news for a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>After half a year passed, there was finally a letter from Gu Linglong.</p><p></p><p>In the following years, Gu Linglong would send letters home from time to time. </p><p></p><p>It was thanks to Gu Linglong that the Gu family was able to keep this large mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know what exactly Gu Linglong was doing outside, but in every letter, Gu Linglong would send a large sum of spirit stones. As a result, Gu Jiuqing became a young master in Tianyuan Ancient City, traveling and accompanying many Confucian disciples.</p><p></p><p>The main hall!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the housekeeper Xie entered the mansion, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to ask Xie about it, but gave up.</p><p></p><p>He continued reading the letter.</p><p></p><p>[Ever since you were young, you enjoyed literary pursuits, as well as qin, chess, calligraphy and painting. Over these years, I have also heard news of you in Jiuzhou. Some great Confucian disciples brought your paintings into Jiuzhou, attracting many literati to admire them. There were even connoisseurs willing to pay thousands of taels of gold! Those literati compared you to a celestial painter descending to the mortal realm, causing many ladies to admire you. You simply have no interest in the path of cultivation, but do not lament your current life.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing recalled a few months ago, when several great Confucian disciples traveled together to the northern lands and happened to pass through Tianyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Jiuqing, gazing at the vast wilderness, painted a depiction of the wilderness. This painting of the vast wilderness caused a sensation in Tianyuan Ancient City, and its fame even spread to the thirteen cities of the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>After seeing this, those great Confucian disciples sighed repeatedly, taking the painting of the vast wilderness with them, saying they would spread Gu Jiuqing's illustrious name!</p><p></p><p>"My illustrious name spreads through the Great Zhou, I, Gu Jiuqing, can be considered an eccentric in the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, withdrew his thoughts, and continued reading.</p><p></p><p>[Jiuqing, if you still wish to cultivate, your elder sister can lend you a helping hand.]</p><p></p><p>[In the wandering Jiuzhou, the planet Ying guards the heart. In recent years, the Great Zhou Divine Emperor has been fervently constructing the Celestial Tower, causing immense suffering for the common people. The prefectural lords of Jiuzhou are recruiting soldiers. If you still wish to cultivate, your elder sister can write a letter of recommendation for you to take up a position as an aide in the Qingzhou Prefecture, sharing in the fortunes of Qingzhou. Perhaps you may be able to knock on the door of mystery and become a cultivator.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing never expected!</p><p></p><p>So the Great Zhou is now in such turmoil. From his elder sister's few words, Gu Jiuqing learned that Jiuzhou is in chaos, and the nine prefectural lords harbor malicious intentions!</p><p></p><p>It seems that even before the demons invade, Jiuzhou may already be in disarray.</p><p></p><p>[However, given your temperament, you probably wouldn't want to reside in the Qingzhou Prefecture. I have chosen a second path for you. After reading this letter, burn it, and you will obtain the Buddhist Three-Zhang Golden Body technique. This technique forges a three-zhang golden body, without any cultivation threshold, only requiring some enlightenment.]</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist Three-Zhang Golden Body technique?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was startled!</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong actually obtained this secret Buddhist technique?</p><p></p><p>Where did she get it from?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate guards the Sword Gate Pass in the northern region of the Great Zhou. After passing through the Sword Gate Pass, one enters the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>This is the second line of defense guarding the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>And to the west of the Great Zhou lies the Buddhist Gate, one of the four great sects, stationed in the Small Western Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Zhang Golden Body technique is a secret Buddhist technique, equivalent to the supreme sword technique of the Sword Gate! Cultivating this technique can attain a three-zhang golden body, with the entire body like divine metal. Once activated, it transforms into a three-zhang physique, with every movement imbued with the power of dharma form.</p><p></p><p>"Sister thinks I failed to join the Sword Gate, so she's letting me cultivate the Buddhist Three-Zhang Golden Body technique. But if I cultivate this Buddhist secret technique, I will definitely be hunted down by the Buddhist Gate!"</p><p></p><p>That is a secret technique of one of the four great sects. The four paramount leaders are almost godlike existences, standing at the pinnacle of the world. Who dares to greatly disrespect them?</p><p></p><p>[Rest assured, your sister has arranged a marriage for you. Three days from now, this good match will come visiting. At that time, brother only needs to go out and receive them.]</p><p></p><p>A marriage?</p><p></p><p>Three days from now?</p><p></p><p>Isn't that today?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing panicked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong's actions are meticulous, even thinking of arranging his marriage?</p><p></p><p>The Gu family has a humble status. Is she trying to use this marriage to shield him from disaster?</p><p></p><p>Then who could shield Gu Jiuqing from the Buddhist Gate's pursuit?</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Calamity!!</p><p></p><p>A prominent family from the northern lands? </p><p></p><p>A force of this level is not qualified to stand before the four great sects!!</p><p></p><p>If not from a prominent family, then who could it be?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>[That good person is your sister's close female friend. If you are not interested, just say so directly. Over these years, your sister has had close female friends all over the place. If you don't mind, brother can slowly find a good match.]</p><p></p><p>Close female friend?</p><p></p><p>Sister's close female friend?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled bitterly. When did Gu Linglong have so many close female friends?</p><p></p><p>Previously in the ancient city of Tianyuan, Gu Linglong was even more of a shut-in than him. These close female friends must be friends she made over the years.</p><p></p><p>[I have sent you two jade boxes. One jade box contains a spiritual vein from the former Taoshanpai sect! The other jade box contains a spiritual vein from the former Xiulupai sect. That close female friend of your sister loves spiritual stones. If you present her with the spiritual veins as gifts, you will surely gain her favor. As for the remaining spiritual vein, you can bury it deep within the old Gu family manor. With the assistance of a spiritual vein, your cultivation will also improve, brother.]</p><p></p><p>She's gone mad!</p><p></p><p>She must have gone completely mad!</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong's audacity is truly outrageous. She even stole the spiritual veins of Taoshanpai and Xiulupai!</p><p></p><p>The chaos in the nine states is unceasing. The great Zhou dynasty is purging the heretical sects and cults. Taoshanpai and Xiulupai were among those sects purged by the great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Taoshanpai was annihilated 120 years ago, while Xiulupai was destroyed 280 years ago.</p><p></p><p>After the two great sects were destroyed, their spiritual veins disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought they ended up in Gu Linglong's hands?</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what is she up to?"</p><p></p><p>How did she manage to obtain the spiritual veins?!!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual veins are the veins of the heavens and earth, capable of nurturing spiritual stones. To establish a new sect, one needs a spiritual vein to gather destiny.</p><p></p><p>The sword sect has spiritual veins, as does the Buddhist sect. The four great sects all have spiritual veins, even the great Zhou dynasty has spiritual veins.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a servant brought two jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>These were the two jade boxes sent by Gu Linglong, containing the spiritual veins of Taoshanpai and Xiulupai respectively.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing carefully placed the two jade boxes down, then read the final line of the letter.</p><p></p><p>[Wait a while longer, until sister finishes her business, then I will return to see you.]</p><p></p><p>The letter ended abruptly.</p><p></p><p>This letter revealed a lot of information, but did not mention anything about Gu Linglong's whereabouts!</p><p></p><p>"Sister, where have you gone?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Jiuqing had thought Gu Linglong left the ancient city of Tianyuan to do business. Later, news of the Celestial Lady of Yaochi Pond shook the thirteen cities of the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>After the Celestial Lady left the northern lands and entered the nine states of the great Zhou, Gu Linglong's news went dark.</p><p></p><p>Doing business? </p><p></p><p>Could she have obtained two spiritual veins through business?</p><p></p><p>Could she have obtained the Buddhist secret of the Three Zhang Golden Body through business?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing burned the letter with an oil lamp. As the letter burned, golden patterns emerged, quickly forming a sheet of golden paper in Gu Jiuqing's hand!</p><p></p><p>It was the Buddhist technique "Three Zhang Golden Body"!</p><p></p><p>The golden paper was as thin as a cicada's wings. Even though Gu Jiuqing had undergone the Moulting of Mortality eight times and possessed fifty-six dragon and elephant powers, he could not destroy this paper!</p><p></p><p>The golden patterns remained clear, depicting thirty-three small golden human figures. Some figures held flowers and smiled, others pointed one hand to the sky and one to the earth, while others sat with closed eyes in meditation.</p><p></p><p>A human is only a few meters tall, but a Buddha stands three zhang (about 10 meters) tall. This extra height is the Buddhist dharma you comprehend!</p><p></p><p>Fill yourself with the Buddhist dharma, and condense a Three Zhang Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Jiuqing understood the method of cultivating this technique.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The steward Xie rushed into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"There is a woman outside claiming to be the Young Master's..."</p><p></p><p>"Speak!"</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie was flustered. "She says she is the Young Master's fiancée."</p><p></p><p>First update, begging for month tickets, rewards, and rating tickets!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

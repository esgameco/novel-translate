        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The eighth heavenly paradise of the Celestial Realm, the heavens, earth, water, fire, wind, thunder, mountains and marshes, the great marsh heavenly paradise within. </p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu, this tribulation realm celestial personally opened the ancient teleportation formation for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>There were also several Celestial Palace realm Great Wind masters seeing him off from afar. </p><p></p><p>The ripples of the ancient teleportation formation, the spiritual qi from each spirit stone was absorbed by the formation.</p><p></p><p>There were five hundred spirit stones within the teleportation formation. The distance between Qingzhou and Yuzhou was far less than the path from the Blue Star to the moon, so naturally fewer spirit stones were consumed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you again, Venerable Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu's eyes were full of gratitude. If it weren't for Gu Jiuqing's assistance, the Great Wind Clan would have been annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing remained calm. Just as he was about to step into the teleportation formation, Lu Yuan behind him took out a small booklet.</p><p></p><p>[Mentor Brother Gu travels the world, entering the Celestial Realm of Tianmu in Qingzhou, rescuing the Great Wind Clan from the water and fire.]</p><p></p><p>[Mentor Brother rides the ancient teleportation formation to leave the Celestial Realm, yet the Great Wind Clan did not think to repay Mentor Brother. No wonder the Great Wind Clan of Tianmu can only occupy a corner of Qingzhou.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had noticed the small booklet in Lu Yuan's hand long ago. On the moon, Lu Yuan had also taken out the booklet before.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at the time, he was pretending to be Mentor Brother Liang Xiao, and later fought the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>So he had no time to pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a motion of his spiritual sense, he had already seen the line of text Lu Yuan had written.</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu was a tribulation realm celestial, although he had only crossed one lightning tribulation, his spiritual sense was stronger than anyone else present.</p><p></p><p>In just a thought, Wind Taiyu's old face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rescued the Great Wind Clan from the water and fire!</p><p></p><p>Other than hosting a banquet for Gu Jiuqing, they had made no other gesture.</p><p></p><p>It was their fault.</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu, although the supreme patriarch of the Great Wind Clan who had lived for thousands of years, never involved himself in the affairs of the great clan.</p><p></p><p>It was his elder brother and another tribulation realm patriarch who oversaw the Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>He smiled awkwardly, "It is the Great Wind Clan that has been discourteous."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was about to put away the booklet, but seeing this, he reopened it, holding a brush, looking at Wind Taiyu.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was waiting to see how the Great Wind Clan would repay their life-saving grace.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Celestial Palace realm patriarchs were stunned, then immediately realized.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled bitterly. Rescuing the Great Wind Clan was just a minor effort for him.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Lord Gu, it is the Great Wind Clan that has been discourteous, please do not take offense."</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu hurriedly transmitted his voice to the Celestial Palace realm cultivators, and soon several of them left the great marsh heavenly paradise, but not long after, they returned carrying spatial bags.</p><p></p><p>One Celestial Palace realm cultivator came forward and handed a spatial bag to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"This contains 80,000 spirit stones nurtured from the spiritual veins of my Great Wind Clan!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Palace realm cultivator opened the spatial bag, revealing mountains of spirit stones piled up.</p><p></p><p>The second Celestial Palace realm cultivator came forward, opened his spatial bag, and Wind Taiyu spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"I see that Venerable Lord Gu has not yet opened the Celestial Palace realm, nor forged a great weapon embryo. This is an ancient ferrous mine that my Great Wind Clan has spent years collecting!"</p><p></p><p>An ancient ferrous mine!</p><p></p><p>This was a divine metal that could be ranked among the top ten in the Great Wilderness. The "ancient mine" meant the ferrous ore came from an ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>Around ten thousand years ago, the previous imperial era collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the nine states of the human race, most of the Great Wilderness preserved ancient remnants. Those were dangerous places, while demon lairs were not located within the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>The ancient ferrous mine came from the ancient ruins of the Great Wilderness, and was extremely difficult to mine.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the spatial bag was a piece weighing three thousand pounds!</p><p></p><p>It was enough to forge the embryo of a great weapon!</p><p></p><p>The third Celestial Palace realm cultivator opened his spatial bag.</p><p></p><p>Inside was only one object, a bronze piece the size of a palm, covered in verdigris.</p><p></p><p>But upon seeing this, even this Celestial Palace realm cultivator revealed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the Patriarch Wind Taiyu to gift this item to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the bronze piece with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>The palm-sized bronze piece did not seem to be a fragment fallen from any divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>But for the Great Wind Clan to present it as a gift, this intact bronze piece must be extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>"I see Venerable Lord is perplexed."</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu smiled, "When I first saw this bronze piece, my reaction was the same as yours."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's Mud Pill Palace!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch looked at this bronze piece, as if recalling something!</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wind Clan actually hid such a treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, with the Great Wind Clan's current strength, if word got out, they would be annihilated overnight."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan curiously asked the Eight Trigrams Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is this bronze piece?"</p><p></p><p>"A fragment of a divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>A fragment of a divine weapon?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stared at the bronze piece, looking at Wind Taiyu with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan was just giving away such a treasure?</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu explained to Gu Jiuqing, "Venerable Lord must also understand, at the end of the previous era, the celestial court fell, and one celestial after another disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"Among all the versions circulating in the Great Wilderness, the most well-known is that at the end of antiquity, a war broke out among the gods!"</p><p></p><p>This war among the gods led to the twilight of the gods!</p><p></p><p>One deity after another fell, and it was said that the patriarchs of the four great sects gained their power by dividing the remains of a deity.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze fragment is suspected to be a piece of a divine weapon shattered during the twilight of the gods in ancient times."</p><p></p><p>A fragment of a divine weapon!!</p><p></p><p>This was actually a piece of a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons were engraved with thousands of dao inscriptions, able to unleash terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand inscriptions made a great weapon!</p><p></p><p>Six thousand inscriptions made a supreme weapon!</p><p></p><p>If the inscriptions on a divine weapon exceeded nine thousand years, it could reach the realm of a divine weapon, becoming the embodiment of the Dao used by deities.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Realm of Communicating with the Divine generally possessed supreme weapons with six thousand inscriptions. The four great sects had ancient divine weapons due to their long heritage, but in the present era, none could refine a true divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's shocked expression, Wind Taiyu shook his head and sighed, "It's just a pity that the divinity of this divine weapon fragment has already dissipated, unable to unleash its power!"</p><p></p><p>"However, a fragment of a divine weapon is still a fragment. If you can find the other pieces of this divine weapon, you may be able to restore its original form!"</p><p></p><p>The great war during the twilight of the gods in antiquity must have been terribly ferocious, to even shatter divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took the three spatial bags, and casually stored the bronze fragment in his dantian, nourishing it with his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Under the nourishment of spiritual power, the bronze fragment showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>It did not shed its verdigris, nor emit any radiance, remaining an ordinary bronze piece.</p><p></p><p>"A fragment of a divine weapon! If I use the method Mentor Brother Liang Xiao taught me, placing the divine weapon fragment on the moon and using the Moonlight Grand Formation to etch the Dao patterns onto it, perhaps I can obtain a divine weapon!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing needed a great many divine weapons. The ancient ferrous mine could forge a great weapon embryo, but the bronze fragment was already formed, so it would be of greater help to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh——————"</p><p></p><p>The brilliant light of the ancient teleportation formation flickered, the six-rayed star rippling, signaling its activation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and the Great Wind Clan bid farewell. Before leaving, Wind Taiyu bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Following his bow, the other Celestial Palace realm cultivators of the Great Wind Clan also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Lord Gu has the destiny to achieve deity-hood. The Great Wind Clan is willing to follow and assist Venerable Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"May I ask if Venerable Lord is willing?"</p><p></p><p>This was a pledge of allegiance from an ancient clan!!</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu's words could represent the entire Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Great Wind Clan of Tianmu far surpassed the Lu Family, with dozens of Celestial Palace realm cultivators and scores of Realm of Communicating with the Divine experts.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the purposes of traveling the world.</p><p></p><p>If you do not travel the world, how can your talents be seen?</p><p></p><p>If the world cannot see your talents, how can you gain followers?</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan was shocked by Gu Jiuqing's talents, which is why Wind Taiyu made this gesture at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Those Celestial Palace realm cultivators all looked at Gu Jiuqing with hopeful eyes!</p><p></p><p>Awaiting his response.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stirred, looking at the Celestial Palace realm cultivators, then at the tribulation realm celestial.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that his position as the foremost follower was shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Mentor Brother Gu is too accomplished. As he travels the world, he will inevitably gain followers from ancient clans. Those long-lived clans cannot let Mentor Brother slip away."</p><p></p><p>"Although I followed Mentor Brother first, my strength is too weak. In the future, I cannot be of much help to Mentor Brother!"</p><p></p><p>So this is how followers compete!</p><p></p><p>It's so intense.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan felt he needed to re-plan his future path.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were on Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>The tribulation realm patriarch of the Great Wind Clan, the Celestial Palace realm cultivators, and Lu Yuan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>They were all waiting for Gu Jiuqing's response.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was also pondering!</p><p></p><p>He was the true disciple of the Sword Sect. The Sword Child of the sect had already been established, and barring any accidents, the position of Sect Master would be passed to him.</p><p></p><p>At most, Gu Jiuqing would inherit the Ming Ting Peak lineage and become an elder of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>An elder of one lineage?</p><p></p><p>Was that the future he wanted?</p><p></p><p>No, what he wanted was to achieve deity-hood and become a god!! If possible, he wanted to establish a divine court in the Great Wilderness and usher in the 19th imperial era!!</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan!</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient surname. In the eras of the previous 18 imperial dynasties, members of the Great Wind Clan had assisted the Celestial Emperor! There were even Great Wind Clan members who achieved deity-hood.</p><p></p><p>This surname carried the bloodline of gods.</p><p></p><p>But that was before the 18th imperial era.</p><p></p><p>To accept or not?</p><p></p><p>Accepting the Great Wind Clan would help Gu Jiuqing collect materials for divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Just this one benefit alone was enough!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the tribulation realm patriarch, his expression calm without the slightest change.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose the Great Wind Clan has also seen my strength."</p><p></p><p>His strength?</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu immediately recalled the scene of Gu Jiuqing subduing the Demon Emperor in the Six Realms Grand Formation!</p><p></p><p>At the realm of the Eight Tribulations Celestial, he could see that Gu Jiuqing's strength slightly surpassed the Demon Emperor's.</p><p></p><p>Such an accomplished person would undoubtedly reach the Three Realms in One in the future!</p><p></p><p>"You wish to become my follower and guard my path of cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>In their weak stages, cultivators seeking deity-hood need followers to protect them.</p><p></p><p>But did Gu Jiuqing need a tribulation realm cultivator's protection?</p><p></p><p>Ever since he assimilated the Six Realms Grand Formation, Gu Jiuqing gained the future body of the Great Dao - the body of an Eight Tribulations Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Unless a cultivator above the Three Realms in One, a pure yang patriarch, took action against him, he could move unobstructed in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the light in Wind Taiyu's eyes dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>What use did the Great Wind Clan have to this Venerable Lord?</p><p></p><p>To become Gu Jiuqing's follower?</p><p></p><p>That was just the Great Wind Clan's wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>"However, there is one matter where I need your assistance."</p><p></p><p>"I need a great quantity of astral spirit iron, lunar spirit stones, thousand-fold iron, and myriad-refined gold."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star and the moon could set up grand formations, but Gu Jiuqing had run out of spirit materials!</p><p></p><p>He needed more spirit materials to construct the Moonlight Grand Formation and formations to harvest astral energy and refine astral divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu was overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>He could clearly hear that Gu Jiuqing was giving the Great Wind Clan another chance.</p><p></p><p>Spirit materials?</p><p></p><p>That was nothing!</p><p></p><p>With the Great Wind Clan's strength in the Great Wilderness, collecting spirit materials would be simple.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly saying it!</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu nodded repeatedly!</p><p></p><p>"Please rest assured, Venerable Lord. Give the Great Wind Clan some time, and we will surely satisfy you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded, and together with Lu Yuan, entered the ancient teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant light flickered, the six-rayed star rippling.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Great Wind Clan members bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Venerable Lord!"</p><p>"Farewell, Venerable Lord!"</p><p>"Farewell, Venerable Lord!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Watching the disappearing figures, pure yang energy rippled from Wind Taiyu's body, a pure yang aura pervading the great marsh heavenly paradise.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Great Wind Clan cultivators, did you all hear Venerable Lord Gu's words just now?"</p><p></p><p>"Spirit materials are not rare in the nine states, and there are also many in the ancient ruins!"</p><p></p><p>"This old patriarch hopes that none of you will cause any trouble in this matter. I am not like those two celestials who are concerned about the Great Wind Clan's bloodline!!"</p><p></p><p>Among the three patriarchs of the Great Wind Clan, Wind Taiyu's talents were the weakest.</p><p></p><p>But he was the one the Great Wind Clan feared most!</p><p></p><p>Over ten Great Wind Clan members had died by his hand.</p><p></p><p>He truly would take lethal action against his clansmen.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Palace realm cultivators hurriedly pledged their compliance, saying they dared not cause any issues.</p><p></p><p>"I will go to Qingzhou Prefecture. Wind Xiang, you go to Yuzhou Prefecture and have the Prefect of Yuzhou assist with this matter!"</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>The Wind Xiang cultivator was hesitant.</p><p></p><p>To trouble the Prefect of Yuzhou over such a small matter?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that inappropriate?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Are you unwilling?"</p><p></p><p>The celestial aura descended, and the cultivator trembled.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I'll go right away!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Celestial Realm of Tianmu flickered, and rays of divine light flew out from the paradise.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou, Yuzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>An ancient teleportation formation!</p><p></p><p>Streams of light rippled, and people from other prefectures entered Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This was the</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That very day, the Buddha established the Buddhist order and accepted his first three followers as disciples. </p><p></p><p>He gave them the names Past, Future, and Present. The Three Worlds Buddha Descending Dharma was the cultivation method created by the Buddha after taking in these disciples.</p><p></p><p>After accepting these three chief disciples, the Buddha gradually took in four more Bodhisattvas over the years. </p><p></p><p>The current eighteen Arhats are the disciples the Buddha took in during his third round of accepting students.</p><p></p><p>The Arhat Great Help is one of these eighteen Arhats.</p><p></p><p>"There are no ranks among the eighteen Arhats, but if Great Help Arhat made it onto the Dragon and Tiger Roster, he would likely be ranked first among the eighteen Arhats."</p><p></p><p>There are not many disciples in the Buddhist order, and the Buddha has even fewer direct disciples. But the Buddhist order is able to guard the Small Western Heaven all by itself through its own strength!</p><p></p><p>It must have some unique strengths.</p><p></p><p>"What merit does Great Help Arhat, one of the eighteen Arhats, have to be listed on the roster?"</p><p></p><p>The storyteller heard the question from the crowd and thought to himself, "Good question."</p><p></p><p>He held up the Dragon and Tiger Roster and said again:</p><p></p><p>"This Arhat has already arrived in Youzhou Prefecture and fought against the traveling disciples of the Four Great Sects. The Arhat cultivated an eighteen-foot golden body, suppressing that Fierce Yang Sword Immortal of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Suppressing a Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>No wonder he made the roster. Just this achievement alone proves that Great Help Arhat has the strength of the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>Fierce Yang Shixiong is one of the three talents of the Sword Sect, but he was suppressed by Great Help Arhat!</p><p></p><p>In front of a true prodigy, Fierce Yang Shixiong was not even worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>He merely served as a stepping stone for others.</p><p></p><p>"That was just one of Great Help Arhat's achievements. This Arhat set up a great formation in Youzhou Prefecture, sealed off space, and challenged heroes from all paths!"</p><p></p><p>Because of the matter of the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord, Youzhou Prefecture was where the traveling disciples of the Four Great Sects gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Jun Wushang of the Astral Pavilion, a newly ascended Celestial Realm cultivator, was also suppressed by Great Help Arhat."</p><p></p><p>Shixiong Jun was defeated too?</p><p></p><p>After the Journey to Pursue the Moon ended, Gu Jiuqing had not heard any news about Jun Wushang, a cultivator of Confucian studies known for his righteousness. Yet he was still no match for the Buddhist Arhat?</p><p></p><p>"The son of the Prefect of Youzhou Prefecture was also defeated by Great Help Arhat. The number one talent of Youzhou, a scholar who studied at the Xixia Academy for decades, was defeated by Great Help Arhat!"</p><p></p><p>Achievement after achievement left the crowd speechless.</p><p></p><p>Great Help Arhat deserved his ranking on the Dragon and Tiger Roster.</p><p></p><p>But if the tenth-ranked Great Help Arhat was so powerful, how much stronger were those ranked above him?</p><p></p><p>The small wine tavern was packed with people.</p><p></p><p>The storyteller opened the Dragon and Tiger Roster, "Now I will announce the ninth and eighth ranks!"</p><p></p><p>"Ninth is Descending Dragon Arhat! Eighth is Subduing Tiger Arhat!"</p><p></p><p>The storyteller was stunned himself.</p><p></p><p>The ninth and eighth ranks were also Buddhist Arhats?</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Was there a mistake?</p><p></p><p>The storyteller opened the roster again, wiped his eyes, and confirmed it was correct before continuing:</p><p></p><p>"No, it's right. The ninth and eighth ranks on the Dragon and Tiger Roster are also Buddhist Arhats!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are there more Buddhist disciples? What merits do these two Arhats have to be ranked eighth and ninth? Is there an explanation on the roster?"</p><p></p><p>The storyteller looked and indeed there were detailed records.</p><p></p><p>Descending Dragon Arhat! Subduing Tiger Arhat! One cultivated the True Dragon God Body, one the White Tiger God Body. When they condensed their realms, they manifested the aura of ancient divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>These two joined the Buddha's order earlier than the other sixteen Arhats. They cultivated the three-zhang golden body method and have already surpassed two zhang, taller than Great Help Arhat's golden body by several degrees!!</p><p></p><p>No wonder they ranked higher than Great Help Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Then what about the seventh rank on the Dragon and Tiger Roster?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was restless.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to compete with the world's talents, and the emergence of the Dragon and Tiger Roster set the path for his competition.</p><p></p><p>Competing against those on the roster meant competing against the world's talents.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh rank is Great Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone should know the name Great Celestial Lord. With the opening of the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord, this Great Celestial Lord has been extremely busy."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I heard that many ladies at night hug portraits of Great Celestial Lord. Tsk tsk, one should aspire to be like Great Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"It's said that when Great Celestial Lord enters a brothel, he doesn't need to pay! Each calligraphic word from Great Celestial Lord is worth a thousand taels of gold. But there hasn't been any news about Great Celestial Lord recently, otherwise his ranking should be higher than seventh!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was strange.</p><p></p><p>The seventh-ranked Great Celestial Lord was actually Gu Linglong?</p><p></p><p>So his senior martial brother had already ranked seventh in the world before even arriving in Youzhou?</p><p></p><p>"The sixth rank on the Dragon and Tiger Roster is the Crown Prince of Great Zhou!" Upon hearing this, many were dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Crown Prince of Great Zhou only rank sixth?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he is the Crown Prince of our Great Zhou. His ranking should be first or at least second."</p><p></p><p>The storyteller hurriedly pointed to the sixth rank on the roster, "This ranking was determined by the Xixia Academy. I'm just reading it out."</p><p></p><p>"The Crown Prince of Great Zhou cultivates the Imperial Dao Extreme World Scripture. After fighting Great Celestial Lord, he broke through to the Celestial Realm. He was in secluded cultivation at Dragon Mausoleum but arrived in Youzhou Prefecture a few days ago!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mausoleum was where the Great Zhou imperial clan was buried.</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years ago, the first emperor of Great Zhou died prematurely and was buried in Dragon Mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>As for the other imperial clansmen of Great Zhou, none lived nearly that long. They died or disappeared, with many buried in Dragon Mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>For the current Crown Prince to seclude himself in Dragon Mausoleum, he must have obtained a great opportunity. Otherwise, he could not have ranked above Great Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth rank on the Dragon and Tiger Roster is Xuan Tianji!"</p><p></p><p>When this name appeared, the entire tavern fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled, as he had never heard of this person before.</p><p></p><p>The storyteller looked at the fifth rank and said the name again.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Tianji!"</p><p></p><p>"A top scholar of the Xixia Academy who proposed the Three Realms Theory. Due to disagreements with the Great Celebrant's ideas, he defected from the Xixia Academy and was pursued by the academy's scholars. In Youzhou Prefecture, he suppressed over a dozen Xixia scholars!"</p><p></p><p>Another great talent!</p><p></p><p>He dared to oppose the ideas of Master Ban Shansuo.</p><p></p><p>But with Master Ban's temperament, he would not punish Xuan Tianji.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the intention of the other Celebrants at the Xixia Academy.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was also very curious about what ideas this former Xixia student had that differed from Master Ban's, causing the other Celebrants to be so displeased that Xuan Tianji had to defect from the Xixia Academy!</p><p></p><p>The Xixia Academy was the holy land that scholars aspired to. </p><p></p><p>For Xuan Tianji to be admitted but then defect, there must be profound reasons behind it that could not be easily explained!</p><p></p><p>"The fourth rank is the Sacred Maiden of the Astral Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>"The third rank is the Sword Scion of the Sword Sect!"  </p><p></p><p>"The second rank is the Princess of Soaring Clouds, a Dao cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The storyteller listed the remaining three ranks in one breath.</p><p></p><p>These last three ranks carried immense weight!!</p><p></p><p>However, the Princess of Soaring Clouds lived hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Maiden of the Astral Pavilion and the Sword Scion were also from the past.</p><p></p><p>Only the Dao cultivator was unknown in terms of age.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Tiger Roster is ranked this way, with no explanation for why these few made the top four."</p><p></p><p>"The first rank on the Dragon and Tiger Roster is still vacant. It seems these human talents have not had a decisive battle to determine who is the number one genius of the current younger generation!"</p><p></p><p>The storyteller laughed at himself.</p><p></p><p>Younger generation?</p><p></p><p>The youngest among these cultivators was at least thirty-four, with others in their fifties, sixties, or even hundreds of years old.</p><p></p><p>Young?</p><p></p><p>Compared to them, this storyteller was the young one.</p><p></p><p>But for mortals, their lifespan was insignificant compared to cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The people in the tavern sighed in amazement at witnessing such a grand era with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were just ordinary people of this grand era, able to observe its prosperity.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, they could not personally witness it, only hearing about it through word of mouth.</p><p></p><p>Most of them could not even afford the five hundred spirit stones needed to take a teleportation formation to Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Yet there is no senior martial brother on the roster?"  </p><p></p><p>"This Dragon and Tiger Roster must be fake, right?"</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly spoke up, and all eyes turned towards Lu Yuan behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did not care!</p><p></p><p>He was just telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>During the Journey to Pursue the Moon, Gu Jiuqing took the Demon Lord's Eighth Prince as his master, who was a Celestial Realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>On the final day, Gu Jiuqing fought the Demon Lord's Crown Prince, battling a Tribulation Realm celestial!</p><p></p><p>Great Help Arhat?  </p><p></p><p>Descending Dragon and Subduing Tiger Arhats?</p><p></p><p>And that so-called Great Celestial Lord, did they dare compare?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Scion?</p><p></p><p>Well, Lu Yuan did not mean to belittle his own sect's Sword Scion, but the Sword Scion truly could not compare to his Senior Martial Brother Gu.</p><p></p><p>With the current Teenage Celestial Emperor walking the world, did the Xixia Academy not know?</p><p></p><p>There was a problem with this ranking.</p><p></p><p>The Dao cultivator, Princess of Soaring Clouds, Sacred Maiden of the Astral Pavilion - they had simply never witnessed Senior Martial Brother's talents!</p><p></p><p>If they encountered Senior Martial Brother, they would have to become his followers.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's words silenced the tavern. Looking at his attire, they knew he was a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They did not dare refute him, but also did not dare agree.</p><p></p><p>"You make a fair point!"</p><p></p><p>"Your first statement may not be true, but your second statement is quite realistic."</p><p></p><p>"My Buddhist order's three chief Arhats - Great Help Arhat's cultivation is a bit lower than the Descending Dragon and Subduing Tiger Arhats, but he should not be ranked tenth!"</p><p></p><p>A monk wearing a tattered robe stood outside the tavern, pressed his palms together, and bowed towards it.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>With this bow, the tavern shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom-----"</p><p></p><p>The wooden boards fell but froze in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shaken. As they were about to flee, they saw the shattered pieces of the tavern, including the floor beneath them, flying upwards.</p><p></p><p>The broken wooden boards reassembled themselves, forming a new tavern in mid-air. A path of condensed void also appeared, with golden lotuses blooming along it.</p><p></p><p>The monk stood up, his expression serene.</p><p></p><p>"I have borrowed your premises for a moment and returned to you a void tavern!"</p><p></p><p>A great cultivator!</p><p></p><p>This was a cultivator with profound divine powers.</p><p></p><p>He exerted precise control over his powers. In the instant the tavern collapsed, he manifested countless threads of energy to lift and reassemble the shattered pieces into a new tavern above. He even condensed the void to form golden lotuses!</p><p></p><p>After this day, the "Auspicious Clouds Tavern" would skyrocket in value and become the only tavern in Yuzhou Prefecture that could float in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The tavern keeper was overjoyed and bowed deeply to the monk before hurriedly walking up the lotus path to the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the tavern keeper's voice came from inside:</p><p></p><p>"Exactly the same! Exactly the same!"</p><p></p><p>"I thought my tavern was destroyed. Hahaha, hahaha."</p><p></p><p>The void tavern hovered high above Yuzhou Prefecture. Soon, officials and soldiers rushed over from afar.</p><p></p><p>However, the tattered monk did not seem rushed. Instead, he walked towards the original location of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>He sat down beneath the void tavern, pressed his palms together, and spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I am a monk from the Western Regions who joined the Buddhist order long ago. I have come to Yuzhou Prefecture today to spread the Dharma!"</p><p></p><p>One of the eighteen Arhats!</p><p></p><p>He was one of the eighteen disciples personally accepted by the Buddha in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>He had come to Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this, the officials and soldiers did not dare approach.</p><p></p><p>If it were another cultivator or a member of a prestigious Yuzhou clan, they would not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>But this was a disciple of one of the Four Great Sects, and moreover a disciple of the supreme leader.</p><p></p><p>They did not dare act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Aum!!</p><p></p><p>Buddhist light radiated from behind the tattered monk, enveloping the void tavern like the Grand Thunder Monastery within the Buddhist light.</p><p></p><p>The Aum Buddhist symbol blanketed the sky, merging with various figures.</p><p></p><p>Those people originally wanted to avoid the Aum symbol, but then they felt an unusual sensation.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the Buddhist light into their bodies, they felt refreshed, cured of all illnesses. Those who had hidden ailments saw them disappear. Some Spirit Transformation cultivators even experienced a minor transcendence, directly breaking through to the next realm!</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators comprehended the Buddhist Dharma, gaining profound insights and increasing their cultivation realms!!</p><p></p><p>"Who is spreading the Dharma in Yuzhou Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, Yuzhou Prefecture belongs to the Nine Prefectures of Great Zhou. Is the Buddhist order not satisfied with spreading the Dharma in the Western Regions and wants to convert Great Zhou as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Leave now, and you will be pardoned!"</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out from Yuzhou Prefecture as cultivators descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, which benefactors wish to take action against this poor monk?"</p><p></p><p>The tattered monk remained calm.</p><p></p><p>In front of him appeared several talents from Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>They never expected a disciple of the Buddha to enter Yuzhou Prefecture to spread the Dharma!!</p><p></p><p>Traveling the world to compete against other cultivators was one thing.</p><p></p><p>But the Buddhist disciples actually intended to spread the Buddhist teachings to mortals!</p><p></p><p>This was undermining the foundations of Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect, Dao Sect, Astral Pavilion - even if they recruited disciples, they would not intentionally enter the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Buddhist order did the opposite!</p><p></p><p>"That seems to be Young Master Tian Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"It's him!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd stirred, and even the officials and soldiers looked excited.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had also heard of Young Master Tian Yu from the surrounding conversations.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu was the son of the Prefect of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The son of a prefect going out would naturally cause a stir in Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This Young Master Tian Yu held a folding fan, had a jade-like handsome face, wore a long robe, and carried himself with great poise.</p><p></p><p>Beside him were two other young talents, members of prestigious Yuzhou clans, with cultivation bases at the Spirit Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this level of cultivation, they could become patriarchs of major clans in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The three Spirit Refinement cultivators released their powerful auras, a force that could shatter the void itself.</p><p></p><p>The crowd scattered, and even</p>

        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen ancient cities were arranged in a row, leading from Jianmen Pass all the way to the Great Zhou Dynasty's border. This border region was known as the Northern Lands. </p><p></p><p>In the Northern Lands, there were thirteen ancient cities.</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan Ancient City, Tianyuan Ancient City, Qingyang Ancient City, Shengxu Ancient City, Guiyuan Ancient City, Nandou Ancient City, Beidou Ancient City, Ziyang Ancient City, Taixu Ancient City, Huangtian Ancient City, Chongming Ancient City, Yueming Ancient City!</p><p></p><p>And the final desolate city!</p><p></p><p>The thirteen ancient cities had a long history. Legend said that when the old ancestor of Jianmen established Jianmen Pass, he moved an ancient divine mountain below Jianmen Pass and used it as the foundation to build this supreme sacred land. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he excavated ancient ruins in the Northern Lands, and these thirteen ancient cities were those primordial city ruins.</p><p></p><p>However, over so many years, the city ruins had been constantly renovated, and the ancient ruins had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Age, decay, vicissitudes - these could be seen everywhere across the ancient cities of the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan were traveling horizontally across the Northern Lands, not stopping at Tianyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>Passing through Tianyuan, heading to Tianyuan, stepping into Qingyang, entering Shengxu, they finally arrived at Guiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Guiyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>At the city gates.</p><p></p><p>This was the fifth ancient city of the Northern Lands. Outside this ancient city, Gu Jiuqing could clearly sense that there were more travelers coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Below the city gates, the figures of peddlers and patrolling soldiers were much taller than those in the other cities.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere one could see jade-like youths, vigorous men, and beautiful women!</p><p></p><p>"Tianyuan, Tianyuan, Qingyang, Shengxu, Guiyuan, Nandou, Beidou, Ziyang, Taixu, Huangtian, Chongming, Yueming, and the final desolate city - the thirteen ancient cities have very similar appearances. But starting from Guiyuan, they become more prosperous."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gazed at Guiyuan Ancient City and sighed.</p><p></p><p>He was a disciple of the Lu Family from Guiyuan Ancient City, having grown up inside the city since childhood. He had also visited the other cities in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>But none of the other cities could match the strong sense of hometown that Guiyuan Ancient City gave him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very curious about how the thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands got their names!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was born into a prestigious clan, specifically in Tianyuan Ancient City, so the places he had traveled were not many. Of the thirteen ancient cities in the Northern Lands, he had only been to three.</p><p></p><p>The first ancient city, the second ancient city, the third ancient city.</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan, Tianyuan, Qingyang!</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan seemed profound, with the ancient city giving off an unfathomable aura.</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan meant the primordial unity, the center of heaven and earth. In the Great Wilderness, Tianyuan Ancient City was right at the central position. Qingyang, the ancient city was full of vitality, representing the essence of wood. It had the most wood-type divine bodies within.</p><p></p><p>Each major ancient city had its own characteristics!</p><p></p><p>It seemed like Lu Yuan had thought of something, and he asked doubtfully, "Isn't there a legend circulating in the Northern Lands?"</p><p></p><p>"Has Senior Martial Brother Gu heard of it since coming out from the Northern Lands?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded. He knew the legend Lu Yuan was referring to.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Lands had existed for a very long time, tracing back to the end of the Primordial Chaos era when Jianmen was first established.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years of history had given rise to all sorts of legends in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>"The thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands were built from the thirteen vertebrae of a deity's incomplete spine."</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three vertebrae did not have a unified naming system. Later, the Scholastic Palace gave the names of the thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands to the first thirteen vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but which poor deity was so unlucky to have their spine dug out after death and refined into ancient cities!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, these thirteen ancient cities are ancient ruins, said to be city ruins from several eras ago."</p><p></p><p>Even if the thirteen ancient cities were refined from a deity's vertebrae, it couldn't have been done by the primordial founder of Jianmen.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed at Guiyuan Ancient City. The ancient city carried a hint of extinguished meaning, but beneath that extinguished meaning was a transcendent implication.</p><p></p><p>Guiyuan, to transcend the realm of life and death, returning to the true stillness and primordial origin.</p><p></p><p>This ancient city contained the meaning of extinguishment. Upon first seeing Guiyuan Ancient City, one would be enveloped by its true meaning.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, Gu Jiuqing finally withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>The ancient city was prosperous, with many cultivators present, but most were at the Mortal Realm, with only a few at the Realm of Spiritual Force.</p><p></p><p>After the time it took to burn an incense stick, an ancient manor appeared before Gu Jiuqing's eyes!</p><p></p><p>The Lu Manor!</p><p></p><p>Now that Lu Yuan had officially become Gu Jiuqing's follower, Gu Jiuqing naturally had to visit the Lu Family while in Guiyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>However, before Lu Yuan could enter to report their arrival, voices came from the main gate of the Lu Manor.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze swept over, and at the entrance of the Lu Manor, a crowd of onlookers had gathered.</p><p></p><p>At the steps below the manor, there were also a few disciples of the Lu Family lying fallen.</p><p></p><p>A melodious voice rang out from amidst the crowd, even entering the entire Lu Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Are the cultivators of the current Lu Family generation really this weak?"</p><p></p><p>"My noble family considers twenty-five years as one generation. If this is the case, then I'll give you four generations, a hundred years - will anyone from the younger generation of the Lu Family dare to compete against me, Ji Wangli?"</p><p></p><p>"If not, then the young cultivators of the Lu Family better not leave the manor. Stay inside the Lu Manor from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangli?</p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd murmured in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Ji Wangli blocking the entrance of the Lu Family manor. No wonder he dares to challenge the Lu Family - he's from a great noble clan."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, blocking someone's doorway and challenging them is tearing off all pretenses!"</p><p></p><p>In the Northern Lands, if cultivators wanted to determine superiority, they would first send a letter of challenge, issue a battle summons, and agree on a time and place before meeting on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Who would block someone's doorway like this?</p><p></p><p>This was usually the conduct of a noble clan towards a lesser clan!</p><p></p><p>Using their status to suppress the other party, to cultivate audacity and an undefeated spirit in their disciples.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Wangli was from a noble clan just like the Lu Family. How dare he act this way!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Lu Manor.</p><p></p><p>The newly built ancestral hall.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral tablets were densely packed. Below these densely packed tablets, the patriarch of the Lu Family was kneeling.</p><p></p><p>By his side, a stick of incense was burning, wisps of fragrant smoke rising and swirling around the ancestral tablets.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Lu Family patriarch stood several young members of the Lu Family.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family cultivated the Sun Divine Body, so there were not many disciples of the main branch. Up until now, there were only four branches remaining.</p><p></p><p>The first branch was the patriarch's own lineage, with Lu Yuan as his only descendant.</p><p></p><p>The second branch descended from an elder at the Celestial Spirit Realm. This elder had many descendants, but most were unaccomplished. This second branch had the most members in the Lu Family.</p><p></p><p>Of the current generation of Lu Family disciples under twenty-five, this second branch had two!</p><p></p><p>As for the other Lu Family disciple under twenty-five, he had already been scared speechless.</p><p></p><p>Besides this current generation of young Lu Family disciples, there were also a few cultivators from the past four generations within a hundred years! These few cultivators from the past four generations were at the Immortal Realm, having opened their divine bodies and begun cultivation. The primal essence of the Sun Divine Body flowed within them, wisps of solar aura enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>"This is the ancestral hall, if you want to act up, go outside!"</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch's voice was cold.</p><p></p><p>Those few elder cultivators trembled, suppressing the aura around their bodies as they stood quietly to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh——————"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Lu Family patriarch let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family!</p><p></p><p>Had truly declined.</p><p></p><p>To have someone block the entrance to the Lu Manor, and these young cultivators couldn't even fart in response?</p><p></p><p>What was so impressive about that Ji Wangli?</p><p></p><p>His talent was decent, but could he withstand ten of them in a battle royale?</p><p></p><p>Withstand ten, then twenty!</p><p></p><p>Useless trash.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch did not voice those three words.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the rows of ancestral tablets before him, a hint of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Huanxing! A junior genius of my Lu Family from one thousand five hundred years ago. He dominated Guiyuan Ancient City in that era. Lu Huanxing defeated the Xia Family, the Ji Family - back then the city lord of Guiyuan was from the Ji Family, but he still lost to my ancestor Lu Huanxing."</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand six hundred years ago, ancestor Lu Zhixing roamed the Northern Lands, challenging and overthrowing three ancient cities."</p><p></p><p>"And Lu Lusheng, Lu Taitian, and several other ancestors. When they were young, they dominated the Northern Lands, overthrowing the ancient cities and noble clans like it was child's play."</p><p></p><p>"But you all? You can't even deal with a single Ji Wangli? Letting him block our Lu Manor's entrance for three days?"</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch's voice echoed through the ancestral hall, audible across half the manor compound.</p><p></p><p>"You all carry the bloodline of the Lu Family's Sun Divine Body. How can it be inferior to the Ji Family's Celestial Hound Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>"Get out, all of you get out of the ancestral hall! Since Ji Wangli is blocking your entrance, then if you can't defeat him from today onwards, just obediently stay inside the manor!"</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch raged, and one by one, the Lu Family disciples hurriedly left the ancestral hall in a panic.</p><p></p><p>After they left, another figure appeared from the side, supporting the Lu Family patriarch as he stood up. Only then did he speak.</p><p></p><p>"This incident may not necessarily be a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"In the past, when ancestor Lu Huanxing defeated the Ji Family patriarch of that era, it caused the Ji Family to lose their position as city lord. Now that our Lu Family's Immortal has fallen, and the other elders are old and feeble."</p><p></p><p>"Ji Wangli is blocking our entrance? Then let him block it. It's just a loss of some reputation, a passing cloud."</p><p></p><p>Better than the Ji Family secretly targeting the Lu Family disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xingyuan ah, this matter is not as simple as you think."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xingyuan!</p><p></p><p>He was the decision-maker of the third branch of the Lu Family. His grandfather was an Immortal of the Lu Family who had comprehended the Celestial Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter. The Ji Family can't possibly want to unleash a great weapon within Guiyuan Ancient City, can they?"</p><p></p><p>A great weapon required the presence of an Immortal. But within the ancient cities of the Northern Lands, one could not unleash great weapons!</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Lu Family had truly declined.</p><p></p><p>Even the decision-maker of the third branch could only see the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly barged into the ancestral hall, an old man who had entered from the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Lu Yuan has returned!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch frowned. Why had Lu Yuan come down from Jianmen Pass at this moment?</p><p></p><p>He should be staying by that Immortal's side, why had he come down the mountain?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>That Immortal had come down the mountain?</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family patriarch tensed as he asked the old man, "Did you see if there was a young master standing beside Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>The old man had no cultivation, he was just an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>He thought carefully for a moment before nodding.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"There seems to be a young master, wearing a blue robe and shirt!" </p><p></p><p>It's him!!</p><p></p><p>The sword sect's top expert, the cultivator that the Lu Family follows, has arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Yuan, quickly go and invite your second uncle, third uncle, and a few other venerable ancestors out."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xing Yuan did not dare neglect this, and hurriedly went out of the ancestral hall. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, throughout the Lu Residence, powerful auras were awakening one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that young man standing next to Lu Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be the top expert from the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"It's him!"</p><p></p><p>"Scared?"</p><p></p><p>"What is there to be afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>At the Lu Residence, in the distance, on the top floor of a wine tavern.</p><p></p><p>Two people gazed across the river, their eyes flickering with a divine light, perfectly able to see everything happening at the entrance of the Lu Family's residence.</p><p></p><p>"That sword sect's top expert has quite a reputation in the sect, but who knows."</p><p></p><p>One person wore a long robe with six leaves, clearly someone from the Ji Family.</p><p></p><p>Sitting next to the Ji Family member was an old man with sparse hair, appearing like the remaining rays of the setting sun in his twilight years.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're helping my Ji Family, you must have a foolproof plan. That so-called true disciple of the sword sect is nothing. Without reaching the Heavenly Palace realm, I can suppress him with a wave of my hand!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the true disciples and elders of the sword sect are the pillars of the sect. They cannot intervene in the affairs of the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family member smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The old man grabbed a handful of his sparse hair and plucked out two strands. He casually tossed them away.</p><p></p><p>The strands were dull, without any spiritual light, their spiritual nature already gone.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, without a Heavenly Palace cultivator from the Lu Family to suppress them, it's time to reshuffle the positions of the great families in the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Ji Family member hurriedly asked, "This time, how many great families in the Northern Lands need to be repositioned?"</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled but did not speak, only holding up two fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Two great families?"</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head, "Twenty great families!"</p><p></p><p>How many great families were there in the Northern Lands?</p><p></p><p>Xia, Qing, Ji, Fan Shao, Ye...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Ji Family member mentally went through all the great families within the thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of thirty-four great families in the Northern Lands!</p><p></p><p>And now, this old man wanted to take down twenty of them??</p><p></p><p>Even he couldn't help being startled.</p><p></p><p>Such a grand scheme!</p><p></p><p>Truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Sir is a great talent!"</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family member hurriedly raised a cup of wine and drained it, toasting the old man.</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled faintly, "It's not that I have talent, but that you all lack it."</p><p></p><p>This...?</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family member did not dare refute.</p><p></p><p>Below the Lu Family residence.</p><p></p><p>On each step leading up, there were traces of dried blood, evidence of the Lu Family members bleeding after being challenged by Ji Wang Li.</p><p></p><p>The blood on the steps had long coagulated. A youth of around twenty-two sat blocking the main entrance to the Lu Residence.</p><p></p><p>Through the door crack, one could see pairs of eyes staring out in trepidation at Ji Wang Li.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li looked at those eyes peeking through the crack, the corners of his mouth curling up in a smile.</p><p></p><p>Weak!</p><p></p><p>Too weak!</p><p></p><p>This younger generation of the Lu Family, he could suppress them all with one hand.</p><p></p><p>He had already begun body cultivation, condensing sixteen origin nodes on Mount Buzhou. His Heavenly Hound Divine Body was about to take minor form!</p><p></p><p>Some of these Lu Family disciples had not even shed their mortal forms yet!</p><p></p><p>How could they possibly be his match?</p><p></p><p>"The clan has allowed me free rein, heh heh. Then I'll just block the main entrance of the Lu Residence for three days and three nights. No, I'll come and block it periodically. Let's see if the Lu Family will still have the face to remain in Guiyuan Ancient City after this!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a cold snort, the tremendous sound shaking the doors and causing the few Lu Family disciples peeking from behind to instantly fall to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he nonchalantly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>How quiet!</p><p></p><p>When he closed his eyes, no voices of praise arose around him.</p><p></p><p>Were these commoners not stunned by his dashing demeanor just now?</p><p></p><p>Why was there no praise?</p><p></p><p>No, Ji Wang Li suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li's expression changed, recognizing this as Lu Yuan who had joined the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>A Lu Family disciple who had joined the Sword Sect decades ago.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Young Master Lu Yuan returning."</p><p></p><p>He calmly stood up, not obstructing Lu Yuan's path forward.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know Lu Yuan's cultivation level, he remembered the Ji Family Patriarch's instructions about him.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to mock Lu Yuan. If he ended up getting beaten down, it would only damage his morale.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan frowned slightly. Why was this brat being so polite?</p><p></p><p>Even letting him pass?</p><p></p><p>"This is the entrance to my Lu Family's residence. Ji Wang Li, this is not a place you should be loitering!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ji Wang Li simply stood up and looked at Lu Yuan with a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>"What? Does Young Master Lu Yuan also wish to challenge me in battle?"</p><p></p><p>"However, Young Master Lu is decades my senior. If you attack me, even if you win, it won't sound good when word spreads."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li also felt a bit apprehensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lu Yuan was a disciple of the Sword Sect who had cultivated for decades. If he didn't have to fight, that would be best.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Yuan didn't care about such things!</p><p></p><p>A voice rang out from the crowd, "Junior Brother, don't be rash."</p><p></p><p>From the crowd, a young man in a blue robe and shirt stepped out.</p><p></p><p>His age wasn't great, but he exuded a youthful charm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm also half a member of the Lu Family, and my age isn't that old either, still part of this younger generation."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his hand, and a strand of hair appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ji Wang Li and said indifferently, </p><p></p><p>"I won't take advantage of you either. If you can lift this strand of hair, I'll make the Lu Family leave Guiyuan Ancient City."</p><p></p><p>"If you can't lift this strand of hair, then please leave the Lu Family residence."</p><p></p><p>His indifferent voice echoed through the crowd, and the onlookers all turned to look at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>They were all stunned by Gu Jiuqing's boastful words!</p><p></p><p>Challenging with a strand of hair?</p><p></p><p>Has he gone mad?</p><p></p><p>This was just a broken strand of hair, about two palms long, with a rough broken end, without any spiritual nature - just an ordinary strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>There was no infusion of spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>Yet he dared to make such an exaggerated challenge?</p><p></p><p>And even staked the entire Lu Family on it?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan burst into raucous laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear what my Senior Brother Gu said?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ji Family has been targeting my Lu Family for days, and today even my Senior Brother Gu can no longer watch idly!"</p><p></p><p>"Ji Wang Li! Could it be that you don't dare to accept?"</p><p></p><p>"My Senior Brother Gu is a true disciple of the Sword Sect, and is actually a few years younger than you. A contest between your generations - do you accept?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan raised his eyebrows arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li, you were quite the smooth talker just now, weren't you?</p><p></p><p>Why are you silent now?</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li reined in his emotions and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't dare, but that I'm surprised by this Sword Sect true disciple's words."</p><p></p><p>How heavy could a strand of hair be?</p><p></p><p>He was a cultivator at the Incomplete Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It's just, can this Sword Sect true disciple's words be taken at face value?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course they can!"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from inside the Lu Residence - it was the Lu Family Patriarch appearing!</p><p></p><p>Following the Lu Family Patriarch's appearance, terrifying auras emanated from inside the residence as several venerable ancestors awakened one by one.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Refinement experts, emerging into the world!</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li said no more. He looked at Gu Jiuqing with a faint smile, and after three breaths, a rumbling sound came from his flesh body as the seventeenth vertebra was also enveloped by his Heavenly Hound origin energy.</p><p></p><p>"Please!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li let out a loud shout, and rays of divine light radiated from his entire body.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of his flesh, a glazed luster shone.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power surged, and the nine-cycled spirit pill in his dantian even hovered above his head like a bright moon, dripping spiritual power to envelop his whole body.</p><p></p><p>His partially-formed divine body unfolded, and the vague image of a Heavenly Hound flowed over his body's surface.</p><p></p><p>His seventeen vertebrae were all unblocked, and Ji Wang Li's body swelled to over ten feet tall, his clothes bursting apart.</p><p></p><p>"What? This is a partially-formed divine body! Ji Wang Li actually cultivated to the seventeenth vertebra?"</p><p></p><p>Cries of astonishment rang out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The seventeenth vertebra allowed one to condense a partially-formed divine body, greatly enhancing the power of the flesh!</p><p></p><p>A strand of hair? Even if you're a divine weapon, so what?</p><p></p><p>Without infusing it with spiritual power, how heavy could an ordinary divine weapon be?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing extended his arm and pulled out a strand of hair, letting it drift in the air.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li reached out and grabbed this strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, there will be no more Lu Family in Guiyuan Ancient City!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li could already envision the scene of him inheriting the position of Ji Family Patriarch in the future.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>His arm shook, an unimaginable weight transmitting from this single strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, there's deception!"</p><p></p><p>He knew this strand of hair couldn't be taken away so easily.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Grasping Divine Arm Technique!"</p><p></p><p>It was a low-grade divine ability!</p><p></p><p>An arm grew out from Ji Wang Li's back, its rippling waves condensing moonlight as it descended to support Ji Wang Li's physical arm.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't all!</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li was being too cautious!</p><p></p><p>"Where is the nine-cycled spirit pill?"</p><p></p><p>The spirit pill circulating above his head instantly moved to prop up his physical arm!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power, divine ability, and physical body!</p><p></p><p>The three powers combined!</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator with a partially-formed divine body, Ji Wang Li exerted his full strength. He revealed a smile as he grasped this strand of hair!</p><p></p><p>"Making a bit too much of this. For Ji Wang Li to be so cautious shows he's giving this Sword Sect true disciple enough face. When word of this spreads, no one will say Ji Wang Li was in the wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Unleashing physical body, spiritual power and divine abilities together, even if it were a mountain, he could easily lift it. Did this Sword Sect true disciple really think his face alone could make Ji Wang Li back down?"</p><p></p><p>What a pity!</p><p></p><p>Ji Wang Li was being stubborn and insisting on this confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Now, how would this Sword Sect true disciple explain himself to the Lu Family?</p><p></p><p>It was rather amusing. The onlookers wore expressions of watching a play unfold, all wondering how this Sword Sect true disciple would look flustered and at a loss next.</p><p></p><p>"Boom ------------------"</p><p></p><p>The ground sank, and Ji Wang Li's figure vanished into it!</p><p></p><p>A deep pit appeared where he had been standing.</p>

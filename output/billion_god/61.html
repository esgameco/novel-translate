        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The main subject was right in front of him. Gu Jiuqing held the letter, feeling a bit nervous. </p><p></p><p>He didn't know!</p><p></p><p>Whether the Celestial Goddess had seen this letter or not.</p><p></p><p>This was just an ordinary letter, without any infusion of magical powers or divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could read it.</p><p></p><p>As if hearing Gu Jiuqing's thoughts, a voice came from the Celestial Goddess in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, do not worry. This palace does not stoop to such petty behavior."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt awkward.</p><p></p><p>His elder sister had arranged too many potential spouses for him.</p><p></p><p>First it was the Goddess of the Luo River, and now came this Celestial Goddess!</p><p></p><p>Had Gu Linglong forgotten the Celestial Goddess's identity?</p><p></p><p>She was the disciple of a major sect. Even if he took a fancy to the Celestial Goddess, she could not possibly marry him.</p><p></p><p>Unless!</p><p></p><p>He married into her family!</p><p></p><p>There was still a slim possibility.</p><p></p><p>In the letter, a newly introduced name, Chu Xiangyu, would be the third potential spouse that Gu Linglong would introduce to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was now somewhat apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of the Luo River was the goddess of the northern lands! Her reputation resounded throughout the north, and behind her was the power of an influential northern aristocratic family!</p><p></p><p>And the status of the Celestial Goddess was even more terrifying. Backed by the Celestial Palace, she was the future supreme leader of the next generation of the Celestial Palace. She might even cultivate into a deity in the future. At the very least, she was a formidable figure close to godhood, capable of being ranked among the four greatest powers in the world!</p><p></p><p>Then what about Chu Xiangyu?</p><p></p><p>The status of this potential spouse should not be low either.</p><p></p><p>[By the way, little brother, your calligraphy and paintings have received a good response in the Great Zhou. When will you send some of your works to your sister? Over these years, I have done well in business and opened up trade routes across the nine states, even reaching the barbarian tribes beyond.</p><p></p><p>After some time, I will send you a sum of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It has been a few months already. How is your cultivation going? Have you made any progress in the Three Zhang Golden Body technique? Cultivating this method requires comprehending Buddhist dharma. With your mastery of the arts of zither, chess, calligraphy and painting, you should be able to comprehend the Buddhist dharma quickly.</p><p></p><p>I have already purchased a genuine painting of the Buddha from a barbarian. I will send it to you along with the next delivery.]</p><p></p><p>The letter also mentioned at the end:</p><p></p><p>[You are not young anymore. You and I are the only ones left in the Gu family. While I am out working hard, you need to take on the responsibility of continuing our family line. But do not be too picky. If you take a fancy to someone, just tell me, and I will help you get her.]</p><p></p><p>Apart from the useless first half of this letter, the second half revealed a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>Sister would send another large sum of spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was preparing to open the path to the Blue Star and the Moon, and activating the ancient teleportation formation required spirit stones! This could resolve Gu Jiuqing's worries.</p><p></p><p>And there was also the genuine painting of the Buddha!</p><p></p><p>The pages recording the Three Zhang Golden Body technique had been taken away by the Goddess of the Luo River.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation method was already imprinted in Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had not taken out this cultivation technique was that he was worried the people of the Blue Star might not be able to cultivate it successfully.</p><p></p><p>With the genuine painting of the Buddha, allowing the people of the Blue Star to comprehend the true meaning of the Buddha, there was a slim possibility they could successfully cultivate the Three Zhang Golden Body technique.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing put away the letter, and only then looked towards the Celestial Goddess.</p><p></p><p>She had walked over to a wall inside the divine palace.</p><p></p><p>The wall had been pierced through, leaving a huge hole.</p><p></p><p>"This must have been pierced through by sword energy."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess looked towards the hole, and saw the innermost cultivation room beyond it.</p><p></p><p>"You, young man, were not careful enough during your cultivation, almost destroying your own palace."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to be with you in the future, wouldn't I be suffering for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Jiuqing had finished reading the letter, the Celestial Goddess joked.</p><p></p><p>"However, you only joined the Sword Sect two or three months ago, yet you have already cultivated such fierce sword energy."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess suddenly changed her tone. "This is not sword energy, this is sword intent. You are cultivating the flying sword pellet technique, imbuing your sword intent into flying swords. Formless like water, bending around your fingers. You have already completed the cultivation of the flying sword pellet technique."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was startled.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at this damaged wall, the Celestial Goddess had deduced Gu Jiuqing's level of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Such insight was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"There was a temporary breakthrough, which allowed me to condense the flying sword into a pellet."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess looked again at the hole in the wall.</p><p></p><p>She reached out and touched the edge of the hole, as if sensing the remnants of the sword intent left behind.</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent should be no less than the fifth level of sword intent."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess looked at Gu Jiuqing and parted her ruby lips. "You have already cultivated to the semi-immortal sword realm!!"</p><p></p><p>The semi-immortal sword realm at such a young age?</p><p></p><p>Just from less than three months of sword cultivation??</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess was greatly moved.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"It cannot compare to the cultivation of the Celestial Goddess!"</p><p></p><p>After his travels in the illusory realm, Gu Jiuqing's insight had greatly improved. He looked at the star halos surrounding the Celestial Goddess!</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Goddess was enveloped in starlight, her mysterious gauze robes forbidding any prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>She was too mysterious, no less so than Sixian and Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Sixian's insight was unmatched in the world, yet such a peerless genius had joined the Sword Sect! Gu Jiuqing could not fathom it.</p><p></p><p>And then there was Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Renowned as the madman of the Nameless Peak, he had cultivated the divine demon visualization technique, only to sever it later! Studying demonic arts, he had planted three hundred seeds of divine abilities on Mount Wuzhou!</p><p></p><p>It took three hundred and sixty-five divine warriors to suppress his celestial aperture, and there were still major artifacts suppressing him on Mount Wuzhou!</p><p></p><p>A figure at the celestial realm could easily slay those at the tribulation realm, defying the heavens with ease.</p><p></p><p>And the mystery surrounding this Celestial Goddess before him seemed no less than those two...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, your elder sister suppressed me once, and then the Prince of Zhou suppressed me. If it weren't for your sister rescuing me, I wouldn't have been able to come to Sword Gate to see you."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>That Great Celestial Venerable was actually played by my elder sister.</p><p></p><p>But why did my sister have to take on the identity of the Great Celestial Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Your elder sister is truly a celestial prodigy, dominating the ancient celestial tombs of the celestial venerables. No one is her match, even the elders of the previous generation are no match for her."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars spoke of Gu Linglong with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Elder sister, elder sister, you even deceived me by saying you were a traveling merchant in the Nine Provinces, and now the Celestial Goddess of Stars has revealed your background!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was full of doubts in his heart!</p><p></p><p>Why was Gu Linglong so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Was this still the elder sister he knew?</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, within the ancient ruins in the Nine Provinces of Great Zhou, the Goddess was only suppressed by an avatar!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Celestial Goddess of Stars, whose starlight broke through the palace and scattered onto the star rings, and said uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Goddess walks in her true form at Sword Gate, and this starlight is the Goddess's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Celestial Goddess of Stars!</p><p></p><p>Reassemble your cultivation!</p><p></p><p>She has more than one avatar!!</p><p></p><p>At first, Gu Jiuqing didn't think the Celestial Goddess of Stars had avatars, until he saw her summon the starlight to form star rings.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow Divine Body has the Curse-Killing Primordial Divine Ability. The boundless sunlight can be transformed into divine fire, using the power of the sun to burn cultivators!</p><p></p><p>This allowed Gu Jiuqing to realize that the boundless starlight was the Celestial Goddess of Stars' cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars reassembled her true form, condensing the cultivation from her avatars into her main body.</p><p></p><p>This made the Celestial Goddess of Stars appear like a celestial maiden descending from the ninth heaven, like a primordial deity incarnate.</p><p></p><p>"The two Sword Immortals of Sword Gate didn't notice my trail, but you saw through my true form."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars stared at Gu Jiuqing, the star rings surrounding the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>"You are the paramount Sword Immortal, reaching the half-step Sword Immortal realm in less than three months. This is no falsehood. Your sister used the Nine Cycles of Longevity Divine Ability of the Longevity Celestial Venerable to invite me to meet you."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars continued staring at Gu Jiuqing, her star-like dress scattering to reveal her fair skin.</p><p></p><p>An arrogant demeanor was displayed.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a thin undergarment, her exquisite beauty was fully revealed.</p><p></p><p>"At first I refused, but after your sister said you were a celestial prodigy, I thought Gu Linglong was lying. After seeing you today, I realize your sister was underestimating you."</p><p></p><p>"With your talent, you have the prospect of becoming a deity in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Divine light!</p><p></p><p>Dazzling divine light emerged from the Celestial Goddess of Stars' body.</p><p></p><p>The starlight disappeared, fully absorbed by the Celestial Goddess of Stars. The star ring dress collapsed, leaving only the divine light attached to her celestial body.</p><p></p><p>That exceptionally beautiful face was also seen by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Eyes like stars, like the sun and moon, engraved in her pupils, so bright and charming.</p><p></p><p>Eyebrows curved like the crescent moon!</p><p></p><p>Cherry lips, exhaling fragrance, an exotic scent wafting in the palace.</p><p></p><p>A celestial maiden!</p><p></p><p>A beauty even more enchanting than the Goddess of the Luo River by three parts!!</p><p></p><p>No wonder she could attract eighty-one followers!</p><p></p><p>Even the disciples of great clans and longevity families could not remain unaffected!</p><p></p><p>"You will marry into my Celestial Star Sect and become my husband!"</p><p></p><p>"How about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars' eyes were so alluring!</p><p></p><p>As if spring itself was overflowing, making one unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>This was the decision the Celestial Goddess of Stars made after much contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong!</p><p></p><p>Born lowly, but able to shake the heavens and earth, destined to become an influential figure.</p><p></p><p>And her younger brother, Gu Jiuqing, the paramount Sword Immortal, had just joined Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing married into her sect, the Celestial Star Sect would gain two future cultivators close to deities!</p><p></p><p>And she was ultimately a woman, finding a Dao partner was an inevitable part of her cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>To seek one in the future?</p><p></p><p>Or to choose one now!</p><p></p><p>A beauty by one's side, with bright eyes and white teeth.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart wavered.</p><p></p><p>But to marry in!</p><p></p><p>He could not possibly agree, and even if he did, Gu Linglong would not agree.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess' kindness is appreciated, but Jiuqing cannot accept."</p><p></p><p>He smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"If the Goddess wishes, Jiuqing can reserve a concubine's position for the Goddess in the future!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!"</p><p></p><p>"Very well, but you'll have to wait until this young master cultivates to deity!"</p><p></p><p>"If this young master can cultivate to deity, this concubine is willing to serve him day and night."</p><p></p><p>Become a deity?</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the Celestial Star Sect, the patriarchs of Sword Gate, the Dao Venerables, and the Buddhas, all failed to reach deity!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess of Stars left!</p><p></p><p>She departed the Celestial Sword Palace, bidding farewell to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This primordial deity incarnate was once again covered by the star dress, her face concealed.</p><p></p><p>Watching the departing Celestial Goddess of Stars, the corners of Gu Jiuqing's mouth curved upwards.</p><p></p><p>Let's set a small goal first,</p><p></p><p>Cultivate to deity!</p><p></p><p>And take the Celestial Goddess of Stars into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>This was her own words, Gu Jiuqing did not force the Celestial Goddess of Stars.</p><p></p><p>Another 3,000 words, full of sincerity!</p><p></p><p>Begging for your support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

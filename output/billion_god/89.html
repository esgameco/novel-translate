        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Wilderness, the Moon!</p><p></p><p>An ancient and massive divine ship hovered above the moon. </p><p></p><p>This brilliant moon once again welcomed the baptism of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Divine banners fluttered, and the brilliance emanating from the condensed moon became even brighter. Below the sails, three Sword Immortals and Gu Jiuqing gazed at the sword disciples before them.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty days! You have thirty days. After thirty days, you need to board the ship and return to the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"There are tidal storms and elemental magnetic storms on the moon that erupt once a month. With your current cultivation, encountering an elemental magnetic storm would undoubtedly mean death!"</p><p></p><p>The tidal storms on the moon were the first wave. The lunar radiance eruption - just the rampant lunar radiance alone could grind cultivators into dust.</p><p></p><p>The second wave, the elemental magnetic storm, was an intensified version of the tidal storm that could bring down even cultivators at the Heavenly Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>"During this period, you must hand over half of whatever spoils you obtain on the moon to the sect."</p><p></p><p>"And one more thing, remember this - if you encounter disciples from other sects on the moon, strike first without hesitation if you must fight. Do not leave any evidence behind. If evidence is left, the sect cannot side with you!"</p><p></p><p>Flame Sword Immortal spoke plainly.</p><p></p><p>The order of the Wilderness did not apply on the moon. </p><p></p><p>Sect disciples were prohibited from fighting to the death, but if they encountered disciples from other sects and dealt with it cleanly, the Sword Sect would not say much.</p><p></p><p>However, if it was not handled cleanly and evidence was left behind, the Sword Sect would not jeopardize its relationship with the Constellations Pavilion for the sake of one disciple.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly referring to the Constellations Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Sword Sect disciples on the deck revealed looks of surprise, but they quickly regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>There were too few heavenly materials in the Wilderness. After so many years of excavation, a 500-year-old supreme grade spirit herb was considered a Herb King.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Qu Family sent an 800-year-old Demonic King herb as a reconciliation gift - that was already an extravagant gesture.</p><p></p><p>But on the moon, 500-year supreme herbs were not uncommon. One could even find millennium-old supreme herbs!</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't want to claim such precious herbs for themselves?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, and one last point - there is a group of undying elders meditating on the moon. Do not disturb these undying elders under any circumstances!"</p><p></p><p>To be able to meditate and survive the monthly tidal storms, the cultivation of these undying elders must have reached the pinnacle of the Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>They were ancient relics from thousands of years ago!</p><p></p><p>To be suppressed by such supreme beings would mean utter defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Now, you may all disembark."</p><p></p><p>With Flame Sword Immortal's command, the disciples flew out from the divine moon ship.</p><p></p><p>A group of lower cultivation disciples walked near the divine ship, able to quickly return if any issues arose.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, those who had reached the Untroubled Realm, including a few true disciples, flew directly deeper into the moon.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Gu Jiuqing and the others remained on the divine moon ship.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Jiuqing did not leave, Flame Sword Immortal laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"True Disciple Gu, this is your first time treading the moon. We three Immortals will guard the divine moon ship."</p><p></p><p>Cold Sword Immortal also nodded. "You can fully experience the moon. The scenery here is vastly different from the Wilderness, Senior Brother can take it all in."</p><p></p><p>Wind True Disciple smiled slightly. He and Cold Sword Immortal flew out of the divine moon ship. The three Sword Immortals would each guard for ten days, perfectly aligning with the day of return.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Gu Jiuqing did not stand on ceremony. He bowed to Flame Sword Immortal who was guarding the divine moon ship, then flew out with Lu Yuan following behind.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left the divine moon ship, a chilling sensation enveloped their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Lu Yuan shuddered. "So cold!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan cultivated the Sun Physique, making the moon an unsuitable place for his cultivation. However, he could still collect rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>A pounding sound reverberated from within Gu Jiuqing's body. What was this?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan dared not ask further. Hugging the Taiyi Divine Sword, he followed closely behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Within the dantian...</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing once again condensed his nine-zhang spiritual power into a massive spirit pill and thrust it towards the Untroubled Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand two hundred dragon and elephant images coalesced into a divine figure, pounding the spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>Dong dong dong!!!</p><p>Boom boom boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The spirit pill was like a divine iron being forged by the divine figure, constantly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power was condensed within the spirit pill, becoming tougher. This was the second time Gu Jiuqing had tempered his own spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>After being tempered to the extreme this time, the spirit pill also became the size of a grain of rice. Only then did the divine figure stop.</p><p></p><p>The rice-sized spirit pill contained the spiritual power equivalent to two nine-zhang realms. If unleashed from the dantian, even a strand of the initial power could collapse a building!</p><p></p><p>The spirit pill orbited the Untroubled Mountain dozens, hundreds of times before settling into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>"After two temperings, the spirit pill's flight speed is quite fast. Although not as fast as a sword, if unleashed unexpectedly, it can also slay enemies."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was very satisfied with the tempered spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the spiritual power flowing out from the Nine Wondrous Paths was still too little, and his nine-zhang dantian was not large enough.</p><p></p><p>If he could open it to ninety-zhang or nine-hundred-zhang, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the people of Planet Blue have yet to cultivate spiritual power, so for now I can only condense it myself."</p><p></p><p>After this journey on the moon, Gu Jiuqing had to research a method to cultivate spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>That way, he only needed to control the dragons and elephants to keep tempering the spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>Two temperings was nothing - to temper it that many times would require a dantian with nine-thousand-zhang of spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pulled back his thoughts and continued waiting for the Nine Wondrous Paths to flow more spiritual power to fill his dantian.</p><p></p><p>He surveyed the surrounding lands!</p><p></p><p>The terrain on the moon was somewhat different from the Wilderness. Lunar radiance was dense and flowed everywhere. There were no trees or flowers, only spirit plants could grow on the moon - spirit trees and spirit grass, all of value.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, barren mountains were the most common sight.</p><p></p><p>Range after range of hills undulated endlessly, desolate and devoid of human presence. One could travel hundreds of miles without seeing a single person.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the land, then up at the Wilderness above, making a judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go this way!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan followed without question.</p><p></p><p>No matter what Senior Brother Gu did, there was purpose behind it.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to follow.</p><p></p><p>The two flew through the air, dispersing the lunar radiance into rippling white waves in their wake, heading towards the distant ripples.</p><p></p><p>A cold pool!</p><p></p><p>On the moon, a cold pool had actually formed!</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a heavenly treasure.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai stared fixatedly at this cold pool.</p><p></p><p>The cold pool was four feet deep, emanating a dim glow. The surrounding soil was soaked, tinged with the cold pool's properties and giving off a faint chilling radiance.</p><p></p><p>Just standing at a distance, the two of them could sense its profound nature.</p><p></p><p>Though Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai's cultivations were low, in order to recoup their journey, after disembarking from the divine moon ship, they had flown straight north without stopping to search.</p><p></p><p>They crossed numerous mountain ranges and found a few spirit plants, but nothing as valuable as this cold pool.</p><p></p><p>A strand of spiritual power rippled in the air, forming an arm that reached into the cold pool.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou wanted to scoop out some of the cold pool water!</p><p></p><p>But as the spiritual power arm entered the pool, it dissipated!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power merged into the cold pool, disappearing completely, leaving only a few ripples on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to take the cold pool water!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's heart raced with excitement - this meant the cold pool was even more precious.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how many millions of years it took for the four feet of cold pool water to condense from the lunar radiance!</p><p></p><p>This was a divine liquid born from the essence of the moon, possessing boundless miraculous properties.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai extended his hand and took out a precious gourd from his cosmic bag.</p><p></p><p>He controlled the gourd to fly towards the cold pool. The gourd's mouth dipped into the cold pool water, quickly filling up!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou looked at the gourd in astonishment. Her spiritual power dissipated upon touching the cold pool water, yet this gourd could contain so much of it!</p><p></p><p>A rare treasure indeed!</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai carefully retrieved the gourd and placed it back into his cosmic bag before explaining.</p><p></p><p>"This is a cosmic gourd forged by the Great Zhou Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>The cosmic gourd did not contain an actual cosmos, but could store all things. It was said that even the divine iron used to forge thousand-streamed divine weapons and great artifacts could be stored within.</p><p></p><p>Such a gourd was worth at least eight hundred spirit stones, yet no one would sell it.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, my clan only has one cosmic gourd."</p><p></p><p>"This pool of water is the essence of lunar radiance, purer than any spirit herb or pill. If a master alchemist could refine it, they could create divine pills!"</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai and Xia Qingzhou gazed at the cold pool water, not daring to get too close.</p><p></p><p>The pure essence of lunar radiance - with their current cultivation, they would be unable to refine it. Even a trace would cause a severe backlash.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So you two actually have a way to take the essence of lunar radiance?"</p><p></p><p>"Heheh, hand over the gourd and we'll let you leave."</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly rang out from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Who was it?</p><p></p><p>Who was speaking?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai were on high alert, nervously scanning their surroundings to locate the hidden speaker.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Still looking for us?"</p><p></p><p>"Heheh!"</p><p></p><p>Another voice sounded from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivations are too weak. It's better if you don't see our true forms."</p><p></p><p>They panicked.</p><p></p><p>The two were in full panic now.</p><p></p><p>There were at least two enemies hiding, both at least at the Untroubled Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just hand over the gourd and we'll act like this never happened."</p><p></p><p>The voice came again, this time with a hint of impatience.</p><p></p><p>Mere Spiritual Power Realm cultivators - they didn't need to waste more words. Killing them here, with no witnesses to who did the deed.</p><p></p><p>Xia...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The faces of the two cultivators Qing Zhou and Qing Yang Bai were pale, but they were still trying to locate the source of the voice in the darkness. </p><p></p><p>"It seems you don't want to leave here alive."</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out from the opposite side of the cold pond. </p><p></p><p>There was a slight ripple in the void, and that person appeared just like that.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of talisman papers, that must be a divine ability!!</p><p></p><p>Another figure descended from the sky above. </p><p></p><p>A wisp of cloud formed from condensed moonlight drifted and fell down, transforming into a human form standing in front of Xia Qing Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Ka ka ka ————"</p><p></p><p>The ground shook violently, soil splashing everywhere, a spiritual plant burst forth, instantly growing into a towering tree.</p><p></p><p>The towering tree swayed, forming a human silhouette.</p><p></p><p>"Three people! There are three opponents!"</p><p></p><p>These three were all cultivators below the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The ability to conceal themselves in the void, transforming the body into moonlight essence, and the last one used a wood spiritual ability, possibly cultivating a wood spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xia Qing Zhou and the others decided to journey to the moon, they knew what would happen.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them!"  </p><p></p><p>"We chose to avoid the Sword Sect's people, yet we still encountered them."</p><p></p><p>"The water of the cold pond is precious, these two are not worth us giving it up!!"</p><p></p><p>One of the three figures that fell from the sky moved.</p><p></p><p>Ripples of moonlight formed a huge vase, aimed at Xia Qing Zhou and Qing Yang Bai, instantly gathering a yin force.</p><p></p><p>In the sky!</p><p></p><p>The moonlight vase was three zhang wide, devouring the surrounding moonlight.  </p><p></p><p>This divine ability would only have one-third of its power in the wilderness, but here, the vase swelled, the yin force devouring the void.</p><p></p><p>A divine light bloomed from inside the vase!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it devoured the surroundings, engulfing the two's figures.</p><p></p><p>When the light faded, outside the cold pond, Xia Qing Zhou and Qing Yang Bai's figures were still standing!</p><p></p><p>A bronze bell hung high, its faint light shielding the two.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A thousand-grooved divine weapon?"</p><p></p><p>The three were instantly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-grooved divine weapon was exclusive to the Celestial Realm, these two's identities were likely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"They couldn't possibly activate a thousand-grooved divine weapon, quickly subdue them!"</p><p></p><p>The three acted without further words.</p><p></p><p>Not approaching with their physical bodies, but using divine abilities instead!</p><p></p><p>The moonlight vase condensed again, absorbing a great deal of the surroundings, the vase taking form, its patterns clearly visible, with a bright moon rippling inside.</p><p></p><p>This disciple of the Stellar Hall, with the vase above his head, aimed its mouth again at Qing Yang Bai and Xia Qing Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Of the other two, one instantly condensed a divine spear with a flick of his finger, the spear piercing through the moonlight over a zhang long, power rippling as the divine ability took shape!</p><p></p><p>The last one swayed his body, condensing divine trees one by one in the sky, intent on suppressing the two.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang Bai and Xia Qing Zhou had no choice but to channel their power into the divine weapon, ritually refining the small bronze bell, forcibly opening four of its grooves, its marks flickering with faint light.</p><p></p><p>The bell's ringing resounded, entering the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Moonlight Vase Seal?"</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>This voice came too abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Hall disciple using the Moonlight Vase Seal changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>"The mid-grade Moonlight Vase Seal divine ability, condensing 81 talisman papers, borrowing the power of yin, manifesting the moon to devour all things."</p><p></p><p>How did he know the cultivation method of the Moonlight Vase Seal?</p><p></p><p>"The Barbaric Spear, a high-grade divine ability, condensing the ancient barbaric god's spear, requiring 108 talisman papers to form the divine ability seed!"</p><p></p><p>The spear shook, frozen in the air unmoving.</p><p></p><p>"Descent of the Tree Realm, a high-grade divine ability, condensing 120 talisman papers to form the divine ability seed. But your Descent lacks even a hundred divine trees, you must have rushed it, missing a few talisman papers, reducing its power by at least three tenths!"</p><p></p><p>This voice?</p><p></p><p>It sounded quite familiar!</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang Bai and Xia Qing Zhou felt relieved, was a fellow disciple from their sect coming to their rescue?</p><p></p><p>The three Stellar Hall cultivators below the Celestial Realm changed expressions drastically, the one with the wood spiritual body looked at the sky in horror.</p><p></p><p>There, two figures stepped forward, landing outside the cold pond. </p><p></p><p>One wore blue robes, with elegant brows and eyes, like a scholar out strolling.</p><p></p><p>Behind this person was an attendant carrying a sword case.</p><p></p><p>"It's Senior Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The two instantly recognized Gu Jiuqing, but their momentary hope vanished.</p><p></p><p>How could it be Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>He was the sword dao's top genius, true, but he had only just joined the Sword Sect. There were rumors he had comprehended three parts of the sword intent, four parts even, with tales he had already reached the semi-sword immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>But those were just rumors, while here were three unfathomable cultivators below the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>They wanted to warn him, but the attendant Lu Yuan following Gu Jiuqing stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"It seems these are three senior brothers from the Stellar Hall?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan held the sword case, neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The three didn't speak, only looking at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This is my sect's true disciple Senior Brother Gu. You can leave now."</p><p></p><p>Arrogant!!</p><p>Overbearing!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan glanced at the three Stellar Hall disciples, without any tone for discussion, as if stating a common matter.</p><p></p><p>This cold pond, my Sword Sect has taken an interest in it, so you can go!</p><p></p><p>The three sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"A true disciple of the Sword Sect? So what?"</p><p></p><p>Just being a true disciple allowed him to act so high and mighty?</p><p></p><p>The three of them cultivators below the Celestial Realm were not necessarily weaker than a true disciple!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's expression turned furious. "Audacious, what status do you have to be so rude before Senior Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's strength was not lacking, stronger than any of the cultivators below the Celestial Realm present.</p><p></p><p>But he did not act, instead holding the sword case in his hands.</p><p></p><p>A burst of spiritual power shook the case, the rippling dragon patterns releasing an aura of a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the supreme treasure spread, causing the three sub-celestial cultivators' faces to pale, their legs trembling.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme treasure! This is a supreme treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Those two cultivators having a thousand-grooved divine weapon was already monstrous enough.</p><p></p><p>Now this true disciple of the Sword Sect was traveling while carrying a supreme treasure??</p><p></p><p>That was like a noble clan's entire inheritance being carried on his back.</p><p></p><p>The supreme treasure's pressure filled the air, its weighty aura flattening the moonlight, causing ripples in the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>"Still not leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan held the sword case again, coldly snorting at them.</p><p></p><p>The three Stellar Hall disciples did not dare linger, fleeing panicked into the sky!!</p><p></p><p>With a supreme treasure in hand, this person's status was inviolable.</p><p></p><p>Even if they killed this so-called true disciple, they could not escape death from their sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Yuan walked towards the cold pond.</p><p></p><p>Approaching it, strands of spiritual light interweaved around his body, his treasured robes automatically protecting their master. He took out a white jade bottle, and in just a few breaths, absorbed most of the moonlight essence from the four-chi deep cold pond, leaving only the deepest pond water!</p><p></p><p>After doing this, Lu Yuan went to Gu Jiuqing's side and handed him the white jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this pond's moonlight essence, most of it is contained within."</p><p></p><p>He was gifting the moonlight essence to Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Earlier they had used a heavenly calabash to absorb a gourd's worth of moonlight essence, nearly getting killed over it.</p><p></p><p>Yet this inner disciple was willingly giving it to Gu Jiuqing!!</p><p></p><p>"Put it away."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lu Yuan store the white jade bottle. He stood behind Gu Jiuqing, like a noble's attendant when going out.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing Zhou!</p><p>Qing Yang Bai!</p><p></p><p>They were struck speechless by this scene.</p><p></p><p>From the same year, joining the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Yet this person already had an attendant cultivator below the Celestial Realm following him, and even the Stellar Hall fled in panic upon hearing Gu Jiuqing's name.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers Qing Yang and Xia, it has been a while."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed, only now noticing these two were also among the Sword Sect's disciples journeying to the moon.</p><p></p><p>The two hurriedly tidied their robes and respectfully bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Gu!!"</p><p></p><p>They did not dare address Gu Jiuqing as a peer.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also noticed the distance between them, stemming from the disparity in status.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing Zhou and Qing Yang Bai did not dare overstep, not even daring to look at him directly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Senior Brother Gu for your assistance!"</p><p>"Thank you Senior Brother Gu for your assistance!"</p><p></p><p>The two expressed their gratitude, heads lowered without a word.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing knew there was no need to linger, as it would only make them more awkward.</p><p></p><p>"It was a minor matter, I shall not disturb Brothers Xia and Qing Yang from treasure hunting any further."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bid them farewell with grace.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the cold pond made Gu Jiuqing more certain he was heading the right way.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon Senior Brother Liang Xiao left on the moon was not far from him.</p><p></p><p>Two beams of light soared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>In their original spot, Xia Qing Zhou and Qing Yang Bai watched Gu Jiuqing's departing back with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu!"</p><p>"He truly ascended in a single stride!"</p><p>"Yes, he really ascended in a single stride."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing Zhou shook his head, putting Gu Jiuqing's figure out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qing Yang, since the Stellar Hall's disciples appeared nearby, it seems we cannot stray too far from our spirit ship."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, let's search towards the direction of the moon spirit ship!"</p><p></p><p>The two left the cold pond, continuing to hunt for treasures in the direction they came from.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The moon god ship was massive, the largest divine ship that Gu Jiuqing had ever seen. Just the divine cloth hanging as the mainsail was as large as the true transmission island of the Heavenly Sword Palace! </p><p></p><p>There were three sails on the mast, forming a canopy in the sky. </p><p></p><p>Strands of moonlight fell from the main sail, interweaving with the void to form a full moon.</p><p></p><p>The ship's hull was forged from divine metal, imprinted with lines of divine markings and traces!</p><p></p><p>This was a divine weapon, but the moon god ship was so enormous that Gu Jiuqing could not discern how many traces were on the hull. </p><p></p><p>But there should be over three thousand!</p><p></p><p>The moon god ship, this was a great vessel!</p><p></p><p>Towards the front of the hull, there was an expanse of "seawater" in a deep blue color. As the ship rocked, the seawater splashed about, churning up thunderous waves with lightning snakes undulating within.</p><p></p><p>A thunder pool! Also one of the driving forces of the moon god ship.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Sword Sect's moon god ship used an ancient thunder pool as its power source, enabling unmatched speed. Combined with the moonsail divine banner, it could sail to the moon in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped onto the deck, with Lu Yuan following behind carrying the case containing the Supreme Unity Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>The three sword immortals also appeared before Gu Jiuqing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"True Transmission disciple, you've finally arrived. Now we just await your command!"</p><p></p><p>This sword immortal was a disciple of the Elder of Primal Antiquity, the sword immortal from Barbarian Peak. He originally cultivated the Barbarian Sword Intent but later gained insight into the Blazing Sun Laws, making rapid progress on the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal, wielding the Blazing Sun Sword. This divine sword had no sheath restraints, freely hanging behind his back.  </p><p></p><p>His fiery red hair was unbound, like a divine sword taking root in the void.</p><p></p><p>There was an awkward smile on his face. He wanted to rebuke Gu Jiuqing, but didn't dare!</p><p></p><p>Another sword immortal spoke up. </p><p></p><p>This was the Wind Sword Immortal, clad in white with a wine gourd at his waist. His face was smooth and youthful with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, please enter the thunder pool and activate the moon god ship."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he invited Gu Jiuqing to set sail.</p><p></p><p>The other female sword immortal was from the Celestial Snow Peak. Within three feet of her, the cold sword intent of frost and ice chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Sword Immortal's gaze fell upon Gu Jiuqing. </p><p></p><p>Forcing a smile onto her cold beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>An icy beauty feigning a warm smile.</p><p></p><p>"True Transmission disciple? What is it?"</p><p></p><p>The three sword immortals had varying expressions, but all showed deference to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He was merely a true transmission disciple who had just joined the sect, not even a sword immortal yet.</p><p></p><p>But these three were the top sword immortals of the sect, having achieved that realm years ago. Even if he was the paramount sword cultivator, there was no need for such trepidation, right?</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it seemed like fear!</p><p></p><p>Yes!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing saw a hint of fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>What ability did he possess to make three sword immortals afraid?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the thunder pool requires an ancient thunder talisman to activate. This talisman is within the pool."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan transmitted his voice, thinking Gu Jiuqing didn't know how to activate the moon god ship.</p><p></p><p>"Three Senior Brothers, you honor this junior brother so highly, I'm quite flattered."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to the three sword immortals. "It is thanks to Senior Brother Liang Xiao's recommendation that this junior could board the divine ship. As for other matters, you three can discuss amongst yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to consult me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't want to cause trouble. The moon god ship had traveled the vast heavens many times, it was very safe. If he casually interfered, it may lead to accidents instead.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three sword immortals nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Gu, there will be strong winds once we take off, please rest inside the cabin."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Senior Brother led the way, and Gu Jiuqing naturally wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>The other two sword immortals headed to the thunder pool to power up the moon god ship.</p><p></p><p>"He's leaving? That junior brother is not an inner sect disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"Definitely not an inner sect disciple, how could an inner sect disciple receive such an escort from three sword immortals!"</p><p></p><p>"Could he be the son of some high-ranking elder?"</p><p></p><p>Some inner sect disciples speculated. These elite disciples usually remained in secluded cultivation, ignorant of secular affairs and disdaining such relationships.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Wind True Immortal inviting him into the moon god ship's cabin?"</p><p></p><p>Jealousy!</p><p></p><p>Thick jealousy arose behind Gu Jiuqing's back.</p><p></p><p>Those gazes even contained a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>During take-off, they would all stand on the deck, but only those three sword immortals had the privilege to enter the cabin.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>That young disciple, even bringing a companion, boldly strode past them into the cabin to rest!!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai also felt envious.</p><p></p><p>They were puzzled, exchanging a glance as if realizing something.</p><p></p><p>"Could that be Senior Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai wasn't sure!</p><p></p><p>Was this still the Gu Jiuqing he remembered?</p><p></p><p>During the nine-day sword assessment, that youth had clear eyes and a slender build.</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>His spirit was vigorous, his bearing extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>The sect's sword immortals cleared a path for him, with an inner sect senior brother following behind carrying a divine sword.</p><p></p><p>Not just his appearance, but his entire aura had drastically changed. Adding that they didn't expect this, they almost didn't recognize Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"It does seem to be Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's gaze was complex!</p><p></p><p>They had spent so many spirit stones just for the take-off, while Gu Jiuqing was directly being escorted. </p><p></p><p>The difference in their statuses was like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"That should be the True Transmission Disciple Gu."</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing and the Wind Sword Immortal's figures entered the ship's interior, someone finally spoke up.</p><p></p><p>It was Gao Shuli who had spoken earlier.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples' eyes fell on him again.</p><p></p><p>Facing their gazes, he stuck out his neck proudly and said, "Lu Yuan is a disciple of the Artifact Forging Peak and became a protector of the Heavenly Sword Palace a few months ago. And the Heavenly Sword Palace is the true transmission island of that paramount Senior Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd was astonished. </p><p></p><p>So he was the paramount sword cultivator, no wonder he received such treatment!</p><p></p><p>Even those true transmission cultivators looked towards the departed figures with contemplative expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The paramount sword cultivator? No surprise he gets such treatment!"</p><p></p><p>"Once I suppress the paramount sword cultivator, I'll be the number one genius of the sect!"</p><p></p><p>Many inner sect prodigies were itching to make a move.</p><p></p><p>These elite disciples selected to train on the moon all had shockingly high talents.</p><p></p><p>Inside the moon god ship's cabin.</p><p></p><p>The celestial interior spanned acres like its own celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged while Lu Yuan stood holding the sword case.</p><p></p><p>He was quite excited!</p><p></p><p>This was like a free ten thousand spirit stone ticket.</p><p></p><p>But because of Senior Brother Gu, he boarded for free without the three sword immortals even asking a single question.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's status in the sect.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal sat across from Gu Jiuqing and took out his wine gourd, retrieving new wine cups from his spirit storage - four in total corresponding to Gu Jiuqing, himself, and the other two sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>"This is Wind Moon Treading Snow Wine, brewed by my junior over the course of pursuing the wind, treading the moon, and thirty winter days."</p><p></p><p>As the wine gourd poured, a faint aroma of wind, flowers, snow and books wafted out.</p><p></p><p>This single jar of wine was like a book itself.</p><p></p><p>The poured wine was a page from its profound passages.</p><p></p><p>Just drinking this cup could explosively increase one's spiritual power by years!</p><p></p><p>A single cup was worth a thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's eyes went wide, an ordinary person would never witness such a scene in their lifetime if not for becoming Gu Jiuqing's companion.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble —————"</p><p></p><p>The ship violently rocked as a majestic force permeated the moon god ship. Outside, the heavens and earth rapidly transformed.</p><p></p><p>Through the window, nine ancient lightning serpents intertwined above the thunder pool, swallowing the lightning liquid that cycled from blue to white to golden yellow!</p><p></p><p>The lightning serpents even transformed into nine lightning dragons!</p><p></p><p>The nine ancient lightning dragons left the thunder pool and flew ahead of the moon god ship, actually lifting and propelling this divine vessel forward.</p><p></p><p>Each lightning dragon was tens of thousands of feet long. The nine lightning dragons soared through the azure void, already leaving the Great Wilderness behind!!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh————————   </p><p></p><p>Frigid winds howled as the vast expanse of the universe unfolded, displaying the Four Great Territories and Nine Continents below which the Sword Sect had become a tiny speck.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, moonlight raining from the sails coalesced into a protective stream enveloping the deck disciples.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, just the raging winds from take-off could scatter their fleshly bodies.</p><p></p><p>"My mental state is far inferior to Senior Brother Gu's."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal picked up his wine cup and took a sip, recalling the past.</p><p></p><p>During his first moon journey long ago, he was so terrified he didn't dare look around for an entire incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>How unlike Gu Jiuqing's calm and composed demeanor, as if it were an everyday sight.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, we scholars read to broaden our perspectives and realize our talents. The inner and outer sceneries are no different."</p><p></p><p>The inner and outer scenery principle!</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal's eyes lit up. "So Senior Brother Gu is also a man of letters. The Inner and Outer Scenery is an invaluable rare book."</p><p></p><p>Clang————</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open as the other two sword immortals entered.</p><p></p><p>"What's so invaluable and rare?"</p><p></p><p>"Wind Senior Immortal, what are you searching for again?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal's hair crackled with streaks of lightning, his body stained by residual lightning liquid from the thunder pool.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan inwardly marveled at his powerful body!</p><p></p><p>Lightning was the pinnacle of ferocious yang energy that could blast a fleshly body into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal's body was completely immersed in lightning without any harm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Not even a hint of damage!</p><p></p><p>Such a fleshly body should have reached the peak of the Body Refinement Realm, or even be comparable to the Heavenly Palace Realm. </p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal sat to the right of Gu Jiuqing, while the Cold Sword Immortal sat to his left.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I was discussing the theory of external scenery with Senior Martial Brother Gu. It's the theory of internal scenery manifesting externally that the Jixia Academy has been recently researching."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Senior Brother looked surprised. "I didn't expect the True Disciple Gu to also know such a theory?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt embarrassed. "No, no, I only heard a few great Confucian disciples mention the internal and external sceneries before, but I'm still quite ignorant about the specifics of the theory."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that profound."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal drained his cup of fine wine in one gulp. He wiped his mouth and explained simply and clearly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just about visualizing an imaginary scene, sketching it into reality, sculpting the internal scenery, and then projecting it outwards!"</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, their internal scenery is just an imagined scene.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Jiuqing meant earlier was that he had imagined the scene of ascending to the moon many times, and since those imagined scenes were similar to the real thing now, there was nothing too shocking about it.</p><p></p><p>As for the theory of internal scenery manifesting externally, it was a theory proposed by the Jixia Academy!</p><p></p><p>In this world, all divine abilities and myriad laws start from nothing to existence. </p><p></p><p>For example, the divine ability Grasp the Moon requires condensing thirty-six talisman seals into a divine seed before it can be used.</p><p></p><p>The theory of internal scenery manifesting externally first envisions the appearance of Grasp the Moon, then fills in the details, the power it wields when cast, and so on. After sketching out all of this, one can then overlay their spirit upon the internal scenery, or infuse it with spiritual energy and power, making it become real and thus affecting reality!!</p><p></p><p>This is profound knowledge that many great Confucian scholars are studying. Some have even sealed it within paintings, calligraphy, and texts.</p><p></p><p>A single word can manifest an external scenery; a single stroke of a brush can manifest an external scenery - which can be used to slay enemies. This is a formidable divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Sword Immortal was a beautiful ice-jade lady with skin fairer than snow and a pale, bloodless complexion. </p><p></p><p>She spoke, "The great Confucian scholars of the Great Zhou Dynasty have burned all the books on manifesting internal scenery externally. A deviant trend has emerged in the nine states, with people saying this is the expansive divine ability of Confucianism!"</p><p></p><p>"However, the expansive divine ability of Confucianism is rather interesting. By cultivating expansive energy and infusing it into the internal scenery, the manifested external image will endure expansively - a powerful weapon for slaying demons and evil beings!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Cold Sword Immortal's words, the Wind Sword Immortal roared with laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Next time I go to the Great Wilderness, I'll capture a great Confucian scholar and see if their words and paintings can indeed suppress demons!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing cradled his wine cup, not saying much as he rarely joined their discussions.</p><p></p><p>The three Senior Martial Brother Sword Immortals conversed loftily, moving from the theory of manifesting internal scenery externally to the recent book burnings in the Great Zhou, then to the expansive righteous energy of Confucianism.  </p><p></p><p>Next, the three brilliant swordsmen spoke of the widely circulated rumors about the ancient immortal emperor's grand tomb these days.</p><p></p><p>The ancient immortal emperor's grand tomb was surrounded by great artifacts, with scions of great clans, top disciples, and ancient true immortals of the Heavenly Palace Realm bombarding the tomb with their artifacts!</p><p></p><p>They had already unlocked ten of the twelve immortal seals guarding the tomb, leaving only the final two.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient objects had been excavated from the immortal emperor's tomb, including an ancient stele inscribed with this immortal emperor's grand title.</p><p></p><p>"The Long Life Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"The final celestial emperor of antiquity, who reigned for over forty thousand years. But for some unknown reason, the ancient celestial court suddenly collapsed, the Great Wilderness was beset by calamity, and the four great danger zones appeared out of nowhere. Even this great emperor's name was lost to history."</p><p></p><p>Along with the loss of the emperor's name, many other things also vanished, including what exactly caused this calamity - there are no records remaining.</p><p></p><p>"The seals outside the Long Life Immortal Emperor's tomb are too powerful. These may have been personally laid by the Long Life Immortal Emperor himself. It's so strange - the Long Life Immortal Emperor was at least a supreme existence who had passed the ninth lightning tribulation, with his spirit, flesh, and power all purely yang. With his strength, he shouldn't have needed to make preparations for the afterlife!"  </p><p></p><p>At that level of existence, without external interference, one could essentially live forever.</p><p></p><p>"Which means the Long Life Immortal Emperor must have known his death was imminent, hence laying these twelve immortal seals!"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years later, the seals had greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>It was only after being bombarded day and night by over ten great artifacts that the first ten seals were finally broken.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine how terrifyingly powerful the seals laid by this immortal emperor must have been back then.</p><p></p><p>"That Great Celestial Lord is quite peculiar. The great artifact coffin he possesses is extremely powerful - it shattered several three-thousand-talisman great artifacts. I heard many ancient sects are looking to make trouble for him."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing heard news of the Great Celestial Lord, he immediately pricked up his ears.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal chuckled and looked at Gu Jiuqing. "So it seems Senior Martial Brother is also interested in this Great Celestial Lord. I know quite a few inside stories about him."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal then revealed all the information he knew.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>He claimed to be a scholar and entered the Long Life Immortal Emperor's tomb alone. He mapped out all the seals outside the tomb and even found their weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>It was with the Great Celestial Lord's assistance that the great sects and clans were able to break through so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, the Celestial Maiden of Stars was suppressed multiple times. Later, when she forcefully entered the ancient ruins again, she clashed with the Crown Prince of Great Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>"In that battle, the Crown Prince of Great Zhou summoned the Nine Provinces Cauldron, while the Celestial Maiden of Stars transformed into a celestial maiden holding up the Nine Provinces Cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>This was an inside story!</p><p></p><p>News of this great battle did not spread in the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden of Stars' power was boundless - she could forcefully withstand the great artifact Nine Provinces Cauldron. She even defied its divine might, pushing back against it and nearly suppressing the Crown Prince of Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, that Great Celestial Lord appeared again. But it seems he colluded with the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Seven Celestial Sovereigns of the Demonic Path, and they ambushed and injured the Celestial Maiden of Stars together."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal sighed in admiration. It turned out the Celestial Maiden of Stars had been hiding her true strength! He had always thought he could match her, but this great battle made the Wind Sword Immortal and the other sword immortals realize their true standing.</p><p></p><p>To forcefully withstand a great artifact and nearly suppress the Crown Prince of Great Zhou - the Celestial Maiden of Stars' strength far exceeded the Crown Prince's.</p><p></p><p>"That Great Celestial Lord has been wandering around the ancient immortal emperor's tomb, seemingly searching for traces of the Celestial Maiden of Stars."</p><p></p><p>"Lustful scoundrel!" </p><p></p><p>The Cold Sword Immortal let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal smiled but didn't comment.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal, however, looked displeased. "So what if the Great Celestial Lord is lustful? According to some, this Great Celestial Lord should have allied with the Crown Prince of Zhou first to deal with the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Demonic Path!"</p><p></p><p>"That Seventh Celestial Lord is the true beauty!"</p><p></p><p>A chill arose. </p><p></p><p>The Cold Sword Immortal's face was frosty, clearly displeased.</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Celestial Lord of the Demonic Path - the First Celestial Lord is actually her mother."</p><p></p><p>Before the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal could finish, the Cold Sword Immortal's gaze pierced out a sword energy!</p><p></p><p>The sword energy fell around the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal but was incinerated by a burst of flames.</p><p></p><p>"You two Sword Immortals, what are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you see that Senior Martial Brother Gu is also present?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal hurriedly tried to dissuade them.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the two sword immortals cease their confrontation.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rubbed his nose, feeling that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord - that was his sister!</p><p></p><p>That (person) was most likely the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Demonic Path.</p><p></p><p>How could Gu Linglong collude with the Seventh Celestial Lord to attack the Celestial Maiden of Stars?</p><p></p><p>Based on his understanding of Gu Linglong, his sister definitely had no good intentions.</p><p></p><p>The mother of the Seventh Celestial Lord was the First Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>And according to rumors, the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Demonic Path, in terms of strength ranking, the First Celestial Lord was at least a major figure of the Long Life Realm who may have passed the ninth lightning tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was afraid she was an existence with a pure yang spirit, or even a three-in-one being of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining his sister scheming against a three to four thousand year old, or possibly over five thousand year old elderly lady...</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt utterly terrified.</p><p></p><p>No, this cannot be.</p><p></p><p>After calming the two sword immortals' emotions, the Wind Sword Immortal saw that the timing was ripe and inquired, "Senior Martial Brother Gu, you're representing that Senior Martial Brother Jiang this time. Does Senior Martial Brother Jiang have any tasks for us?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Sword Immortal had completely dropped his earlier poised demeanor, his face full of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Sword Immortal and Cold Sword Immortal also looked towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Jiang? </p><p></p><p>Was that Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqiao?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Liang Xiaoqiao?</p><p></p><p>No, that's not right. When I was wandering on the moon earlier, I saw the true name "Jiang Buyu" carved on that primordial laurel tree!</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years ago, when Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqiao measured the celestial heights, he stayed on the moon for ten years.</p><p></p><p>Since Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqiao's surname is Jiang, that true name of "Jiang Buyu" must be his!</p><p></p><p>On the moon, there also seemed to be ten divine weapons left behind by Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqiao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head. "Senior Martial Brother didn't mention anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Phew——————</p><p></p><p>The three of them visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>It was good that this madman didn't say anything!</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Sect, who didn't fear Jiang Buyu, except perhaps those two from the Nameless Peak?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked out the window. The stars were twinkling, and the bright moon had suddenly grown much larger. Apart from that, the lunar ark continued flying without encountering any other celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, any celestial bodies near it had been refined, with some of them refined into stardust pearls by the Celestial Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>Only by passing the moon were there still some celestial bodies remaining.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brothers, how many more days until we reach the moon?"</p><p></p><p>"Six days!"</p><p></p><p>Such incredible speed - only six days to traverse the hundreds of millions of miles to the moon beyond the heavens!</p><p></p><p>First day, thirty thousand words, all published.</p><p></p><p>Begging readers for support.</p><p></p><p>Cough cough, not asking for more readers now, asking for bookmarks!</p><p></p><p>Yes, asking readers to bookmark this book!!</p><p></p><p>Originally they thought this was just an ordinary request for bookmarks.

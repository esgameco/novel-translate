            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Pain!</p><p></p><p>So much pain!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only felt his left eye being melted away. </p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of flesh was constantly wriggling, trying to grow a new left eye.</p><p></p><p>In this state of rebirth, Gu Jiuqing's vital energy, magic power, were completely useless!!</p><p></p><p>He tightly closed his left eye, feeling the emptiness, making Gu Jiuqing realize that his left eye had not yet formed.</p><p></p><p>"Does my eye look like the moon?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly did Si Wuxie want to tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did activating the Mirror Flower Water Moon divine ability trigger the primordial moonlight tree's radiance?"</p><p></p><p>"Was it the primordial moonlight tree's radiance that melted my left eye, so now is my left eye self-regenerating? Or is a new eyeball growing?"</p><p></p><p>A moon eye?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts were jumbled, his divine soul the height of eight zhang and nine chi, shedding thought after thought.</p><p></p><p>He closed his left eye and opened his right eye!</p><p></p><p>He saw the terror of this Mirror Flower Water Moon strike.</p><p></p><p>A hundred blossoms bloomed, condensing the vast moonlight into a single strike.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty demon heads exploded, their severed limbs and remains strewn across the ground under the moon ship.</p><p></p><p>Various demon organs were torn apart, and some demons not yet dead struggled, trying to condense their magic to be reborn, but their injuries were too severe, only able to wail miserfully.</p><p></p><p>At the very front of the moon ship, that twenty-eight zhang tall demon prince, reflected in Gu Jiuqing's right eye, had his enormous arms already shattered, his black demonic aura sinking.</p><p></p><p>Three arms fell onto the moon ship, the remaining five shielding his body, charred black.</p><p></p><p>Another large talisman hovered above his head, dripping strands of yin-yang energy!!</p><p></p><p>That was a powerful talisman!</p><p></p><p>The demon prince was performing the yin-yang talisman ritual, surrounded by yin-yang energy.</p><p></p><p>Countless dao marks were activated on the talisman's surface, thousands of rippling patterns interweaving with various dao rhymes.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered as he stared fixedly at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>This divine ability!</p><p></p><p>He had never seen it before.</p><p></p><p>What level of moon divine ability was this? It was clearly a supreme divine ability, the pinnacle skill of those three-in-one beings.</p><p></p><p>"You've ruined my true form, you should die!"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince's yin-yang talisman rippled, his charred arms shedding and regenerating into new flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the demon army stood unmoving, not daring to take a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Behind Gu Jiuqing, the Sword Sect disciples exclaimed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>They were somewhat familiar with this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Some disciples cultivated the Mirror Flower Water Moon divine ability, but dared not speak it aloud.</p><p></p><p>Was this the Mirror Flower Water Moon divine ability??</p><p></p><p>Then what were they cultivating?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing kept his left eye closed, still able to sense his left eye slowly growing back.</p><p></p><p>He did not speak!</p><p></p><p>Instead, he struck out directly!</p><p></p><p>This battle!</p><p></p><p>Would be the most arduous he had faced since starting his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, that blurry divine figure, embracing heaven and earth, using Mount Buzhou as its spine, had completely fused into Gu Jiuqing's flesh.</p><p></p><p>The Pangu divine body was officially activated!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>His flesh instantly transformed, his vital energy roaring like dragons, his bones like divine metal, under the bombardment of vital energy and divine metal, emitting brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>His flesh abruptly swelled several times, becoming a three-zhang giant.</p><p></p><p>But this height was still insignificant before the demon prince's true form.</p><p></p><p>His magic circulated, all three-zhang wondrous gates trembling, his vast magic condensing into strands that gathered into a spirit pill!</p><p></p><p>This was a spirit pill Gu Jiuqing had never refined before, a mixed elemental unity in a transparent state.</p><p></p><p>Dragon-elephant forms flew out from Mount Buzhou, entering the Pangu divine body's weight, as if a great dao of force was interweaving!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang giant actually flew into the air outside the moon ship to battle the demon prince!</p><p></p><p>"Bold!"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince sneered, his eight arms churning space, each arm wielding a thousand-pattern divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons clashed, the Pangu divine body instantly blasted away.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood mangled, head lolling, in that one strike, the dragon-elephant force was being extinguished!!</p><p></p><p>"See that? That's the true power of a celestial who has passed the five thunderous tribulations. A pure yang thought alone has at least sixteen spirit embryos."</p><p></p><p>"That true form should be the Pangu deity that stubborn one spoke of!"</p><p></p><p>Nothing more!</p><p></p><p>At the distant Niran Palace, the Eight Trigrams Elder watched carefully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan focused his eyes, taking out a book recording his own path to immortality, as well as the events on Elder Martial Brother Gu's path.</p><p></p><p>"The moon journey, Elder Martial Brother Gu battles the demon prince, victory!"</p><p></p><p>He put away the notes.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder looked at the content in the notes, he really couldn't believe it!</p><p></p><p>What kind of nonsense disciple was this, the battle between stubborn one and the demon prince wasn't over yet, how could there be a victory?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in this battle, stubborn one couldn't possibly win.</p><p></p><p>"Master oh master, in the past ten thousand years, no deities have been born. But in the ancient imperial era, those celestial emperors were almost undefeated."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother Gu is achieving immortality in this era, so he will be a celestial emperor. Do you think a celestial emperor's life would have any defeats?"</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder was stunned, suddenly realizing something.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't right, celestial emperors being undefeated was against others of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>But what realm was this stubborn one in? The celestial tribulation realm? Or the celestial palace realm?</p><p></p><p>Or even the spirit refinement realm?</p><p></p><p>At least a three to four realm difference, and he could still be undefeated?</p><p></p><p>Even a reincarnated celestial emperor couldn't do that!</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't overthink it, quickly look at Elder Martial Brother's great Celestial Palace Sword Aura!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Great Celestial Palace Sword Aura?</p><p></p><p>In the distant heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang figure was smashed hundreds of meters into the ground, his entire body nearly collapsing.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the sounds of roaring dragons and tigers, thunderous rumbles, all kinds of divine sounds rang out from the three-zhang true form. In just a short while,</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang Pangu true form flew back out from underground.</p><p></p><p>Perfect and flawless, his flesh unharmed, as if he had not been severely struck. Gu Jiuqing was directly withstanding the full-force attack of this celestial tribulation demon prince, yet he still was not killed!</p><p></p><p>This level of achievement, looking through all ages, was enough to shake the world.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish————</p><p></p><p>Sword auras rang out endlessly, the twenty-eight sword auras howled out from his Baihui acupoint, Gu Jiuqing opened his mouth and expelled the Great Celestial Palace!!</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Palace roared through heaven and earth, condensing one hundred celestial palaces into physical form. Those twenty-eight sword auras that could slice the heavens converged into the palaces, gathering the myriad celestial palaces together!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, 999 celestial palaces took shape, even the Southern Celestial Gate of the four great celestial gates materialized, and the Celestial King guarding the Southern Gate gained a vague form.</p><p></p><p>The vast celestial palace pulsed, the Great Celestial Palace sword aura erupting!!</p><p></p><p>A three-hundred zhang sword aura burst forth from the Great Celestial Palace, the unmatched sword aura transforming into a flying sword that spanned the universe.</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, it cleaved the vast heavens!</p><p></p><p>The demon prince crossed his arms in the air, six arms performing rituals, five divine wheels condensing into his final Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel opened the cycle of life and death, myriad worlds reflected in the divine wheel.</p><p></p><p>This demon prince seemed to rule over the myriad worlds like a sovereign, his noble countenance bearing the heroic air of all deities.</p><p></p><p>The sword aura sank, the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel rippling, world after world sliced apart, the life and death wheel surging endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Boom————————"</p><p></p><p>The twenty-eight zhang demon true form was forced back dozens of steps, the sword aura thundering, its remnant force blooming to the sides, raining down on the distant demon army.</p><p></p><p>Sword aura sprayed everywhere, the sword intent roaring like spirit refinement light that extinguished the demons.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble!</p><p></p><p>A heaven-spanning path was opened, similar in size to the demon prince's true form, demons on both sides annihilated, the Great Celestial Palace sword aura and intent devouring hundreds of demon lives.</p><p></p><p>"Weak weak weak!"</p><p></p><p>"You're still too weak!"</p><p></p><p>"With this strike, you could slay a celestial palace cultivator, maybe even a seven or eight palace celestial cultivator, but a celestial tribulation cultivator could flick you dead with one finger!!"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince's voice was full of regret.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the number one peerless genius of the Sword Sect, the first such genius he had encountered in his life.</p><p></p><p>He suspected that even Jiang Xingyu and Jiang Buyu did not possess this disciple's talents.</p><p></p><p>Such a divine body, with unmatched recovery abilities. Such power, able to contend against the celestial tribulation realm. Such divine abilities that could injure a celestial tribulation cultivator. Only his magic power was this Sword Sect disciple's shortcoming.</p><p></p><p>Magic power, divine abilities, flesh - he had reached the pinnacle in all but realm, if not for the realm suppression, he would not be Gu Jiuqing's match.</p><p></p><p>But what a pity!</p><p></p><p>He was a celestial who had passed the thunderous tribulations.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, pure yang spirit embryos flew out from the Niran Palace, gathering in space to form a physical spirit body.</p><p></p><p>That was the true battle strength of a pure yang celestial!</p><p></p><p>Spirit embryo after spirit embryo condensed, eight of them merging into a pure yang spirit body.</p><p></p><p>The spirit body pointed a finger at the three-zhang true form.</p><p></p><p>The demon prince was going to use a celestial tribulation divine ability, using the power of his realm to slay Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"I've been waiting for you!"</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang Pangu true form showed no damage at all, still standing at its peak.</p><p></p><p>His Yanluo Pagoda moved, the four tiers radiating divine light as four flying swords shot out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the Yanluo Pagoda, four illusory arms growing from his back one by one.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally reached his limit? What kind of freakish thing can actually fight a celestial tribulation cultivator with so many arms, when the tribulation cultivator can only rely on realm advantage to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buyu can never be stubborn one's match in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one has finally used this old man's flesh body."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder sighed, wishing he had never agreed to it in the first place.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he had to take it back.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The disciple lowered his head stubbornly.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang yuan shen's finger descended, able to break through all fleshly bodies and spiritual powers. As long as it was not a pure yang object, it would be shattered. </p><p></p><p>Four arms rose into the air, transforming into demonic limbs, confronting this single finger of the pure yang yuan shen.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang force radiated from between the fingers, causing the four arms to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Crack————</p><p></p><p>The arms shattered, cracks appearing on their surface. These were illusory cracks. Although the pure yang yuan shen was substantial, this single finger strike from the pure yang descended from the essence, shattering the real world. After striking the illusory realm and withstanding the origin, the pure yang condensed back into substance.  </p><p></p><p>This was the suppression of the tribulation realm.</p><p></p><p>The first arm looked as if pierced through by pure yang thoughts, and the second arm began cracking too.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Fumu Pagoda shook, ripples appearing in the eight primordial essences.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Primordial Elder Patriarch had refined this pagoda from his own flesh, but the Elder Patriarch's flesh alone did not contain pure yang. He could only borrow the spiritual powers of the two dragon and tiger heads to resist the pure yang strike.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing infused his spiritual powers into the Yin-Fumu Pagoda, activating the dragon and tiger forces.</p><p></p><p>"Boom————"  </p><p></p><p>The earth sank down!</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————————"</p><p></p><p>The mountain ranges also sank, the mountains swaying, an ancient range shifting.</p><p></p><p>The tremors grew louder, even affecting the great battle between Gu Jiuqing and the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>The two figures swiftly separated.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang yuan shen retracted its finger, flying into the Demon Prince's Mud Ball Palace.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the Yin-Fumu Pagoda, his left eye closed, using his right eye to gaze into the distance at the mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ranges, an unprecedented massive creature was walking.</p><p></p><p>With each step it took, the lands and rivers trembled, the sinking of the earth beneath its feet echoing from afar.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Beast!!"</p><p></p><p>It was the Celestial Beast of the Celestial Pavilion that had arrived.</p><p></p><p>From far away, a voice tore through the heavens, entering the Moon Ship.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Gu, you're still alive! That's wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"I've asked the master to deploy the Celestial Beast to lend you a hand."</p><p></p><p>It was Jun Wu's voice.</p><p></p><p>Palaces were built on the twelve massive horns of the Celestial Beast.  </p><p></p><p>A figure stood on the last palace at the end of its tail. He did not step even half a step out of the palace, waving from the entrance to greet Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The earth shook again as the Celestial Beast, seemingly spotting some delicacy, strode forward ravenously, snatching dozens of demons into its grasp and devouring them whole.</p><p></p><p>"This taste is not bad at all. After eating so many celestials, to be honest, the taste of demons is still more delicious."</p><p></p><p>"I've said it before, I'm still growing my body. It's been thousands of years, and I still haven't passed my infancy, all because you Celestial Pavilion people are not putting in enough effort."</p><p></p><p>"If this Beast King could go to the Primordial Chaos and devour the demon dens, I might have passed infancy long ago."</p><p></p><p>Unrestrained, the Celestial Beast turned into a dreadful weapon, hunting demons on the land.</p><p></p><p>Those demons, upon seeing the Celestial Beast, had no will to fight, only to flee.</p><p></p><p>Even the two heavenly demons were swatted into meat patties by the Celestial Beast's palm before being rolled up and swallowed along with a few other demons.</p><p></p><p>"Demons that taste like rolled pancakes, not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>This was a massacre!!</p><p></p><p>Before the Celestial Beast, the demons' forces collapsed. Hundreds of demons were devoured in an instant, the rest scattering into the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Don't eat anymore, eating that much will leave the demons' aura lingering in your body."</p><p></p><p>"When the Beast King returns to the Celestial Pavilion, it won't be good if the Celestial Lord finds out."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Lord stood atop the Celestial Beast's head.</p><p></p><p>After the beast beneath his feet opened its mouth seven or eight more times to devour a few hundred more demons, it finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled again as the Celestial Beast blocked the Demon Prince's rear entrance.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Lord gazed at this Demon Prince, "I've heard your demonic clan has been spreading word that this old man is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Well now this old man stands before you demons. Let's see what tricks you have to kill this old man!"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Lord transmitted his voice to the Celestial Beast beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>"There's still one more demon here. Devouring one more won't be noticed by the Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast's eyes lit up, its massive mountainous body shifting.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's expression turned one of horror.</p><p></p><p>His twenty-eight zhang true form trembled, his yuan shen separating, summoning the heavenly laws and earthly phenomena!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's figure swelled, boundless moonlight pulling, transforming from his twenty-eight zhang true form into a ninety-nine zhang manifestation of the heavenly laws and earthly phenomena!</p><p></p><p>Yet this manifestation nearly a hundred zhang tall was still an ant before the Celestial Beast.</p><p></p><p>But the Demon Prince took out pure yang thoughts one by one, sacrificing and infusing them into his manifestation.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-nine zhang manifestation swelled dozens of times, directly evolving into a thousand-zhang body!</p><p></p><p>"He's burning pure yang thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Prince has pure yang thoughts from other tribulation cultivators!!"</p><p></p><p>Pure yang thoughts were too precious, no one would simply give them away. Those were pure yang thoughts the Demon Prince obtained by slaying other tribulation cultivators!!</p><p></p><p>The thousand-zhang manifestation was vast, but still not as large as one of the Celestial Beast's horns.</p><p></p><p>Sacrificing two pure yang thoughts was not enough, so the Demon Prince continued sacrificing a third, a fourth, a total of five pure yang thoughts fused into his manifestation before he finally stopped!</p><p></p><p>And this manifestation swelled again by several times, barely reaching the threshold of a ten-thousand-zhang manifestation!!</p><p></p><p>"This is the true battle between pure yang celestials!"</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Shedding Mortality, Spiritual Power, Incomplete Enlightenment, and Refining Divinity Realms could only cause limited destruction.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Heavenly Palace Realm that this situation changed.</p><p></p><p>Coalescing the yuan shen granted boundless spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>But at the tribulation realm, celestials could use pure yang thoughts to amplify their fleshly bodies, spiritual powers, and spiritual abilities, displaying true high-level might.</p><p></p><p>Summoning manifestations of the heavenly laws and earthly phenomena, their every move was a celestial calamity!</p><p></p><p>The ten-thousand-zhang manifestation stood between heaven and earth. The Demon Prince condensed eight divine weapons in his eight arms, a yin-yang divine diagram above his head, sacrificing a great artifact and opening profound markings!</p><p></p><p>His yin-yang divine body surged, emanating a terrifying divine might.</p><p></p><p>Under this divine might, the sword cultivators on the Moon Ship were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Fierce Yang Sword Immortal, even Lu Yuan was pressed to the ground, crawling on his body.</p><p></p><p>The divine might covered the world. A divine strike descended!</p><p></p><p>Brilliant light beams as thick as buckets radiated from the yin-yang divine diagram, striking towards the Celestial Beast.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Lord's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this is a divine strike from a great artifact!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly warned the Celestial Beast.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast beneath his feet did not move. When the strike arrived, it simply opened its mouth and swallowed it whole.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>After closing its mouth, smoke billowed from the Celestial Beast's nostrils, ears.</p><p></p><p>When it opened its mouth again, a plume of smoke rose, the strike having been devoured.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing the divine strike, the Celestial Beast's body actually swelled again!!</p><p></p><p>It looked at the Demon Prince with delighted surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's face was unsightly as his massive ten-thousand-zhang manifestation wavered. His eight arms reached into his spirit apertures, pulling out a divine wheel.</p><p></p><p>This divine wheel was huge, three zhang in size even without infusing it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The wheel of life and death spun on it, myriad heavens manifesting below.</p><p></p><p>This was the Myriad Heavens Wheel of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>"This is...!"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Lord's brows raised as he looked at this Myriad Heavens Wheel of Life and Death, inwardly feeling it was not good.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Demon Monarch's Myriad Heavens Wheel of Life and Death end up in your hands!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarch possessed a great artifact called the Myriad Heavens Wheel of Life and Death!</p><p></p><p>He comprehended the Myriad Heavens Wheel of Life and Death, then created the supreme ability of the same name!</p><p></p><p>And this great artifact was handed down to the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, now you know it's too late."</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of profound mysteries resonated, activating this supreme artifact beyond six thousand strands.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>At the location of Sword Gate Pass, a peculiar white cloud was rising upwards.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was rapid!</p><p></p><p>Piercing through the clouds, a sword trail struck the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the people within the thirteen ancient cities of the Northern Lands all saw a sword trail soaring into the vast starry sky!</p><p></p><p>"That's a sword trail flying out from Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>"I saw it! I saw an old man above Sword Gate holding a furnace and unleashing a strike!"</p><p></p><p>"What? A furnace? Could it be the Sword Sage of Sword Gate has opened the Sword Furnace?"</p><p></p><p>To their astonished gazes, this sword trail spanned the azure heavens, a myriad zhang sword aura piercing through the layers of celestial winds, directly slashing towards the moon!</p><p></p><p>This sword strike!</p><p></p><p>Came from the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>Slashing towards the moon!!</p><p></p><p>Spanning hundreds of millions of miles across the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>It was unleashed by a three-in-one supreme figure wielding the Sword Furnace.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was from the pinnacle Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist cultivated for half a year, surpassing the Three Sword Greats of Sword Gate, able to battle the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>His strength increased rapidly, but he could not slay the Demon Prince by himself.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from Planet Blue had also only cultivated for half a year, determining the protagonist's upper limit.</p><p></p><p>However, this small episode would still be exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>The journey to the moon in the Primordial Chaos was also nearing its end. Before the conclusion, the protagonist had to put on a show.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The students who were testing their qi and blood on the sports field paused and all looked towards the pathway across the field. </p><p></p><p>Fighter jets were roaring in the sky, with more and more gathering above Linji High School. Looking up, there were at least fifteen jets.</p><p></p><p>Facing these fighter jets, the Martial Chief's expression remained calm, without the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>He was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the martial sages of the old era, his power was enough to crush them.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary blood-exchanging martial sages during the Martial King period, they would begin the blood exchange after the third step. </p><p></p><p>The old blood would be washed away, giving birth to new blood symbiosis.</p><p></p><p>This step was too dangerous. If not careful, it could cause a massive loss of qi and blood, resulting in disability or instant death.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Chief was different.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the 22 Forms of the Dragon and Elephant Art, his qi and blood far exceeding the same realm. He also cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body, filling the third vertebra.</p><p></p><p>He had already preliminarily formed the divine body!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow Divine Body improved itself, and his qi and blood were also changing secretly.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to having gone through a blood exchange once!</p><p></p><p>This could be considered the Martial Chief's second blood exchange!</p><p></p><p>Black feathered wings lifted the Martial Chief's body high into the air, the two martial sages facing each other in the void.</p><p></p><p>The Jiangnan Chief felt the pressure!</p><p></p><p>He had heard of the Martial Chief before, but had never taken him seriously.</p><p></p><p>In so many cities of Jiangnan, there were many Martial Alliance Presidents at the Martial King realm, with more resounding titles and higher realms than the Martial Chief.</p><p></p><p>But today!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that this "Martial King" was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Patriarch roared angrily. He had already retracted his arm.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that he just wanted to discipline his unfilial son, but almost caused a rebellion in Linji!</p><p></p><p>And Linji's strength exceeded their imagination, even these Linji higher-ups were far more powerful than them when they entered Linji.</p><p></p><p>Especially this newly ascended martial sage.</p><p></p><p>This martial sage gave him a feeling almost on par with the First Martial Sage.</p><p></p><p>Exchanged blood twice? Or a martial sage who exchanged blood three times?</p><p></p><p>"Lord Gu, you are too righteous!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief smiled faintly, the golden crow wings behind him disappearing as he caught up to Gu Jiuqing's pace.</p><p></p><p>The other Linji higher-ups also closely followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Only leaving this group of bigwigs from the imperial capital looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>Since this matter involved the Gu family's affairs, they could not make arbitrary decisions.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>Awkward!</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that the person blocking his path would be Gu Zixiu's father?</p><p></p><p>This left Gu Jiuqing at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lived in the Gu family, but had never seen his grandfather's generation. His mother passed away early, and his father died five years ago in an ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>This was the norm in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, killings never ceased, and the deaths of cultivators were common occurrences.</p><p></p><p>In pursuit of higher realms, severing the six roots was also normal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's father was often away, so he rarely experienced a father's love. Now with a nominal father appearing, Gu Jiuqing hurriedly fled.</p><p></p><p>At one end of the sports field.</p><p></p><p>This was a spot Gu Jiuqing had long ago decided to set up the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Today, the first thing he did after entering Planet Blue was to open a channel between Planet Blue and the moon.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, the moon hidden behind the clouds, its body unseen.</p><p></p><p>He took out a palm-sized ancient teleportation array from his cosmic bag.</p><p></p><p>After he finished this, the Martial Chief led everyone to stand not far from Gu Jiuqing, not disturbing him, but quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the ancient teleportation array in his hand. Five minutes later, the array suddenly flashed a bright light.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>This was the signal that the other teleportation array had been set up on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing tore open the talisman paper on the ancient teleportation array!</p><p></p><p>A hexagram flew out of his palm and landed on the sports field below.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The field was crushed down, the plastic track sinking three to four meters deep.</p><p></p><p>A huge pit appeared before Gu Jiuqing's eyes. Taking a step forward, he saw that a large array had already formed in the pit.</p><p></p><p>A dim milky white light radiated from the hexagram, covering an area of about 30 square meters, or 6 x 5 meters.</p><p></p><p>Rays of light scattered about, extraordinarily strange.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief and the others not far away were also attracted by this wondrous sight, walking over to Gu Jiuqing's side.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, is this already connected to the moon's path?" Teacher Wen asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He heard Gu Jiuqing say that once the teleportation array was set up, they could go to the moon.</p><p></p><p>Such a method was inconceivable, like the spatial folding or wormhole technology on the science tree.</p><p></p><p>This kind of technology only existed in theory. For it to actually be achieved, who knows how many years humanity would need.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded. "It's done!"</p><p></p><p>The mayor was delighted. "You instructed me before to tell those lunar explorers that once the teleportation array was set up, they should place a thousand spirit stones in the array as you instructed to activate it."</p><p></p><p>So now they were waiting for the lunar explorers to activate the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Each activation of the teleportation array required a thousand spirit stones. Gu Jiuqing had given all the spirit stones to the mayor and the others.</p><p></p><p>Just enough for four activations of the array.</p><p></p><p>The anomaly at one end of the sports field also attracted the group of bigwigs who came from the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>They were still standing in their original spot, fighter jets circling overhead and not leaving Linji. This drew in a number of flying demonic beasts, but none reached Grade A, let alone Grade S. They were quickly slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening over there?"</p><p></p><p>"Light? Is that light from spotlights?"</p><p></p><p>One of the bigwigs raised a question.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at this moment, Gu Lao'er could interject.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, that seems to be an ancient teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient teleportation array??</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>The group of bigwigs were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er recounted what he saw when he arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Six days ago, Linji launched a manned rocket, and I heard the mayor and others say it seemed to be about opening a path to the moon."</p><p></p><p>"They placed one teleportation array on the moon, and the other on the school's sports field."</p><p></p><p>"It seems Linji wants to cultivate some divine ability, needing to go to the moon to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Teleportation array??</p><p></p><p>Opening a path between Planet Blue and the moon??</p><p></p><p>They could go to the moon through a teleportation array?</p><p></p><p>Divine ability?</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>On Planet Blue, divine abilities only existed in myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>What they cultivated were martial arts. Advanced martial arts came from the gateways to other realms.</p><p></p><p>"Technique approaches the Dao and can communicate with the Divine!"</p><p></p><p>An old man spoke up. "Divine ability, divine ability, it should be the highest realm of martial arts. If martial arts are cultivated to the extreme, perhaps that is a divine ability."</p><p></p><p>President Wei pondered, "Where did Linji get these divine abilities from? There are no records of divine abilities in other realms. From what you're saying, it seems Linji wants to widely spread divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>The various elders and experts all had different thoughts. If they could obtain Linji's cultivation methods for divine abilities...</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er smiled bitterly, "Big brother, you all don't know. Linji also has two supreme martial arts - the 22 Forms of the Dragon and Elephant Art, and the Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>"Those students are cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Art. In just three months, they can become martial artists, even grandmasters. I even saw middle school students become martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>Each of Gu Lao'er's statements left the experts present astonished.</p><p></p><p>Middle school martial artists?</p><p></p><p>"I also heard there are even elementary school martial artists in Linji!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er also felt this was absurd, but was it more absurd than opening a path to the moon?</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Sword Drawing Art. You can download it from Linji's city forum. Not just the Sword Drawing Art, but also methods to cultivate the Divine Body, open the Divine Apertures - they can all be downloaded online."</p><p></p><p>What??</p><p></p><p>These methods had already been made public?</p><p></p><p>Several bigwigs' expressions changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>Before they set out, they had cut off all connections with the lands across the great ocean.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Kingdom could not contact the nations across the ocean via the internet.</p><p></p><p>But they could still go there by ship or plane, though it was very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>But if those spies knew about this!</p><p></p><p>The eight national lords hurriedly passed the information to the Dragon Kingdom's national defense department, cutting off all channels that could connect to the lands across the ocean.</p><p></p><p>After just a few calls, the Dragon Kingdom's airports and ports were all shut down.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, that Martial Chief is truly powerful. At the Martial King realm, he killed a Golden-Winged Giant Falcon with a single sword strike. That was an S-grade demonic beast!"</p><p></p><p>"He used the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er revealed another major piece of information.</p><p></p><p>Killing an S-grade demonic beast at the Martial King realm with a single strike?</p><p></p><p>The Jiangnan Chief broke out in a cold sweat. If he had acted rashly earlier, he would have definitely died at the Martial Chief's hands.</p><p></p><p>A Martial King could instantly kill a Martial Sage-level demonic beast. Just how powerful was the Martial Chief, who had stepped into the Martial Sage realm?</p><p></p><p>Silence!!</p><p></p><p>The Linji Martial Sage was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Swish------------------"</p><p></p><p>Just as they were discussing, a dazzling beam of light came from the direction of the ancient teleportation array at one end of the sports field.</p><p></p><p>The hexagram flickered, tendrils of brilliant light shooting up, entering the clouds like countless spotlights, as if competing with the sun's radiance.</p><p></p><p>When these rays of light dispersed, they saw a deep pit at that end of the sports field.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the pit, there stood a person wearing a spacesuit.</p><p></p><p>"The transmission is complete!" </p><p></p><p>"Someone has been transmitted from the moon to the playground of Linjiang High School on Planet Blue!!"</p><p></p><p>That's a distance of 400,000 kilometers! A rocket flight would take over 100 hours, but the transmission array?</p><p></p><p>One hour?</p><p>Half an hour? </p><p>Or ten minutes?</p><p>Five minutes?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the chief's large hand, these bigwigs from the imperial capital also moved.</p><p></p><p>On the six-pointed star transmission array, there were still beams of light flickering. At the very center of the array, an astronaut took off her spacesuit, revealing an exquisite appearance and an almost perfect figure.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian looked at the school with pleasant surprise. </p><p></p><p>She had returned!</p><p></p><p>Of the hundred personnel on the moon, only she dared to attempt the transmission array, so only she returned to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>The return speed was too fast - just a moment ago she was still on the moon, and the next instant she entered Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Ms. Bai Muqian, on your successful return to Planet Blue."</p><p></p><p>The mayor hurriedly congratulated Bai Muqian. </p><p></p><p>They had heard of the rumors between Gu Jiuqing and Bai Muqian, although this matter seemed a bit absurd, it was better to believe it existed than to be wrong.</p><p></p><p>Outside the transmission array, more and more people gathered. Those examinees also came over and stood outside the six-pointed star, curiously looking around.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this just our school's Teacher Bai? Teacher Bai went to the moon some time ago, how did she appear at the school now?"</p><p></p><p>"The transmission array has been successfully built. Teacher Bai returned to Planet Blue through the transmission array!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god, the passage between Planet Blue and the moon has really been opened up, the news didn't lie to me!"</p><p></p><p>Students were shocked, teachers were shocked, and more and more people gathered around the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful eyes, someone took a step forward and entered the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>There was a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>At the very beginning, he was worried that setting up the transmission would be troublesome, so he had the mayor send a hundred people to the moon. Later, he realized that the ancient transmission array given to him by Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao was simply laid out.</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian had returned to Planet Blue through the transmission array, ensuring that the array could operate normally.</p><p></p><p>Inside the transmission array, Gu Jiuqing looked at the mayor.</p><p></p><p>"What? Don't you all want to set foot on the moon and see the scenery up there?"</p><p></p><p>Landing on the moon!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to land on Planet Blue's moon.</p><p></p><p>The mayor hurriedly jumped into the six-pointed star!</p><p></p><p>Followed by the president of the martial arts association, Old Man Wen, Mr. Qian Yue, Secretary Wen, the security chief, and the principal - these few also jumped into the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>For a 30-square-meter transmission array, this number of people was not much.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing then looked towards the crowd, "Are the students from Class 2 of Grade 12 here? The teacher will take you to the moon."</p><p></p><p>A group of students showed envious looks, and forty-five students rushed into the transmission array, filling it up.</p><p></p><p>The bigwigs from the imperial capital panicked!</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to go to the moon through the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>The chief of the Gu clan took a step forward and squeezed into the array!</p><p></p><p>The chairman of the Jiangnan Association also fell into the transmission array, followed by seven or eight more figures squeezing in.</p><p></p><p>The mayor took out a cloth bag and fished out spirit stones one by one from inside. </p><p></p><p>He counted very carefully, ensuring none were missed, and placed a complete thousand spirit stones into the groove at the center of the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>The spirit stones melted, and the surrounding light flickered.</p><p></p><p>The people on the transmission array disappeared into thin air, leaving only a group of people outside looking up at the sky, as if searching for the moon.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth.</p><p></p><p>Outside a small man-made base, ninety-nine people in spacesuits tried to take them off.</p><p></p><p>They were martial artists, including martial arts grandmasters, capable of micro-controlling their physical bodies and surviving on the moon for a short time.</p><p></p><p>If they became Martial Kings and got rid of their five viscera, they could even adapt to the outer space environment.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, they practiced the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill for the first time.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another stood outside the transmission array, circulating their vital energy and flushing their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>There were also grandmasters cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Body, absorbing the moonlight!</p><p></p><p>They only felt that their cultivation was increasing at a rate many times faster than on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"Swish——————"</p><p></p><p>Light condensed on the transmission array, and the ninety-nine figures stopped cultivating, stunned.</p><p></p><p>Sixty figures appeared on the transmission array!</p><p></p><p>"People transmitted from Planet Blue? Bai Muqian is also here!"</p><p></p><p>"The passage between the moon and Planet Blue has been opened!"</p><p></p><p>The moon landing personnel were delighted.</p><p></p><p>How much time had passed? Bai Muqian had just arrived on Planet Blue from the moon, and now she was back on the moon from Planet Blue?</p><p></p><p>A group of people hurried over to inform them of the survival rules in outer space and to properly circulate their vital energy.</p><p></p><p>But this group of people didn't need their instructions. One martial artist after another condensed their own vital energy, communicating with the outer space and maintaining their balance.</p><p></p><p>One martial artist after another walked out of the transmission array. They stood on the moon, looking at the vast land around them, the silent mountains, and that huge blue celestial body.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what it feels like standing on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Suffocating!</p><p>Apprehensive!</p><p>Uneasy!</p><p></p><p>They didn't have protective suits and couldn't stay on the moon for long.</p><p></p><p>Those Martial Kings, however, didn't care. They looked at Planet Blue, then at the land under their feet, their eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>"The moon, this is really the moon! I never thought I'd be able to set foot on the moon in my lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>One Martial King after another sighed. In the vacuum environment, their voices couldn't be transmitted.</p><p></p><p>The mayor, president of the martial arts association and the others looked at the desolate moon, constantly examining the terrain.</p><p></p><p>"For martial artists to land on the moon is still a bit difficult. It's better to be grandmasters or great grandmasters!"</p><p></p><p>The mayor felt inspired and released a wisp of vital energy from his body, spreading it around and enveloping everyone.</p><p></p><p>Under the embrace of vital energy, voices could be transmitted through those wisps.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing responded from the side.</p><p></p><p>"You're wrong. In the future, only Martial Kings will be able to set foot on the moon to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's current physical body was at the grandmaster level, so he could also survive on the moon for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>He took out a peach seed and planted it on the moon.</p><p></p><p>His every move was observed by the martial artists on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Forty-five students! The Linjiang higher-ups! The imperial capital bigwigs! One hundred moon landing personnel! They all watched Gu Jiuqing, very curious about this peach seed.</p><p></p><p>"This is a seed of the Peaches of Immortality. I don't know if it can grow into a Peaches of Immortality tree after being planted on the moon."</p><p></p><p>The Peaches of Immortality!!</p><p></p><p>This was actually the legendary Peaches of Immortality from myths?!!!</p><p></p><p>The bigwigs from the imperial capital were shocked. The chief of the Gu clan looked deeply at Gu Jiuqing - he couldn't see through this son, couldn't figure him out. He had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang higher-ups seemed to listen to Gu Jiuqing's words.</p><p></p><p>"Each time the transmission array is activated, it requires a thousand spirit stones. You'll have to figure that out yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the mayor immediately wilted. There were only two thousand spirit stones left in his cosmic bag. Did that mean the transmission array could only be activated twice more?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had given this deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the moon's divine abilities on the moon was Gu Jiuqing's original reason for opening the lunar passage.</p><p></p><p>Who would cultivate these abilities?</p><p></p><p>Those martial artists?</p><p></p><p>That would be a waste!</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, there were probably only about ten Martial Kings in Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>Jiangnan Province had twenty independent cities, with about ten Martial Kings in each, so around two hundred. The provincial capital would have at least fifty Martial Kings!</p><p></p><p>That's two hundred and fifty Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>In the twenty-three provinces of the Dragon Nation, there were at least five thousand Martial Kings! Adding the Martial Kings from the four metropolitan areas, there would be at least a thousand more.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Jiuqing was only counting the young and vigorous Martial Kings. There were quite a few elderly Martial Kings in each city as well.</p><p></p><p>The mayor nodded helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, we can arrange for a group of Martial Kings to specifically cultivate divine abilities on the moon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not avoid the other people and stated his thoughts directly.</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang higher-ups exchanged glances, realizing this deity wanted to build a base on the moon.</p><p></p><p>They looked around the desolate area, as if seeing a vast Guanghan Palace standing on the moon!</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities again!</p><p></p><p>The bigwigs from the imperial capital stared at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The heads of the top four clans, two presidents of the Dragon Academy, the chairman of the Jiangnan Association - these seven furrowed their brows tightly.</p><p></p><p>They were like outsiders, listening to Gu Jiuqing's words but unable to make sense of them.</p><p></p><p>"Um, Teacher Gu, it seems you haven't passed down the methods for divine abilities yet."</p><p></p><p>The mayor mustered his courage to ask!</p><p></p><p>It was him again, asking Gu Jiuqing for cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The others secretly gave the mayor a thumbs up!</p><p></p><p>Deity, you've said so much, the moon passage has been opened, but what about the methods for divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>"Methods for divine abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled calmly. He stepped onto the moon's surface and gazed at the azure Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Today!</p><p></p><p>He would impart the methods on the moon!</p><p></p><p>(On the moon it's a vacuum, so sound cannot be transmitted, and there are various other factors. But this is a novel after all, and since the spiritual qi has been revived, perhaps the moon is also suitable for human habitation now. Please forgive any inconsistencies.)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

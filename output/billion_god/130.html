            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The brilliant sunlight scattered upon Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's body, igniting the female form! </p><p></p><p>A divine flame burned fiercely on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva paid no mind to this scene. </p><p></p><p>He was a pure yang ancient ancestor, an existence that had passed through nine levels of thunderbolt tribulation. This was merely a divine flame, what was there to make a fuss about?</p><p></p><p>"Roar roar roar————————"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying roar came from below, ripping apart the universe, shaking the azure sky, causing even the Ancient Mountain to sway.</p><p></p><p>The ancient forbidden formation was shattered, various divine lights tearing apart.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva stared fixedly at this arm.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago!</p><p></p><p>He thought he was going to perish. </p><p></p><p>This arm covered in red fur was too terrifying, even he, a pure yang ancient ancestor, revealed a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>He worried that the owner of this red furry arm was the trump card of the Future Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately! He only borrowed a sliver of power."</p><p></p><p>The arm fell from the cliff edge, sinking into the abyss, disappearing from sight. </p><p></p><p>An eerie aura drifted through the air, reflecting off the divine flame on his chest, wisps of energy surging from between heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva frowned, raising his hand to pluck off the divine flame.</p><p></p><p>The divine flame burned in his palm, the red flames exceptionally bright.</p><p></p><p>He blew a breath at the divine flame, extinguishing it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this your ploy?"</p><p></p><p>Borrowing power from the terrifying existence behind the Ancient Mountain, but it was only a sliver of power, still no match for Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was indifferent, he did not speak!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva stepped forward, and the golden lotus pedestal beneath his feet suddenly cracked open.</p><p></p><p>Streams of female figures fell from above, torn into quarters, bloody and mangled, becoming puddles of flesh.</p><p></p><p>The lotus pedestal scattered, Buddha's light shining, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva fell from above, standing among the rocks.</p><p></p><p>He revealed an astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>A trace of extinguishing aura spread through his body.  </p><p></p><p>His golden lotus pedestal extinguished, his golden body about to be extinguished in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang golden body method, the golden body he condensed was disappearing bit by bit, Guangping Bodhisattva could only feel his power fading away.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh——————"</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling.</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang golden body method was the result of his many years of cultivation. To cultivate the three-zhang golden body, he had suffered too many hardships.</p><p></p><p>None of the Eighteen Arhats had ever fully cultivated the three-zhang golden body.</p><p></p><p>Only a Bodhisattva could cultivate the three-zhang golden body method to completion, condensing a three-zhang physique!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's light on Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's body surged, the golden body separating from the flesh body, a three-zhang golden body emanating a golden divine light.</p><p></p><p>However, now streaks of rust appeared on this three-zhang golden body.</p><p></p><p>The golden body was corroding!</p><p></p><p>Golden liquid dripped from the golden body, the Buddhist dharma Guangping Dali Bodhisattva had cultivated over many years, disappearing just like that.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Bodhisattva reached out, wanting to reapply the golden liquid onto the golden body, but as soon as his hands grabbed the golden liquid, more of his cultivation scattered.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha dharma and seals became extremely concentrated, the entire Ancient Mountain drifting with the great dharma of Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's understanding of the Buddha dharma plummeted a thousand levels!</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuanjing silently watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Manifestations Ancient Ancestor in his Mud Bead Palace was also perplexed.</p><p></p><p>He had only seen Niu Tou borrow an ominous power to unleash the Mirror Raven Primordial Divine Art curse against Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Then this scene occurred with Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's golden lotus scattered, his three-zhang golden body also melting away.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's flesh body fell apart into chunks of bloody flesh, the dharma power within extinguishing bit by bit, his blood essence also dissipating.  </p><p></p><p>This was extremely similar to dharma termination!</p><p></p><p>But Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was a pure yang ancient ancestor, his primordial spirit pure yang, his primordial spirit separating from the Mud Bead Palace, pure yang aura illuminating heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>There were no signs of his primordial spirit undergoing dharma termination.</p><p></p><p>"Swish——"</p><p></p><p>Under the brilliant sunlight, a second divine flame ignited.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva looked at the second divine flame on his chest, this time not taking action to extinguish it, allowing the red divine flame to burn on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"My golden body did not continue corroding."</p><p></p><p>Not just the golden body, even his flesh body and dharma power did not continue extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>But his essence, energy, and spirit were slowly dissipating, this dissipating essence, energy and spirit ignited by the divine flame.</p><p></p><p>The horror in Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's heart disappeared, he furrowed his brow, looking down at the divine flame, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"When this penniless monk extinguished the divine flame earlier, a trace of extinguishing power was born within, able to extinguish this penniless monk's dharma power and flesh body!"</p><p></p><p>Only unable to affect the pure yang primordial spirit, or perhaps, relying solely on a sliver of extinguishing power was insufficient to extinguish the pure yang primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>"And now, this penniless monk did not extinguish the divine flame, so the divine flame ignited this penniless monk's essence, energy and spirit."</p><p></p><p>Phew———————</p><p></p><p>He let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>That had really given this Bodhisattva quite a fright.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's mouth curved up in a faint smile. "Future Buddha ah, Future..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Lao Fo, your methods are quite formidable." </p><p></p><p>"But this divine fire cannot refine my Buddha nature!"</p><p></p><p>No matter how the divine fire burned, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was unafraid.</p><p></p><p>Under the radiant sunlight, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva slightly frowned, for he discovered another divine fire had grown on his chest. </p><p></p><p>The two red divine fires burned his spirit, energy and essence, devouring his powers, physical body, origins, realms and cultivation. Even his primordial spirit showed slight signs of dissipation.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva looked at the two red divine fires on his chest. With a clap of his hands towards his Mud Ball Palace, pure yang energy poured down, enveloping the divine fires.</p><p></p><p>The divine fires still burned, but without the nourishment of spirit, energy and essence, they shrank to just thumb-size.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>The third, fourth, fifth and sixth divine fires all bloomed together. </p><p></p><p>An anomaly appeared on Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's body.</p><p></p><p>A single red strand of hair grew out from his bald head!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva actually had hair growing on his head.</p><p></p><p>Buddhist disciples shave their heads during cultivation, representing the renunciation of mortal dust and entry into the dharma gates with single-minded devotion to Buddha.</p><p></p><p>For a single red hair to grow on Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's head was an unacceptable fact.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly used his powers to vaporize the strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>The hair disappeared, but more red strands grew out from his head.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, red fuzz covered his entire body, from his armpits to everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish————"  </p><p></p><p>The seventh and eighth divine fires bloomed in succession.</p><p></p><p>When Guangping Dali Bodhisattva looked at his chest, eight divine fires blazed with red flames, devouring his spirit, energy and essence.</p><p></p><p>After consuming much of Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's spiritual reserves, the divine fires transformed into eight red phoenix-like birds.</p><p></p><p>The red phoenix-like birds circled his chest, as if rooted there unable to fall off.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's figure was enveloped in red hair, strands falling to the ground growing longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>Ominous!</p><p></p><p>Completely enshrouding Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Twenty Great Catastrophes!!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder was aghast, finally recalling the memory from his youth.</p><p></p><p>That was the most terrifying scene in his memory.</p><p></p><p>In the Larva Village, every household with someone over age twenty would have large amounts of red hair appear daily.</p><p></p><p>As a child, he had thought someone had dyed their hair red!</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder finally understood.</p><p></p><p>That was red hair grown from one's own spirit, energy and essence!</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish!!"</p><p></p><p>The red hair on Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's body was vaporized, rays of divine light flashing.</p><p></p><p>He returned to his previous appearance, but new red hair immediately regrew.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Bodhisattva had no choice but to constantly vaporize the red hair with his powers!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the eight phoenix-like birds circled his chest, igniting his spirit, energy and essence.</p><p></p><p>"Future Buddha! What taboo did you place on this poor monk!"</p><p></p><p>Flustered.</p><p></p><p>Terrified!</p><p></p><p>Even a pure yang ancient elder looked at Gu Jiuqing in shock.</p><p></p><p>He was a pure yang primordial spirit ancient elder, but now he found his own pure yang primordial spirit was dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Before long, his entire spiritual reserves would be ignited by the divine fires or turned into red hair and depleted.</p><p></p><p>"Death death death!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the massive outflow of inner powers, even the powers in his celestial spirit apertures were rapidly scattering.</p><p></p><p>Part of his three-zhang golden body had also rotted away, his two legs already gone!</p><p></p><p>If this continued, even his true form would perish.</p><p></p><p>All this occurred in just a few breaths, when Guangping Dali Bodhisattva had still been waiting for Gu Jiuqing's final move.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could no longer wait, he had to strike first!</p><p></p><p>Buddha's light shone universally, Buddha's dharma was vast as the ocean. The Bodhisattva stretched out his hand, the void was extinguished, and Buddha's worlds descended!</p><p></p><p>Billions of disciples chanted Amitabha Buddha across the lands!</p><p></p><p>Buddha's voice resounded, this strike was of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>This strike had already surpassed the concept of tribulations, even celestials of the ninth tribulation would die from it.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the sword talisman in his hand flickered, Liang Xiao Shifu was sending him another message.</p><p></p><p>"Release your mind and spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grabbed the First Scourge with his left hand and Lu Yuan with his right. Wandering freely, his physical form dispersed, reappearing below Tiangu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>His spirit roamed while his body traveled. In just a few breaths, he had descended from Tiangu Mountain!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>Tiangu Mountain erupted, the entire divine mountain shaking, layer after layer of prohibitions tearing apart, pure yang energy permeating. Another figure emerged from the overwhelming prohibitions and brilliant pure yang light.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was too powerful. Even enshrouded in this ominous state, he could not be easily subdued in a short time.</p><p></p><p>With his profound reserves, it would take at least...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It would take months to burn him to death!</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Guangping Dali Bodhisattva blew out the eight divine fires, the Extinction Power would appear directly, suppressing and killing him. This depended on whether Guangping Dali Bodhisattva could withstand this Extinction Power. </p><p></p><p>The first great villain dared not resist, allowing Gu Jiuqing to seize his body.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was taking notes on the side. </p><p></p><p>Rainbow ripples flickered on the horizon, as Gu Jiuqing traversed the ancient ruins, using his sword mark to search for the direction of Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the Ancient Mountains split apart, and a female Bodhisattva bathed in Buddha's light, her body bare, walked down from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, he sensed Gu Jiuqing's location.</p><p></p><p>"Run! Where can you run to?"</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva now had only one thought - to capture the Future Buddha and hand him over to the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's rainbow technique was too fast. In just a few breaths, his figure broke through the vast sky, arriving at a mountain ridge outside.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the broken walls and ruins of the mountain ridge, there was a huge cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>"This is the entrance to the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Patriarchs of the Mud Ball Palace gazed into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Neither Jiang Xiaoyou nor Niu Tou were a match for Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>He was also curious as to what means these two unparalleled talents of the current era would use to deal with a Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not expect that Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao would choose the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity as the location to kill the Bodhisattva!</p><p></p><p>Outside the entrance to the Great Tomb, there were many figures of cultivators standing.</p><p></p><p>There were disciples from great clans, as well as people from the Nine Continents, and disciples from the Sword Sect and the Star Palace.</p><p></p><p>"That's Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized Gu Jiuqing's figure.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they had recognized Gu Jiuqing, but they could not believe that a Bodhisattva would be chasing him.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Jiuqing had reappeared at this place, several true disciples of the Sword Sect looked at him in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is Senior Martial Brother Gu also going to enter the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity?"</p><p></p><p>"The first stop for Senior Martial Brother Gu after descending the mountain is also the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>They marveled endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to converse with Gu Jiuqing, the rainbow fire suddenly vanished into the dark cave.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the true disciples of the Sword Sect changed, and they laughed dryly, saying no more.</p><p></p><p>After some time, several true disciples of the Sword Sect considered and also wanted to enter the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>"Wushala ————"</p><p></p><p>In the distant heavens, Buddha's light illuminated the sky, and boundless radiance scattered. A bare-bodied Bodhisattva descended onto this mountain ridge.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva frowned, standing outside the deep pit!</p><p></p><p>This was Guangping Dali Bodhisattva, who had chased the Future Buddha from the Ancient Mountains to the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>"The Future Buddha led this poor monk into the Ancient Mountains, and now he wants to enter the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>Buried in this great tomb was an Immortal Lord from the ancient era!</p><p></p><p>But to these Pure Yang Patriarchs, this great tomb was not much of a concern.</p><p></p><p>In their repeated explorations of ancient ruins, the great tombs of many Immortal Lords from ancient times had been excavated, but apart from some personal artifacts of the Immortal Lords, not even a shadow had been found.</p><p></p><p>After tens of thousands of years, those who died in ancient times, even their divine corpses would dissipate!</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva only pondered for an instant before acting.</p><p></p><p>Buddha's light fell from his body, and red hairs danced in the air. This time, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva did not care about the red hairs growing on his body.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's state of mind had calmed!</p><p></p><p>A Bodhisattva covered in red hair also entered the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators outside the great tomb sensed the Pure Yang aura and were all startled.</p><p></p><p>"What is this Bodhisattva from the Buddhist sect doing, entering the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity?"</p><p></p><p>"Earlier, it seemed that Senior Martial Brother Gu was being chased by this Bodhisattva. Could it be that this Bodhisattva is entering the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity to continue pursuing Senior Martial Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the true disciples of the Sword Sect changed!</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go and inform the Sword Child of this!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'll go and perform the Sword Ritual to inform the elders of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Child was no match for a Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>After realizing that Gu Jiuqing did not intentionally ignore them, the true disciples of the Sword Sect immediately took action to assist him.</p><p></p><p>Sword lights flew out from the ancient ruins, heading towards the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Boom ——————"</p><p></p><p>The mountain ridge below collapsed, burying the cave entrance to the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>Figures flew up into the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"A great battle has broken out inside the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators looked at the buried land in alarm.</p><p></p><p>True disciples of the Sword Sect being chased by a Bodhisattva?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these two great sects were at war again?</p><p></p><p>The thought was too terrifying. For a moment, these cultivators stood there, at a loss.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"To have you students go to the 23 provinces and 4 capital cities to spread the Dharma instead of Teacher Gu?"</p><p></p><p>The 45 students were startled. </p><p></p><p>Three months ago, they were just ordinary high school students. In order to break through the qi and blood value of 1, they practiced bitterly every day, but that was not the worst of it.</p><p></p><p>The worst was seeing no hope of breaking through the qi and blood value of 1. </p><p></p><p>However, everything changed after Teacher Gu took a half-month leave.</p><p></p><p>When Teacher Gu reappeared, he brought them the Dragon and Elephant Skill, which greatly increased their qi and blood values. Later, they cultivated into martial artists and also practiced the Sword Drawing Technique!</p><p></p><p>Just today, the results they achieved in the college entrance examination shocked the entire nation.</p><p></p><p>The 45 students from Class 2 of Grade 3 all became martial artists, with qi and blood values above 9! Some even cultivated into grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>In just three short months, they underwent an earth-shattering transformation.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>They were merely students who had just finished the college entrance exam, having never set foot into society or left Linji.</p><p></p><p>Yet Teacher Gu wanted them to go to other provincial capitals to spread the Dharma on his behalf?</p><p></p><p>"If I don't spread the Dharma well, will people criticize me? Will it implicate Teacher Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"What if I spread the wrong Dharma and someone dies?"</p><p></p><p>"Go to the capital cities? Go to 23 provinces? Wouldn't that mean facing many people?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, with so many people, I'll get flustered."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The 45 students had different expressions, each harboring their own worries.</p><p></p><p>Behind these students, the four state masters and two deans of the Dragon Academy were once again shocked by Gu Jiuqing's words.</p><p></p><p>They had always thought that Gu Jiuqing was spreading the Dharma for the people of Linji to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But from Gu Jiuqing's words, it seemed he wanted to spread the Dharma across the entire Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>Even the patriarch of the Gu clan, this middle-aged man, could not help but admire this unfilial son's ambition.</p><p></p><p>The Wuji of the Gu clan, the Refining Skin Technique, Refining Flesh Technique, Refining Bone Technique, Refining Tendon Technique, Refining Viscera Technique, and the Blood Substitution Technique were all secret arts that were not to be passed down.</p><p></p><p>Even he had not learned the secret Blood Substitution Technique until now!!</p><p></p><p>These arts were all mastered by the clan's ancestors. He was a state master of the Dragon Nation and the patriarch of the clan, so he could not casually change the rules.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the four state masters remain silent, Dean Wei quickly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Students, you don't need to be afraid. It's just going to the 23 provinces and 4 capital cities to spread the Dharma, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, we will have people cooperate with you. From the moment you leave Linji, we will dispatch stationed troops to protect you safely in and out of the wilderness. When you enter the cities, martial artists from the security department will protect you! You will absolutely not face any danger whatsoever."</p><p></p><p>"Students, you only need to go to other cities to spread the Dharma. We will take care of all the other matters, setting up venues, promotion, and so on!!"</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei's words dispelled the worries of many students.</p><p></p><p>Dean Yang chimed in from the side, "That's right, how could you, as Teacher Gu's students, be scared of spreading the Dharma?"</p><p></p><p>"Just previously, we have already cut off connections with the lands across the ocean. No planes or ships can travel there anymore."</p><p></p><p>"You'll be spreading the Dharma within the Dragon Nation, so you won't face assassination by foreign spies."</p><p></p><p>Because those spies were already dead!</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the Human Immortal, the Dragon Academy was shaken. That night, the entire nation was shaken, and many clans and forces were massacred, completely eliminating all the spies.</p><p></p><p>With the Dragon Nation's official guarantee of safety, the 45 students had no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups from Linji stood behind Gu Jiuqing without a word.</p><p></p><p>This deity spread the Dharma in Linji with great selflessness!</p><p></p><p>Now spreading the Dharma across the entire Dragon Nation also matched this deity's persona.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they could not stop him anyway.</p><p></p><p>Communications had already been restored, and with the higher-ups of the Dragon Nation aware of this matter, Linji could no longer maintain its lockdown.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher! When will we go spread the Dharma!"</p><p></p><p>Class president Yang Miaoqing mustered her courage.</p><p></p><p>The other students became determined, showing resolute expressions.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled slightly, "No rush, wait until I pass down the Divine Body Cultivation Method to you, then you can go spread the Dharma."</p><p></p><p>Divine Body Cultivation Method?</p><p></p><p>Didn't they already have that?</p><p></p><p>The 45 students were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They only heard Teacher Gu continue, "Yang Miaoqing, you will go to the various major cities in Jiangnan Province to spread the Golden Crow Divine Body Method!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely complete the mission!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoqing hurriedly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Que, you will go to Xijiang Province to spread the Yin-Yang Divine Body Cultivation Method!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Que promptly responded.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Jiuqing named others, "Wen Daihua, you will go to Jiangbei Province to spread the Gengjin Divine Body Method. I will now impart the Gengji Divine Body Cultivation Method to you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing recited the Gengji Divine Body Cultivation Method.</p><p></p><p>"Lan Bai, you will go to Jiangdong Province to spread the Mountains and Rivers Divine Body Method. I will now teach you the Mountains and Rivers Divine Body Cultivation Method!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>A total of 32 Divine Body Cultivation Methods were imparted, including the previously mentioned Golden Crow and Yin-Yang methods.</p><p></p><p>Each of the 23 provinces and 4 capital cities had their own Divine Body Cultivation Method, and a few larger provincial capitals had two spirit techniques imparted. In this way, Gu Jiuqing's idea of verifying the Pan Gu theory could finally begin.</p><p></p><p>After passing down all the Divine Body Methods, Gu Jiuqing then said:</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Technique are foundational cultivation methods. You can spread them nationwide, and you can also spread the other methods."</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts across the land, everyone like dragons! I hope you can take this as your belief!!"</p><p></p><p>Publicly releasing cultivation methods online was the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Traveling to the 23 provinces of the Dragon Nation and personally spreading the Dharma in each city would allow for more detailed transmission.</p><p></p><p>These two approaches proceeded in parallel. Gu Jiuqing wanted the 1 billion people of the Dragon Nation to all cultivate the methods he imparted.</p><p></p><p>The seven Lunar Spirit Techniques, 32 Divine Body Cultivation Methods, Dragon and Elephant Skill, Sword Drawing Technique, the great Courtyard Sword Classic, and the 333 Spirit Aperture Opening Methods would appear in every corner of the Dragon Nation!</p><p></p><p>Whether talented or mediocre, from the data of 1 billion people, Gu Jiuqing would accept their cultivation and insights, ushering in a formidable transformation!!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>A faint voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing walked towards the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>They were on the moon, and Gu Jiuqing's physical body was only at the grandmaster level. If not for the Martial Saint's qi and blood enveloping them, they would have exploded long ago.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another gathered on the teleportation formation. The mayor reluctantly took out spirit stones one by one.</p><p></p><p>These treasures, using even one meant having one less. After this trip, the remaining spirit stones would only be enough to activate the teleportation formation once more.</p><p></p><p>A thousand spirit stones were placed into the grooves of the teleportation formation, and the figures instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Outside the formation, a hundred lunar explorers looked at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>"Did you all memorize the spirit technique cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>"I memorized some. Let's go back to the base first and write down these spirit techniques."</p><p></p><p>Excitement!</p><p></p><p>These great figures had spread the Dharma on the moon without hiding anything from them.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Martial Saint's qi and blood had also enveloped them, allowing them to hear Gu Jiuqing's teachings and see the patterns on the spirit technique talismans.</p><p></p><p>Lunar spirit techniques!</p><p></p><p>They could cultivate right on the moon, without waiting for the next teleportation formation to open.</p><p></p><p>The hundred people hurriedly returned to the space capsule, having also obtained this transformation.</p><p></p><p>Planet Earth, Linji, high school playground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Fighter jets circled above the playground, while a large crowd had gathered outside the school. Those martial artists who had been watching the martial arts tournament surrounded the school gates.</p><p></p><p>There were also security personnel with police cars maintaining order outside.</p><p></p><p>Outside the teleportation formation on the playground!</p><p></p><p>The martial kings of Linji were apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>The departure of the Martial Chief and the mayor made them fear being judged as traitors by the higher-ups of the Dragon Nation!!</p><p></p><p>However, the great figures from the Heavenly Capital paid no heed, instead taking out their phones to use Linji's local area network!</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er had informed them about the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Technique. Additionally, Gu Jiuqing and the others had used the teleportation formation to go to the moon, so they waited here, having nothing better to do.</p><p></p><p>They found the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Technique on Linji's forum.</p><p></p><p>"The 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. So the high school students in Linji relied on this cultivation method to achieve such excellent results in the college entrance examination."</p><p></p><p>Dean Sima sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, he could see the formidable power of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Cultivating this method was far superior to all the body refining methods in the Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>"If this Dragon and Elephant Skill could be spread throughout the nation!"</p><p></p><p>Dean Sima dared not imagine how powerful the Dragon Nation would become.</p><p></p><p>With just a few years of cultivation, every person in the Dragon Nation would become a martial artist!</p><p></p><p>Martial artists would be as common as dogs, with grandmasters walking everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Only great grandmasters would be considered the elite of the Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>As for martial kings, they would merely receive a second glance!</p><p></p><p>Dean Zheng remained silent, determined to obtain this method from Linji.</p><p></p><p>He secretly recorded videos and saved them locally.</p><p></p><p>The 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the Sword Drawing Technique, the Golden Crow Spirit Technique Cultivation Method, the Yin-Yang Divine Body Cultivation Method, as well as various cultivation insights from the forum – he took screenshots of everything.</p><p></p><p>After he finished, the teleportation formation in front of him suddenly lit up, and one figure after another reappeared on it.</p><p></p><p>The people who had disappeared earlier reappeared on the playground.</p><p></p><p>The four state masters, the two deans of the Dragon Academy, the Martial Chief of Jiangnan Province!</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups of Linji City, the 45 students, and that son of the Gu clan!</p><p></p><p>Dean Zheng...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhangjiang put away his phone, squeezed into the crowd, and inquired about the situation with Dean Yang and Dean Wei. </p><p></p><p>"We just went to the moon, there are quite a few things happening, no need to rush, we..."</p><p></p><p>Before Dean Wei could finish, Dean Zheng said in a low voice, "Guess what we discovered from the Linjiang Forum?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he took out his recording and pictures.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The expected shock did not appear!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the two deans and the four national leaders were strange. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that they thought it was fake?</p><p></p><p>"Dean Zheng, you don't need to take screenshots, that person!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Dean Wei didn't know how to address Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Gu family? </p><p></p><p>Master Gu?</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>A figure left the crowd and walked alone towards the school gate.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing leaving the school.</p><p></p><p>"Ai ya, it's hard to explain everything to you in a short time. Anyway, that person wants to spread the dharma to Dragon Country, and all these dharmas will be spread to the twenty-three provinces and four capital cities."</p><p></p><p>Seeing people crowding around, Dean Wei hurriedly said, "Quick, go and call those students over!"</p><p></p><p>"Let them stay at the school first."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>What does that mean?</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei looked at the mayor of Linjiang City, then at Old Wen.</p><p></p><p>Old Wen!</p><p></p><p>A former vice dean of the Dragon Academy, but that was a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wen, long time no see. This school principal is your disciple, right?"</p><p></p><p>Old Wen knew what Dean Wei meant, but he didn't say it directly.</p><p></p><p>"Well, he's kind of a half-disciple, a good-for-nothing guy. What does Dean Wei want him to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's just say it directly. That person wants to spread the dharma all over the world, but some of the dharma is still with forty-five students. You're the principal's teacher, so have the principal keep the students here."</p><p></p><p>"One is to have them quickly write down the seven supernatural abilities into books, so they can be spread to Dragon Country."</p><p></p><p>"Two is to let us meet with them. With Linjiang's capabilities, it's unrealistic to escort them to the twenty-three provinces and four capital cities to spread the dharma."</p><p></p><p>The national leaders of Dragon Country stood behind Dean Wei, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>This matter!</p><p></p><p>It was quite urgent.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, but you need to agree to one condition for us."</p><p></p><p>The few national leaders frowned!</p><p></p><p>What status did they have! And what status did these people from Linjiang have?</p><p></p><p>To actually dare to set conditions for them.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wen, you say it."</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. The Dragon Academy will draft a proposal that Linjiang will become the ancestral city! It will become the fifth capital city of Dragon Country."</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three provinces and four capital cities!</p><p></p><p>These four cities were independent from the twenty-three provinces, a product of the era of spiritual energy's revival.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Academy!</p><p></p><p>Even the martial arts alliance of Dragon Country couldn't interfere in its internal affairs.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral city becoming the fifth capital city, this was establishing a separate regime!</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Dean Wei narrowed his eyes. The old man laughed derisively.</p><p></p><p>"You guys, you guys sealed off the city for three months, just for this??"</p><p></p><p>Three months! If the Dragon Palace had received the Martial Ancestor's dharma transmission three months earlier, Dragon Country would have already undergone earth-shaking changes by now!</p><p></p><p>The mayor!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader!</p><p></p><p>The chairmen of the three major corporations, every martial king looked at Dean Wei nervously.</p><p></p><p>Only Old Wen remained calm. "No way around it, Linjiang is also my hometown. For Linjiang to become the ancestral city, this old man can only lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei looked at the head of the Jiangnan Province branch. Finally, he understood!</p><p></p><p>So Old Wen had arranged this matter long ago.</p><p></p><p>Just Linjiang wanting independence, there was no way it could escape the notice of the head of the Jiangnan Province branch.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang sealed off the city, and this branch head allowed it without investigating!</p><p></p><p>This was his dereliction of duty.</p><p></p><p>But the Dragon Academy couldn't blame a Martial Saint either!</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei walked over to the few national leaders. After ten breaths, Dean Wei finally stood beside Old Wen again.</p><p></p><p>"They agreed!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Old Wen showed a slight smile. The Linjiang leadership was beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>Their efforts had not been in vain!</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, they sealed off Linjiang City, already prepared for the possibility of being besieged by the Dragon Country higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, Linjiang became the ancestral city, and they would become the local gentry of the ancestral city!!</p><p></p><p>They could sit on equal footing with the bigwigs of the Heavenly Capital!</p><p></p><p>At least in status, they could do so!</p><p></p><p>"However, you need to tell us the information about that Martial Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei put forth a demand.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor? You mean that deity?"</p><p></p><p>"Deity? So that's what you call that person!"</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor was the term used by the bigwigs of the Heavenly Capital for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>While deity was the term used by Linjiang for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"We know very little about that deity's information. We only know that deity is the young master of the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader laughed derisively as he looked at the Gu family's national leader.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family patriarch did not respond!</p><p></p><p>If it really was the young master of his Gu family, the Gu family would have already unified the Blue Planet long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, the deity lives in Jingyangxiaoqudistrict. He comes and goes without a trace. During these three months, we didn't disturb the deity much."</p><p></p><p>"Each time was the deity taking the initiative to contact us. I hope you all can do the same."</p><p></p><p>The deity was spreading the dharma in the human realm. If there was no interference from the Heavenly Capital, the deity would still reside in Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Then Dragon Country would absolutely not dare to declare war on the ancestral city!!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the few national leaders changed. Gu Lao'er, standing at the back of the crowd, walked forward and came before the martial arts leader.</p><p></p><p>"That's my Gu family's young master. You're saying we can't contact him just because you say so?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, the Gu family's young master? Does he even recognize you? Or does he recognize the Gu family patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er fell silent.</p><p></p><p>That's right, it seemed Gu Jiuqing had forgotten many things.</p><p></p><p>The first time Gu Lao'er met Gu Jiuqing, he had noticed the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei pondered, "But I heard you have the formulas for three elixir pills!"</p><p></p><p>Elixir pill formulas!</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang leadership immediately tensed up.</p><p></p><p>These were their lifelines. With these three elixir pills, they could become wealthy enough to rival nations - the foundation for them becoming aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>"You also have the teleportation array in your grasp. With Linjiang's small population, you have no use for a teleportation array, right?"</p><p></p><p>Dean Wei laughed derisively.</p><p></p><p>"Dean Wei, you're still the same. With so many people here, why bring up these things?"</p><p></p><p>Old Wen motioned for the principal to clear out an office.</p><p></p><p>"These matters are not important. Let's go to the office to discuss the details."</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late. Those students need to go home too. Wait until later, and I'll have the principal call them to the school one by one."</p><p></p><p>Old Wen started walking, and everyone else followed and left the sports field.</p><p></p><p>The fighter jets circling overhead received orders and flew out of Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang City's network communications were also restored at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Country was shaken!</p><p></p><p>The twenty-three provinces and four capital cities were shaken!</p><p></p><p>The entire nation was shaken!!</p><p></p><p>What had happened in Linjiang over the past three months was exposed online, and all kinds of information began to spread.</p><p></p><p>One billion people would learn about the events that took place in Linjiang over those three months!</p><p></p><p>The information of every high school graduate, every cultivation method, the teleportation array leading to the moon, the matter of the ancestral city of Linjiang - everything was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, it seemed the entire country was anticipating something.</p><p></p><p>But soon, news came from the Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang was renamed the Ancestral City!</p><p></p><p>Forty-five martial artists from the Ancestral City would enter the twenty-three provinces of Dragon Country and the other four capital cities to spread the dharma.</p><p></p><p>Then, the seven lunar supernatural abilities, the Great Courtyard Sword Classic, thirty-two divine body cultivation methods, the Dragon Elephant Skill's twenty-two forms, the Art of Drawing the Sword, the method to open the three hundred thirty-three divine acupoints - all were completely spread online!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, forty-five people boarded trains and left Linjiang, heading to other provinces and cities.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Country!</p><p></p><p>The era of everyone practicing martial arts and becoming like dragons had begun at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Forty-five Martial Divinities!</p><p></p><p>Taking the place of the Martial Ancestor to spread the dharma across the world.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness, the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing woke up from the supernatural abilities cultivation room. After this round of dharma transmission, Gu Jiuqing would not go to the Blue Planet for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of one billion people was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know his own cultivation base would soar to what level.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to continue spreading the dharma or transmitting it across the oceans.</p><p></p><p>He preferred to take things one step at a time when doing things, being too hasty could lead to mistakes.</p><p></p><p>"If I wait a few more days, I can try absorbing the cultivation achievements of everyone in Dragon Country for the first time!"</p><p></p><p>A paper crane folded from paper appeared beside Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This was the sect's voice transmission talisman that could transmit voices across a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Who used this voice transmission talisman on me?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the paper crane, and a message instantly manifested. There was no sound, only a line of text.</p><p></p><p>[Has Senior Martial Brother Gu emerged from seclusion? Tomorrow is the day our sect herds on the moon. Will Senior Martial Brother Gu tread upon the moon? This junior disciple has a matter to report to the Senior Martial Brother.]</p><p></p><p>This was the message left by Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So soon??"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paused, he had almost forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao had given his spot to Gu Jiuqing. As a Sword Immortal, Gu Jiuqing would herd on the moon, escorting the sect's disciples to tread upon the moon!</p><p></p><p>In just a few more hours, it would be time for the sect's moon herding.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual energy flowed, triggering the formation to transmit the news of his emergence to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was also curious what important matter Lu Yuan needed to report to him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's facial features became distorted, his vital energy sank, and great terror gripped his heart. He felt that his death was imminent. </p><p></p><p>The formless oppressive force grew increasingly dense - it was the overbearing aura of the Dragon and Elephant realm.</p><p></p><p>Practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill, imitating the Dragon and Elephant's body refinement, there was a vast difference between the third and fifth Shedding of Mortality. In between was the fourth Shedding.  </p><p></p><p>Around Qu Yaozhou, the Northern youths who had undergone the first Shedding were intimidated by Gu Jiuqing's aura and half-knelt on the ground. Lu Buye's figure was even prostrate, face down on the floor.</p><p></p><p>The Northern youth was trembling, while the four young masters from great clans nearby also showed signs of being shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Five Sheddings of Mortality! This is the fifth Shedding, the pinnacle of the Dragon and Elephant Skill!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>"Countless years ago, during the Sword Gate assessment, an unmatched peerless genius appeared and completed the five Sheddings within nine days!"</p><p></p><p>This was recorded in the annals of the Sword Gate and the Northern lands - nine days to complete five Sheddings, surpassing even peerless geniuses, reaching the level of a freak genius.</p><p></p><p>But back then, the body refinement method used by the Sword Gate for testing was the legendary Visualization Method that could supposedly allow one to cultivate to divinity, not some crude body refinement art like the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gu Jiuqing completed the five Sheddings within nine days because the Dragon and Elephant Skill could only go up to the fifth Shedding.</p><p></p><p>It's very possible that the Dragon and Elephant Skill limited Gu Jiuqing's talents!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou!</p><p>Qing Yangbai!</p><p>Even Fan Shaoli realized this point, looking at Gu Jiuqing with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura rushed forth, and the four peerless geniuses felt like they were facing a formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying, the power of the fifth Shedding is so immense?"</p><p></p><p>They had undergone three Sheddings, but before the fifth Shedding, they were like ants.</p><p></p><p>Facing Gu Jiuqing directly, Qu Yaozhou was enveloped by great terror. He let out a loud shout, trying to dispel his fright.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotian Que!"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's divine ability was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities required spiritual energy to activate, but some special ones were considered arcane arts that didn't need spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's blood flowed, wisps of vital energy evaporating. His 365 accupoints flickered in and out of sight, radiating light.</p><p></p><p>Along his spine, the light converged, gradually enveloping Qu Yaozhou's body.</p><p></p><p>Mists swirled around, smoke coiled, and specks of light shone in front of Qu Yaozhou, like a mountain peak shrouded in boundless divine radiance.</p><p></p><p>This was the image of Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that Buzhou Mountain supported the heavens and earth. In cultivation, one had to uphold their inner world like Buzhou Mountain, imitating the way of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou sacrificed the Qu family's bloodline, summoning the power of his ancient ancestors!</p><p></p><p>The flickering lights around him formed rippling waves of divine radiance, shaping a celestial temple that materialized before Qu Yaozhou!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou bowed to the temple, "Please, ancient ancestors, grant me your power!"</p><p></p><p>"That's the Ancestral Temple of the Qu family. Qu Yaozhou is borrowing the power of the Qu ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou glanced disdainfully at Xia Qingzhou. You wretched person!</p><p></p><p>Alerting Gu Jiuqing at this moment?</p><p></p><p>But it was too late!</p><p></p><p>The celestial temple trembled and transformed into divine radiance that flew into Qu Yaozhou's body, generating a majestic power within him.</p><p></p><p>Every second, vital energy was being sacrificed to sustain this power.</p><p></p><p>Powerful!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou felt an overwhelming majestic force filling his entire being. Even his physical body seemed to have expanded by three feet!</p><p></p><p>"The fifth Shedding?"</p><p></p><p>The fifth Shedding would also die!</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the power of the Qu ancestors, Qu Yaozhou's fear of Gu Jiuqing's fifth Shedding had vanished.</p><p></p><p>He actually struck first.</p><p></p><p>Dragon and Elephant Combined Strike!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant illusory images condensed - his left hand became a divine elephant, his right a true dragon. The left and right struck together, as if the Dragon and Elephant were about to attack.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>"Qu Yaozhou, in a life-and-death battle of the Northern lands, life and death are not to be discussed. Do not blame me for being merciless today."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had waited for Qu Yaozhou to attack first.</p><p></p><p>With the life-and-death battle pretext and Qu Yaozhou striking first, the timing, location, and circumstances all favored him. Today, Qu Yaozhou would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>The immense power of the Dragon and Elephant condensed. Behind Gu Jiuqing was the illusory Dragon and Elephant image - not the blood-colored one, but a physical Dragon and Elephant form similar to the real thing, towering over three zhang tall!</p><p></p><p>The massive Dragon and Elephant descended from the heavens. The power of the fifth Shedding, combined with the force of the Dragon and Elephant, overwhelmed the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Space shattered, like the sound of an explosion.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's hands froze - this punch had landed!</p><p></p><p>His palms were blown apart, flesh and blood mangled. A force surged through his palms, numbing his entire arms.</p><p></p><p>A burst of pain assaulted him. Before Qu Yaozhou could react, the punch, carrying the force of the Dragon and Elephant, pierced straight through his dantian!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Just one punch!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's body was sent flying. His ribs shattered one by one, his internal organs ruptured. In mid-air, he coughed up mouthfuls of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, the ground covered in red. Qu Yaozhou crashed heavily to the floor.</p><p></p><p>"You...you..." </p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou wanted to say something, but instead spat out a massive amount of blood, crimson streaks flowing from his mouth, nose and ears.</p><p></p><p>"You wanted to say that the Dragon and Elephant force I condensed wasn't just one, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his punch and stood still. Behind him, the illusory image of a second Dragon and Elephant converged, quickly solidifying.</p><p></p><p>Two Dragon and Elephant forces manifested behind Gu Jiuqing, their power imbuing him!</p><p></p><p>No wonder that one punch nearly killed Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>"Qu Yaozhou opened the Ancestral Temple, borrowing the power of the Qu ancestors. That level of power surpassed the fourth Shedding, on par with the fifth."</p><p></p><p>"But!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had been hiding another trick - he had actually condensed the force of a second Dragon and Elephant.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's beautiful eyes swirled as his mind was thrown into turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"Is the gap between me and Gu Jiuqing really that large?"</p><p></p><p>As fellow peerless geniuses, how could the difference be so vast?</p><p></p><p>The fifth Shedding, condensing the force of two Dragon and Elephants?</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>As Xia Qingzhou was still reeling from Gu Jiuqing's talents, that overwhelming aura that had descended earlier stirred again. A figure stepped through the void towards them.</p><p></p><p>Even before arriving, an immense oppressive force shattered the Dragon and Elephant aura.</p><p></p><p>Mountainous!</p><p>Weighty!</p><p>Vast like the starry cosmos!</p><p>Immensely weighty, profoundly unfathomable - this was the aura of the Spirit Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was Qu Yaozhou's protector taking action.</p><p></p><p>"You decrepit old Qu, this is a life-and-death battle of the Northern lands. Besides the two combatants, no outsiders can interfere. Are you trying to disrupt the rules?"</p><p></p><p>The Xie Steward soared into the sky, blocking Qu Yaozhou's protector.</p><p></p><p>His white hair cascaded like a waterfall as the Xie Steward's hunched figure regained its former glory.</p><p></p><p>The wrinkles on his face gradually faded away, his white hair turning into youthful dark locks. Behind him materialized a three-legged golden raven - the divine body of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>The Xie Steward had also cultivated the Gu family's divine body, condensing the image of the golden raven.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The semi-Spirit Refinement Realm? The Gu family still has such an expert?"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's protector sneered.</p><p></p><p>The semi-Spirit Refinement Realm?</p><p></p><p>Before this true Spirit Refinement expert, he was merely an ant.</p><p></p><p>An ant obstructing his path?</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>The Qu protector raised his hand, a crystalline translucent finger descending towards the Xie Steward.</p><p></p><p>The finger contained terrifying inscriptions, dots of divine light crisscrossing like a star map, twinkling with starlight.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, go ahead. This old servant can at least hold him off for three breaths!"</p><p></p><p>The Xie Steward had regained his youthful handsomeness, his aura reaching its peak as the three-legged golden raven image took flight, golden spiritual energy flowing within him.</p><p></p><p>That single finger from the heavens landed on the Xie Steward's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On his brow, the golden crow brand emitted a burst of flames. </p><p></p><p>When his fingers touched the golden crow flames, his outer body was instantly scorched. The Qu family protector withdrew his hand!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Jiuqing felt relieved. In just a few steps, he was already standing in front of Qu Yaozhou. </p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's face was covered in blood, his physical energy extremely depleted. He wanted to say something, but all that came out of his mouth was blood.</p><p></p><p>His internal organs and bones were shattered, most of his physical energy evaporated. For the Qu family, such injuries were just minor wounds. </p><p></p><p>Physical injuries can be healed by many powerful medicines.</p><p></p><p>But that also required time for Qu Yaozhou to recover!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not hesitate. He raised his hand, channeling the power of two dragon avatars through his body. A force gathered in his palm. He raised his arm, using all his strength!</p><p></p><p>Then he struck down towards the horrified Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Heavenly Abyss City, the Gu family, Gu Jiuqing, you should hold your hand."</p><p></p><p>The sword gate closed, shaking the divine mountain. Those disciples who were flying through the void or riding swords were slightly moved upon hearing this voice.</p><p></p><p>"This is Elder Qu's voice! Is the White Jade Sword Immortal Elder Qu going to take action??"</p><p></p><p>Along with the exclamations, a sword immortal walked down step-by-step from the divine mountain. He did not emanate any aura, but everyone's gaze converged on this sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly White Jade Capital, there are twelve floors and five cities!</p><p></p><p>The immortals support my crown, and I receive longevity by tying my hair!</p><p></p><p>The true disciples under the White Jade Sword Immortal were the most numerous. This elder was deeply loved by the sword disciples, and they all wished to join his school and become part of the White Jade Peak lineage.</p><p></p><p>A peerless sword immortal, like a mortal elder, merely walking in the void. The howling winds of heaven and earth could not even ruffle his robe, revealing this sword immortal's identity.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing stop his hand, he showed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, the Qu family had not produced a decent descendant for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was absolutely one of the few prodigies the Qu family had in hundreds of years. </p><p></p><p>He was old!</p><p></p><p>He needed a successor to inherit the Qu family's legacy, to inherit the Jade Peak lineage.</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's legacy could not be passed down to those true disciples, right?</p><p></p><p>The peerless sword immortal slowed his pace, but!</p><p></p><p>As he slowed down, that arm suspended in mid-air did not hesitate to strike down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The immense force exploded on the ground, shattering Qu Yaozhou's head. Blood splattered everywhere, shattered bones burying into the earth, staining Gu Jiuqing red and white!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's headless corpse twitched twice, then fell completely still.</p><p></p><p>At the place where his head used to be, a huge pit appeared out of nowhere. </p><p></p><p>This was where the force of the dragon avatar struck!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing used his robe to wipe the blood off his fist, wiping it once, twice, three times. Only then did he put down his robe and look towards the Qu family's old patriarch walking down from the sword mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Gu Jiuqing pays respects to the Sword Sect Elder!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing showed a puzzled expression, gazing at the Qu family's old patriarch, "This disciple was fighting to the death with Qu Yaozhou earlier and did not have a lapse of attention. I do not know what the Elder said just now."</p><p></p><p>"Please do not blame this disciple."</p><p></p><p>Dead!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was dead!</p><p></p><p>His corpse lay at Gu Jiuqing's feet, his head shattered. The force of that punch had penetrated his entire body!</p><p></p><p>Don't just look at Qu Yaozhou's body being intact apart from his head. His insides were already riddled with holes, not a single bone was unbroken, his organs and viscera completely shattered into a mess.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know what methods the Qu family had, so he struck lethally!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou definitely had no chance of revival.</p><p></p><p>At the sword gate below and on the divine mountain, there was silence, the atmosphere rather strange.</p><p></p><p>That was the Sword Sect Elder trying to stop him, but Gu Jiuqing ignored it? Killing the Qu family's prodigy disciple right in front of the Qu family's old patriarch??</p><p></p><p>Many were secretly terrified, not daring to speak up.</p><p></p><p>Those youths in the flying carriages stood up in a panic, not daring to approach Gu Jiuqing. Even the four young masters retreated a few steps, distancing themselves from Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's old patriarch had finally appeared!</p><p></p><p>They thought this farce would end here, but never expected Gu Jiuqing to be so audacious, not even giving face to a sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu is in trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family will be in calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei sighed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's temper was too rash. This was just a competition, yet the Qu family's old patriarch had appeared. If he could give the old patriarch some face now, he might gain a fortuitous opportunity in the Sword Sect in the future.</p><p></p><p>Alas! Alas! Alas!</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed his meteoric rise and now his plunge into the deepest abyss. They had seen Gu Jiuqing's nine-day brilliance with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Completing five sheddings of mortality in nine days, condensing the power of two dragon avatars - he was a body refinement prodigy! In the upper echelons of the Sword Sect, apart from sword immortals, there were other experts too.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's rise from the ground was already a fact, but alas, he had killed Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>The four young masters stood not far away, silently watching Gu Jiuqing. They wanted to help but lacked the ability.</p><p></p><p>The sword immortal hovered in the void. </p><p></p><p>The Qu family's old patriarch stopped in mid-air, the sword immortal's aura gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Outside the divine mountain, those sword disciples flying through the void sensed something.</p><p></p><p>They all pressed down on the large iron swords on their backs!</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum hum——————" </p><p></p><p>"Hum hum hum————————"</p><p></p><p>Swords!</p><p></p><p>Humming on their own!</p><p></p><p>The humming shook the blood energy of the sword disciples, but they did not let go, firmly pressing down their swords.</p><p></p><p>The sword hums grew louder until the Qu family's old patriarch spoke, and this strange phenomenon finally dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Scion of the Gu family, you have not joined the mountain yet, how can you call yourself a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Do not be confused about your status!"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family elder's voice was calm, as if the previous events had not occurred.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Gate, the territory of my Sword Sect. My Sword Sect guards the Sword Gate to prevent demonic beasts from the wilderness from entering and threatening the commoners."</p><p></p><p>"You killed someone from my sect, violating our rules, no different from a demon."</p><p></p><p>The Qu family elder's voice grew increasingly intense, "Where are the law enforcement disciples of the Sword Sect? Why have they not thrown this evil demon into the Demon Suppressing Pagoda?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect fell silent, disciples looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>They had never experienced such an absurd situation and were at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The law enforcement disciples still had not flown out from the sect.</p><p></p><p>One breath of time!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths!</p><p></p><p>Three breaths!</p><p></p><p>At the fourth breath, the Qu family elder's aura suddenly erupted violently, sweeping through the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I am a sword immortal of the Jade Peak lineage. Are you all disobeying my words now?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Sect shook as six law enforcement disciples flew out towards the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Three breaths of time was the consideration period for the Sword Sect's higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>A body refinement prodigy was a treasure, but the Qu family elder was also right - rules were rules, and the Sword Sect's rules could not be violated.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity for this sword genius."</p><p></p><p>They could only sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Hum————————"</p><p></p><p>A strand of sword hum resounded through the sky, followed by another strand of sword intent rippling out, shaking the Sword Sect. Even the six law enforcement disciples were stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this sword intent come from?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be coming from the Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>"A new sword intent has appeared? Such an intent has never manifested in the Sword Sect before, why would it appear at the Sword Gate?"</p><p></p><p>This strand of sword intent was extremely arrogant, as if wanting to sever the heavens and earth. It seemed to be the Heaven-Severing Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>Gazes turned towards Gu Jiuqing, following the source of the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>That Heaven-Severing Sword Intent was indeed emanating from Gu Jiuqing's body!</p><p></p><p>Requesting contribution points, rewards, monthly tickets, reading subscriptions, and reviews.</p><p></p><p>Requesting all kinds of data!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Mud Bead Palace had a Dao fruit that could suppress and temporarily absorb the cultivation and insights of the people of the Blue Star. Gu Jiuqing could place the insights and cultivation of the Blue Star people onto the Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>This also solved Gu Jiuqing's concern about his power increasing too quickly. </p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Force born from the Dragon Elephant Skill was an exclusive benefit for cultivators practicing this skill.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had obtained too much Dragon Elephant Force.</p><p></p><p>Just having the Dragon Elephant Force of these five hundred dragon elephants would be enough to crush a young sage who had shed mortal form nine times.</p><p></p><p>"Now only the insights into the Unsheathing Sword Technique remain."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed his eyes and perceived the Dao fruit within the Mud Bead Palace. </p><p></p><p>Scenes of the Sword Dao continuously emerged.</p><p></p><p>The insights of countless people who cultivated the Unsheathing Sword Technique condensed into form, with each spiritual sword becoming the intent to slice the heavens, mutually verifying each other!</p><p></p><p>There were far too many of these spiritual swords, a full seventy million of them!</p><p></p><p>That meant seventy million people had cultivated the Unsheathing Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>The seventy million spiritual swords mutually verified each other. Every moment, spiritual swords were severed and absorbed by other swords, but in the next instant, new spiritual swords would be born.</p><p></p><p>Those were the new insights of people cultivating the Unsheathing Sword Technique by the river, captured and condensed within the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Among these scenes, there were seven thousand that were particularly clear - the sword Daos comprehended by seven thousand cultivators of the Unsheathing Sword Technique, the most quintessential!</p><p></p><p>Some had even comprehended sword forces!</p><p></p><p>The insights into the Unsheathing Sword Technique encompassed everything, merging together into a golden divine sword.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing touched the Dao fruit, grasping the true essence of the Unsheathing Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>This was another true essence of the Unsheathing Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing touched the second true essence of the Unsheathing Sword Technique, he comprehended entirely new insights into the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>The most direct manifestation was the sword intent!</p><p></p><p>A strand of sword intent took shape in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Three portions of sword intent rose up, coiling around his fingers like silken threads, like rootless water.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing comprehended the true essence of the Unsheathing Sword Technique, the heaven-slicing sword intent in his hands continuously strengthened.</p><p></p><p>The heaven-slicing intent grew richer and richer. The sword intent soared, instantly reaching the level of four portions of sword intent!</p><p></p><p>"For sword cultivators, the elevation of sword intent is what divides their true strength."</p><p></p><p>"After being cultivated by tens of millions along the river, the heaven-slicing sword intent had long since advanced to the upper-rank sword intent."</p><p></p><p>The first time Gu Jiuqing condensed the heaven-slicing sword intent, it was already an upper-rank intent.</p><p></p><p>And as more and more people cultivated the Unsheathing Sword Technique, the grade of the heaven-slicing sword intent continued rising!</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao fruit, the insights into the Unsheathing Sword Technique mutually verified each other, discarding the false and retaining the true.</p><p></p><p>Ancestral teachings are insufficient, the heavenly Dao is not to be feared.</p><p></p><p>Through this process of verification, the heaven-slicing sword intent became more and more complete. This Dao fruit could elevate the grade of the Sword Dao and techniques, perfecting the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only felt the sword intent in his palm growing richer and richer, breaking through four portions and directly entering five portions of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Half-step Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"I've become a half-step Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>In the sword schools, a full Sword Immortal was one who had comprehended one complete strand of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending five portions of a sword intent was considered a half-step Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In the true transmissions of the sword schools, even those elite disciples who cultivated the Sword Dao for hundreds or even thousands of years were mostly stuck at the half-step Sword Immortal level!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had cultivated the Sword Dao for less than a month and had already become a half-step Sword Immortal. If this cultivation speed was spread, it would undoubtedly cement his status as the paramount figure of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>"And there's still my heaven-slicing sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could sense the richness of the sword intent in his palm. Perhaps after some more time, the heaven-slicing sword intent would elevate another grade.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the upper-rank sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know what level that would be, but it seemed it would shake the sword schools and allow him to obtain more resources.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent in his palm continued slowly elevating. The brilliant heaven-slicing sword intent flowed through his five fingers, graceful like water, gentle like a spring breeze. Gu Jiuqing extended his hand, and the five portions of sword intent in his palm instantly soared, transforming into a spiritual sword.</p><p></p><p>"This spiritual sword represents all my insights into the Unsheathing Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Once the sword intent was damaged, Gu Jiuqing's sword cultivation would plummet.</p><p></p><p>Hence the existence of sword pills!</p><p></p><p>Refining the sword pill with one's essence, nourishing the sword pill with one's life force.</p><p></p><p>Using the hard materials of precious swords to protect the sword intent - this was the origin of the flying sword technique.</p><p></p><p>The insights of seventy million people of the Blue Star had been absorbed by Gu Jiuqing alone.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent in his hands had also elevated to the peak of five portions, just a hairbreadth away from six portions of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The soaring sword intent dissipated the translucent spiritual sword.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed, "Finally, I've refined all the cultivation and insights accumulated in the Dao fruit."</p><p></p><p>This elevation in his strength allowed Gu Jiuqing to stand at new heights.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred strands of Dragon Elephant Force, three innate celestial phenomena, the half-step Sword Immortal realm of five portions of sword intent, having shed the mortal form ten times!</p><p></p><p>Yet currently Gu Jiuqing was only at the Form Shedding realm, having not even cultivated true energy.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, when I said I was the number one in the Form Shedding realm, I may have been a bit immature."</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing declared out loud...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He is undoubtedly the first person to transcend the mortal realm throughout history, and no one would object to that.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master."  </p><p></p><p>"We've arrived at the Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The butler Xie straightened the reins.</p><p></p><p>It only took two days to travel from the ancient city of Tianyuan to the Sword Gate, but this time, butler Xie drove the flying carriage for three days before finally arriving at the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>During these past few days, strange noises and visions would occasionally emanate from inside the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>Butler Xie was worried the carriage might explode on the way, so he drove very carefully.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately!</p><p></p><p>They finally arrived safely at the Sword Gate.  </p><p></p><p>Outside the gate was a desolate wilderness scene, an endless sense of bleakness arose. Inside the gate stood a divine mountain piercing the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped at the foot of Sword Mountain.</p><p></p><p>A young man stepped out of the carriage, and butler Xie was about to support him.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I have already become a cultivator. Old Xie doesn't need to treat me like a helpless young master anymore."</p><p></p><p>The old butler withdrew his hand and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Just a habit. In the past, this old servant always supported the young master when going out. Now that the young master has become a cultivator, this old one hasn't quite gotten used to it yet."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked up at the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>The vast divine mountain stood before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The divine mountain pierced the clouds, its upper part shrouded in mist, with rays of divine light emanating from deep within the Sword Gate. There were profound cultivators practicing divine arts inside.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of sword aura also tore through the clouds, shooting into the starry sky!</p><p></p><p>Such a magnificent sight was truly enchanting.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xie, let's part ways here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to butler Xie.</p><p></p><p>Xie nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then, under Xie's watchful gaze, Gu Jiuqing stepped into the entrance of the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had only taken a few steps towards the Sword Gate when an illusory heavenly gate manifested above his head.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly gate wavered, its illusory image rippling. This time, the gate only appeared three zhang (about 10 meters) high.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing entered, a divine light descended from the heavenly gate above.</p><p></p><p>The sword talisman in his palm radiated brilliance, interacting with the divine light of the heavenly gate. In the next moment, Gu Jiuqing passed through the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>He stood at the foot of Sword Mountain, gazing up at it from afar.</p><p></p><p>A path to heaven unfolded before him. If he were to climb this path to the top of the divine mountain, to reach the Mingtingfeng peak, it would take at least six to seven hours of walking!</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in his brow, and a sword furnace manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Swhoosh——————"</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Sword Gate, at the peak of the divine mountain, a ray of divine light suddenly descended upon one of the mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>The divine light connected heaven and earth, forming a divine bridge that landed right in front of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"This is the guiding path that only true disciples are allowed to use!"</p><p></p><p>"A true disciple has returned to the Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>Figures began appearing from Sword Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the outer courtyard and inner courtyard, where the most people resided, they curiously looked towards the mountain's base. They saw a figure in azure robes, treading upon the divine bridge. Under their watchful gazes, he ascended upwards.</p><p></p><p>He quickly traversed halfway across the divine mountain, surpassing the residences of the outer and inner disciples.</p><p></p><p>In one of the inner courtyards, four newly promoted inner disciples each held a copy of the Sword Gate Rules.</p><p></p><p>Newly promoted inner disciples had to take a small test, not on their cultivation, but on their mastery of the rules.</p><p></p><p>Whether from a prestigious clan, a noble family, or an ordinary household, all had to be examined.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Ye Fei, Fan Shaoli and the others had been memorizing the Sword Gate Rules day and night, and today was no exception.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I really envy those true disciples."</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei sighed.</p><p></p><p>"True disciples reside in the nine great peaks or on the true disciple islands. Even the enforcement disciples cannot govern them."</p><p></p><p>"They even have their own dedicated guiding paths when ascending or descending the mountain."</p><p></p><p>He looked outside the courtyard, where a stream of light flowed between heaven and earth, a figure ascending along it.</p><p></p><p>It was truly enviable.</p><p></p><p>"Don't complain. There aren't many rules in the Sword Gate Rules, but the test questions are quite difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste the spirit stones I spent to buy these past exam questions."</p><p></p><p>There were only a little over a hundred rules in the Sword Gate Rules.</p><p></p><p>But the test questions changed every year. This set of past questions was bought by Xia Qingzhou at the cost of two spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The two young masters from prestigious clans, Fan Shaoli and Qing Yangbai, lowered their heads without looking outside.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, continue."</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Fei was about to continue studying the questions, he suddenly felt doubtful and rubbed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why did this true disciple seem a bit similar to Brother Gu?</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei shook his head. "Brother Gu should be cultivating at Mingtingfeng peak right now."</p><p></p><p>He made a note of the direction this divine bridge led to the mountain peak, then withdrew his gaze and continued memorizing the questions.</p><p></p><p>Keep voting everyone, I can take it!</p><p></p><p>Don't stop!</p><p></p><p>Don't stop! </p><p></p><p>Don't stop!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The desolate Sword Gate pass. </p><p></p><p>The divine mountain pierced straight into the clouds, sword aura forming clouds that encircled the sacred mountain. Looking up, the heavens and earth were divided, cleaving yin and yang. There were three sword furnace caves penetrating the universe, suppressing the northern lands of the great wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped down from the horse-drawn carriage. Last night he dreamed of returning to the Azure Star to teach students the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Afterwards, he surfed the internet for half a day, learning about many affairs on the Azure Star. </p><p></p><p>This morning he woke up very early.</p><p></p><p>The great examination lasted nine days, and today was the third day. Gu Jiuqing only had six days left!</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat anxious! </p><p></p><p>If he could not complete a shedding of the mortal realm within these six days, the Sword Gate would be hopeless.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you have finally awoken," the old butler said, unable to hold back as he saw Gu Jiuqing step down from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"The youths from the thirteen cities of the northern lands have already begun cultivating under the steles. Young master seems to be the last to awaken in this great examination."</p><p></p><p>The old butler's surname was Xie, and he had followed Gu Jiuqing's father.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing's father died exploring an ancient ruin, the Gu family declined. Only the old butler remained in the Gu household.  </p><p></p><p>Additionally, since Gu Jiuqing's sister did well in business and had some cultivation talent, Gu Jiuqing could study literature, music, chess, calligraphy and painting at home.</p><p></p><p>"The young masters Qu Yaozhou of the Qu family, Lu Wuye of the Lu family, and a few others from the Ancient Heaven City have come looking for the young master."</p><p></p><p>"They wanted to exchange insights on the Dragon and Elephant Skill with the young master."</p><p></p><p>"Seeing that the young master had not yet awoken, they have all left."</p><p></p><p>The butler pointed to a place some distance from the stele, where two dozen youths from Ancient Heaven City stood together, practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"Let them be," said Qu Yaozhou, who had obtained a manual of the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. They did not need to observe the stele with the other examination candidates and did not wish to practice together with the rest.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Yaozhou to take the lead among the Ancient Heaven City youths, who all deferred to him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not care about this matter.</p><p></p><p>On the third day of the great examination, Gu Jiuqing already had arrangements. He casually found an open space and practiced the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing performed all twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, his qi and blood rising, clouds of mist and colorful vapors enveloping his body. The remaining effects of the spirit pill he consumed yesterday were also fully activated.</p><p></p><p>After performing the set several times in succession, Gu Jiuqing finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Drenched in sweat, his whole body had become somewhat bloated. The qi and blood within surged powerfully as impurities were expelled, but he was still far from completing the first shedding of the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>"Practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill eight times a day is already my limit, and that's with the effects of the spirit pill. Tomorrow, I can practice at most seven times, perhaps only six!"</p><p></p><p>It was the same on the fifth, sixth and seventh days.</p><p></p><p>To be admitted into the Sword Gate, one needed the qualifications to complete a shedding of the mortal realm within fifty performances of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>This was far more difficult than becoming a martial artist at eighteen on the Azure Star. Though Gu Jiuqing's blood carried the heritage of the Gu family, and his father had been a powerful Celestial Body realm expert, there remained no small difficulty in performing the Dragon and Elephant Skill fifty times within seven days to achieve shedding.</p><p></p><p>On the evening of the third day of the great examination, a cry of astonishment rang out from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Qu Yaozhou of Ancient Heaven City has completed a shedding of the mortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>It was the other youths from Ancient Heaven City who cried out in shock. Many turned to look towards that distant space.</p><p></p><p>They only saw a figure standing calmly in the dim light, its silhouette blending with the night, emanating faint rays of divine light!</p><p></p><p>The shedding transformation had begun!</p><p></p><p>From head to toe, and toe to head, the primordial energies washed away impurities, refining the essence. Qi burst through the Hundred Meetings acupoint atop the head, transforming into a wisp of smoke that then returned to the body, completing the first shedding.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's slender frame now carried a transcendent air.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Young Master Qu on completing the first shedding," Lu Wuye hurriedly said in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qu is truly talented. With six days remaining in the nine-day great examination, Young Master Qu may even complete a second shedding!"</p><p></p><p>To achieve two sheddings within nine days would allow one to stand out in the annual Sword Gate examination. Completing three sheddings would directly admit one into the inner sect!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou let out a big laugh. Becoming an outer sect disciple of the Sword Gate was not his pursuit!</p><p></p><p>He aimed to join the inner sect!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Ancient Heaven City youths showered him with praise, the only exception being the young master of the Gu household.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Qu Yaozhou's face vanished. He had been dissatisfied with Gu Jiuqing for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But considering Gu Jiuqing's sister, he had refrained from pressuring him.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had completed a shedding, joining the Sword Gate was a certainty. This time, he would properly discipline Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The lofty Gu family?</p><p></p><p>Among the great clans of Ancient Heaven City, the Qu family took precedence. If he, Qu Yaozhou, desired something from the Gu family, how dare they not provide?</p><p></p><p>Just as Qu Yaozhou was about to seek out Gu Jiuqing, a ray of light pierced through the night's haze.</p><p></p><p>A chill shot through his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou stood motionless, as did the other city youths. They only felt the cold light at their backs, an abyss at their feet!</p><p></p><p>A great dread suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>This heart-pounding feeling came and went abruptly, the only remnant being that beam of light illuminating below the Sword Gate pass.</p><p></p><p>A lamp no bigger than a bean flickered in the dim world, a point of radiance transmitted from afar.</p><p></p><p>Nine out of ten participants in the Sword Gate examination had gathered under the three steles. A portion who considered themselves talents or had already completed a shedding instead came to a test sword stone.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Gate examination, completing one shedding allowed entry into the outer sect, while three sheddings permitted joining the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>But if one could comprehend a strand of sword intent from the test sword stone, one could receive the true teachings of the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has comprehended sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>Sword light flashed brilliantly, cold rays erupting as a youth stood before the test sword stone.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding youths retreated dozens of steps, not daring to stand alongside him.</p><p></p><p>This youth had his eyes closed, hands clasped behind his back. He wore a black longcoat with three or four crimson rose patterns, and crystal shoes.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate pass shook, the divine mountain trembled, sword aura rippling through the heavens as countless illusory figures coalesced beyond the world to gaze upon this youth.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace flew up, transmitting sounds one after another.</p><p></p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed youth responded, "Si Wuxie!" </p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing firmly committed this name to memory. This was the first time he had encountered a true prodigy.</p><p></p><p>He was a prodigy from the Great Wilderness. Within three days, he comprehended the sword intent, and his piercing sword intent swept through the entire Sword Gate. All the youths who came here to seek discipleship sensed this chill!</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to become a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie bowed towards the sword furnace, then a sword aura descended, enveloping Si Wuxie's figure as he entered the Sword Gate and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie!</p><p></p><p>Noticed by a high-level member of the Sword Gate, directly accepted as a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>Within nine days, comprehending the sword intent, truly able to obtain true transmission from the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>After this event, the youths below the Sword Gate cultivated even more diligently.</p><p></p><p>And this name Si Wuxie was also firmly imprinted in the hearts of the youths of this realm.</p><p></p><p>This would become an insurmountable mountain for them.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed!</p><p></p><p>He had not yet completed a single Shedding of Mortality, while this Great Wilderness prodigy Si Wuxie directly became a true disciple of the Sword Gate, even comprehending the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The gap between him and a true prodigy was far, far too great.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can complete a Shedding of Mortality within nine days."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing heavily returned to the flying carriage, he still had to go to the Azure Star of Dreams to observe those students' comprehensions to aid his own Shedding of Mortality.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Gu, please stay."</p><p></p><p>A voice fell at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A youth stopped Gu Jiuqing, it was none other than Lu Buye!</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Jiuqing with a smile, "Why is Young Master Gu so aloof? Just like your sister, both from the younger generation of the Ancient Heavenly Abyss City, why not join us?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be you're hiding something?"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the expressions of the other young masters from the ancient city changed.</p><p></p><p>They all thought their talents were not lacking, yet they failed to complete a Shedding of Mortality.</p><p></p><p>They all thought the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill that Gu Jiuqing drew were incomplete!</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, explain this clearly. Did you really conceal parts of the Dragon and Elephant Skill?"</p><p></p><p>"I also find it strange. We twenty-five people came from the Ancient Heavenly Abyss City to the Sword Gate together. Why is it that after drawing it, only you, Gu Jiuqing, went off alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be you really did tamper with the Dragon and Elephant Skill?"</p><p></p><p>Voices of accusation arose one after another.</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye had already stood by Qu Yaozhou's side, revealing a hint of a fawning expression.</p><p></p><p>A fawning youth must have already awakened his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Qu family had an elder who joined the Sword Gate as a senior elder. If he could latch onto Qu Yaozhou and join the Sword Gate, with that elder's protection, he could soar with ease.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's expression was indifferent!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the surrounding youths fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's face was awkward!</p><p></p><p>He could clearly understand now that all of this was Qu Yaozhou's doing.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, it seems you have misunderstood Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>"We may not have known Gu Jiuqing for long, but surely you all know of that Fairy Sister of the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Fairy Sister!</p><p></p><p>Also known as the Fairy of the Jasper Pool!</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong was Gu Jiuqing's sister, but her name was far less renowned than the Fairy of the Jasper Pool.</p><p></p><p>In the thirteen cities of the northern lands, there were four fairies, holy maidens and divine maidens. Later, one more was added - this additional one was the Gu family's Linglong.</p><p></p><p>Jiuqing meant the ninth heavenly realm, alluding to the Celestial Court!</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that in ancient times, the Celestial Court had a Jasper Pool, with fairies singing and dancing within. Thus, Gu Linglong gained the title of Fairy of the Jasper Pool.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Fairy of the Jasper Pool was just a joking term used to mock the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>But after the Gu family's young lady, Gu Linglong, emerged, she directly shook the Ancient Heavenly Abyss City, and the name Fairy of the Jasper Pool resounded through the thirteen northern cities, matching the other four divine maidens.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Jiuqing's sister was praised as a fairy, Gu Jiuqing's handsomeness was naturally astonishing as well.</p><p></p><p>This was also a reason why many young masters looked down on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"After this great examination, I ask that Jiuqing introduce me to your sister."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou smiled at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were distinctly black and white, having undergone a Shedding of Mortality. His bearing had changed greatly, exuding a noble air befitting a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"My elder sister is a merchant, rarely home, so I cannot make such an introduction."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's face became even more awkward!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was threatening him.</p><p></p><p>If he did not comply, the matter of the Dragon and Elephant Skill would be fabricated!</p><p></p><p>How could a youth have encountered such a situation? Anger was already rising uncontrollably in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to introduce her? That is quite troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's expression turned cold. He wanted to use Gu Jiuqing's sister to provoke him.</p><p></p><p>Among the young masters from the Ancient Heavenly Abyss City of the northern lands, only Gu Jiuqing dared to defy him!</p><p></p><p>He had even defied Qu Yaozhou's orders multiple times.</p><p></p><p>For example, yesterday when he held the painting album to guide the cultivation of the young masters from the Ancient City, only Gu Jiuqing did not come!</p><p></p><p>If he could not subdue Gu Jiuqing, it would be difficult for him to command the others in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Lu, I also find some reason in what you said earlier. We are all from prestigious clans, descendants of the Immortal Emperor. Young Master Qu has completed a Shedding of Mortality, so you young masters should also undergo a Shedding. Perhaps it is Gu Jiuqing who tampered with the depiction of the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?!!</p><p></p><p>No one wanted to admit their talents were lacking. They were all youths, and their ancestors had all forged the path of the Immortal Emperor, passing down their bloodlines. Who was stronger than who?</p><p></p><p>The young masters from the ancient city surrounded Gu Jiuqing, wanting him to give them an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's face alternated between white and red, angered to the point of trembling hands. An imperceptible, inaudible and invisible energy gathered in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>This strand of energy quickly spread through his entire body. A scorching heat flowed out, and his blood and qi churned like a smelting furnace!</p><p></p><p>"Shedding of Mortality transformation!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was aghast!</p><p></p><p>How did this brat complete his first Shedding of Mortality at this moment?</p><p></p><p>Sign in to receive a fully-comprehended sword intent, a great perfected sacred body. Initially, people thought it was just a joke, but three years later when the spiritual qi was restored, those who signed in directly became deities!!</p><p></p><p>It was only then that they realized the distribution of cheat abilities had already begun three years prior!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

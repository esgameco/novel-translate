        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Not Old Peak!</p><p></p><p>The spring water tinkled.</p><p></p><p>Every strand of spring water was crystal clear, flowing between the mountains, able to reflect the beautiful scenery amid the mountains. </p><p></p><p>On the moon there were rarely any trees or plants, but on this main peak, there were spiritual plants and grasses everywhere, with ancient trees soaring to eight hundred zhang high!</p><p></p><p>Forming an expanse of primordial ancient forest. </p><p></p><p>This scene made one feel awe.</p><p></p><p>The two threaded through the ancient forest. From deep within the ancient forest, occasionally sounds would transmit over, those were living beings inhabiting the ancient forest.</p><p></p><p>"But this is on the moon, besides us, could there really be other living beings?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan exclaimed in astonishment!</p><p></p><p>The foremost venerable elder of the first mountain ridge of the Eight Formations Ridge had died. </p><p></p><p>Only then did the disciples of the Constellations Pavilion and Sword Gate dare to set foot here!</p><p></p><p>But this second mountain ridge, those with insight could discern that this was the place where a venerable elder from the Primordial Era sat in meditation until death.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare trespass?</p><p></p><p>Within the Sword Gate, starting from the outer door disciples, besides cultivation, they needed to study the scriptures.</p><p></p><p>The inner door disciples had to also master the arts of zither, chess, calligraphy and painting.</p><p></p><p>Every Sword Gate disciple, if placed in the great Zhou dynasty, would at least be a scholar. If they loved learning, passing the imperial examinations would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>This was the daily routine of the disciples of the four great sects. Lu Yuan was not like Gu Jiuqing who ascended in a single step. When he was an inner door disciple, he studied all kinds of scriptures and ancient books, knowing many widely known legends.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic era eight thousand years ago was also called the Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who joined the Sword Gate for a year or two would know about this.</p><p></p><p>So those moving beings could not possibly be disciples of the Sword Gate or Constellations Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Could they be wandering immortal cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan shuddered!</p><p></p><p>If that was truly the case, their lives would be in peril.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, "It's impossible to be immortal cultivators. The sounds coming from deep within the ancient forest were sometimes hurried, sometimes quiet. Those immortal cultivators would have no need to be so restless!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing slightly furrowed his brows, the spiritual energy within his body coalesced together, forming a spirit pill!</p><p></p><p>The various origins on Buzhou Mountain, including the two thousand two hundred dragon and elephant beasts, had all been stirred!</p><p></p><p>Mouthfuls of thousand-grooved divine weapons surged with spiritual energy, activating the divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The two passed by ancient tree after ancient tree, with various wondrous fragrances wafting over. They dared not be distracted, vigilantly watching their left, right, front, back, above and below.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Jiuqing and the others had walked to the main peak. After going a bit further, they would be able to see the Not Old Spring on Not Old Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Swish——"</p><p></p><p>From a large tree, leaves fell down one after another. Some of the fallen leaves landed on the clear spring flowing between the mountains, while others fell onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>But before they even hit the ground, they transformed into wisps of spiritual energy, merging into the void of the mountain ridge.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual leaves of spiritual plants could not last long.</p><p></p><p>"There's something in the tree!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at this ancient tree. Amid the dense branches, a rabbit the size of a palm was staring right at them!</p><p></p><p>The rabbit was snow white, with red eyes. Its body brimmed with spiritual energy that merged with the moonlight, which was why they hadn't discovered it earlier.</p><p></p><p>"It's a moon rabbit!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing blurted out.</p><p></p><p>There were moon rabbits on the moon - they were spiritual beasts, celestial spirits. Taking the moonlight as their foundation, they condensed into the form of moon rabbits. Every moon rabbit was a celestial spirit!!</p><p></p><p>Their lifespans were practically endless. Without needing to cultivate, they were comparable to pure yang paragons who had crossed the nine thunderclap tribulations.</p><p></p><p>The moon rabbit flickered and hid back into the forest. Sounds transmitted over from even further away.</p><p></p><p>The earlier noises had been made by the moon rabbit.</p><p></p><p>"The Not Old Spring connects through Not Old Peak. On this mountain peak, even celestial spirits like the moon rabbit can manifest!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual essence of the Not Old Spring was too dense!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan set their minds at ease and continued walking.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, the two arrived at the summit of Not Old Peak.</p><p></p><p>A vast expanse of spring water!</p><p></p><p>Reflected on the mountaintop, it was crystal clear. The moonlight rippled across it, causing various visions to appear on the spring water's surface.</p><p></p><p>A naturally formed Dao rhyme emerged that could lead to the great yin Dao!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan inwardly sighed. He cultivated the sun divine body, unless he switched to cultivating the yin divine body, this innate Dao rhyme had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the innate Dao rhyme!</p><p></p><p>The Dao rhyme formed naturally, then dissipated on its own. The formation of each Dao rhyme was different. If one could comprehend even a bit of it, their cultivation would soar.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing did not linger. He stepped forward and arrived before the Not Old Spring.</p><p></p><p>He did not care whether the Not Old Spring held any dangers. His spiritual energy flowed out, forming a large arm that directly plunged into the Not Old Spring.</p><p></p><p>The spring water rippled, disrupting the innate Dao rhyme. But no matter how long he searched within the Not Old Spring, he could not find the eight divine weapons that Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao had said he planted there.</p><p></p><p>"It's not here?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked around blankly. Could it be that besides this Not Old Spring on the Eight Formations Ridge, there was another Not Old Spring?</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that the divine weapons Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao planted under the Not Old Spring had been taken away by someone?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan circled around, his gaze gradually becoming horrified. He pointed at the surface of the Not Old Spring, where a blurry figure was gradually condensing into physical form!!</p><p></p><p>The spring water surface was sinking down.</p><p></p><p>This spring, not even two meters wide, as the blurry figure appeared, the spring water grew less and less, as if being absorbed by this blurry figure.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths of time, the spring water revealed the bottom, and the figure solidified into form.</p><p></p><p>It was a humanoid figure!!</p><p></p><p>It sat within the Not Old Spring. Under the Not Old Spring was only a thin layer of spring water left. Within this entire Not Old Spring, besides this humanoid living being that had condensed into form, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>"A humanoid! A living being!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's hair stood on end. The divine sword in his hand surged as he was so startled that he immediately summoned the sword on the spot. Seeing Gu Jiuqing motionless beside him, he hurriedly moved in front to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Not Old Peak!</p><p></p><p>The spring water flowing down from this mountain peak flowed in reverse, flying up to the summit and pouring into the humanoid living being.</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient texts, I found many mentions about the Not Old Spring," Gu Jiuqing's voice rang out calmly.</p><p></p><p>"It is said the Not Old Spring contains spiritual essence. There are tales of people who drank from the Not Old Spring and had their cultivation explosively increase, with their fleshly body, spiritual energy, and even divine soul all strengthening. Even more bizarre is that they could randomly comprehend various divine abilities and insights."</p><p></p><p>"Just now when I saw the innate Dao rhyme on the surface of the Not Old Spring, I had an inkling of this."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid living being did not move, still facing away from Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at this figure and exclaimed in amazement, "Who could have imagined the Not Old Spring was actually formed from a senior cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Not Old Spring was formed by this humanoid living being?</p><p></p><p>How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>There was not the slightest connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Gu Jiuqing's words, the humanoid living being's figure suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>A piercing sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Kaka kaka————"</p><p></p><p>"Kaka kaka————————"  </p><p></p><p>The humanoid living being swayed, absorbing all the Not Old Spring water on Not Old Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Old man..."</p><p></p><p>His voice sounded very strange, as if he hadn't spoken for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Just now I was quite disappointed. Old man thought someone had mistakenly wandered into Not Old Peak."</p><p></p><p>The ancient voice lingered melodiously.</p><p></p><p>He was admitting to Gu Jiuqing's deduction!</p><p></p><p>An Eight Formations Elder!</p><p></p><p>It was this person.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was astonished.</p><p></p><p>So Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao had planted the eight divine weapons within this Eight Formations Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Not Old Spring was formed by the Eight Formations Elder.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing guessed that the Eight Formations Elder had been invaded by demonic energy. He fused together his spiritual energy, divine soul, fleshly body, and all his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Forming a pool of spring water!</p><p></p><p>This pool of spring water contained the Eight Formations Elder's entire cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The ancient texts recorded that anyone who drank from the Not Old Spring was actually plundering the Eight Formations Elder's cultivation and gaining his divine abilities!!</p><p></p><p>Then why didn't Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao inform him of this beforehand?</p><p></p><p>"But when you condensed your spiritual energy, old man was even more disappointed."</p><p></p><p>Disappointed!</p><p></p><p>He was so disappointed.</p><p></p><p>How many years had he waited??</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years??  </p><p></p><p>Six hundred years??</p><p></p><p>Or eight hundred years?</p><p></p><p>He only remembered that on Not Old Peak, he had cycled through reincarnation nine thousand times!!</p><p></p><p>His "body" flowed down from the mountaintop of Not Old Peak, then flowed back up from the mountain ridge to the summit.</p><p></p><p>After waiting all those years, the one who came was not him!!</p><p></p><p>The living being's disappointment actually triggered a celestial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>The celestial phenomenon's range was not large, just enough to envelop Not Old Peak.</p><p></p><p>A chilling wind howled. A cold aura assailed them. The spiritual plants on the mountain instantly withered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Tree after ancient tree transformed from lush green to rotten wood. The green leaves dulled and rapidly disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>Rays of light also fled from Not Old Peak in succession.</p><p></p><p>Those were the moon rabbits!!</p><p></p><p>Several moon rabbit celestial spirits escaped from Not Old Peak, fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of disappointment lingered, this ambiance permeating the fleshly body down to the soul.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly summoned his spiritual energy to cleanse his body, dispelling the disappointment ambiance.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why did the one who came not turn out to be him, but you instead!"</p><p></p><p>The "him" the living being spoke of should be referring to Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Since Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao did not come, this peerless elder from the Primordial Era felt such disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the living being and respectfully bowed from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother instructed me to come to the Not Old Spring to retrieve the eight divine weapons he planted here long ago!"</p><p></p><p>The living being moved!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his entire body completely took form, transforming from the illusory into the real and tangible.</p><p></p><p>He slowly turned around.</p><p></p><p>A living being without any facial features stood in the position of the Not Old Spring.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, he did not put it that way when he took away my face."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>A great terror swept over!</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's figure was suppressed to less than three feet by this great terror!</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Jiuqing's figure was affected, with various divine weapons wavering inside his body, and the Buzhou Mountain emitting an ominous aura. </p><p></p><p>The dragon and elephant primordial essences, the golden crow primordial essence, and the yin-yang divine body's kunpeng primordial essence emitted brilliant divine lights.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt that even his thoughts had frozen.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianqiao had stayed on the moon for ten years back then, and those ten years were spent in the Baxiangling!</p><p></p><p>Did Senior Brother deceive and take away the skin mask of the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor??</p><p></p><p>Promising that he would come to the moon for an appointment later?</p><p></p><p>Why did Senior Brother need to deceive and take the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor's skin mask?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the current Senior Brother is not the original Senior Brother?</p><p></p><p>Is the current Senior Brother Lianqiao existing with the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor's skin mask?</p><p></p><p>All sorts of doubts arose one by one, but they all vanished under this great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You're just a cultivator who has cultivated some divine powers, yet you can withstand my pressure?"</p><p></p><p>This!</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a sliver of his pressure, it was still not something a cultivator at the Realms of Divine Powers could withstand.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan was suppressed to a size of three feet, barely able to stand, and his body was still shrinking!</p><p></p><p>On his faceless face, a blank, but Gu Jiuqing could sense that the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor was looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I miscalculated!"</p><p></p><p>"It was I who miscalculated!"</p><p></p><p>"I thought that even if Junior Jiang didn't value my inheritance, he wouldn't just let anyone inherit it!"</p><p></p><p>Inheritance?</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure dispersed, the great terror dissipated, and the faceless old man walked step-by-step towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"After discussing the Dao with Junior Jiang for ten years, I almost thought that no one valued my lifelong cultivation."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, about to place it on Gu Jiuqing, but he forcibly stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>He "looked at Gu Jiuqing"!</p><p></p><p>The blank face without features was quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also felt a bit flustered, "May I ask what inheritance the senior was referring to earlier?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor let out a hearty laugh.</p><p></p><p>"It was probably eight or nine hundred years ago? I've forgotten."</p><p></p><p>During that period, a Moon Chaser accidentally entered the Baxiangling.</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years ago, Senior Brother Lianqiao measured the celestial heights and ascended all the way to the moon.</p><p></p><p>He accidentally entered the Baxiangling, but was not suppressed by the Deathless Old Man. Instead, he amazed the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor with his own talents.</p><p></p><p>The two of them discussed the Dao throughout the night for as long as ten years!</p><p></p><p>"Junior Jiang's talents made me feel ashamed. Back then, he had only cultivated to the Nine Heavenly Palaces, yet he dared to ascend to the moon."</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years ago?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianqiao had already cultivated to the Nine Heavenly Palaces?</p><p></p><p>This doesn't seem right. Although Senior Brother Lianqiao had never explicitly stated his cultivation time, if he had already cultivated to the Nine Heavenly Palaces nine hundred years ago!</p><p></p><p>Why is he still at the Nine Heavenly Palaces now?</p><p></p><p>The faceless old man seemed to notice Gu Jiuqing's doubts and spoke again.</p><p></p><p>In his voice was his admiration for Senior Brother Lianqiao!</p><p></p><p>Yes, a Venerable Ancestor from the Primordial Era admired Senior Brother Lianqiao!</p><p></p><p>What a remarkable person he must be!</p><p></p><p>"I discussed the Dao with Junior Jiang for ten years, never imagining that anyone could possess such talents."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the deep pits on the mountain ridge and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Those deep pits were caused by just a single drop of our blood."</p><p></p><p>A single drop of blood!</p><p></p><p>Capable of creating a huge pit in the Baxiangling.</p><p></p><p>If that drop of blood fell on the mountains of the Primordial Realm, it would be enough to flatten an entire mountain range!!</p><p></p><p>Luyuan, who had regained his true form, gaped in astonishment at those deep pits.</p><p></p><p>"Blood and qi are the foundations of the physical body. Junior Jiang let me refine a physical body to carry his Dao, his Primordial Spirit? Divine powers? Supernatural abilities could all be discarded, only the physical body needed to endure."</p><p></p><p>"With a physical body and blood and qi, one could still wield extraordinary powers."</p><p></p><p>This solved the trouble of needing the Three Ones every time he was revived.</p><p></p><p>Now, he only had a physical body, without a Primordial Spirit or divine powers, greatly reducing the revival process.</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, the old man and Junior Jiang continued discussing the Dao."</p><p></p><p>After Senior Brother Lianqiao helped the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor improve his Deathless Physical Body, they continued their endless discussion of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The two entered the Buzhou Mountain of the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor and discussed while in the mountain. Eventually, they broke through Buzhou Mountain and entered the Mud Embryonic Palace to observe the Heavenly Palaces they had forged.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Senior Brother Lianqiao discovered the secret of the Heavenly Palaces.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Layered Heavenly Palaces housed the Three Souls and Six Spirits, with the Three Souls governing life and the Seven Spirits governing death.</p><p></p><p>If one could reopen the Three Souls and Seven Spirits, the Primordial Spirit would become even more powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Junior Jiang's physical body is perfect, with strands of spirituality contained in his bloodline, and his divine powers are also pure. By tempering with the yin-yang energies and the quintessences of the five elements, and now that he has reopened the Three Souls and Seven Spirits to reforge the Ten Layered Heavenly Palaces, who knows how high his Primordial Spirit has reached."</p><p></p><p>So that's it!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianqiao reopened his Heavenly Palaces.</p><p></p><p>This is certainly more powerful than just refining a Spirit Pill once and dropping it once, as opposed to dropping it multiple times.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made a note of the method of reopening the Primordial Spirit's Heavenly Palaces, as he would need to do the same when he reached the Heavenly Palace Realm in the future!</p><p></p><p>"But what does this have to do with Senior Brother deceiving the Venerable Ancestor and taking his skin mask, as well as the inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>The faceless old man's tone became solemn, "Of course it's related!"</p><p></p><p>"The old man is about to die. Even with the Deathless Physical Body suppressing the Deathless, I cannot last forever."</p><p></p><p>Deathless? Is that demonic qi?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor did not elaborate, and Gu Jiuqing did not dare ask further.</p><p></p><p>"He refined my physical body into eight divine weapons, which are the weapons buried beneath the Deathless Spring."</p><p></p><p>A precious pagoda appeared in the old man's palm!</p><p></p><p>This pagoda was adorned with countless decorations!!</p><p></p><p>At the top was a brilliant gemstone.</p><p></p><p>The pagoda body had four layers, each vastly different yet connected, like the four limbs of a human body, while the gemstone at the top resembled the head!</p><p></p><p>"This gemstone was refined from my head, and the four layers of the pagoda body were refined from my four limbs."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the base, "This was refined from my torso!"</p><p></p><p>"The true dragons and phoenixes coiling around the Yanluo Precious Pagoda were condensed from my divine abilities and powers!"</p><p></p><p>The eight divine weapons referred to the eight weapons refined from the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor's physical body.</p><p></p><p>This Yanluo Precious Pagoda was bizarre, but there was no need to doubt it - this pagoda was undoubtedly a supreme treasure!</p><p></p><p>Once consecrated, it would be equivalent to using the physical body of a nearly divine-level expert to fight!!</p><p></p><p>Unless Gu Jiuqing's physical body surpassed the Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor's, otherwise he would be unable to withstand the infusion of such immense cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what level of cultivation the Venerable Ancestor had reached back then?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Ones were complete, with my Primordial Spirit and divine powers both purified to the Yang polarity."</p><p></p><p>"However, when Junior Jiang refined the Yanluo Precious Pagoda, the old man had already lost most of his cultivation, but this pagoda should still be no less than the Ninth Tribulation Celestial Human."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Palace Realm of True Human, the Tribulation Realm of Celestial Human!</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>What a pity. If it was a physical body at the Three Ones level that created the Yanluo Precious Pagoda, Gu Jiuqing wouldn't need to continue searching for divine weapons to suppress his own body.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, you have the same expression as that madman back then."</p><p></p><p>Looks like he's being criticized again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that kid took my skin mask, renamed himself Lianqiao, calling himself the Celestial Heights Measurer, saying he would return to the Primordial Realm to understand his heart's desire before coming to the moon to inherit my legacy!"</p><p></p><p>After waiting all these years!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor truly thought that Senior Brother Lianqiao didn't value his inheritance, which is why he never came.</p><p></p><p>But a new doubt arose.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lianqiao did not change his appearance. When Senior Brother Lianqiao emerged from seclusion and replaced the Seal Imprint Daoist to accept Gu Jiuqing into the Mingting Peak lineage, those Sword Cultivators and Sword Immortals all recognized Senior Brother Lianqiao!</p><p></p><p>If Senior Brother Lianqiao had changed his appearance, he could not have become the true inheritor of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Immortals Venerable Ancestor tossed the Yanluo Precious Pagoda to Gu Jiuqing and said slowly,</p><p></p><p>"You are far inferior to Junior Jiang, but your physical body is still acceptable and can withstand more divine powers. Let the old man nurture you for fifty years, and perhaps you can walk the same path as Junior Jiang."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand again, wanting to thoroughly examine this person that Jiang Buyu had sent to the moon and into the Baxiangling to inherit his legacy, to assess his aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure moved, and a waterfall of sword qi burst forth from his Baihui acupoint.</p><p></p><p>The inverted waterfall, the tempered sword qi, the sharp sword intent, the intention to sever the heavens, to cut through all under heaven!!</p><p></p><p>A waterfall blocked this reaching hand.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent is not bad, it has already reached the upper grade."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, to cultivate a nine-grade sword intent at the Realms of Divine Powers, you are indeed a genius."</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's mouth gaped open.</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Nine-grade sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Not five-grade sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Luyuan was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>He had transmitted Senior Brother Gu's deeds to the Sword Sect, intentionally exaggerating his sword intent by two grades, so that Senior Brother Gu would strive to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect that Senior Brother Gu's sword cultivation had already reached the nine-grade level!!</p><p></p><p>This was four grades higher than the two grades he had exaggerated, leaving only one grade before Senior Brother Gu could become a Sword Immortal!!</p><p></p><p>The paramount of the sword path, the paramount of the sword path.</p><p></p><p>If Heaven did not create Senior Brother Gu, the sword path would be an eternal night for eternity.</p><p></p><p>"Do not resist. Although the old man's lifelong cultivation is all contained within the Yanluo Precious Pagoda, it is still not something you can withstand."</p><p></p><p>"Let the old man see your talents!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the waterfall before him and stretched out his hand again.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, are you willing to bear the burden of the old man's great Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The only response he received from Gu Jiuqing were two cold words:</p><p></p><p>"Unwilling!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

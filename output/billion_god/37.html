        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Refining the Body!</p><p></p><p>Refining the Qi! </p><p></p><p>Refining the Spirit!</p><p></p><p>Six words occupied the entire blackboard. </p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom looked bewildered, completely unaware of the true meaning contained within these six words.</p><p></p><p>Even Teacher Wen and the principal were dumbfounded. The five elders behind the classroom also looked at each other in a daze, not understanding the meaning behind Gu Jiuqing's six words.</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation begins with the steps below, and refining the body, refining the qi, and refining the spirit is the true essence of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>This was not something Gu Jiuqing had comprehended himself. With only having grasped the essences of the Dragon Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Art, he was still insufficient in seeing through the nature of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This came from the words of a talented scholar from the Zhouxi Academy of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Shedding mortality, leaking the heavenly secrets, the Unbounded Realm, the Spirit Refining Realm, the Heavenly Palace Realm, the Longevity Tribulation Realm - these were the realms of cultivation in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>But on the high martial planet of Lanxing, there were Body Refining Martial Followers, Flesh Refining Martial Cultivators, Bone Refining Patriarchs, Tendon Refining Great Patriarchs, Organ Refining Martial Kings, and Blood Exchanging Martial Sages!</p><p></p><p>The path of the martial artist was to solely cultivate the physical body. Through singular cultivation, they sought the Great Way. A Blood Exchanging Martial Sage could be titled and praised as a "human nuclear bomb," with strength far exceeding even cultivators who had refined spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>This did not exist at all in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>And that talented scholar from Zhouxi Academy, who proposed the singular secret realm of refining the body, qi, and spirit, once said that as long as one cultivated a singular secret realm to the extreme, one could also cultivate into a deity.</p><p></p><p>Refining the body to the extreme allows one to pluck the sun, moon, and stars with one's hands, and shatter myriad disciplines with a single force!</p><p></p><p>Refining the qi to the extreme, cultivating spiritual powers to the utmost, allows one discipline to shatter myriad disciplines!</p><p></p><p>Refining the spirit to the extreme, the primordial spirit influences reality, the spirit leaves the body and roams the vast cosmos, moving the nine heavens and ten earths, borrowing the might of the myriad things of heaven and earth to grasp the rules and order, also able to shatter myriad disciplines under heaven!</p><p></p><p>This talented scholar divided the path of cultivation into three small paths. Walking any one of them to the extreme would still lead to the apex.</p><p></p><p>And now, Gu Jiuqing was transmitting this method of singular secret realm cultivation to the people of Lanxing.</p><p></p><p>On the martial path, even cultivating to a Martial King was unable to give birth to spiritual powers. Even Blood Exchanging Martial Sages had no spiritual powers!</p><p></p><p>This was caused by the singular body cultivation of martial artists. Gu Jiuqing did not intend to destroy the characteristics of the high martial planet Lanxing.</p><p></p><p>"What I need most now is to shed mortality!"</p><p></p><p>The power in his body was too tremendous, and the physical body simply could not bear it!</p><p></p><p>And the method of singular secret realm cultivation on this planet was currently most suitable for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He wrote down large characters under the "Refining the Body" column on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>[The Twenty-Two Forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill!]</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's discuss refining the body!"</p><p></p><p>"Refining the body focuses solely on cultivating the physical body. But the human body ultimately has limits. After refining the skin, flesh, bones, tendons, organs, and exchanging the blood, the physical body reaches its pinnacle - this is the final path to becoming a Martial Sage with that title!"</p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom nodded.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Sage was the apex of the martial path!</p><p></p><p>After exchanging their blood, a Martial Sage had surpassed the human realm.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming a Martial Sage could one transcend the boundaries between nations.</p><p></p><p>"The Twenty-Two Forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill can allow you to cultivate into Martial Kings, completing all cultivation stages except for the blood exchange. For those with exceptional talents, borrowing the Twenty-Two Forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill can also help you cultivate to the blood exchange realm."</p><p></p><p>"But what comes after the blood exchange?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, what came after the blood exchange?</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years after the revival of spiritual qi, the first Martial Sage lived over two hundred years and was globally recognized as the strongest Martial Sage.</p><p></p><p>But he was also firmly stuck at the blood exchange realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wrote down the various martial realms on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>[Martial Follower, Martial Cultivator, Patriarch, Great Patriarch, Martial King, Martial Sage!]</p><p></p><p>Finally, after Martial Sage, he wrote down another realm.</p><p></p><p>[Earth Immortal!]</p><p></p><p>The first step in elevating the high martial planet Lanxing, continuing on to the immortal martial realms!</p><p></p><p>"Earth Immortal?"</p><p>"Earth Immortal?"</p><p>"Earth Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>The forty-five high school seniors in Class 2 all showed looks of confusion. Their martial cultivation was still very shallow. Completing the Body Refining cultivation by practicing the Dragon Elephant Skill to step into the Flesh Refining cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of Yang Miaojing or Ning Que, they were still some distance away from the Bone Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>But! Those few elders behind the classroom were all Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>They were first dazed, then revealed looks of horror.</p><p></p><p>"He wants to continue the path of the martial dao!"</p><p>"The realm above Martial Sage is Earth Immortal!"</p><p>"Today, the Earth Immortal realm is revealed. Someone must ascend and become the first Earth Immortal!"</p><p>"Good heavens, is this a public lesson? He's publicly continuing the path beyond the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>The five elders, after being stunned, were then filled with pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>They listened even more attentively to Gu Jiuqing's lecture.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The high martial planet Lanxing's singular body cultivation could eliminate the spiritual power realms of leaking the heavenly secrets!</p><p></p><p>At least for now, he could eliminate the spiritual power realms. In the future, Gu Jiuqing would transmit the leaking of heavenly secrets...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Dao allows martial artists to possess spiritual power as well. </p><p></p><p>He now wants to solve the problem of his physical body not being strong enough, so he can only rely on the high-level martial artists from Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>Therefore!</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortal realm needs to be revealed in advance.</p><p></p><p>"As I mentioned before, blood condensation is the current pinnacle of the martial path, and the last opportunity to excavate the potential of one's physical body. Once the limits of the physical body's potential are reached, the path of martial arts comes to an end."</p><p></p><p>"So there is this higher realm called the Earthly Immortal."  </p><p></p><p>"Above the Earthly Immortal is the True Immortal! Now I will explain in detail what the Earthly Immortal is."</p><p></p><p>"The Earthly Immortal is an integrated whole, the body enters the earth, the body becomes imperfect, like an imperfect mountain, rooted in heaven and earth. To step into the Earthly Immortal realm, one needs to cultivate to become imperfect, that is, to forge a divine body."</p><p></p><p>"After forging the divine body, one can begin Earthly Immortal cultivation, refining the 365 divine apertures throughout the body, drawing in the power of the nine heavens into the physical form!"</p><p></p><p>"Once the divine body is fully cultivated, with the three flowers gathered at the crown and the five qi returning to the origin, one becomes a True Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing treated the Imperfect Realm and Divine Body Realm as equivalent to the Immortal Martial Realm on Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>But this was only a vague analogy, as martial cultivation and cultivation in the Wilderness are different - one singularly cultivates in a secret realm, while the other follows the trinity cultivation path. Their relative strengths still need to be verified.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortal, the True Immortal - these are the last two cultivation realms of the martial path on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I will impart to you the method of forging the divine body!"</p><p></p><p>"This method is called the Yin-Yang Divine Body Forging Method. One gathers yin and yang energies to forge the physical body, changing one's physical constitution and drawing upon the power of heaven and earth to amplify oneself."</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Divine Body Forging Method!</p><p></p><p>"If one can cultivate the Yin-Yang Divine Body, in the later stages one can use the yin and yang energies to build one's foundation, transforming into a primordial deity formed from the yin and yang energies!"</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the divine body forging method, the foundation lies in the human spinal column, also called the Imperfect Mountain. By building the Imperfect Mountain and becoming one with heaven and earth, standing among rivers and mountains, one establishes a small universe, a small world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grew more and more excited as he spoke. He went to the back of the classroom, and the old men hurriedly stood up to make way for him.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a piece of chalk and wrote down the Yin-Yang Divine Body Forging Method on the blackboard behind them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the complete Yin-Yang Divine Body Forging Method was written out.</p><p></p><p>"This is the path of the Earthly Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The principal, Old Wen, Secretary Wen, Chairman Wu, and the security chief - </p><p></p><p>The five veteran Martial Kings sighed in awe. </p><p></p><p>They had never imagined they would witness the emergence of the Earthly Immortal realm. They were the first to know of the Earthly Immortal's existence.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not linger, continuing to write down a second divine body cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>[The Golden Crow Divine Body Forging Method!]</p><p></p><p>Yet another divine body forging method, similar to the Yin-Yang Divine Body Forging Method.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang method steals yin and yang energies, gathering the sun and moon, or condensing primal pure yin and pure yang energies to complement each other into balance.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Golden Crow method absorbs the sun's energy and radiance, taking in a single source, then visualizing the image of the Golden Crow to cultivate the Golden Crow Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>"Did you write it down?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The five old men were dazed.</p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom reacted, quickly taking out their phones to photograph the two cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing erased the words from the blackboard, then began writing down the method for refining divinity, the true Earthly Immortal cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>"The method to open the 365 divine apertures throughout the body!"</p><p></p><p>These methods for opening the divine apertures came from the Imperfect Realm and Divine Body Realm of the Qu Family. After integrating them, Gu Jiuqing obtained the method for opening 333 divine apertures.  </p><p></p><p>This was not bad.</p><p></p><p>It is said the human body has 365 divine apertures, corresponding to the cycles of heaven, but even the Northern Land aristocratic families' divine body cultivation methods could not perfectly align with this number.</p><p></p><p>To condense all 365 divine apertures, Gu Jiuqing still needed to obtain methods from the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wrote out the complete method for opening the 333 divine apertures, and the students quickly photographed it again.</p><p></p><p>"That's all for today's lesson. Next time I have a chance, I'll discuss refining qi and refining divinity further."</p><p></p><p>"Principal, all of you wait a moment. I still have something to discuss with you privately."</p><p></p><p>At the back of the classroom!</p><p></p><p>The five Martial Kings stood dazed.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortal realm had just been revealed?  </p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortal cultivation methods?</p><p></p><p>They had just emerged?</p><p></p><p>They had already begun contemplating how to cultivate divine bodies!</p><p></p><p>With their Martial King cultivation bases, forging divine bodies would allow them to rapidly condense their blood essence, essentially bypassing the Martial Saint realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperfect Mountain! So searching for the Imperfect Mountain was about continuing the path of martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>They sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>I hope this full translation is helpful!

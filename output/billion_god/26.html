        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>*Thump*!</p><p></p><p>The door to the principal's office was closed.</p><p></p><p>Old Wen, the principal and the others fell silent. </p><p></p><p>The idea that Gu Jiuqing had just proposed was too terrifying. The former elders were all shocked by Gu Jiuqing's idea.</p><p></p><p>It was the moon!</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the moon rising high in the sky outside the window, sinking into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, how many people have been curious about the moon?</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>No matter how daring they were, they only dared to create manned spacecraft rockets to send people to the moon, circle around it once, and then transport them back.</p><p></p><p>But this existence, seemingly divine, told them:</p><p></p><p>He is It!</p><p></p><p>To build an ancient teleportation formation on the moon to connect the blue planet and the moon.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wen, is this teleportation formation the kind we imagine? Just by standing in the formation, one can travel to another realm? Spanning countless heavens and lands?"</p><p></p><p>The principal had been stuck at the Wu Wang realm for too long.</p><p></p><p>Refining to become a Wu Sheng, exchanging blood to become a Wu Sheng, becoming a Wu Sheng was his lifelong hope. In recent days, he cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill, his blood energy broke through the peak, his muscles, bones, skin and membranes, his five viscera and six bowels were reborn - Wu Sheng was no longer a dream.</p><p></p><p>But it was nowhere near as shocking as building a teleportation formation on the moon!</p><p></p><p>"This matter is too immense, are you sure you want to complete it alone?"</p><p></p><p>Old Wen did not answer, but instead asked the principal.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang City will be sealed off for three months, cutting off contact with the outside world!</p><p></p><p>This time, the divine being wants to build a teleportation formation on the moon. Relying solely on Linjiang City alone, the difficulty is too great.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this lunar journey requires sending hundreds of people!</p><p></p><p>In front of Old Wen, the principal was like a child, but at this moment, this child looked up at Old Wen and enunciated word by word:</p><p></p><p>"Linjiang City must become the ancestral city of this era!"</p><p></p><p>He wants to leave an eternal legacy, he wants to become the trend-setter of this era, and even with the help of divine power, achieve immortality!!</p><p></p><p>"Then you should get to it quickly."</p><p></p><p>Old Wen did not try to stop them again.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang was his hometown. If Linjiang could become the ancestral city of this era, his reputation would far surpass that of any living elder.</p><p></p><p>At the school, in the conference room.</p><p></p><p>A number of tycoons were sitting in the conference room, waiting.</p><p></p><p>They were waiting for Gu Jiuqing, the business tycoons who had learned that Gu Jiuqing would come to the school this morning, and they had all driven to the school, also wanting to meet this divine existence.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing had already left the principal's office, and had even walked out of the school gates.</p><p></p><p>But the business tycoons in the conference room were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A text message appeared on their cell phones. The tycoons stared at this text message.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be about the company's affairs?"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun also picked up his phone.</p><p></p><p>The two factories of Huaren Technology were producing nutrient fluids full tilt, which had already been supplied to the entire city. At this critical juncture, there couldn't possibly be any problems!!</p><p></p><p>Then who could be sending him a message at this moment?</p><p></p><p>Didn't they see that he and the other tycoons were waiting for someone?</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun also looked at more and more people taking out their phones, his heart skipped a beat, he thought of something, and hurriedly opened his phone.</p><p></p><p>[From the latest intelligence of the Merchants' Association, that divine being wants to build an ancient teleportation formation on the moon. The ancestral city of Linjiang needs to build a manned rocket. Received the message, come to the Merchants' Association immediately]</p><p></p><p>There were more than a dozen tycoons from the Merchants' Association waiting in the conference room. This was their private activity.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to show their faces in front of the divine being, but the appearance of this message interrupted their plan.</p><p></p><p>"A teleportation formation? It must be a divine being, only deities can set up such a terrifying thing."</p><p></p><p>"A teleportation formation, isn't that just a small wormhole? If a teleportation formation is set up on the moon, in the future when we go to the moon, we only need to step onto the formation and we can instantly reach the moon!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine being, why do you want to build a teleportation formation on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Merchants' Association quickly, the chairman is already waiting."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The tycoons stood up and pushed open the door of the conference room.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The conference room door had just been opened when someone rushed into the room. The bodyguards outside did not expect that someone would barge into the conference room at this moment!</p><p></p><p>"Hua Yunye! Where are you?" </p><p></p><p>A crisp voice rang out in the conference room, as a female teacher wearing a sleeveless top and wide-leg pants burst in, searching for Hua Yunye.</p><p></p><p>All eyes instantly turned towards Hua Yunye.</p><p></p><p>An elderly man showed a displeased expression, "Little Hua, you should quickly resolve this matter. The business association's affairs cannot be delayed."</p><p></p><p>Where did this crazy woman come from? </p><p></p><p>Such rashness?</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye broke out in a cold sweat. The influential figure who just spoke came from the Zheng Group, one of the three major groups in Linji. A few years ago, this influential figure even served as the chairman of the Linji Business Association.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zheng, please rest assured, I will handle this immediately."</p><p></p><p>The people in the conference room quickly dispersed, leaving only Hua Yunye and Bai Muqian standing together.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian was Hua Yunye's new romantic interest and the one he fancied the most.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian, a teacher at Linji High School, was a peak Refining Flesh martial artist. Bai Muqian's physical vigor had grown even stronger recently!</p><p></p><p>She had stepped into the realm of Refining Bone Master during this period.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye looked at Bai Muqian with a complicated gaze.</p><p></p><p>The latter also sensed something amiss. "Just say it, why have you been avoiding me these days? Do you have someone else?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"No? Then what is your relationship with Wen Daihua?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian really did not expect that Wen Daihua would pursue a high school student.</p><p></p><p>That day, she went to the Tiandao Practice Room, but her card had been frozen.</p><p></p><p>And the gravity room that Bai Muqian had been using was already occupied!</p><p></p><p>She waited until late at night before finally seeing the person emerge.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua!</p><p></p><p>A martial artist from Linji, a high school student about to enter university.</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, Hua Yunye dared to make a move on her?</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye now understood that Bai Muqian had misunderstood, but he did not explain.</p><p></p><p>"Then what is your relationship with Gu Zixiu?"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye asked this question with trepidation!</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu!</p><p></p><p>That was the true name of a divine being.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he did not care about the rumors between Bai Muqian and Gu Zixiu.</p><p></p><p>But in this period, who dared to disrespect Gu Zixiu?</p><p></p><p>Let alone steal his romantic interest.</p><p></p><p>If those Martial Kings found out, he would surely die a tragic death at home tomorrow!</p><p></p><p>"I've already explained it to you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian said impatiently, "Initially, I wanted to apply to a university in the imperial capital, but I wasn't accepted by any schools there. At that time, I had a chance encounter with Gu Zixiu. After half a year, Gu Zixiu unexpectedly came to Linji."</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye looked at Bai Muqian without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu! His public identity was the eldest son of the Gu Family, one of the eight great families in the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>How could Hua Yunye not know Bai Muqian's character?</p><p></p><p>The only reason Bai Muqian was interested in him was because of his status!</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu's background far surpassed his by ten or a hundred times! He didn't believe Bai Muqian had never been tempted!</p><p></p><p>"Hua Yunye, do you not believe anything I say now?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian regained her composure.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's leave it at that. I'm very busy these days, don't bother me."</p><p></p><p>Women will only hinder my future!</p><p></p><p>Hua Yunye turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Watching Hua Yunye's departing figure, Bai Muqian did not cry or make a scene. Instead, she quietly gazed at his retreating back.</p><p></p><p>She felt that the recent events were not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Something major was happening in Linji, but like many others, she did not know the true major incident occurring in Linji.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have a feeling that if I continue like this, I'll miss something."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian did not know what she was saying, but she knew she needed to make some changes.</p><p></p><p>The changes in Linji were too rapid. If Bai Muqian wanted to rise with the winds of change, she could not afford to lose Hua Yunye!</p><p></p><p>"Ta-ta—"</p><p></p><p>Footsteps sounded in the conference room as the last person left.</p><p></p><p>First update, begging for support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

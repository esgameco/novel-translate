        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The butler Xie was dressed strangely, carrying a huge sword case on his back that resembled a door panel. </p><p></p><p>He looked around at the divine temple, his eyes full of surprise. </p><p></p><p>"Young master, you have truly risen to prominence with remarkable ease."</p><p></p><p>The solitary island, as well as this massive Heavenly Sword Palace, could not help but highlight Gu Jiuqing's identity.</p><p></p><p>How things have changed from the past!  </p><p></p><p>How things have truly changed!</p><p></p><p>Butler Xie could hardly imagine that Gu Jiuqing, who had initially come to participate in the Sword Sect's great examination by riding a flying horse-drawn carriage, had now become such an influential figure.</p><p></p><p>Butler Xie stared at the divine temple, his mouth slightly agape. After a while, he still hadn't uttered a word.</p><p></p><p>After another moment, Butler Xie finally sat down on the ground and untied the door panel-like object from his back, placing it on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The black cloth fell away, revealing the true appearance of the door panel.</p><p></p><p>It was a coffin!</p><p></p><p>A large black coffin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked puzzled, wondering if Butler Xie had come to the Sword Sect just to deliver this black coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, this is the coffin sent by the young lady. According to her, this coffin seems to be a divine weapon. Once the coffin is consecrated, it can bestow unimaginable and majestic power."</p><p></p><p>Butler Xie then took out a letter from his pocket and handed it to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Butler Xie stood aside.</p><p></p><p>This was a letter from Gu Linglong, and two months had passed since the last one.</p><p></p><p>[Little brother, have you received the coffin that your sister sent? This coffin is a cultivation treasure. Although you are cultivating in the Sword Sect, you still need a divine weapon to protect yourself.]</p><p></p><p>[I bought this divine weapon at a high price. It has been preliminarily refined. All you need to do is infuse it with your spiritual power and ignite the seal with your essence blood, and it will refine itself. However, this coffin has a flaw. When using it, you need to shout the three words 'Great Heavenly Venerable' to unlock the Dao traces within.]</p><p></p><p>Great Heavenly Venerable?</p><p></p><p>The Black Coffin!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, how could Gu Jiuqing not understand Gu Linglong's intention?</p><p></p><p>He finally understood!</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Gu Linglong had been so arrogant in the Great Zhou Dynasty, doing one unimaginable thing after another in the name of the Great Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Paving the way!</p><p></p><p>She was paving the way for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Great Heavenly Venerable, or Gu Linglong, first portrayed herself as a scholar outside the Immortal Sovereign's ancient tomb, then clashed with the Celestial Maiden and fought against the Prince of Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>She established the identity of an extraordinary genius, and then, in the guise of a scholar, drew the immortal seals within the Immortal Sovereign's tomb, allowing others to decipher them.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some playful acts by Gu Linglong during the process, such as suppressing the patriarchs of various clans under the pressure of the tomb's immortal seals and painting that scene.</p><p></p><p>She spread a painting depicting the Great Heavenly Venerable suppressing the patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly increased the Great Heavenly Venerable's popularity.</p><p></p><p>One thing led to another, interconnected, and now the Great Heavenly Venerable in the Great Zhou Dynasty was undoubtedly a young, handsome talent with a decent reputation, portrayed as a positive figure.</p><p></p><p>And all of this!</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Linglong's way of helping Gu Jiuqing pave the way and shape the Great Heavenly Venerable's image as a scholar.</p><p></p><p>And now, this black coffin, the signature divine weapon of the Great Heavenly Venerable, had also fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing wasn't the Great Heavenly Venerable before, he would have to become him now.</p><p></p><p>"Butler Xie, have my calligraphy and paintings been sent to my elder sister?"</p><p></p><p>Butler Xie was taken aback. "Yes, some time ago, the young lady sent a letter to this old servant, asking for some of the young master's calligraphy and paintings. This old servant took the liberty of sending out some of them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing let out a wry smile upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>His calligraphy and paintings had a distinctive style, easily recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Those great scholars who were his disciples in the Great Zhou Dynasty had probably already assumed he was the Great Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing read the letter again, revealing a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>His sister had arranged everything clearly for him, even solidifying his identity.</p><p></p><p>[By the way, the matter with Chu Xiangyu that your sister mentioned before has encountered some issues. Your sister is looking for someone else for you. She has heard that the Princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty is quite suitable, and your sister is already in contact with her. At most, within ten days, your sister will invite this princess to the Sword Sect to find you.]</p><p></p><p>[Have you been neglecting your cultivation recently? Have you made progress with the Three Zhang Golden Body technique? Do you have enough spirit stones? If not, tell Butler Xie, and I will send some spirit stones that are stored in the manor. While cultivating in the Sword Sect, do not compare yourself to others or get involved with the people there. Stay in the Sword Sect for the time being. In a year or two, your sister will come to the Sword Sect and take you away.]</p><p></p><p>The letter was concise, without excessive sentiments. Gu Jiuqing quickly finished reading it.</p><p></p><p>Since returning from the moon, Gu Jiuqing had also learned about the Primordial Moon Tree from Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Demon Prince had flown out of the moon riding a branch of the Primordial Moon Tree, and this branch belonged to the First Demon Heavenly Monarch.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Demon Heavenly Monarch was the daughter of the First Demon Heavenly Monarch, named Chu Xiangyu!</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong had intended to find a Heavenly Monarch as a Dao companion for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, for some reason, this matter fell through.</p><p></p><p>This relieved Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"But which princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty is she referring to?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was worried that Gu Linglong might seek out Princess Chengxiao, who had just been appointed as the Martial General of Guarding the Nation and possessed formidable abilities.</p><p></p><p>At most, Gu Linglong was at the peak of the Spirit Refinement Realm or had just entered the Heavenly Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>She would be no match for Princess Chengxiao, who lived hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched out his arm and took the black coffin into his hands.</p><p></p><p>The patterns on the coffin were jet-black, appearing as if ants were crawling and forming mysterious patterns.</p><p></p><p>"This coffin has been consecrated by someone, and these Dao traces are quite profound, with only three thousand of them!"</p><p></p><p>Three thousand Dao traces, not a single one more.</p><p></p><p>And the material used for this coffin was also quite special!</p><p></p><p>"This coffin should only be an ordinary coffin, but the material used is special. Someone used a secret method to condense Dao traces onto the coffin, turning it into a great treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing curiously opened the coffin lid!</p><p></p><p>As he pushed open the lid, the interior of the coffin was fully revealed.</p><p></p><p>It was completely empty!</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Jiuqing knew this would be the case, he still felt a tinge of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>The empty coffin.</p><p></p><p>"No, there is actually something on the coffin!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the coffin, and under his gaze, a trace of blood came into view.</p><p></p><p>On the jet-black coffin, a streak of blood had turned blackish-red, stained on it who knows how many years ago, now long dried and devoid of spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and touched this streak of blood.</p><p></p><p>As his fingers made contact, a burning sensation instantly assailed him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing quickly withdrew his hand!</p><p></p><p>His fingertips were mangled, with the bones clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at this streak of blood, a streak that had dried up who knows how many years ago, devoid of spiritual essence, yet still so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Then what kind of being was buried in this coffin?</p><p></p><p>"A three-in-one supreme expert? Or a... deity!"</p><p></p><p>A three-in-one expert at the Deity Realm, like his master, the Daoist Cultivator Cunyin.</p><p></p><p>This Daoist's single drop of blood was powerful, but not more so than the Seventh Golden Body Transformation of the great sacrificer Banshannuo.</p><p></p><p>But this single drop of blood was definitely more powerful than Banshannuo's.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years? Several thousand years? Or a drop of blood from tens of thousands of years ago?"</p><p></p><p>If it was a drop of blood from tens of thousands of years ago, then it must have belonged to a deity.</p><p></p><p>"Where did my elder sister get this black coffin? It seems to be a coffin that buried a deity. This coffin first appeared in the Immortal Sovereign's ancient tomb. Could it be the coffin of the Immortal Sovereign himself?"</p><p></p><p>And was the Immortal Sovereign a deity?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was frightened by his own deduction.</p><p></p><p>How did Gu Linglong obtain the Immortal Sovereign's coffin?</p><p></p><p>When Gu Linglong acquired the Immortal Sovereign's coffin, the Immortal Sovereign's tomb had not yet been opened!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed the coffin lid again and dripped his essence blood onto it.</p><p></p><p>The coffin immediately reacted!</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer of seals intertwined and formed. Seizing this opportunity, his spiritual power surged, imprinting his unique spiritual aura onto the seals.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Gu Jiuqing had finished consecrating this great treasure.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his spiritual power, the black coffin was stored by Gu Jiuqing on Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Divine Sword, the Black Coffin, and the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda were all divine weapons of the great treasure level.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda and the Black Coffin have not suppressed Mount Buzhou yet. It seems I can find an opportunity to absorb the cultivation and insights of the Blue Star people!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his thoughts. He personally walked out of the Heavenly Sword Palace and saw Butler Xie off after leaving the Sword Sect, then returned to the Divine Power Cultivation Room.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not immediately absorb the cultivation of the Blue Star people. He was waiting for the Grain God Star from the moon to be refined into a divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>This was a palace of the Sword Sect, where the Supreme Elder was in seclusion and did not come out. The various Sword Immortals would discuss matters and then convey them through the Sword Palace to the various mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Palace was silent and still, with each Sword Immortal descending in person. None of the Sword Immortals dared to manifest a spiritual clone in the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortals from the Azure Jade Lineage, the Nine Yangs Lineage, the Lotus Lineage, and the Barbaric Lineage – all nine lineages of the Sword Sect were present here. Each Sword Immortal's figure condensed, their vast sword intent dividing the void and forming their own sword domains.</p><p></p><p>From these sword domains, one could discern the strength and weaknesses of the Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators who had just become Sword Immortals could only maintain their sword domain around their bodies, manifesting as sword qi for practice.</p><p></p><p>Elder Sword Immortals who had cultivated to the second stage of sword intent could extend their sword domain outward, occupying a corner of the void in the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Those who had cultivated to the third stage of sword intent were mostly the peak lords of the nine lineages.</p><p></p><p>There were only around ten such Sword Immortals in the Sword Palace, far fewer than the number of elder Sword Immortals and ordinary Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortals who had cultivated to the fourth stage of sword intent or above had sword intent cascading around them like a waterfall. Among the Sword Immortals, they were considered supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>And there were only two such figures in the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>One was the Supreme Elder Cunyin Daoist of the Nameless Peak, and the other was the Third Elder of the Sword Tomb, also known as the Three Words Daoist.</p><p></p><p>These two Sword Sages had descended in their true forms, so naturally, the other Sword Immortals dared not be negligent.</p><p></p><p>The main gate of the Sword Palace was constantly opening, with Sword Immortals entering one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, a hundred sword immortals gathered within the Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>"This time I've summoned everyone here, it's because there is an important matter to discuss."</p><p></p><p>The voice of Daoist Cunyin resonated throughout the Sword Palace. Currently, his status was the most venerable, and his strength was also the strongest, so the other sword immortals could only listen.  </p><p></p><p>"The first matter is the demon lair of the Great Wilderness Demonic Lineage!"</p><p></p><p>The higher ranks of the Sword Sect had already known about the death of the Demonic Crown Prince. They had dispatched sword immortals deep into the Great Wilderness to investigate, and the information obtained was that the Demonic Crown Prince had indeed perished!!</p><p></p><p>This matter shook the Great Wilderness no less than if a sword cultivator of the Sword Sect had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin continued, "Apart from the Demonic Emperor, the rest of the demons from the demonic lair are not formidable. A few venerables taking action would be enough to completely suppress that demonic lineage's lair. However, the old master has informed me that the number one Demon Celestial and the Demonic Emperor are colluding together, and they even gave birth to an offspring - that human-demon hybrid is the current seventh Demon Celestial."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Palace shook, and every sword immortal revealed a look of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Some sword immortals who knew about this matter in advance didn't show much reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elder, is this true?" A senior sword immortal couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. The seventh Celestial Chu Xiangyu was roaming in Great Zhou, and her true form was seen through by several Pure Yang Ancient Immortals, but they didn't take any action to avoid stirring up trouble."</p><p></p><p>An offspring between humans and demons??</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, this was considered an absolute taboo.</p><p></p><p>Whoever dared to violate it would be judged as equally guilty as the demons!</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Rankings issued by the Xuanxuan Academy in Zhouxi list the number one Demon Celestial at the fifth rank. This Celestial is extremely powerful, so even Great Zhou doesn't dare to act recklessly against her."  </p><p></p><p>The number one Celestial!</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert at the Realm of Communicating with Divinity, whose strength surpassed even the Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>With such a dominating figure, who would dare to make a move against her daughter?</p><p></p><p>Add to that the Demonic Emperor, who was the emperor of the demonic race, Chu Xiangyu's status was even more terrifying than the Zhou Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>"However, the old master has already discussed this matter with the Dao Sect, Buddhist Sect, and the Constellations Pavilion. They plan to send their disciples to Great Zhou to slay demons and eliminate evil spirits."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin's voice was calm, and upon hearing this, the other sword immortals nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this matter was just to inform them.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin and the other three major sects had already reached a consensus, so this matter was settled.</p><p></p><p>"The second matter is the upcoming great competition between the four major sects, as well as the true transmission trial of our Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the sword immortals changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The great competition between the four major sects!</p><p></p><p>That was the true focus.</p><p></p><p>The first place winner of the four sects' great competition could observe any supreme scripture from any of the four sects!!</p><p></p><p>As for the date of the four sects' great competition, it would be determined by the Ancestral Patriarch of the Dao Sect. Whenever he said it would be, that's when it would happen.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Patriarch of the Dao Sect has finally agreed to let his disciples descend the mountain!" Daoist Cunyin sighed, this was to help the Dao Sect's disciple rise to prominence, using the four major sects' competition.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, every generation's Dao Sect disciple was treated this way!</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Dao Sect, those disciples were all peerless prodigies. In the four sects' competitions, they always took the first place without exception!!</p><p></p><p>Five thousand years ago, that generation's disciple took first place in the four sects' great competition and was able to observe the Buddhist Sect's Past Sumeru Sutra. Later, he was bestowed the title of Expounding Heaven Venerable by the Dao Sect!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand six hundred years ago, that generation's disciple again took first place, observing the Sword Sect's Supreme Sword Classic, and was later bestowed the title of Severing Heaven Venerable by the Dao Sect!</p><p></p><p>One thousand six hundred years ago, that generation's disciple again took first place, observing the Constellations Pavilion's Future Astral Sutra, and was bestowed the title of Supreme Heaven Venerable!</p><p></p><p>These three Dao Sect disciples became the three Heaven Venerables of the Dao Sect, with strength second only to the Ancestral Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Ancestral Patriarch's fourth disciple was about to walk the world, which was why the four sects' great competition was being opened.</p><p></p><p>This was an unfair treatment. Over the span of five thousand years, the four sects had produced many prodigies, but none from the same era could match those three Dao Sect disciples!</p><p></p><p>For example, the Sword Sect's Supreme Venerable joined the sect three thousand years ago, in a different era from the Severing Heaven and Expounding Heaven Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Supreme Venerable would have been able to suppress those two Dao Sect Heaven Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior nodded slightly and uttered three words, then said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm hmm hmm!"</p><p></p><p>This sword sage, wrapped in a black robe, his sword intent cascading like a waterfall around his body.</p><p></p><p>The other sword immortals quickly turned their heads, not daring to look at the Third Senior.</p><p></p><p>"This time, my Sword Sect's sword cultivator has left closed-door meditation and descended from the sect."</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivator had already descended the mountain?</p><p></p><p>The other immortals were shaken by this news.</p><p></p><p>After the Traversing the Months journey and mourning period, there had been no news about the sword cultivator. It turned out he had already descended the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"As for the four sects' great competition, the primary task is to subdue the Demonic Maiden. If anyone can subdue the seventh Demon Celestial, they will be the first place winner of this four sects' great competition!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin's tone was somewhat solemn. Demonic women must be killed on sight!</p><p></p><p>This had nothing to do with morality, only the divide between races.</p><p></p><p>Humans and demons could not coexist.</p><p></p><p>The number one Demon Celestial was human, but she actually dared to give birth to an offspring with a demon. The other five Celestials were all hunting her down!!</p><p></p><p>Only a few experts at the Realm of Communicating with Divinity knew about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"So the true transmission trial of our sect can also take place in Great Zhou. That Demonic Maiden's cultivation is not high, probably just the peak of the Spirit Refinement Realm or the initial Celestial Realm. The other true transmission disciples of our Sword Sect also have a chance to subdue her!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin's words made these sword immortals delighted.  </p><p></p><p>So they could take action too?</p><p></p><p>The rules of the four sects' great competition stated that as long as it wasn't an elder-level expert acting, disciples from the four sects were allowed to participate!</p><p></p><p>But some of the sword immortals here were not yet at the elder level of their sect. So could they take action?</p><p></p><p>This definition was quite vague and depended on the individual.</p><p></p><p>Usually the four sects would set a limit, but this time Daoist Cunyin did not mention it.</p><p></p><p>Did that mean the older generation experts at the peak of the Celestial Realm or even the Tribulation Realm could take action without it being considered overstepping?</p><p></p><p>But if that was the case!</p><p></p><p>Then this matter was worth pondering!</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Patriarch of the Dao Sect opened the four sects' great competition to help his disciple rise to prominence.</p><p></p><p>If this revered disciple couldn't outshine those Tribulation Realm experts, wouldn't he become a laughingstock??</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of Lotus Peak spoke directly, "Does the Ancestral Patriarch have full confidence in this current disciple? He didn't set any restrictions."</p><p></p><p>In previous four sects' great competitions, cultivators over 200 years of age were prohibited from participating, as were those who had reached the Tribulation Realm within the last 200 years.  </p><p></p><p>The former were considered too old to be part of the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter, it was to prevent people from exploiting loopholes in the rules and using secret or evil techniques to forcefully increase their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, so the old master plans to have the sword cultivator descend the mountain after requesting that old master's other disciple also descends."</p><p></p><p>The Mingting Peak lineage!</p><p></p><p>Apart from Gu Jiuqing, there was another peerless prodigy, Jiang Buyu, or Jiang Buyu! Also known as the current Liangxiao!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this name, the sword immortals fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu!</p><p></p><p>He was the sword cultivator of the previous generation!</p><p></p><p>After the Supreme Venerable crippled his cultivation, he started cultivating again from the beginning. Now, they had no idea what Jiang Buyu's current strength was.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was certain!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu was extremely powerful. Traversing the Great Wilderness was like strolling through a garden for him. He could even singlehandedly subdue Tribulation Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>Unless that Dao Sect disciple had crossed a Tribulation, he would not be Jiang Buyu's match.</p><p></p><p>This generation's sword cultivator was very accomplished, but in the eyes of these sword immortals, his accomplishments had long been overshadowed by Jiang Buyu.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the sword immortals voiced their agreement.</p><p></p><p>Over the past five thousand years, in the three previous four sects' great competitions, the Dao Sect had always taken first place, leaving the other three sects gasping for air!</p><p></p><p>The strength of those three Dao Sect disciples was even more outrageous. They had long since crossed numerous Tribulations and became Pure Yang Ancient Immortals.</p><p></p><p>This was all because they had gathered the quintessence of the other three sects onto a single person. By accumulating hundreds of years' worth of the four sects' quintessence into one person, allowing them to cross nine Tribulations and cultivate to the Pure Yang Ancient Immortal realm, it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Xuanxuan Academy in Zhouxi of Great Zhou was imitating the four sects' great competition by unveiling the Dragon and Tiger Rankings!</p><p></p><p>Once Great Zhou learned of this matter, they would also join the four sects' great competition with the goal of subduing the Demonic Maiden!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, whoever took first place in the four sects' competition would also be ranked first on the Dragon and Tiger Rankings!</p><p></p><p>By then, this first place winner could possibly cultivate the Three Realms Unified!</p><p></p><p>A great era!</p><p></p><p>Was descending!</p><p></p><p>This great era was personally crafted by the four sects and Great Zhou, used to create a supreme expert of the Three Realms Unified at the Realm of Communicating with Divinity.</p><p></p><p>"So, all peak lords and venerables, you should pass on this matter to the disciples of your respective peaks and have our Sword Sect's disciples descend the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the sword immortals left the Sword Palace, and soon only two sword sages remained.</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior, why haven't you left yet?"</p><p>"Are you trying to show off?"</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior nodded, "Yes yes yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, has your disciple descended the mountain yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Not yet."</p><p></p><p>"If Si Wuxie doesn't descend, who knows what his talents are."</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Look at my two disciples, one is participating in the four sects' great competition, and the other is joining the true transmission trial. This time, first place will likely fall to my Mingting Peak lineage."</p><p></p><p>Anxious!</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior was anxious, so anxious he couldn't speak. The terrifying sword intent was about to emanate from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I know you're anxious, but don't be in such a hurry. Why don't you go persuade Si Wuxie to descend the mountain too?"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior was speechless again.</p><p></p><p>Have him persuade Si Wuxie to descend the mountain?</p><p></p><p>How should he persuade him?</p><p></p><p>With words?</p><p></p><p>He currently couldn't speak, as all his spirit, power, divine abilities and sword intent were concentrated within his body. Speaking was the most difficult thing for him right now.</p><p></p><p>A sword immortal from the Third Senior's lineage, the Sword Immortal Wu Yong, returned to the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Junior Brother Wuxie has descended the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie had descended the mountain?</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin was stunned.</p><p></p><p>And the Third Senior laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior closed his mouth and strode out of the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>I beg for bookmarks and monthly votes. It's still the double vote period, so please vote!</p><p></p><p>I've transitioned a bit, and will soon enter the main storyline!</p><p></p><p>I beg for your support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

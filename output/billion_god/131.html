            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient relic, the burial place of one of the ten greatest celestial lords in the heavenly realm - the Immortal Lord of Longevity. </p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Jiuqing stepped inside, he sensed countless auras scattered around the void.</p><p></p><p>Those were the auras left behind by people who had entered the Great Tomb of the Immortal Lord of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>There were too many of these auras, each belonging to a cultivator at the Unbounded Realm or even the Celestial Realm. Many auras were feeble, clearly indicating their owners had been killed.</p><p></p><p>Corpses lay strewn on the ground, the yellow mud overturned, debris everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The Black Feather Army of the Great Zhou Dynasty also had many who had perished in the tomb, their ominous aura seeping out from the remains and rippling through the void.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's brows furrowed tightly. He had not expected the scene inside the Immortal Lord's tomb to be so horrific.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, many ancient patriarchs of great clans, Catastrophe Realm celestials, and even a few Demon Sovereigns from the evil paths are said to be vying for the Immortal Lord's treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan walked over to a corpse - the white bones of a celestial.</p><p></p><p>A celestial at the Longevity Realm, with a divine body nurtured to perfection in the Unbounded Mountain, spiritual roots thoroughly comprehended, and celestial state complete.</p><p></p><p>But on these remains, there was not a single celestial treasure, only bones that emanated a celestial aura.</p><p></p><p>Five sword auras hung on the white bones.</p><p></p><p>"It's Senior Brother Liang Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>That technique!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was all too familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>It was Senior Brother Liang Xiao who had killed this celestial.</p><p></p><p>But why would Liang Xiao slay a celestial in the Immortal Lord's tomb?</p><p></p><p>"It's a celestial from the Buddhist realm!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Eight Trigrams Patriarch came from Lu Yuan's Earth Pouch.</p><p></p><p>"The Flower Treasure Holy Monk, who claimed to be the reincarnation of the Buddha, taking the Sumeru Sutra as the supreme Buddhist scripture, the method of the Buddha's descent across the Three Realms, the Three-Zhang Golden Body method, and the Bodhisattva Heard Records as the unsurpassed Buddhist classics."</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one, you have never battled the Monk in Hempen Robes or fought the Three-Zhang Golden Body of the Guangping Bodhisattva, so you did not notice the peculiarity of this physical body."</p><p></p><p>The Three-Zhang Golden Body method?</p><p></p><p>His sister had passed down the Three-Zhang Golden Body method long ago, even Luo Shen had cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>And he had also transmitted this method to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>But he had yet to absorb the Blue Star people's comprehension and insights into the Three-Zhang Golden Body method.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch continued:</p><p></p><p>"This kind of Golden Body method can be cultivated starting from the Mortal Shedding Realm, using the Golden Body to shed mortality, stripping away the mortal shell and refining the old body to give birth to a new one."</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating the first Zhang of the Golden Body, the physical bones will reveal a hint of a golden attribute."  </p><p></p><p>"After the second Zhang, the bones will be covered in golden lines."</p><p></p><p>"After the third Zhang, the bones will shine like divine gold, no less resplendent than a supreme artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's current physical body was comparable to a thousand-pattern divine weapon, probably between the second and third Zhang of the Golden Body, similar to the Monk in Hempen Robes.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the white bones and indeed saw a few golden lines.</p><p></p><p>This celestial was a guardian of the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>A celestial guardian, encountering Liang Xiao and the Eighteen Arhats at this time!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where the male body of the Guangping Bodhisattva who pursued Senior Brother has gone!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure moved, stepping into the void without lingering further. </p><p></p><p>The sword mark in his palm shone, guiding him deeper into the Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Two figures traversed the void, and the further in they went, the vaster the surrounding space became.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Lord of Longevity was likely a deity from the ancient era. The celestial abode he opened is too vast - even a Comprehending the Heavens expert couldn't create such an expansive domain!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the celestial realm with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>The doubt in his heart grew denser.</p><p></p><p>In that glorious era when the Heavenly Court suppressed the Primordial Chaos, the Celestial Emperor was a deity, and the Immortal Lord of Longevity was also a deity.</p><p></p><p>So why would a deity from such a prosperous age prepare his own tomb in advance?</p><p></p><p>Did a deity foresee his own impending death?</p><p></p><p>How could the Immortal Lord of Longevity have known he was going to die?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts surged, but his three thousand thoughts could not deduce the ancient truth.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the thoughts sank into the Earth Pouch, motionless.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A divine light bloomed deep in the tomb, shards of celestial prohibitions flying out from the depths, brushing past Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The celestial prohibitions were shattered, their Dao patterns completely dissipated, carrying a terrifying divine might that filled the entire tomb.</p><p></p><p>"It's the strike of a supreme artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Someone had unleashed the full power of a supreme artifact deep in the Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>No, not just one or two people - it was a group simultaneously unleashing their artifacts in one supreme strike, even shaking the Immortal Lord's tomb, causing this celestial abode to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked ahead into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's sword mark and the direction of the divine might were consistent.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Jiuqing flew towards the source of the divine might.</p><p></p><p>A pressure weighed down on the void, as if deities and demons stood in the vast expanse of the universe, keeping their spiritual power and physical bodies constantly on guard.</p><p></p><p>The innermost celestial prohibition of the Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>This celestial prohibition had been almost completely shattered, shards scattered everywhere, some even falling to overturn the yellow mud.</p><p></p><p>Several figures hovered in the air, enveloping the core of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>As the pressure of the artifact strikes dissipated, they all turned towards the bronze celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Not a single scratch?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of celestial palace is this that can withstand a supreme artifact strike without damage?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, under a supreme artifact, even another supreme artifact would shatter. Yet this celestial palace remains unscathed?"</p><p></p><p>One of the arhats took a few steps forward.</p><p></p><p>The others said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Ordinarily, they would have acted to be the first to enter the bronze celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>But now, they understood the might of this bronze palace that could withstand multiple supreme artifact strikes without a scratch.</p><p></p><p>Even the formidable Descending Dragon Arhat could not open this celestial palace alone.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Arhat clasped his hands, a golden body manifesting behind him.</p><p></p><p>The infinite golden body radiated Buddhist light as he pushed against the celestial palace doors with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>Golden light flashed, the golden body sank, and the Descending Dragon Arhat coughed up blood, unable to open the doors but injuring himself instead.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, unleashing his spirit, physical body, spiritual power, origin, and divine abilities all at once. An enormous celestial dragon coalesced above his head!</p><p></p><p>The true dragon roared, charging towards the bronze celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>The figures in the heavens all watched the Descending Dragon Arhat.</p><p></p><p>"The Descending Dragon Arhat, the foremost disciple of the fourth generation of Buddhists, ranked above the Subduing Tiger Arhat on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"The Descending Dragon Arhat cultivates the true dragon physical body, his origin already perfected. Coupled with his innate anomaly, even Catastrophe Realm celestials would not dare battle him directly!"</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist golden bodies were formidable to begin with, and the Descending Dragon Arhat had also cultivated the true dragon physical body, resonating with his innate anomaly. Even those on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking would not recklessly fight him physically.</p><p></p><p>Yet!</p><p></p><p>The bronze celestial palace remained utterly motionless. The true dragon crashed against the doors, gradually dissipating until the last strand of divine light vanished.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Arhat retreated from the celestial palace entrance, standing in the celestial realm once more.</p><p></p><p>"You all saw it - this bronze celestial palace cannot be forced open from the outside. To enter, we must push open these bronze doors!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Lord's tomb was vast, but from the beginning, apart from breaking through the celestial prohibitions, they had not encountered anything else.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had broken through the final layer of prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>The only place left unexplored in the entire tomb was this celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>So the Immortal Lord's treasures most likely, with a ninety percent chance, lay buried within the bronze celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we join forces to push open the celestial palace doors?"</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Arhat's voice echoed outside the palace as the Subduing Tiger Arhat stepped forward first.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, by combining our power, we may have a chance of opening the bronze celestial palace doors!"</p><p></p><p>The other celestial talents and peerless geniuses did not speak.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, another figure came forward.</p><p></p><p>She wore a starry gossamer robe, trailed by several figures - the followers of the Celestial Maiden of the Stars.</p><p></p><p>She smiled faintly, starlight shimmering on the bronze celestial palace, bathing it in resplendent radiance.</p><p></p><p>"When I entered the Immortal Lord's tomb earlier, I saw that madman from the Sword Sect chasing your Buddhist Great Benefactor Arhat."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I also saw him kill your Great Benefactor Arhat and a Buddhist celestial."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>The celestial talents and geniuses stirred.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the southeast direction of the bronze celestial palace was a sword cultivator brimming with sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Those talents and geniuses turned to look at this sword cultivator, curiously asking:</p><p></p><p>"When did the Sword Sect produce such a formidable sword cultivator? Able to slay even Catastrophe Realm celestials?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Cultivator, you should explain this to us properly."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was a Daoist cultivator with a jade-like countenance, holding a long sword that appeared ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he spoke, the other cultivators dared not utter a word!</p><p></p><p>He was the fourth disciple of the strongest in the world, the Dao Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>It was because of him that the great competition between the four sects had begun.</p><p></p><p>The current great era was opened for the sake of this Dao Cultivator!!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Cultivator smiled calmly, "The Dao Cultivator jests, how could a disciple of my Sword Sect compare to you?"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Celestial Maiden of the Stars.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The woman's sword aura erupted, her sword intent condensing into a fierce dragon hovering in the air, directly aiming the sword aura at the Celestial Maiden of Stars!</p><p></p><p>Among the peerless experts of the Great Wilderness, the Sword Cultivator ranked third on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking. </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden of Stars ranked fourth!</p><p></p><p>"What does the Celestial Maiden of Stars mean by those words?"</p><p></p><p>Now they were all wondering how to open the Bronze Immortal Palace. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Maiden of Stars shifted the conflict onto the Sword Sect, causing the Sword Cultivator to feel displeased.</p><p></p><p>He was the Sword Cultivator of the Sword Sect, and also a Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>As a sword cultivator, his sharp edge was fully exposed!</p><p></p><p>Although he had not fought the Dao Cultivator, he had already determined that he was no match for him.</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Maiden of Stars!</p><p></p><p>He was thinking of testing the Celestial Maiden's strength.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden wore a veil, the corners of her mouth slightly upturned.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Cultivator, do not misunderstand. I bring this up to inform you all that the madman from your Sword Sect killed a celestial from the Buddhist sect after entering here, and then disappeared from this place."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the entrance we used to enter the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Venerable, there are no other exits."</p><p></p><p>That madman from the Sword Sect could not have simply vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Gaze after gaze fell back on the Sword Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"You should all know who he is. It's normal that he could enter the Bronze Immortal Palace."</p><p></p><p>At this point!</p><p></p><p>It was their turn to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Maiden was the Celestial Maiden of the Celestial Pavilion, so she naturally knew the origins of that madman from the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>She even suspected that the previous Celestial Lord had perished at the hands of the Sword Sect's madman.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Cultivator from the Dao Sect smiled faintly as he looked towards the princess beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Soaring Through the Clouds, since that madman could enter the Bronze Immortal Palace, it seems we can too."</p><p></p><p>He put away the long sword in his hand and walked towards the entrance of the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Cultivator taking action, the other figures also began to move.</p><p></p><p>Soon, outside the main gate of the Bronze Immortal Palace stood several figures.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Cultivator!</p><p>Princess Soaring Through the Clouds!</p><p>The Celestial Maiden of Stars, the Sword Cultivator, the Descending Dragon Arhat, the Subduing Tiger Arhat, the Mysterious Celestial Machine, Prince Zhou!</p><p></p><p>On the Dragon and Tiger Ranking, apart from the Great Blessing Arhat killed by Senior Brother Celestial Span and the Great Celestial Venerable who did not come, all the other ranked experts were present.</p><p></p><p>After gazing at the bronze gate for a long time, this direct disciple of the Dao Ancestor finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>He pushed his palms horizontally into the void, pressing them against the entrance of the Bronze Immortal Palace. Ripples appeared on the gate, emanating rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Laws were inverted, the Milky Way descended, various anomalies intertwined!</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, he withdrew his palms and shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"To force open this gate solely with the power of one's mortal body would require at least the strength of a Pure Yang Ancient Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The Dao Cultivator's mortal body was unmatched, approaching the level of a Pure Yang Ancient Venerable!</p><p></p><p>With just those words, the peerless talents present caught a glimpse of the Dao Cultivator's physical prowess.</p><p></p><p>They all revealed grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>If the Dao Cultivator could not open this bronze gate, then none of them could either!</p><p></p><p>Only by combining all their powers might there be a slim chance.</p><p></p><p>Sword aura slashed through the air, sword chimes resounding outside the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Black Feather soldiers stationed here all turned to look behind them.</p><p></p><p>The Black Feather Army's Grand Marshal and Supreme Commander, two Celestial Beings at the Tribulation Realm, stared at the celestial phenomena behind them, where a sword aura was rapidly approaching, arriving outside the Bronze Immortal Palace in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? A Sword Immortal? Another Sword Sect disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Cultivator, it seems your Sword Sect still has quite a few peerless talents."</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou mocked with a sneer.</p><p></p><p>The Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Venerable had been cleared, and those able to stand before the Bronze Immortal Palace were all supreme peerless talents, existences capable of reaching the Unitary, Dual, or even Trinal Cultivation in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Cultivator was arrogant!</p><p></p><p>He had already sent word for the Sword Sect disciples to wait for him in the Gloomy Capital, so how could there be more Sword Sect disciples entering the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Venerable?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his message had not been transmitted?</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Sword Cultivator did not recognize these two figures from the Soaring Peak, but after a moment he identified Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He was about to speak and drive away the two Sword Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>But these two Sword Sect disciples were truly audacious, blatantly ignoring them and fixating on the Bronze Immortal Palace instead.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was anxious!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group surrounding this bronze gate, he didn't mind adding one more person.</p><p></p><p>The sword talisman given to him by Senior Brother Celestial Span marked this very bronze gate.</p><p></p><p>The location where Senior Brother Celestial Span had killed the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping was inside this Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>The sword talisman's ripples did not guide Gu Jiuqing to enter through the main entrance of the immortal palace, but rather led him to the back.</p><p></p><p>"Is Senior Brother telling me to enter the immortal palace from here?"</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Venerable, there was only this one immortal palace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace were scattered traces of formidable divine powers, remnants left behind from the use of great artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Those standing at the entrance earlier must have been the ones who unleashed those artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Sword Cultivator from the Sword Sect, but at this moment Gu Jiuqing had no mind to greet him.</p><p></p><p>The immortal palace was massive, forged entirely from divine bronze, emitting rippling bronze radiance that wove into the Dao's patterns, obscuring the view of the interior.</p><p></p><p>His divine eye was ineffective against the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, a Sword Sect disciple, are you trying to find the entrance to the Bronze Immortal Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't bother, even our combined efforts couldn't open that gate. Do you really think you can open the immortal palace?"</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou's voice came from above.</p><p></p><p>Previously in the Gloomy Capital, he had been severely beaten by the Great Celestial Venerable!</p><p></p><p>He was astonished by the Great Celestial Venerable's strength, definitely a being capable of opening the Eight Heavens Palace or even the Nine Heavens Palace!</p><p></p><p>Then he saw the Buddhist cultivators pursuing the Great Celestial Venerable, and immediately gave up any thought of contending with him.</p><p></p><p>So he entered the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Venerable ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>And none of the peerless talents present were weaker than him.</p><p></p><p>It was at this very moment that Gu Jiuqing, an insignificant disciple below the Celestial Realm, arrived. Prince Zhou took the opportunity to vent his pent-up frustration.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, don't tell me you think you're three times more talented than the Sword Cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou's words left the Sword Cultivator in an awkward position.</p><p></p><p>He was the Sword Cultivator of the Sword Sect, yet this Sword Sect cultivator did not even greet him upon meeting, instead probing the entrance of the Bronze Immortal Palace, clearly not holding him in any regard.</p><p></p><p>However, as a fellow Sword Sect disciple, the Sword Cultivator could not speak ill of his sect before outsiders.</p><p></p><p>"There are many outstandingly talented disciples in my Sword Sect. I am only called the Sword Cultivator because I happened to come into prominence earlier."</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Sword Sect really determine seniority based on age?"</p><p></p><p>"I see the Sword Cultivator's cultivation is celestial, just half a step away from crossing the Tribulation. This sword cultivator may be young, but surely he cannot match the Sword Cultivator, can he?"</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou did not continue mocking him further.</p><p></p><p>He was also wary of the Sword Cultivator spitting out a sword pill.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two peerless talents were verbally sparring, the gate of the Bronze Immortal Palace suddenly trembled!</p><p></p><p>The entire immortal palace rippled, emitting rays of bronze divine light into the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing's eyes, a great soaring peak flashed, reflecting the celestial realm!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pointed at the celestial realm image on the immortal palace, his inner sword intent flowing. The great soaring peak cracked open, revealing a hidden entrance about a person's height!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rejoiced and, accompanied by Lu Yuan, stepped into the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Creak creak creak————"</p><p></p><p>The hidden entrance closed, and the surrounding anomalies disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Outside the immortal palace, those peerless talents were dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>He just went in like that?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect had sent in disciples one after another?</p><p></p><p>When did the Sword Sect produce such talented individuals?</p><p></p><p>This shouldn't be!</p><p></p><p>The peerless talents ranked on the Dragon and Tiger list couldn't help but doubt themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Arhat and Subduing Tiger Arhat sensed a Buddhist aura approaching from behind. They quickly turned and bowed reverently.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Buddha!"</p><p>"Greetings to the Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>By the time the Descending Dragon Arhat and Subduing Tiger Arhat raised their heads, they saw a Bodhisattva approaching through the void from afar.</p><p></p><p>Buddha's light illuminated the heavens, Buddha's dharma was immeasurable, Buddha's voice lingered.</p><p></p><p>A Bodhisattva shrouded in red fur, the entire Buddha form enveloped, red fur dozens of meters long hanging down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This red monster emanated dense Buddha's light, the two Arhats staring dumbly at the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping.</p><p></p><p>"Bodhisattva!"</p><p>"Bodhisattva!"</p><p></p><p>They called out to the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping again.</p><p></p><p>But the Bodhisattva did not hear them, strands of ominous aura drifting down from his body, rippling the Bronze Immortal Palace!</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators hurriedly retreated from the Bronze Immortal Palace!</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful eyes, this Bodhisattva covered in red fur pushed against the gate of the immortal palace, emitting a Pure Yang aura that vaporized the red fur around him.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a naked female form.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Bronze Immortal Palace opened, an ancient aura venting outwards as the Bodhisattva stepped inside and vanished from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Little bugs! The Buddha has found you two little bugs."</p><p></p><p>He sensed that his other half was also inside the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Bronze Immortal Palace, a chilling voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you, pursuing my younger brother?"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura instantly enveloped the void.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!

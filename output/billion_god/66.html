        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Magnificent!</p><p></p><p>Resplendent! </p><p></p><p>In the vast realm above, a celestial court reigned over this golden prosperous age.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was the earth, and the Celestial Court was the heavens. This Celestial Court hovered above the Great Wilderness, looking down upon the cycle of reincarnation of all living beings. </p><p></p><p>This was the outer appearance of the Celestial Court!</p><p></p><p>The scenery of the Celestial Court was depicted as absolutely flawless perfection. </p><p></p><p>Misty clouds drifted about, celestial air rippled, enveloping numerous heavenly palaces.</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred and ninety-nine heavenly palaces, incomparably magnificent. Within each palace resided a great celestial general, while the ten great immortal palaces housed the ten celestial immortal lords who reigned over the world.</p><p></p><p>According to ancient legends, the Celestial Court had the position of the Celestial Emperor, and besides the Emperor, there were ten high ministers.</p><p></p><p>They were the Ten Celestial Immortal Lords!</p><p></p><p>These ten great immortal lords resided in the ten immortal palaces.</p><p></p><p>The ten immortal palaces were surrounded by celestial air, with ancient mystical beasts guarding the palaces. Huge stars from beyond the heavens shone down directly into the ten immortal palaces.</p><p></p><p>Celestial terraces!</p><p></p><p>Celestial pavilions!  </p><p></p><p>The Jade Pool immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of celestial phenomena were perfectly depicted, almost inscrutable!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Celestial Court."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed in admiration. He had never seen the Celestial Court before and did not know what it looked like.</p><p></p><p>In his imagination, the Celestial Court should be similar to the divine capital of the Great Zhou Dynasty, surrounded by city walls with rows of houses, and the imperial palace as the palace of the Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Court was indeed similar to his imagination, but even more magnificent and resplendent, able to reign over the Great Wilderness with its own might alone.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was not just the human race. Even demons, evil spirits and wild deities had to submit at the feet of the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"On the Blue Star, there also seem to be legends about the Celestial Court."</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Gu Jiuqing searched for Pangu online, he came across the term "Celestial Court."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Celestial Court appeared many times, like some demonic Celestial Court, the Eastern King's Celestial Court, the Jade Emperor's Celestial Court, and so on.</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown what kind of Celestial Court the people of the Blue Star would envision after the Great Ming Court Sword Classic was transmitted there.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was curious!</p><p></p><p>This sword classic was so well-suited for being spread to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his thoughts, and the vision of the Ming Court disappeared from the Mud Ball Palace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Jiuqing had observed his own Celestial Court, Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao said regretfully:</p><p></p><p>"Alas, since you cannot enter the sword realm, you can only sneak into the Great Wilderness. Of the eighteen ancient celestial courts, except for the eighteenth celestial court that fell within the Great Zhou territory, the other seventeen fell into the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>What a pity!</p><p></p><p>He could not go in search of the relics of the ancient celestial courts.</p><p></p><p>With your talents, Senior Martial Brother, if you could find the remains of the ancient celestial courts and observe the ancient celestial courts, your comprehension of the Great Ming Court Sword Intent might reach the level of great perfect enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind that. Now that you have cultivated to the Dharma Realm, how do you plan to transform your dharma power?"</p><p></p><p>Transform the dharma power?</p><p></p><p>The dharma power flowing from the Myriad Doors was attribute-less.</p><p></p><p>By using cultivation methods, one could make the dharma power attribute become specialized. In the future, when cultivating divine abilities, it would be more convenient.</p><p></p><p>For example, by cultivating the Yin dharma power, it would not only speed up the cultivation of lunar divine abilities in the future but also increase their might.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating solar dharma power, black water dharma power, wind attribute dharma power, or fire attribute dharma power would have corresponding effects.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had considered it. Single-attribute dharma power was unnecessary for him.</p><p></p><p>With so many people from the Blue Star assisting him in cultivation, his dharma power was inexhaustible. The dharma power alone could crush all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Solely cultivating single-attribute dharma power would only be icing on the cake. At that time, if he used divine abilities of other attributes, he would be hindered and it would not be worth it.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple does not plan to transform the dharma power."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine too. Without an attribute, the dharma power will not hinder the use of any divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's figure flickered and turned into a wisp of light.</p><p></p><p>Gathering quicksand!</p><p></p><p>Activating again!</p><p></p><p>After the light dissipated and reorganized into his true form, the quicksand merged and became Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's true body.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he now held a thick book.</p><p></p><p>"I originally planned to let you observe it after I finished compiling the Divine Abilities Compendium. But now that you have just cultivated to the Dharma Realm and do not yet have divine abilities to protect your body, you can first select some divine abilities to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao handed the Divine Abilities Compendium to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The compendium containing 586 divine abilities was now gripped in Gu Jiuqing's hands.</p><p></p><p>Its weight was so heavy that Gu Jiuqing could not even straighten his back.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao smiled slightly, "Disciple brother, you are the paramount sword cultivator. You can explore these divine abilities, but do not indulge excessively. Wait until our master emerges from seclusion, and he will transmit supreme sword dao techniques and divine abilities to you."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that none of the 586 divine abilities recorded sword dao techniques and spells!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the Divine Abilities Compendium in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This book was three feet thick, even thicker than a millstone and several inches larger than a millstone. </p><p></p><p>It was the painstaking work of Senior Martial Brother over all these years.</p><p></p><p>Yet Senior Martial Brother passed it on to him without reservation. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was moved, he bowed to Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>The elder brother is like a father!</p><p></p><p>Though Venerable Master Cunyin had not yet emerged from seclusion, Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao was already his master.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know how to open his mouth, he had received too many benefits from Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The King's Flying Sword!</p><p></p><p>The Moon Stone, the Sun Stone.</p><p></p><p>The great classic sword manual of the Namingtingmiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Pattern Divine Cauldron, the 1,800-pattern Dragon and Tiger Cauldron, the peerless treasure Star Pearl of the Stellar Hall.</p><p></p><p>And now this divine abilities compendium!</p><p></p><p>He did not know how to ask his Senior Martial Brother for the ancient teleportation altar.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, why are you stammering? Speak quickly, do not be coy."  </p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao frowned!</p><p></p><p>What was wrong with his junior martial brother?</p><p></p><p>Why this appearance?</p><p></p><p>I do not fancy men.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, I also do not fancy women.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, um, do you have the ancient teleportation altar! Your junior martial brother wants the ancient teleportation altar."</p><p></p><p>Phew!</p><p></p><p>Thank goodness!</p><p></p><p>Thank goodness!</p><p></p><p>Junior Martial Brother also does not fancy men.</p><p></p><p>That's good then.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing could finish speaking, Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao reached out and grabbed at his own physical body, pulling out a huge altar from one of his spirit apertures.</p><p></p><p>"Here, this is the ancient teleportation altar, you want to set up the ancient teleportation altar, right? Luckily your Senior Martial Brother has two."</p><p></p><p>He grabbed another altar from another spirit aperture.</p><p></p><p>The two altars were sealed, with talisman papers attached, and fell into Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's palm.</p><p></p><p>"These two ancient teleportation altars were actually obtained from the Demon Prince of the Seventh Evil, I don't know what that Demon Prince of the Seventh Evil wanted the teleportation altars for."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao then tossed the ancient teleportation altars to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he seemed to remember something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, it seems like half a month later, our sect has a mission that requires someone from the Namingtingmiao Peak to protect our junior sect members on a trip to cultivate on the moon."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You probably haven't been to the moon yet, right? This is a good opportunity for you to go to the moon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the two ancient teleportation altars in one hand and the divine abilities compendium in the other.</p><p></p><p>The moon?</p><p></p><p>He recalled the ancient giant tree he saw on the moon during his roaming travels.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu had been there once!</p><p></p><p>"Back then when your Senior Martial Brother surveyed the clouds, I stayed on the moon for ten years, cultivating all kinds of moon divine abilities. I also planted ten seeds of divine weapons on the moon, it's been eight or nine hundred years, those divine weapons should have become thousand-pattern divine weapons by now."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, you can use them to subdue your physical body!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao was really paving the way for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>A sect mission, isn't that something only an Elder Sword Immortal would have the qualification to lead?</p><p></p><p>Yet Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao was letting Gu Jiuqing take his place to go to the moon, and even giving him the divine weapons buried on the moon to subdue his physical body.</p><p></p><p>What a Senior Martial Brother!!</p><p></p><p>Apart from Gu Linglian and Steward Xie, he was the third person who cared so much about him.</p><p></p><p>A thousand words condensed into four:</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Senior Martial Brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Mmm."</p><p></p><p>At the Namingtingmiao Peak palace courtyard, Gu Jiuqing closed the main door behind him.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the sword furnace still emanated strands of sword qi, his master Venerable Cunyin was still in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the floating True Transmission Island of the Sword Immortal Sect hovering outside Namingtingmiao Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the time, it's about ten days until the Blue Star College Entrance Exam."</p><p></p><p>"Which means, if nothing unexpected happens, I can connect to the cultivation bases of all 10 billion people in the world one more time before flying to the Moon of Primordial Chaos."</p><p></p><p>A figure stepped into the void, heading towards the Sword Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>A blue robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The youth held the divine abilities compendium larger than a millstone in one hand, and the ancient teleportation altar in the other. Ripples formed in the void as he channeled his spiritual power through his body, crossing this sword sect's mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition!</p><p></p><p>This time, his strength would increase even faster!</p><p></p><p>Push, push, push the plot!</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star's three-month lockdown will be lifted soon.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist is about to fly to the Moon of Primordial Chaos, it's time for him to enter a side quest.</p><p></p><p>I can't even imagine how formidable the protagonist will become with 10 billion people helping him cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Which means the protagonist is about to emerge from seclusion and show off soon!!!</p><p></p><p>The author has no special talents, except being first-rate at showing off, I beg readers to keep reading.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

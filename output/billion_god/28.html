        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Golden vital energy flowed through his entire body. Under the bathing of the golden vital energy, Gu Jiuqing's physical body underwent an extraordinary transformation. </p><p></p><p>The five viscera!</p><p></p><p>After repeated bathing, the original forms of the five viscera and six bowels had dissipated. Outside the six bowels, wisps of energy condensed - it was the most primordial form of energy!</p><p></p><p>The five viscera appeared indistinct, as if five divine beings were guarding them!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, each of his ribs emitted brilliant divine light, interweaving with the ripples of the golden vital energy to outline the illusory forms of true dragons and celestial beings. </p><p></p><p>Eight times shedding the mortal form allowed Gu Jiuqing's physical body to reach the extreme limit, a limit beyond words.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy transformed into a golden image, his flesh plump and extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Even a single strand of his hair could lift a mighty tripod cauldron.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary person found one of Gu Jiuqing's hairs, that single strand could serve as their divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The myriad phenomena of vital energy returned to the Baihui acupoint, causing his entire body to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The golden vital energy flowed through his body, shaking Gu Jiuqing with some pain.</p><p></p><p>After this bout of pain subsided, Gu Jiuqing reached out and grabbed his own hair, pulling with force to shed his entire physical shell.</p><p></p><p>It was a skin!</p><p></p><p>An old skin!!</p><p></p><p>"Eight times shedding the mortal form is the true rebirth, shedding the old skin to be reborn in new clothes. In Buddhism, those old monks enter meditation for decades just to shed their old shells!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the discarded shell beside him. The old skin was dull, with traces of impurities, bone fragments, broken organ pieces, and vein patterns. In short, this old skin contained everything that was Gu Jiuqing's past.</p><p></p><p>"The old shell is gone, the new is reborn. The eighth shedding of the mortal form, this is the eighth time."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing confirmed again that he had completed the eighth shedding of the mortal form.</p><p></p><p>Once confirmed, Gu Jiuqing could no longer suppress the smile on his face!</p><p></p><p>Eight times shedding the mortal form, the supreme form. In the future, his achievements, without relying on the Blue Star, would make him a paramount figure in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Only by completing the eight sheddings could Gu Jiuqing contend equally with those celestial immortals!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched out his hand, and behind his back, illusory images of dragons and celestial beings surged forth, a force permeating his entire body.</p><p></p><p>This was a pure force, to Gu Jiuqing it was a majestic power!!</p><p></p><p>On the arms that had just completed the eighth shedding, blood vessels burst open, fresh blood seeping out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly dispersed the dragon and celestial force behind him.</p><p></p><p>"The body that just shed its old shell and completed the eighth shedding cannot withstand my full power?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gave a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>He had just calculated that he had condensed the power of fifty-eight dragons and celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>In other words, without considering the burden on his physical body, he could lift fifty-eight small mountains!</p><p></p><p>"Even cultivators at the Imperfect Golden Core stage who have refined a divine body probably couldn't withstand a combined strike with the force of fifty-eight small mountains, right?"</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Jiuqing's gaze, the wounds on his arms gradually healed, quickly returning to their original state.</p><p></p><p>"By relying on the Dragon and Celestial Skill, I can continue shedding, even complete the ninth and tenth sheddings, shed the second and third old shells. But the increase in physical strength is too slow compared to the increase in power."</p><p></p><p>"I need to cultivate other body refining methods to accelerate the speed of my physical cultivation!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly thought of a solution to the problem.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes again!</p><p></p><p>He had just grasped the true essence of the Dragon and Celestial Skill, now he would grasp the true essence of the Sword Drawing Art.</p><p></p><p>Within his spiritual awareness, a golden divine sword condensed with vast splendor. Boundless scenes of sword cultivation fused together, myriad flying swords mutually testifying, the new "Rending Heaven Sword Intent" was developed to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>The realm of Rending Heaven was ancient and solemn, yet carried the supreme meaning of splitting the heavens and earth, enveloping everything!</p><p></p><p>There were 330,000 people cultivating the Sword Drawing Art!</p><p></p><p>70,000 fewer than the Dragon and Celestial Skill!</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators were one in a hundred thousand. Out of a hundred people, maybe one could become a sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In this...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Among 330,000 people, there were probably about 3,300 who were suitable for cultivating the sword path. These 3,300 people had the deepest understanding of the art of drawing swords.  </p><p></p><p>Then there were another 330,000 as the foundation, with all kinds of novel understandings of the art of drawing swords, which unexpectedly also condensed a strand of the true essence of the art of drawing swords in the Dao of fruits.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing touched upon it, he obtained the true essence of the art of drawing swords.</p><p></p><p>The art of drawing swords!</p><p></p><p>It was the most fundamental sword art, with only two forms, corresponding to a rhyming verse. The sword cultivator who created the art of drawing swords had never imagined that someone would gain enlightenment of the sword intent through this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing seemed to see the sword cultivator who created the art of drawing swords.</p><p></p><p>Tracing back to the source, based on the profundity of the art of drawing swords, he deduced the sword cultivation level of this sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet a sword immortal, probably a sword cultivator of three or four parts of sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing narrowed his eyes, and the illusory figure of the sword cultivator disappeared!</p><p></p><p>And on his body, the Cutting Heaven Sword Intent began to increase massively.</p><p></p><p>When he was at the Sword Gate Checkpoint, Gu Jiuqing's Cutting Heaven Sword Intent almost broke through two parts!</p><p></p><p>Now, in just a few breaths of time, the Cutting Heaven Sword Intent had already broken through two parts!!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent shone brightly, too dazzling to look at directly, condensing in Gu Jiuqing's palm.</p><p></p><p>This palm seemed to have transformed into the image of the azure sky, the sword intent about to break through the azure sky, shattering the shackles, and cutting apart the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"The efforts of 330,000 people, condensed into this two parts of sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the cultivation of 330,000 people for a few days, condensed into this Cutting Heaven Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>"Wala——————"</p><p></p><p>The sword intent in his palm surged again.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Gu Jiuqing's face increased by three parts.</p><p></p><p>As the true essence of the art of drawing swords was completely absorbed by Gu Jiuqing, the sword intent in his palm finally condensed to the limit, which was barely reaching three parts of the Cutting Heaven Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>With the true essence refined, Gu Jiuqing's understanding of the art of drawing swords reached the ultimate, and the sword intent in his hand shone brilliantly, then transformed into strands of threads, wrapping around his fingertips, constantly flowing like rootless water.</p><p></p><p>"Three parts of Cutting Heaven Sword Intent, fifty-six dragon and elephant strengths, plus eight times of shedding mortal form, I, Gu Jiuqing, should barely qualify as the foremost person in the realm of shedding mortal form, right?"</p><p></p><p>Set a small goal, to become the foremost person of all time in every realm!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master——————"</p><p></p><p>The flying carriage halted, and the voice of Steward Xie came from outside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"We're home."</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took a step out of the flying carriage, and the scene before him changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>An old mansion appeared before his eyes, with two stone lions standing motionless at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The old mansion was ancient and simple, with large red lanterns hanging high. After being away for nine days, the grand mansion seemed a bit quiet, but as soon as the carriage stopped, someone opened the main gate to welcome the young master home.</p><p></p><p>"Welcoming the young master home!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing returned too early, and the Tianyuan Ancient City and other ancient cities had not yet received news of the disciples who had joined the Sword Gate this time. The Gu Mansion was as usual, without much vitality.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing entered the Gu Mansion, a servant brought him a letter, which was from his sister Gu Linglong.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, this letter arrived three days ago!"</p><p></p><p>Three days ago?</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was still at the Sword Gate Checkpoint for the great examination.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the letter.</p><p></p><p>[My dear brother, when you see this letter...]</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>[I suppose you have failed the great examination and returned early, right?]</p><p></p><p>These were the first two sentences of the letter!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>He had actually joined the true lineage of the Sword Gate, how could he have failed the great examination!</p><p></p><p>My dear readers, you have been reading for so long, you must have accumulated quite a few monthly tickets and recommendation tickets, right?</p><p></p><p>It's time to support this new book!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

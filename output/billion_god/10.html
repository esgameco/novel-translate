        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Linjiang City!</p><p></p><p>On weekends, Linjiang City was severely congested, with several major streets in the downtown area blocked off. </p><p></p><p>"What's going on, they're even blocking roads?"</p><p></p><p>"Is some important figure coming?" </p><p></p><p>"I thought it was a few hundred years ago? Those important figures were all martial arts experts, who would dare attack them?"</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>On the main street, armed police were patrolling and guarding, each officer blocking the street, prohibiting vehicles from passing through.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event could not happen without the mayor's permission. </p><p></p><p>That was four or five main roads blocked off.</p><p></p><p>At the 21st floor of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce building.</p><p></p><p>Black-clothed security guards stood in rows on the 21st floor. Each of these guards was a bone refining master. They were waiting on the 21st floor.</p><p></p><p>There was a dedicated elevator passing through the 21st floor to get to the 22nd floor. </p><p></p><p>After the last person entered the dedicated elevator, the entire 21st floor was completely closed off. The auras of dozens of martial arts masters instantly disappeared. Their auras were concealed, their blood essences congealed, and even their body temperatures dropped slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even with infrared scanning, the figures of the bone refining masters could not be detected.</p><p></p><p>On the 22nd floor of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce building.</p><p></p><p>The bosses of Linjiang's three major listed company groups had all arrived. The three company bosses sat in the front, facing a group of elite talents.</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun, as the boss of Huaren Technology Company, could only be seated in the last few rows at such a gathering.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? The Chamber usually gives at least half a month's notice, or even three months' notice before holding a meeting. Why did they urgently summon us?"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun looked at the bigwigs of Linjiang City and nodded obsequiously, not daring to be rude.</p><p></p><p>The mayor's secretary was even here?</p><p></p><p>"Who's that?"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun looked towards the seats on the podium, where there were name placards.</p><p></p><p>"President of the Linjiang Martial Arts Association!"</p><p></p><p>This was a military figure!</p><p></p><p>The president of the Martial Arts Association could reach the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>The mayor was a local tyrant, while the president of the Martial Arts Association was a formidable force across the river. Both overlords of Linjiang were present!</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened?</p><p></p><p>To require the mayor to take the lead and the president of the Martial Arts Association to descend?</p><p></p><p>And those three company bosses were also present!</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun sensed something was amiss. Seated next to him was the boss of a technology company. Unlike Hua Yun, this boss mainly did foreign trade exports, which was quite dangerous. If they encountered demonic beasts at sea, the goods would almost be completely lost. Therefore, this boss would even go to sea himself to escort the goods.</p><p></p><p>"President Jiang, what happened that made them hastily summon all of us?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember you were going to set sail? How did you have time to come to the Chamber today?"</p><p></p><p>President Jiang was in his forties and had refined his martial arts to a high level. Although his blood essence had slightly declined, his strength was still formidable, far surpassing Hua Yun's.</p><p></p><p>In front of President Jiang, Hua Yun did not dare speak loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you receive the message?"</p><p></p><p>What message?</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun was surprised. What were the people at his company doing? How was he the only one in Linjiang who didn't know about this major event?</p><p></p><p>President Jiang didn't beat around the bush and said directly, "Something happened at Linjiang High School, a big incident."</p><p></p><p>Linjiang High School?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that the school of his girlfriend, Bai Muqian?</p><p></p><p>What major incident could happen at Linjiang High School?</p><p></p><p>Did a demonic beast enter the city and attack the school?</p><p></p><p>Or did a teacher massacre the students?</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun couldn't guess. He asked softly, "President Jiang, just tell me what it is."</p><p></p><p>"Two martial artists appeared at Linjiang High School. This matter is related to those two martial artists. The president will explain the details."</p><p></p><p>President Jiang didn't know much either.</p><p></p><p>Two martial artists?</p><p></p><p>Did students cultivate into martial artists before the age of eighteen?</p><p></p><p>And two appeared at once?</p><p></p><p>How was this a major incident?</p><p></p><p>At Huaren Technology Company, under their training program, some had already cultivated into martial artists before eighteen.</p><p></p><p>At major companies, this was no secret.</p><p></p><p>It just meant they couldn't take the college entrance exam and enroll in university.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, ahem——————"</p><p></p><p>On the podium, there were five people seated. Besides the mayor's secretary and the president of the Martial Arts Association, there were also three company bosses.</p><p></p><p>The current president of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce was Yang Ziantian, the boss of the Yang Group.</p><p></p><p>"You all must be very curious why I summoned you all to the Chamber today."</p><p></p><p>"Let me introduce them first."</p><p></p><p>"On my left is the mayor's secretary, Secretary Wen."</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen nodded, greeting the Chamber's bigwigs.</p><p></p><p>"On my right is the president of the Martial Arts Association!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Association president smiled and greeted the Chamber's bigwigs.</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Wen? It's actually Secretary Wen! The mayor usually doesn't appear in person. Linjiang City is generally managed by Secretary Wen. This secretary is also on stage?"</p><p></p><p>"And the president of the Martial Arts Association, isn't he a military figure? Why is he intervening in the affairs of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce?"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star now was different from the old Blue Star politics.</p><p></p><p>With the loss of nuclear weapons for suppression, martial arts experts, especially those who had undergone blood transformation into martial sages, had made conventional weapons obsolete.</p><p></p><p>Individual combat capabilities had reached their peak. For example, the First Martial Sage had the power to destroy a nation!</p><p></p><p>Martial sages were also called nation-stabilizing or nation-destroying experts.</p><p></p><p>Although the president of the Martial Arts Association wasn't a martial sage, he was still a martial king, one of the strongest martial artists in Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>"The Chamber has already discussed this matter with the mayor and the president of the Martial Arts Association. So I, Yang, will inform you all on their behalf. I hope you can do the following:"</p><p></p><p>"First, do not disclose the matter I'm about to say."  </p><p></p><p>"Second, after today, it's best if none of you leave the city. Stay in Linjiang City for three months."</p><p></p><p>"Third, suspend all trade with other cities, provinces, or overseas, as well as any hunting expeditions. Can you all do that?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Ziantian looked calmly at the Chamber members.</p><p></p><p>But the people below were already flustered.</p><p></p><p>They could keep things confidential, but they couldn't stay in the city or cut off contact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>They even wondered if Linjiang was rebelling!</p><p></p><p>But with the Martial Arts Association president from the military present, it probably wasn't a rebellion.</p><p></p><p>Yang Ziantian saw the uproar and didn't say anything for ten minutes before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, now I want to hear your opinions."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Martial Arts President, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>As the Martial Arts Association president stood up, a terrifying aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>It was his martial arts will!</p><p></p><p>A bone refining martial king had already developed his own will. His fist intent alone could shatter a building!</p><p></p><p>He walked slowly to the door, his arms hanging naturally at his sides, and closed his eyes without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But such a scene had already terrified the people present. </p><p></p><p>The Chairman Wu was blocking the doorway, clearly trying to cut off their retreat.</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian's voice came again, "This matter is very serious. If anyone doesn't want to listen, you can leave now. Of course, Chairman Wu will personally see you out."</p><p></p><p>"Now, if anyone wants to leave, you can go directly." </p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, two people immediately left their seats.</p><p></p><p>One of these two people was Director Jiang!</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun also saw Director Jiang leave his seat, but he didn't dare to stop him.</p><p></p><p>The other member, Hua Yun had also seen before - he was the bearing company boss in Linji City. It was said that his family kept three bone refining masters.</p><p></p><p>The two members left their seats and were about to push open the big door to leave the conference room.</p><p></p><p>But Chairman Wu took action!</p><p></p><p>With the speed of the martial king, his figure flashed and the two were instantly struck in the head in the blink of an eye. </p><p></p><p>White and red matter sprayed out.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Wu, you're still as violent as ever," the secretary said calmly. "Jiang Yunfan and Du Changshuan rebelled against the military and were killed on the spot by Chairman Wu. Director Hu, you will report this later and let everyone in Linji City know of their rebellious intentions."</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat poured down!  </p><p>Limbs went numb!</p><p>Hua Yun was so shocked he couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>To him, Director Jiang was a formidable figure, but Director Jiang was actually killed so easily? And labeled a rebel on top of that!</p><p></p><p>What exactly were the mayor, military, and chamber of commerce trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Those two just wanted to leave!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the conference room fell silent, and no one dared take half a step towards the door.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, it seems you all agree with what I just said."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian was very satisfied and smiled slightly. "Since you all agree, then I hope you won't go back on your word. All trains to and from Linji City have been halted, highway entrances cut off, and the airspace closed."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p>Linji City has been cut off from the outside world? </p><p>This is insane!</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun was dumbfounded. What on earth happened at Linji High School to cause such a huge commotion in Linji City?</p><p></p><p>"Now let me explain this matter. Well, this whole thing is led by the mayor and the chairman of the Martial Arts Association, carried out through the three of our major groups, and then announced to you all."</p><p></p><p>"This is a red-headed document, everyone must keep it safe."</p><p></p><p>"The Linji Ancestral City Plan is officially launching!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian waved his hand, and a huge projection screen appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"You all know Linji High School, right? In Class 2 of Grade 3, there are 45 students in total. And now! Two students have broken through and become martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"One is Ning Que, whose father is the director of the zoo. The other is my daughter, Yang Miao Jing!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p>Hua Yun frowned. He had mentioned this to Bai Mu Chan before.</p><p>He wanted to recruit these two to Huaren Technology, but he didn't expect Yang Miao Jing to be Yang Zhan Tian's daughter!</p><p></p><p>"The remaining 43 students have all become martial artist candidates!"</p><p></p><p>Martial artist candidates?</p><p>43 martial artist candidates??</p><p>In just one class, not only were there two martial artists, but 43 martial artist candidates too??</p><p></p><p>A wave of shock rippled through the room. Although bizarre, this didn't seem like it warranted such a huge response.</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian looked at the Linji City talents below and pointed to the projection screen behind him. </p><p></p><p>A young man's figure appeared on the screen.</p><p></p><p>"And this whole thing is related to this teacher."  </p><p>"Gu Zixiu! From the Gu Family of the Imperial Capital."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu is a teacher at Linji High School. Half a month ago, he suddenly took leave. But on the first day he returned to class, Gu Zixiu passed down the eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>"This allowed my daughter Yang Miao Jing and student Ning Que to cultivate into martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p>So those two martial artists came about like that?</p><p>By cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill?</p><p>Isn't that the supreme martial art of the Imperial Capital's Gu Family?</p><p></p><p>"The next day, Gu Zixiu passed down the remaining fourteen forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, making it the complete twenty-two form set."</p><p></p><p>Images appeared on the projector, and the members below widened their eyes, staring at the screen.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so tense, everyone. The files have photos of all twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. However, the second and third forms are missing. To cultivate the complete Dragon and Elephant Skill, you'll have to get it from the students of Class 2, Grade 3."</p><p></p><p>"That's basically the whole situation."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian stood up, and with a motion of his body, he began performing the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill on the stage!</p><p></p><p>Circulating inner energy, refining flesh, refining bones, refining tendons - an all-encompassing cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After demonstrating the full twenty-two forms, Yang Zhan Tian was sweating profusely, having expended quite a bit of energy. He took out a nutrient tube to replenish himself.</p><p></p><p>"We have verified the authenticity of the complete twenty-two form Dragon and Elephant Skill. This is a supreme martial art, more powerful than even the skills of the eight great families of the Imperial Capital!"</p><p></p><p>"Three years, at most three years! Whether old or young, by cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill for three years at most, one can become a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian was excited.</p><p></p><p>"The era of everyone being martial artists is coming! While we cannot conceal the existence of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, we have decided to launch the Linji Ancestral City Plan and seal off Linji City for three months!"</p><p></p><p>"These three months will be our cultivation period for the Dragon and Elephant Skill in Linji City."</p><p></p><p>"After three months, the college entrance exams will begin. Relevant personnel from the Imperial Capital will come to Linji to administer the exams, and the Dragon and Elephant Skill will be revealed nationwide at that time."</p><p></p><p>By then, the Dragon and Elephant Skill will spread across the entire country!</p><p></p><p>In these three months, they aim to transform Linji City into an ancestral city, on par with the Imperial Capital.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p>The Linji City talents below finally understood the importance of this meeting.</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun trembled, excitedly looking at the red-headed document that contained twenty forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, missing only the second and third.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme martial art, a supreme martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun's face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>This was the start of a new era, and he happened to be born in Linji City just in time for it.</p><p></p><p>With three months' head start cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill, according to Yang Zhan Tian, in three months he could break through flesh refinement, enter bone refinement, and even potentially become a tendon refinement grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Linji City!</p><p>It was about to change drastically!</p><p></p><p>The era when martial artists were treated as less than dogs, when grandmasters walked everywhere, was coming.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure stood up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>It was the principal of Linji High School.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, Gu Zixiu sent a message to the school's head of academic affairs that his morning class is canceled." </p><p></p><p>"He will only come to school to teach in the afternoon at 2 o'clock."</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu has appeared again!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Association Chairman raised his head, the overbearing pressure of the Viscera Refining Martial King reaching its peak at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He would go to the school personally to meet this Imperial Capital young master who passed down the Dragon and Elephant Skill!</p>

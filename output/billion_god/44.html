        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Mingtingfeng Peak.</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace landed at the summit of the mountain peak, with strands of sword light shining like the brilliant sun, shooting straight into the heavens. </p><p></p><p>The ripples on the divine bridge dissipated at the end of the void.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure jumped down from the end of the divine bridge, landing on Mingtingfeng Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the True Inheritor Gu!"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the front, and a young man bowed towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The young man had neat brows and handsome features. His clothes exuded a noble air, and there was a hint of arrogance between his brows.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing Gu Jiuqing, he concealed his arrogant demeanor.  </p><p></p><p>"I am an inner door disciple named Lu Yuan, from the Lu Family of Guiyuan Ancient City in the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>Guiyuan Ancient City was the ancient city where the Xia Family of Xia Province was located. </p><p></p><p>This young man also hailed from Guiyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Yuan had joined the Sword Sect for a long time and had already leaked the heavenly secrets, cultivating formidable inner powers.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned. This was Mingtingfeng Peak, yet Lu Yuan was merely an inner door disciple. What was he doing here waiting for him?</p><p></p><p>Seemingly noticing Gu Jiuqing's puzzlement, Lu Yuan hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this. The True Inheritor Island has just been constructed. My junior martial brother was concerned that the True Inheritor might not be familiar with the True Inheritor Island, so he specially applied to guide you in using it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the outside of Mingtingfeng Peak, where a floating island had risen.</p><p></p><p>This island hovered in the air, emanating rays of divine light all over its body. Numerous brilliant lights illuminated the mortal world, resembling a celestial island and a heavenly mountain.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Jiuqing's gaze fell upon the True Inheritor Island, Lu Yuan's voice came from beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This True Inheritor Island was created by the hands of the Elder of the Artifact Peak. It was personally constructed by the Fierce Sun Elder, with the Three Realms Qi Gathering Grand Formation, the Sword Intent Illumination Grand Formation, and the defensive Four Symbols Primordial Spirit Grand Formation!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan tried to demonstrate his usefulness by eagerly explaining to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Realms Qi Gathering Grand Formation can gather the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. You should know that ninety-nine spiritual veins are buried beneath the Sword Sect. If we can attract some spiritual energy from these veins, it will greatly enhance one's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Intent Illumination Grand Formation is an array specifically requested by my junior martial brother from the Fierce Sun Elder."</p><p></p><p>"You, Senior Martial Brother, are the paramount figure of the sword path. Your swordsmanship is unmatched. If you can increase the speed of your sword cultivation, you may surpass the Three Sword Saints of our Sword Sect in the future."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan led the way in front of Gu Jiuqing, taking out an identity token.</p><p></p><p>This was his identity token from the Artifact Peak.</p><p></p><p>Disciples of the Artifact Peak were responsible for constructing buildings within the Sword Sect and were skilled in using the divine abilities of celestial craftsmanship. They could command the Yellow Turban Laborers.</p><p></p><p>The level of Yellow Turban Laborers that could be commanded depended on the rank of the Artifact Peak disciple's identity token.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's identity token was golden, allowing him to command the highest-ranking Yellow Turban Laborers.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, quite intriguing indeed."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not interrupt Lu Yuan's introduction.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Four Symbols Primordial Spirit Grand Formation, it is our Sword Sect's defensive grand formation, and also the highest-level defensive array that the Artifact Peak can deploy on the True Inheritor Island."</p><p></p><p>"The Four Symbols represent the Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, and White Tiger. The Four Symbols Primordial Spirit contains supreme true insights. With your great talent, Senior Martial Brother, if you can comprehend the sword intent of the Four Symbols from the Primordial Spirit, you will undoubtedly be able to establish a new peak in the Sword Sect and achieve the position of a Sword Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was considering Gu Jiuqing's future prospects.</p><p></p><p>An inner door disciple making such considerations for him, a newly appointed True Inheritor?</p><p></p><p>He must have some request!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not respond, as he wanted to see what this inner door disciple intended.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan infused his spiritual power into the identity token, and suddenly, the True Inheritor Island trembled. A divine light shot forth from it, landing in front of Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stepped back and slightly bent over.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, please!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped onto the guiding divine bridge, walking onto the True Inheritor Island.</p><p></p><p>This was his own mountain peak!</p><p></p><p>On the True Inheritor Island, the Four Symbols Primordial Spirit Grand Formation manifested, and as soon as Gu Jiuqing entered, he felt the interweaving of four types of primordial energies, forming the images of the Four Symbols Primordial Spirits at the four cardinal directions of the island.</p><p></p><p>This divine bridge guided him from the south, and the Four Symbols Primordial Spirit guarding the south was the Vermilion Bird, a massive Vermilion Bird apparition appearing before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan tossed out the Artifact Peak disciple's token, and the Vermilion Bird Gate opened wide, allowing them to enter the True Inheritor Island.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, this is your True Inheritor Island."</p><p></p><p>The mountain peak was vast, three to four times larger than the Gu Residence, with towering trees and an herb garden cultivating the most basic spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>A palace was constructed at the central location of the True Inheritor Island.</p><p></p><p>A stone stele ten zhang tall stood outside the palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Sword Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gazed at the stone stele and exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"When the Fierce Sun Elder originally constructed this True Inheritor Island, he named it by combining the Seven Stars, Four Symbols, Heavenly Origin, and Heavenly Sword. This junior is unworthy, but for you, Senior Martial Brother, I have chosen..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The name "Heavenly Sword Palace". </p><p></p><p>Luyuan lowered his head and glanced sideways at Gu Jiuqing. Seeing no change in the latter's expression, he continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is the paramount master of the Sword Dao. The Heavenly Sword Palace befits Senior Brother's great talent."</p><p></p><p>After each authentic transmission island was constructed, it would be named by the authentic transmission disciples themselves.  </p><p></p><p>However, since Gu Jiuqing was not in the Sword Sect, the naming of this authentic transmission island was left to the disciples of the Artifact Peak.</p><p></p><p>"You do have good intentions."</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's tense heart finally relaxed.  </p><p></p><p>This was praise coming from the paramount Sword Dao master, and moreover, an authentic transmission from the Namingtingfeng lineage!</p><p></p><p>Other disciples of the Artifact Peak did not dare interact with those of Namingtingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>If he could gain the recognition of this paramount Sword Dao master, he might have a chance to become an authentic transmission disciple in the future!</p><p></p><p>Other inner sect disciples dared not approach? </p><p></p><p>Then he, Luyuan, would become the steward of the Heavenly Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, after you refine the stone stele, you will be able to control this authentic transmission island."</p><p></p><p>This was the core location of the three great formations!</p><p></p><p>Only after refining it would Gu Jiuqing become the true master of the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Refine?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had not yet cultivated his magic power, so how could he refine it?</p><p></p><p>Luyuan smiled from the side, "The sect has already considered Senior Brother's situation. Elder Lieyang has personally refined this stone stele. At that time, Senior Brother only needs to drip a drop of his essence blood onto the stele to refine it."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect had thought everything through meticulously, even considering that Gu Jiuqing lacked the ability to refine.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan had clearly explained the usage of the authentic transmission island.</p><p></p><p>At this point, this inner sect disciple should have withdrawn, but Luyuan remained standing in the Heavenly Sword Palace, showing no intention to leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked towards the distant sky!</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, Gu Jiuqing also looked up at the heavens beyond the Sword Sect's divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>A ray of light pierced through the azure vault, its speed so rapid that in an instant it descended from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's great formation automatically dispersed, offering no obstruction to this ray of light's entry.</p><p></p><p>After landing on Namingtingfeng, the light flew towards the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Before the figure even descended, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Laughter echoed throughout the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was the voice of Senior Brother Liangxiao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rejoiced!</p><p></p><p>His senior brother had finally returned to the mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, Luyuan beside him turned deathly pale, his whole body trembling as if he had seen some great horror.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, look what kind of demon your Senior Brother has brought for you this time!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao's figure appeared beside Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he was holding a demon, grasping it like a chick, leaving it unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The demon's figure was enormous, with strands of demonic aura emanating from its body. But after extending three feet, the aura was dispersed by an invisible sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The demon had horns on its head, wings on its back, four arms on its chest, and eight more arms on its back, totaling twelve demonic arms!</p><p></p><p>On its brow was an imprinted purple pattern, appearing extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, don't be afraid. This demon has already been crippled by your Senior Brother, with its cultivation completely sealed. Besides, this is the Sword Sect's domain - even the Demon Lord himself wouldn't dare run rampant here!"</p><p></p><p>"Let alone just one of his offspring."</p><p></p><p>Concerned that Gu Jiuqing might be frightened, Senior Brother Liangxiao offered an explanation.</p><p></p><p>This was a Demon Prince, captured by Liangxiao and brought to the Sword Sect to serve as the baptismal blood for Gu Jiuqing's shedding of mortal form!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's own offspring?  </p><p></p><p>A Demon Prince?</p><p></p><p>Luyuan trembled!</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had been too careless in accepting this sect mission.</p><p></p><p>That madman from Namingtingfeng was dozens of times crazier than the rumors suggested!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, however, showed no particular reaction.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord? Who was that?</p><p></p><p>A quasi-divine powerful being?</p><p></p><p>His master, the Tao-Imprinting Man, was also a quasi-divine powerful being.</p><p></p><p>As the paramount in attacking the Sword Dao, the Demon Lord could hardly be a match for his master.</p><p></p><p>Was there any need to fear?</p><p></p><p>"Come, come, your Senior Brother can't wait any longer!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Prince carries a trace of the Demon Lord's bloodline. Hehe, this time, Junior Brother, you'll be able to bathe in this Demon Prince's vital essence. You might even undergo two or three sheddings of mortal form!"</p><p></p><p>Three sheddings would complete the full eight sheddings, casting off the old skin to be reborn anew.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao still thought Gu Jiuqing had only completed five sheddings.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed Gu Jiuqing, leaping a few times before entering Namingtingfeng and the sole palace within.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

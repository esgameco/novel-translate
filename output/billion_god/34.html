        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Liangjiang Television Station, office building. </p><p></p><p>A row of monitors surveilled every move on the Liangjiang network.</p><p></p><p>Among these monitors, there was a separate monitor that surveilled a unique computer. </p><p></p><p>However, at this moment the monitor was dark, indicating that the computer being monitored was not online yet.</p><p></p><p>After a while, an image appeared on this monitor, and all the personnel in the office stopped what they were doing and looked towards this monitoring screen.</p><p></p><p>"An image is up! That computer has booted up."</p><p></p><p>"What? After all this time, that deity has finally booted up?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been several days since the deity proposed the Moon Plan. During these past few days, the deity seemed to have disappeared. Yet he has appeared today and logged into the computer at this moment."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what this deity is going to do!"</p><p></p><p>They referred to Gu Jiuqing as a deity!</p><p></p><p>They were among the earliest in Liangjiang to call Gu Jiuqing a deity.</p><p></p><p>They captured all of Gu Jiuqing's online records and had completely deified Gu Jiuqing in their minds.</p><p></p><p>During the time Gu Jiuqing was away from Liangjiang, the municipal government and the Martial Arts Association sent out a large number of personnel to search for traces of Gu Jiuqing, but found nothing useful.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Gu Jiuqing had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>It was just like the previous times, and they had no choice but to give up searching for Gu Jiuqing again.</p><p></p><p>A search bar appeared on the screen.</p><p></p><p>[Buzhou Mountain]</p><p></p><p>"Buzhou Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>The staff couldn't help but utter these three words.</p><p></p><p>"The deity is searching for Buzhou Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Why would the deity search for Buzhou Mountain?</p><p></p><p>This piece of information quickly spread from the television station office building to the information retrieval center, where a large group of professionals analyzed the deity's psychological state.</p><p></p><p>A deity had appeared on the Blue Star, and this deity seemed to want to build the Blue Star. They needed to understand this deity's preferences as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Avoid angering the deity!!</p><p></p><p>"Director, a large number of search terms have appeared on the Liangjiang forum."</p><p></p><p>One staff member exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a second staff member also noticed the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the Liangjiang forum, there are also a large number of identical words in text messages and chat groups."</p><p></p><p>One staff member copied these key words from the information and quickly displayed the hottest terms on the large screen.</p><p></p><p>"A large amount of atmospheric glow appeared in the night sky of Liangjiang, as if a celestial treasure had been born."</p><p></p><p>"I saw two flashes of light in the residential area, gone in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone noticed that a thick fog has risen in the residential area? I went into the fog, and I felt my blood boiling. So I practiced the Dragon and Elephant Skill inside the fog, and unexpectedly broke through the martial artist limit, reaching the Sect Master level!"</p><p></p><p>"The fog! There's fog in our residential area too. I'm going to practice inside the fog right now!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Director Liao frowned as he looked at the lines of text appearing on the screen.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes ago, a dense fog had appeared in Liangjiang City, enveloping the Jingyangxiaoquareas and spreading to five surrounding streets, covering a total of twelve residential areas.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, there were no other abnormalities in other parts of Liangjiang City.</p><p></p><p>"The people in the fog-covered residential areas clearly felt their cultivation speed increase, indicating there are substances that accelerate cultivation in the fog!"</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual energy, it's spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>One staff member blurted out.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy condensed into a fog, appearing in Liangjiang City?</p><p></p><p>The staff members trembled, could this be the deity's doing?</p><p></p><p>They wished they could go to the Jingyang residential area and find Gu Ziuxiu to ask the deity in person!</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness of Liangjiang City, at the Martial Arts Alliance's martial artist camp.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief, a Refining Talisman Martial King, stood shirtless under a large tree. His body brimmed with vigor.</p><p></p><p>He gripped a T20 alloy sword, taking the stance of the Unsheathing Sword technique.</p><p></p><p>He was comprehending the Unsheathing Sword technique.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind, and the sword was unsheathed!</p><p></p><p>His blood and energy surged as his spirit condensed into this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>A ten-meter sword energy slashed horizontally.</p><p></p><p>With one strike, the tree in front was cleaved in two.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist hurriedly passed him a nutrient solution.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief drank the entire nutrient solution, then set down the T20 alloy sword.</p><p></p><p>These days, he practiced the Unsheathing Sword technique three hundred times daily.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Three hundred times of cultivation, each time exerting full effort with a sword strike. </p><p></p><p>He could clearly perceive that his understanding of the sword art had gained clear comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"What actions has the Linji Trade Association taken these past few days?"</p><p></p><p>The head of the security department stood to the side, with two of his guards besides him. </p><p></p><p>The warrior who had just handed a report to the Chief was a military personnel, who had already left this place.</p><p></p><p>"They have all signed new contracts. Of the 88 companies in the Linji Trade Association, each has invested two million, raising the first sum of funds. They have now started construction of aerospace equipment."</p><p></p><p>The head of security looked at the Chief curiously and asked, "Chief, how far are you from becoming a Blood Martial Saint?"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>During these days, he cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill day and night, only feeling his martial arts cultivation soaring higher, able to clearly perceive his strength increasing daily!</p><p></p><p>But as for the paramount realm of Martial Saint, it was still far beyond his reach.</p><p></p><p>"How far away is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Chief narrowed his eyes, exhaling a stream of qi that shot out like an arrow over three meters away.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint, the Saint of Martial Arts, to step into this realm is to become a human nuclear bomb. Among us, if anyone becomes a Blood Martial Saint, why bother going to such lengths to blockade Linji City?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, even if the Governor of Jiangnan Province learns of this, he would not dispatch troops to suppress us, at most he would come to negotiate!"</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint was too strong, indicating that to reach this realm would be even more arduous.</p><p></p><p>"In Linji City, besides you and me who are Martial Kings, the Mayor and Secretary are also Martial Kings. The principal of Linji High School and the leaders of the three major corporations, they are all Martial Kings!"  </p><p></p><p>"Linji also hides several Martial Kings over a hundred years old. Normally a Martial King over a hundred years old is inferior to a Grand Master, but now with the emergence of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, these Martial Kings also have a chance to break through to Martial Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Chief smiled faintly, "If a Martial Saint emerges in Linji, I will definitely be the first!"</p><p></p><p>He was too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the head of security fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Among so many Martial Kings, the Chief's strength seemed the strongest. </p><p></p><p>It was natural that he would break through to Martial Saint the fastest.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the martial arts army's evening practice had begun. Thousands of warriors simultaneously cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill, their qi and blood rising, illuminating the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>This prevented them from being attacked by wild beasts while stationed here for many days.  </p><p></p><p>The twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant were unfolding, rapidly enhancing the strength of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Within Linji City, two beams of light suddenly flashed, then the radiance disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the two Martial Kings simultaneously looked toward Linji City.</p><p></p><p>"I just sensed an immense energy!"</p><p></p><p>"I felt it too."</p><p></p><p>The two guards activated their communication equipment, then hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Director! Chief! This is the latest news from the Linji Information Center."  </p><p></p><p>"The spiritual qi concentration in Linji City has increased by three degrees! And the spiritual qi is still rising."</p><p></p><p>"It has now exceeded twelve degrees."  </p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>How could the spiritual qi in Linji City become so concentrated?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in the wilderness, the spiritual qi is only at ten degrees. Normally in cities it's only seven or eight degrees.</p><p></p><p>And during the high martial arts era on Planet Blue, the spiritual qi degree was 0!!</p><p></p><p>After so many years of spiritual qi recovery, most places on Planet Blue have seven degrees, with highly concentrated spiritual qi areas reaching twelve degrees!!</p><p></p><p>Yet Linji City had leapt to become a highly concentrated spiritual qi area?</p><p></p><p>"Roar——————"  </p><p></p><p>Night!</p><p></p><p>A roar of an unknown beast came from the wilderness outside Linji.</p><p></p><p>The beasts had also detected the soaring spiritual qi in Linji City and reacted.</p><p></p><p>The Chief's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, cancel the alliance's evening practice in the future, change to hunting beasts in the wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>If the concentrated spiritual qi in Linji City persisted, it would attract the attention of the wild beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, these are the spiritual qi values for each district of Linji City!"</p><p></p><p>The two guards took off their communication logs.</p><p></p><p>On the display screen appeared patches of red areas.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The ancient city of Tianyuan trembled. </p><p></p><p>Within this ancient city, many great clans were shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate was one of the four great sects in the world, and the northern lands were a subordinate region of the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>To be accepted into the Sword Gate meant soaring to the clouds with ease!</p><p></p><p>To become an outer disciple was good enough, but to become an inner disciple meant being a dragon among men. Whether from prestigious clans or noble families, all wished for their descendants to join the inner court of the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>But to become a true disciple of the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>One would gain true renown in the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>The thirteen ancient cities would continuously sing praises, allowing one's true name to resound through the thirteen northern cities.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Gu family manor was bustling with voices. Carriages kept arriving at the manor gates, with patriarchs from great clans and even prestigious families coming to congratulate Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral tablet of the Qu family had already flown back to the Qu residence, but the two elders were currently standing before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Goddess sat to the side!</p><p></p><p>She had intended to observe the Three Immortal Golden Body technique earlier, but was intrigued by this scene unfolding in the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing has attained the status of a true disciple of the Sword Gate. The Qu family has brought their ancestral tablet to kneel and pay respects!"</p><p></p><p>This was an apology at the cost of humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she would learn of the grievances between the Qu family and Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall!</p><p></p><p>The two Refining Immortal elders forced smiles, looking at the youthful teenager before them without a shred of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"We beg the young master Gu to extend his noble hand and pardon the Qu family!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou coveted beauty and schemed to frame Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>To the Qu family, this was merely an insignificant trifle.</p><p></p><p>But Qu Yazhou was killed by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yazhou was the young master of the Qu family, destined to become their true disciple heir.</p><p></p><p>When they learned of this, the two elders wished to exterminate the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Later, they found out that Gu Jiuqing had joined the Sword Gate as a true disciple under the Supreme Primordial Sect and was praised as the paramount of the Sword Path!</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this, the Qu family felt as if they had fallen into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>The paramount of the Sword Path? An existence that had not appeared for thousands of years had descended upon the Gu family?</p><p></p><p>The two elders dared not associate the paramount of the Sword Path with Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"The Qu family, over a thousand strong, has carried our ancestral tablet to come and beg for forgiveness!"</p><p></p><p>"Here are three thousand spirit stones to congratulate the young master Gu on attaining the status of a true disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The second elder of the Qu family took out a qiankun bag filled with plump spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand spirit stones was an immense sum.</p><p></p><p>Copper coins and gold and silver were the common currencies in Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>But in the northern lands, spirit stones were the hard currency, with even greater purchasing power than gold.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the spirit stones sent by Gu Linglong numbered only in the hundreds, yet they had allowed Gu Jiuqing to live an affluent life.</p><p></p><p>The eighth elder of the Qu family also took out a qiankun bag.</p><p></p><p>"The Qu family has stored many spirit-nurturing pills over the years. In this qiankun bag are three hundred Dragon Blood Pills, which should aid the young master Gu in shedding his mortal form!"</p><p></p><p>The two Refining Immortal elders exchanged a glance, and the second elder took out a large medicinal herb from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>Luo Goddess silently observed the Qu family's apology gifts of spirit stones, pills, and humble plea for forgiveness. The Qu family's sincerity was quite admirable.</p><p></p><p>For a clan about to join the ranks of prestigious families to go to such lengths was already rare.</p><p></p><p>There must be a high-level figure guiding them from behind the scenes!</p><p></p><p>"An eight-hundred-year-old Herb of Sovereign Healing?"</p><p></p><p>"And it is completely undamaged. The Qu family is truly sparing no expense to obtain Gu Jiuqing's forgiveness?"</p><p></p><p>An eight-hundred-year-old Herb of Sovereign Healing was a treasure even among prestigious families.</p><p></p><p>Luo Goddess was a descendant of the Luo family and the most outstanding descendant in recent generations, yet she did not possess the foundation of the Herb of Sovereign Healing.</p><p></p><p>With such a herb in hand, it was like having a second life.</p><p></p><p>For the Qu family to offer this herb, were they not afraid of angering their great elder?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this scene was orchestrated by the great elder of the Qu family?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Goddess was shaken!</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Sword Gate truly harbored great righteousness!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calmly looked at the two elders of the Qu family. He had just recently set foot in the ancient city of Tianyuan when the Qu family came to congratulate him. </p><p></p><p>They even brought offerings from their ancestral temple to apologize!</p><p></p><p>In addition to three thousand spirit stones, three hundred bottles of Dragon's Blood Pills, and an eight-hundred-year-old Herb King plant.</p><p></p><p>This congratulatory gift was extremely generous, showing the Qu family's utmost sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not expect the Qu family to be so decisive!</p><p></p><p>However, since the Qu family was willing to make peace, Gu Jiuqing naturally would not reject them. He reached out and took the Herb King plant in his hand, then looked towards the second elder of the Qu family.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Qu family has a divine ability called the Yin-Yang Life and Death Cycle, driven by the Yin-Yang Celestial Body, with the power to define Yin and Yang, and divide the universe."</p><p></p><p>The second and eighth elders of the Qu family frowned.</p><p></p><p>They completely did not understand why Gu Jiuqing would bring up the Qu family's divine ability at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The two Refining Elders stared at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient city of Tianyuan, there are many prestigious families and clans, but only the Qu family cultivates the Yin-Yang Celestial Body. Would the two elders be willing to let me take a look at the method of forging the Incomplete Cycle?"</p><p></p><p>The method of forging the Incomplete Cycle!</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Qu family's expressions changed!</p><p></p><p>The method of forging the Incomplete Cycle was the foundation of the Qu family, the very basis of their existence.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family also had the method of forging the Incomplete Cycle.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's body refinement involved the Six Harmonies Boxing technique with three stages of shedding mortality, followed by observing the Golden Crow, releasing the Heavenly Mechanism, knocking on the gate of life and death, and condensing the first strand of spiritual power to become a spiritual power cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Shedding mortality, releasing the Heavenly Mechanism, and the third step of forging the Incomplete Cycle - the Gu family cultivated the Golden Crow Celestial Body by nourishing the human body's spine with their own blood essence and spiritual power. Only when the human body's spine gave birth to the image of the Golden Crow would the forging of the Incomplete Cycle be considered successful, obtaining the supreme Celestial Body!</p><p></p><p>But the Gu family did not have the methods for comprehending Heaven and Earth or refining divinity after that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only knew some cultivation methods of the Refining Divinity Realm. With the body's spine being the Incomplete Cycle, the three hundred and sixty-five celestial apertures throughout the body would evolve into the constellations of the celestial cycle. Opening the celestial apertures meant manipulating the constellations of the celestial cycle!</p><p></p><p>This method was not possessed by ordinary clans.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie, who had followed the Gu family for many years, had already reached the pinnacle by stepping into the semi-Refining Divinity Realm. To completely refine divinity, he would need to obtain the method of opening the celestial apertures.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Steward Xie seemed to understand Gu Jiuqing's intention, showing a tense expression as if wanting to speak up, but was stopped by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"The two elders of the Qu family can rest assured. The method of forging the Incomplete Cycle, as witnessed by my eyes and transmitted by me, will at most be known by two people regarding the forging of the Yin-Yang Celestial Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Two elders, what do you say?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the eight-hundred-year-old Herb King plant in his hand, his expression calm, without the previous embarrassment he had when with Luo Shen.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shen carefully watched the Herb King plant in Gu Jiuqing's hand.</p><p></p><p>She had to find a way to take this Herb King plant from her young master.</p><p></p><p>The second elder's smile had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>The eighth elder, who was originally bent over, also straightened his back at this moment. The two Refining Divinity experts were clearly displeased.</p><p></p><p>The Qu family had shown enough sincerity, but Gu Jiuqing still wanted to take advantage of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The main hall fell silent for a few breaths before the second elder suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, we shall follow Young Master Gu's request!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and an ancient book appeared in his palm, looking somewhat decayed.</p><p></p><p>"Three days, at most three days! After three days, I will send someone to the Gu residence to retrieve this book. I hope Young Master Gu will keep his promise."</p><p></p><p>"A scholar never deceives others!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled slightly, taking the book in his hand.</p><p></p><p>As witnessed by my eyes and transmitted by me, I will only pass it on to one person within the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>But outside the Great Wilderness, not to mention the forging method of the Yin-Yang Celestial Body, I have even transmitted the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Among scholars, there is no deception, only the art of war!</p><p></p><p>From this point on!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and the Qu family had resolved their grievances.</p><p></p><p>However, Luo Shen did not leave the Gu residence, instead staying there.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not mind, as he now had too many cultivation methods, spirit pills, and two spirit veins!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Is this the new supreme martial art passed down by Gu Zixiu?"</p><p></p><p>Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>At the municipal government hall, in the mayor's office. </p><p></p><p>The secretary had printed out the photos into a booklet of around 10 pages. Each page showed the sword drawing techniques from different angles, perfectly capturing the two forms of the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Drawing the sword 300 times a day, it takes 10 years to make minor accomplishments. In a year of 365 days, swinging the sword 1 million times allows one to cultivate the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>"This supreme martial art, if cultivated from a young age, one can make minor accomplishments by high school."</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Wen, what do you think of this supreme martial art?"</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang mayor lowered his head, looking at the contents of the booklet in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The body of this refining impurity martial king trembled, his blood essence condensing, his muscles, bones and skin vibrating, his five viscera and six bowels transforming into wondrous sounds.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, taking a precious sword from the sword rack into his hands, then took the stance of drawing the sword.</p><p></p><p>Drawing the sword!</p><p>Unsheathing the sword!</p><p></p><p>The two sword drawing forms were almost indistinguishable. As his blood essence surged and his breath trembled, the refining impurity martial king felt his spirit, energy and essence being drained.</p><p></p><p>His face turned pale, and as the sword fell, a over 3 meter long sword energy was slashed out from the long sword in his hand!</p><p></p><p>The freezing cold sword energy sliced through the office, cutting through the office made of refined iron, secret silver and ancient wood. Everything in front of it was instantly severed into two halves.</p><p></p><p>Crackling sounds rang out ——————</p><p></p><p>The sword energy swept forward, cleaving everything in its path into two halves. Walls were torn apart, the office penetrated through, even the archive room several offices away was split in half. The 3 meter sword energy drifted over 100 meters away before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Who! Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist is attacking the municipal government hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, someone actually dares to attack the municipal government??"</p><p></p><p>"Have they gone crazy? How many martial masters have been deployed? A refining impurity martial king has taken action."</p><p></p><p>"Not good, quickly report it, let the armed police come suppress it, notify the troops outside the city, and also invite the president of the Martial Arts Association to help."</p><p></p><p>The municipal government hall was in an uproar, alarms blaring, as figures rushed out from the shattered office, including two municipal staff who hurriedly entered the mayor's office.</p><p></p><p>The two staff had just entered when they saw the mayor holding a long sword in a slashing stance, while in front of him, the wall was torn apart all the way through to the deepest part.</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen coughed twice, "This is the latest sword-shaped thermal weapon we researched, it's not a martial artist attacking the municipal government, notify everyone not to spread rumors."</p><p></p><p>The two staff quickly closed the door.</p><p></p><p>In the office!</p><p></p><p>Only Secretary Wen and the mayor remained.</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen was around the same age as the mayor, also a refining impurity martial king. The two were close friends who often practiced together, but at this moment, the secretary sighed.</p><p></p><p>"That sword just now, if it was unleashed at me, I would probably be dead."</p><p></p><p>So this is the power of the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art?</p><p></p><p>The mayor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time cultivating the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art. He had only unified his spirit, energy and essence, not yet reaching the realm of harmonizing with heaven and earth, becoming one with the sword. But this one sword strike could sever any refining impurity martial king!</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Drawing Art, the Sword Drawing Art, no wonder those students call it the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art. If one can fully accomplish this sword art, severing the stars and rivers with a single sword stroke, what would be impossible?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wen, should we also spread this sword art to Linjiang?"</p><p></p><p>The mayor hesitated.</p><p></p><p>The 22 forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill, when cultivated to the utmost, could manifest the power of a dragon elephant. He didn't know how powerful this dragon elephant force was, but just from seeing two students break through their shackles and become martial artists after cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill once.</p><p></p><p>This dragon elephant force must be a power from legends, even myths.</p><p></p><p>The strength to move mountains and overturn seas would be child's play with the force of a dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sword Drawing Art, it was the ultimate sword art for protecting the Way, its killing power even more vicious.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and the opponent would either die or be crippled.</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen's eyes looked dazed. "What I'm considering now is not whether the Sword Drawing Art should spread to Linjiang."</p><p></p><p>"It's whether our evaluation of the Dragon Elephant Skill was too shortsighted."</p><p></p><p>"We thought Gu Zixiu's Dragon Elephant Skill heralded the arrival of the Martial Artist Era, but I feel in a few more years, martial artists will be abandoned."</p><p></p><p>Starting to cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill from elementary school, it takes 6 years to become a martial artist. Three years of middle school to reach the martial master realm. Three years of high school to become a great martial master.</p><p></p><p>Four years of university to become a refining impurity martial king. For those with outstanding talents, even becoming a blood condensing martial sage was not rare!</p><p></p><p>The power of the Sword Drawing Art was too formidable. Secretary Wen had elevated the potential of the Dragon Elephant Skill by several levels.</p><p></p><p>Then!</p><p></p><p>In the future era, blood condensing martial sages would correspond to today's martial artists. What higher realms existed beyond the martial sage?</p><p></p><p>The high martial era would also be abandoned!!</p><p></p><p>The mayor was also shaken. He had been too obsessed with the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art, failing to consider such a grand vision.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, blood condensing martial sages are still martial artists, Secretary Wen. Why think so much? Right now, what we need to do is build Linjiang into an ancestral city."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you and I, riding this fresh wind, will surely be able to witness the flourishing age of martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>The mayor put down the long sword and instructed Secretary Wen.</p><p></p><p>"Print out the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art into booklets and send them to the stationed troops outside the city. Also send the Dragon Elephant Skill. Since we've already decided, we might as well implement it properly."</p><p></p><p>The troops were under the control of the Martial Arts Association president, so even if they didn't send these two booklets, the president would obtain them soon anyway. It was better to send them as a friendly gesture.</p><p></p><p>"Also send a copy to each of the 88 companies of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce, and one copy to the security department."</p><p></p><p>"We need everyone to start cultivating as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Later I'll personally visit the three major corporations and have them release more nutrient fluid for our municipal government."</p><p></p><p>"This time, Linjiang truly needs everyone to unite wholeheartedly to build an ancestral city!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the Sword Drawing Art was too formidable.</p><p></p><p>The mayor didn't dare imagine what level his strength would reach if he cultivated it for a few months or years.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Dragon Elephant Skill, when the blood condensing martial sages came, he could slay one with each sword strike!</p><p></p><p>At the Huaren Technology Building!</p><p></p><p>Huaren Technology still had some influence in Linjiang, with an office building in the suburbs.</p><p></p><p>There were over 200 clerks just working in this building alone.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Huaren Technology Building was the company's industrial park, with two factories - one producing agricultural products, the other producing nutrient fluid.</p><p></p><p>But now, both factories were producing nutrient fluid, with production lines increased from the original 8 lines to 30.</p><p></p><p>30 nutrient fluid production lines operating day and night, the entire industrial park filled with the sounds of machinery.</p><p></p><p>"You should all be familiar with the Dragon Elephant Skill I gave you this morning, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Now, we'll invite Consultant Wen to demonstrate the Dragon Elephant Skill for us."</p><p></p><p>On the open field, over 200 Huaren Technology clerks had gathered. Besides them were also a group of martial artists - the company's security personnel.</p><p></p><p>Their duties included hunting demonic beasts and protecting resources being transported. </p><p></p><p>The lowest among them were martial artists, with two refining bone martial masters.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the young Consultant Wen with disdain as he stepped forward. </p><p></p><p>Too young!</p><p></p><p>Consultant Wen looked no more than 18 years old. Having such a young consultant teach them the Dragon Elephant Skill?</p><p></p><p>"And this Dragon Elephant Skill, who knows where it even came from."</p><p></p><p>"It's simply a waste of time and life."</p><p></p><p>They'd be better off going out to hunt demonic beasts and earn money with this time.</p><p></p><p>The two team leaders frowned deeply, staring at Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare be disrespectful, as Huaren Technology's CEO Hua Yun was also in the crowd, standing right in front of Wen Daihua with an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>"Consultant Wen, the gravity chamber you requested is ready at the Tiandao Practice Room in the east of the city. First teach us the Dragon Elephant Skill, then I'll have someone take you to the Tiandao Practice Room."</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua felt a bit nervous. </p><p></p><p>She was just a high school senior. Her blood essence circulated rapidly as her mind became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>She took a few deep breaths, steadied her body, dispelled all distracting thoughts, and recovered her clear mind before beginning to practice the 22 forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Elephant Marching the Wilderness!</p><p>Elephant Uprooting Divine Mountains!</p><p>Elephant Treading the Void!</p><p>Elephant Pushing Divine Cities!</p><p></p><p>As each form of the Dragon Elephant Skill was executed, Wen Daihua's blood essence surged unceasingly. Above her head, a giant blood essence elephant took shape, its image interweaving with that of a dragon, manifesting the form of a dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>Her blood essence roiled as her aura reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At first, the employees of Huaren Technology were inattentive and casual, but then they showed looks of shock. </p><p></p><p>"This is the Dragon and Elephant Skill? Why do I feel like a ferocious beast has appeared before me, with such a formidable aura!"</p><p></p><p>"Is President Hua following Advisor Wen in cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>They inwardly felt something was amiss and hurriedly followed Dai Hua Wen to cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill together.</p><p></p><p>As they cultivated, they only felt the qi and blood in their bodies being circulated, constantly flushing their flesh. The ripples of qi and blood washed and refined their muscles, bones and skin. It was not just following Dai Hua Wen in practicing the 22 moves of the Dragon and Elephant Skill once.</p><p></p><p>They only felt that the qi and blood in their bodies had obviously become more vigorous and robust!</p><p></p><p>This was the most direct feeling.</p><p></p><p>Dai Hua Wen stopped and the qi and blood dragon and elephant above her head dissipated. She casually took out a C-grade nutrient fluid to replenish the qi and blood consumed just now.</p><p></p><p>Dai Hua Wen had tested her own qi and blood value, which had risen to 1.27, while the strongest class leader and deputy leader in the class had reached over 1.5.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at President Hua!"</p><p></p><p>The others had already stopped cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill. The two disdainful Refining Bone Sect team leaders had long been conquered by the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>First, they looked at Dai Hua Wen in shock, then turned to look at Hua Yun Ye.</p><p></p><p>"President Hua, this is...?"</p><p></p><p>On the lawn, Hua Yun Ye wore cultivation clothes. Tiger and leopard thunderous sounds came from within his body, his qi and blood flowed, and his whole skeletal frame was flushed and refined, washing away the impurities!</p><p></p><p>He was a Refining Bone Master who enjoyed all the resources of Huaren Technology. Before the age of thirty, he had already reached the peak of Refining Bones, a distinguished young talent in Lijiang.</p><p></p><p>Even Bai Mu Chan was only at the peak of Refining Flesh, an entire great realm below him.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo ------"</p><p></p><p>The clear sound of flowing qi and blood, his inner muscles and bones were all sharpened, his qi and blood like mercury, flushing his flesh. His whole body was swollen with qi, his waist enlarged by several circles.</p><p></p><p>He practiced the 22 moves of the Dragon and Elephant Skill one by one. After three full rounds of practice, Hua Yun Ye finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>All abnormal phenomena dissipated. Hua Yun Ye had expended a lot of qi and blood, but there was a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally broken through the Refining Bones realm and entered the Refining Tendons realm!"</p><p></p><p>A Great Master!</p><p></p><p>The first Great Master of Huaren Technology was born.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yu, go to my office and get a B-grade nutrient fluid."</p><p></p><p>He urgently needed the nutrient fluid to replenish his physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu hurriedly ran towards the Huaren Technology building.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the guardrail was raised and several armored vehicles carrying live ammunition entered Huaren Technology. Secretary Wen got off the vehicle, looking at Hua Yun Ye in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to President Hua on becoming a Refining Tendons Great Master. It seems the Dragon and Elephant Skill has helped you a lot."</p><p></p><p>Two armed police officers stood beside Secretary Wen, and more police officers unloaded two large boxes of documents from the vehicles.</p><p></p><p>"This is still thanks to the Chamber of Commerce."</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen didn't waste words, pointing at the two boxes of documents in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"One of these boxes contains printed books of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, and the other contains books of the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique. You can distribute them to company employees or print them yourself."</p><p></p><p>Print them himself?</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique?</p><p></p><p>From this sentence, Hua Yun Ye derived many implications.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique also required everyone to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Their conversation was not hidden from anyone present at Huaren Technology, and the employees also heard their conversation.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go to the army outside the city now. You practice yourselves first, and don't forget about the nutrient fluids."</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen drove the armored vehicle away from Huaren Technology.</p><p></p><p>After Secretary Wen left, Hua Yun Ye also received the B-grade nutrient fluid.</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth and swallowed a nutrient fluid to replenish his expended strength, then looked at the bemused Huaren Technology employees.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure everyone is very puzzled. Now I, Hua Yun Ye, the president of Huaren Technology, will explain it to you."</p><p></p><p>"The municipal government, the military, and the Lijiang Chamber of Commerce, the three major powers, have joined hands to promote the cultivation of martial arts among the general population, in preparation for building the ancestral city of Lijiang."</p><p></p><p>"For the next three months, Huaren Technology will suspend all business operations. You can choose to come to the company or stay at home, but you must cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Hmm, you will also be given the new martial arts technique, the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique, which you must also cultivate together."</p><p></p><p>"During these three months, Lijiang will be sealed off and we will be prohibited from entering or leaving Lijiang. Everything from the outside world will be cut off. You don't need to think too much about it, this is an order from the mayor."</p><p></p><p>"You've also seen the terror of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, right? Advisor Wen is a high school student, but after cultivating for two or three days, she has already become a martial artist, with her qi and blood breaking through 1.2! As for you, in these three months, you will at least become martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"There are also 30 production lines of nutrient fluids in the company that can be provided to everyone for free. You can also take some nutrient fluids home for your families to use."</p><p></p><p>"It's not just our Huaren Technology company that is like this, but the entire Lijiang city is the same. I hope you can understand."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and the Fourth Martial Arts Competition will be held on the day of the college entrance examination. The first place winner can receive a prize of fifty million yuan. You can also strive for that."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yu, come up and distribute the books of the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique to everyone."</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun Ye left the stage and personally took Dai Hua Wen to the Celestial Dao Practice Room.</p><p></p><p>This scene occurred simultaneously at 88 major companies in Lijiang, and some martial arts schools also issued notifications in the evening.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique spread to every household in Lijiang.</p><p></p><p>In the western part of Lijiang City, the West Gate.</p><p></p><p>A number of armored vehicles drove out of Lijiang City and appeared in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>On the highway, there was an observation tower every 300 meters, with a soldier standing guard on each tower.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the armored vehicles arrived at the encampment area of the army in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Before Secretary Wen got out of the vehicle, he felt waves of heat!</p><p></p><p>When he drove into the military area, he saw thousands of armed police officers standing in rows, cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Their qi and blood overflowed, causing the surrounding temperature to rise dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of martial artists cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill together!</p><p></p><p>An illusory dragon and elephant, formed by their combined qi and blood, condensed in the sky above the military area.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Chief personally came out, "Secretary Wen, what wind blew you here?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Chief is joking. This time I'm representing the municipal government to deliver the first batch of C-grade nutrient fluids to the brothers outside the city."</p><p></p><p>"There is also a copy of the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique to hand over to the Chief."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Chief thanked Secretary Wen.</p><p></p><p>The two understood each other tacitly and smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique!</p><p></p><p>Which major force didn't have it?</p><p></p><p>Who didn't have C-grade nutrient fluids?</p><p></p><p>But maintaining relationships was like this. As long as they joined hands, the three major groups of the Chamber of Commerce would not cause any waves.</p><p></p><p>"How are the citizens in the city?"</p><p></p><p>"It has just begun. Most of the citizens in the city have accepted this fact, but Lijiang is still too big. Apart from the highway, there are also some small roads that can lead to the wilderness. This requires the military to patrol!"</p><p></p><p>The plan for the ancestral city of Lijiang cannot fail.</p><p></p><p>Three months was the time for them to surpass other cities.</p><p></p><p>Once the college entrance examination was held, their advantage would disappear!</p><p></p><p>"It's good to start implementing it. The current situation is different. I will have the armed police patrol the wilderness outside Lijiang City 24 hours a day, and the head of the public security bureau will also send people to patrol inside the city."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Chief looked towards the direction of the imperial capital and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The imperial capital has already noticed the abnormality in Lijiang."</p><p></p><p>"Just now, the head of the Jiangnan Provincial Branch sent a message inquiring about the situation in Lijiang City."</p><p></p><p>"I used the excuse that there was a demonic beast tide in the wilderness, so the roads to Lijiang City had to be closed to deal with it. But this excuse won't hold for long."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the time left for us is less than three months."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Chief and Secretary Wen pondered.</p><p></p><p>The era of martial supremacy! The individual reigns supreme!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial King was placed in the whole country, he would still be somewhat weak. If one could break through and become a Martial Sage, occupying a city, even the imperial capital would not say much.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully someone among us can quickly break through and become a Blood Condensation Martial Sage!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>I've changed the name. There are billions of deities within me, ahem. In the future, if my performance is good, the editor said I can change it back. "Taishang Zhijian" (Supreme Sword Wielder) sounds so much better, haha.</p><p></p><p>Let me recap the plot. The high-level martial arts of Planet Blue are being transmitted, starting from Lijiang, with the three months before the college entrance examination as the time limit. Then it will spread to the entire country, and eventually the entire Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>The early part will be written focusing on these three periods.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Wilderness, it will start from the nine days and write about joining the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The two worlds will focus more on the high-level martial arts in the early stages, and the world of the Great Wilderness in the middle and later stages.</p><p></p><p>Please follow and read!</p><p></p><p>I just asked the editor, and there are too few followers. I don't know if there will be a second round.</p><p></p><p>I hope everyone can follow and read. I beg you!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

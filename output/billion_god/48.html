        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother activated his celestial acupoints, each acupoint shining like the stars in the sky, surrounding his body. </p><p></p><p>His spine transformed into a towering Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Outside Buzhou Mountain, the stars of the heavens revolved around it. At the thirty-third vertebra sprouted a divine pillar that pierced the heavens, hanging from it were hundreds of divine abilities' seeds, totaling three to four hundred divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Atop the divine pillar was a celestial platform, formed from the thirty-fourth vertebra acting as the celestial gateway. Passing through the thirty-fourth vertebra, one could see numerous celestial palaces!</p><p></p><p>Nine great celestial palaces had condensed, and the tenth celestial palace was about to take form.</p><p></p><p>"Liangxiao Martial Brother is a powerful celestial palace realm cultivator who has condensed nine celestial palaces!"</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Jiuqing, Liangxiao Martial Brother fully displayed his strength, seemingly without hiding any of his power.</p><p></p><p>"Wushala——————"</p><p></p><p>Divine light rippled, and divine rings emanated as divine weapons flew out from Liangxiao Martial Brother's celestial acupoints.</p><p></p><p>These divine weapons were terrifyingly powerful, each engraved with ancient markings.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand-mark divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>These were thousand-mark divine weapons that required over a thousand years of refinement.</p><p></p><p>And every single divine weapon from Liangxiao Martial Brother's celestial acupoints was a thousand-mark divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also saw several great treasures within Liangxiao Martial Brother's Buzhou Mountain that surpassed the thousand-mark divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of divine weapons suppressed the celestial acupoints, while several great treasures suppressed Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Just how much power was Liangxiao Martial Brother suppressing?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, didn't I tell you long ago, Martial Brother is extremely powerful?" </p><p></p><p>Confidence emanated from Liangxiao Martial Brother's expression. "My strength far exceeds my current realm, and my fleshly body cannot contain it. So I use myriad things to suppress my fleshly body, fortifying it to bear my full power."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Brother, you need not worry about your power growing too quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Come, come, Martial Brother will gift you three divine weapons first. If you feel your strength rising too rapidly in the future, come find me again."</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother's spiritual power surged, forming a divine arm that instantly broke through the Niyuan Palace and entered one of his celestial palaces. Soon, he retrieved a divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon shone brilliantly, resembling a bronze tripod cauldron with a thousand markings flickering upon it like flowing rays of the Dao's light and tribulation's radiance, weaving strands of the Dao's rhyme!</p><p></p><p>Just activating the markings on this thousand-mark divine weapon could slay cultivators of the Spirit Refinement Realm!</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother gazed at the bronze tripod cauldron with nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze tripod cauldron was the first thousand-mark divine weapon I forged in my early years and the first weapon used to suppress my fleshly body."</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>His strength far exceeded his current realm by an immense degree, requiring divine weapons to suppress his fleshly body to contain his spiritual power and sword intent.</p><p></p><p>For two monstrous cultivators from the Mingtingfeng Sect to need external objects to suppress their bodies was unheard of!</p><p></p><p>If word spread, it would shake the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother then retrieved two more thousand-mark divine weapons from his other celestial palaces.</p><p></p><p>One was a thousand-mark bell with dragon and tiger imagery, their intertwined forms seeming to trace the markings of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>The other was a thousand-mark bead engraved with myriad stars, like the Star Palace's Celestial Bead.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Tiger Bell was something I excavated from a Celestial Palace Realm expert's palace. It has one thousand eight hundred Dao markings!"</p><p></p><p>"As for this Celestial Bead, it belonged to a former Saint Child of the Star Palace. That Saint Child fought me and lost his life, leaving the Celestial Bead in my hands."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing showed no reaction to his Martial Brother slaying a Celestial Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing he killed a Saint Child of the Star Palace, Gu Jiuqing was shocked.</p><p></p><p>A Star Palace Saint Child!</p><p></p><p>Whose status was equivalent to a Sword Heir of the Sword Sect, the future Patriarchs of the Four Great Sects, yet Martial Brother had killed one?</p><p></p><p>His Martial Brother's might far exceeded Gu Jiuqing's imagination.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother toyed with the Celestial Bead. "Martial Brother, this Celestial Bead carries many karmic burdens. If you use it in the future, remember to kill and silence anyone who learns of it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded fervently. "Martial Brother will engrave it in his heart."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Bead contains brilliant starlight that can be used to cultivate celestial abilities or refined into spiritual power. Once you cultivate its abilities and power, you'll understand its wondrous uses."</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Martial Brother waved his hand, sending the three thousand-mark divine weapons flying towards Gu Jiuqing's body!</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons shone brilliantly...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Streaks of light pierced through the fleshly body, falling onto Gu Jiuqing's spine!</p><p></p><p>Streaks of Dao rhymes leaking out from the three divine weapons intertwined with his spine, suppressing his fleshly body. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only felt his body become lighter, and the five hundred dragon and elephant figures circling around Buzhou Mountain all raised their bodies, no longer curled up!!</p><p></p><p>A surge of power poured forth, transmitted from Buzhou Mountain to his four limbs. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt that his full strength could finally be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>His sword intent was clear, his power flowed through his meridians, and Gu Jiuqing regained his peak strength.</p><p></p><p>"The three thousand-lined divine weapons have entered Buzhou Mountain to suppress my fleshly body, equivalent to the power of these five hundred dragons and elephants swirling around the three thousand-lined divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>The thousand-lined divine weapons were extraordinary. At least for now, Gu Jiuqing no longer had to worry about his fleshly body being unable to bear his strength.</p><p></p><p>He could fully absorb the cultivation of the people of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to Senior Brother Liangxiao.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao withdrew the fleshly anomaly, the heavenly divine apertures, Buzhou Mountain, and the Heavenly Palace one by one, restoring his graceful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"It was but a small matter. As expected, Senior Brother did not misjudge you. Your talents far exceed Senior Brother's back then."</p><p></p><p>"When Senior Brother was at the Spirit Refining Realm, I needed to use divine weapons to suppress my own body."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao sighed.</p><p></p><p>He accepted Gu Jiuqing as a disciple on behalf of the Remaining Print Daoist, solely because Gu Jiuqing was the paramount sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The Taoist lineage could not be broken at Namingling Sword Furnace!</p><p></p><p>The master was about to pass away!</p><p></p><p>Namingling Peak urgently needed an heir.</p><p></p><p>And that heir was Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, when can I vent the Heavenly Mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked.</p><p></p><p>With the issue of his fleshly body resolved, stepping into the Dharma Realm was imminent.</p><p></p><p>The method of venting the Heavenly Mechanism was recorded in the Gu Family, as well as the Yin-Yang Divine Body cultivation method sent by the Qu Family.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's body having undergone ten sheddings of the mortal form, he could easily accomplish the venting of the Heavenly Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, Senior Brother pondered it. To vent the Heavenly Mechanism, to knock on the profound gate of life and death, to merge with Heaven and Earth, to undergo the intermingling of the Dragon and Tiger, and in the state of unity between Heaven and Man, to open the Dantian and refine the first strand of Dharma power."</p><p></p><p>"However, you have not yet condensed your Sword Pill. Once you become a Dharma Realm cultivator, when you condense the Sword Pill, it will be tainted by the Dharma power, causing the Sword Pill to be impure."</p><p></p><p>Condensing the Sword Pill emphasizes the unity of mind and intent, the merging of thought and consciousness, spirit and body. Simply put, using thoughts, vital essence, and spirit to refine the Sword Pill, achieving the realm of sword intent resonance.</p><p></p><p>If Dharma power is added, one would need to fuse their own Dharma power into the Sword Pill, adding an extra step.</p><p></p><p>"Come! Senior Brother will take you to the Sword Tomb to choose a flying sword!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao declared loudly.</p><p></p><p>First, refine the Sword Pill, then vent the Heavenly Mechanism and become a Dharma Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing followed behind Senior Brother Liangxiao, leaving the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>A sword beam flew out from Namingling Peak. Senior Brother Liangxiao rode it through the sword gate, and the disciple enforcers regarded this scene as if they had not seen it.</p><p></p><p>They dared not obstruct the madman of Namingling Peak.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a true disciple, his strength surpassed even the elders!</p><p></p><p>Who would dare seek death?</p><p></p><p>The sword aura soared across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, isn't that your true transmission island? Why is that disciple still standing at the Heavenly Sword Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The true transmission island of the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuangong stood respectfully, as if waiting for Gu Jiuqing's return.</p><p></p><p>"This person has been standing at the Heavenly Sword Palace for days, never leaving. He does have some patience."</p><p></p><p>"Each true transmission island needs an attendant to manage it. It seems this inner disciple wishes to become your attendant."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao saw through it calmly.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed too many similar scenes.</p><p></p><p>In order to get close to a true disciple, these inner disciples were willing to become attendants on the islands.</p><p></p><p>And for the true transmission islands of powerful true disciples, the inner disciples would fight fiercely to seize the position of attendant.</p><p></p><p>"No rush for this matter, Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, why don't you tell me about the Sword Tomb instead?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(Begging for monthly tickets, rating tickets, big sponsors, and followers!)</p><p></p><p>(Kneeling and begging!)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

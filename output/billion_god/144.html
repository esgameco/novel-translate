        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Ancient City of Polaris.</p><p></p><p>A refreshing breeze, a cultivator walking alone. </p><p></p><p>Within the city, there was a great river winding through, connecting the north and south, circling around the lord's manor.</p><p></p><p>On the river's surface, flower boats were moored along both banks.  </p><p></p><p>It was not yet night, so the night scenery had not yet appeared.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one flower boat that had sailed to the middle of the river. The boatman rowed with his oar, as two noble guests observed the beautiful scenery from within the cabin.</p><p></p><p>"It has been a long time since I last saw such a sight," the young master sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Shixiong, how long have you been in the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-two years."</p><p></p><p>He was a disciple of the Wu Family from the Ancient City of Polaris. Thirty-two years ago, he joined the Sword Sect. Aside from two times when he returned home, he had never set foot in the Wu Family compound again.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-two years ago, he was just a youth. Thirty-two years later, he had become a cultivator at the Unitary Realm, with his divine body fully formed. Looking over the Ancient City of Polaris, he was undoubtedly a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Things change, time passes.</p><p></p><p>The friends who joined the Sword Sect together with him back then had all died.</p><p></p><p>"It has indeed been quite a while," the boatman exclaimed in amazement as he rowed.</p><p></p><p>"So this young master is a cultivator. With your youthful appearance, I thought you were just a young man from the city."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he joined the Sword Sect together with Dugu Ming, Gao Shuli, Lu Yuan, and several others.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan followed the path of the sword's paramount master, rising to great heights!</p><p></p><p>Dugu Ming met a tragic death on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli and he managed to avoid a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>However, the paths they chose were completely different.</p><p></p><p>He chose to leave the mountain and become an outer disciple of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>To put it nicely, he was part of the outer sect, no longer cultivating on the Sword Sect's sacred mountain, returning to his homeland instead.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect generally approved such requests.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect guarded the Sword Gate, cultivating the human race, in order to resist demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Sword Sect and learning their sword arts, if one had no hope of receiving the true transmission, a large portion of disciples would leave the mountain.</p><p></p><p>And Wu Shaojie was one of them!</p><p></p><p>"After the incident on the moon, Senior Brother Gao's fighting spirit was not extinguished. It was I who saw him off."</p><p></p><p>On that day, he left the mountain and returned to the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>As for Gao Shuli, he roamed the world, traveling through the nine states. After leaving the northern lands and entering the Green State, Wu Shaojie never heard from Gao Shuli again.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside Wu Shaojie let out a bitter laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gao was indeed worthy of being the young master of the Gao Family, undaunted by hardship. Perhaps in the future, Senior Brother Gao will be able to catch up to those who received the true transmission."</p><p></p><p>The woman had one empty sleeve - this was Xia Qingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Not long after returning from the moon, the Sword Sect's trial began.</p><p></p><p>The two of them chose to leave the mountain, which was how they reconnected.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou had joined the sect for less than a year and was still only at the Qi Refining Realm, but she had already lost her desire to pursue the path.</p><p></p><p>"How many have received the true transmission in the Sword Sect? Although Senior Brother Gao has lofty aspirations, he is still far inferior to those who received the true transmission."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Initially, after their journey to the moon ended, they had planned to leave the mountain and ask their families to follow Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>But after being attacked by demonic forces, they never entertained that idea again.</p><p></p><p>On the moon!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing battled the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>Even the elders in their families did not dare to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Follow Gu Jiuqing?</p><p></p><p>They were merely from great families, unworthy to follow Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou remained silent. She had witnessed Gu Jiuqing's rise step by step.</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Gate, there was a nine-day great examination.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing faced discrimination from the young disciples of the Ancient Heaven City.</p><p></p><p>However, in his youthful prime, standing out uniquely, he completed one metamorphosis after another within those nine days. He then comprehended a supreme sword intent, causing even the eccentric Senior Master to accept him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>"We thought too much of it. After returning to the northern lands, we won't see so many talented young masters, saving us the trouble."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou had let go of many things, having lost her ambition to compete long ago.</p><p></p><p>She extended her hand, pointing towards the riverbanks where some women were carrying basins, washing clothes by the shore.</p><p></p><p>"Life in the northern lands is actually not bad."</p><p></p><p>One of the women, squatting on the steps near the river, carefully examined a white outer garment she had picked up.</p><p></p><p>Scattered across this white garment were spots of blood stains.</p><p></p><p>It was essence blood!</p><p></p><p>The essence blood of cultivators, difficult to dissolve in water.</p><p></p><p>She looked up towards the upstream of the Polaris River, where numerous corpses were floating.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhh————————"</p><p></p><p>The woman let out a shrill scream.</p><p></p><p>Following her scream, buildings collapsed in the distance, and a bloody radiance swept across the land.</p><p></p><p>Numerous figures flew out from that bloody light!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Ancient City of Polaris fled in panic.</p><p></p><p>"Is someone attacking the Ancient City of Polaris?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie, a cultivator with a fully formed divine body at the peak of the Unitary Realm, had extraordinary perception.</p><p></p><p>With a single glance, he saw the terror of that bloody radiance.</p><p></p><p>One cultivator after another was devoured by the bloody light, leaving only bones and skin behind, falling within the city.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful experts of the ancient city took to the skies, trying to block the bloody light.</p><p></p><p>He saw an elder of the Wu Family at the Celestial Realm, along with several Refining Spirit experts, taking action!</p><p></p><p>But in a single exchange, the bloody light devoured them, and their white bones rained down from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this is the handiwork of demons!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the aura of demons.</p><p></p><p>This aura was exactly the same as the demonic aura he encountered on the moon.</p><p></p><p>There were demons inside the ancient city of the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>He was flustered and alarmed. "Junior Sister Xia, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Realm elders were no match for this bloody light.</p><p></p><p>Had some Catastrophe Realm celestial demon taken action?</p><p></p><p>Where were the Catastrophe Realm human elders of the ancient city?</p><p></p><p>Why had they not appeared yet?</p><p></p><p>"Retreat to the Ancient City of Southern Polaris!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie and Xia Qingzhou both thought of retreating to the Ancient City of Southern Polaris. Only by requesting aid from other ancient city forces could they suppress the demonic invasion.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two sword lights rose up and flew a few hundred meters, the space behind them rippled. Ancient auras erupted from the lord's manor of the Ancient City of Polaris, emanating the majestic pressure of a great force.</p><p></p><p>Divine might descended, and the ancient aura swept away one building after another. Even the Polaris River instantly evaporated.</p><p></p><p>A divine strike condensed, and a brilliant primordial light appeared!</p><p></p><p>It struck into the bloody light.</p><p></p><p>The two of them stopped simultaneously, gazing up at the heavens. They saw the primordial light penetrating the bloody light, causing numerous bloody rays to tremble. One bloody figure after another fell from within, ignoring the divine strike.</p><p></p><p>Although many small bloody figures perished and the bloody light dissipated somewhat, this strike did not significantly damage the bloody light.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, look beneath your feet!"</p><p></p><p>Below the ancient city, blood flowed like a river, the bloody stream spreading across the city, floating with white bones. Blood-formed humanoid figures rushed into buildings, flaying and dismembering the human inhabitants.</p><p></p><p>"The demons are performing a blood sacrifice on the Ancient City of Polaris!"</p><p></p><p>"How did they enter the northern lands?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie was terrified. He did not dare linger and immediately tried to escape on his sword aura.</p><p></p><p>However, the bloody light surged, having already devoured the entire Ancient City of Polaris.</p><p></p><p>Above their heads, a bloody tide towered, blotting out the heavens and earth. Refining Spirit cultivators and Celestial Realm True Men ascended, but the corpses of these experts kept falling, leaving only bare bones!!</p><p></p><p>Two bloody rays of light shot towards Xia Qingzhou and Wu Shaojie.</p><p></p><p>They were Blood Demon Scions!</p><p></p><p>Born from the Blood Sea Formation.</p><p></p><p>Whuuush————</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Scions swept past the two of them. Xia Qingzhou's aura instantly withered, losing half her vital energy and essence blood, rapidly aging. Her once youthful, delicate face became haggard, with strands of white hair appearing on her head.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Shaojie, his inner core and a large amount of essence blood dissipated, transforming him from a youthful appearance to that of a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>After draining their vital energy and essence blood, the two Blood Demon Scions grew much taller. They did not look back, continuing to charge forward.</p><p></p><p>And behind them, even more Blood Demon Scions were condensing.</p><p></p><p>Bloody figures enveloped the two of them!</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>A Catastrophe had descended upon the Ancient City of Polaris.</p><p></p><p>Demons were running rampant among the human race!</p><p></p><p>If there was a next life!</p><p></p><p>I, Wu Shaojie, will definitely strive to reach the pinnacle in that lifetime.</p><p></p><p>He had already left the mountain to escape the demonic chaos, but still died at the hands of demons.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling!!</p><p></p><p>Boom————————</p><p></p><p>The bloody light trembled, and that rippling radiance caused every Blood Demon Scion to halt, all of them looking up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>There, a massive arm descended from beyond the bloody tide, piercing through it.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Dharma Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Whose Dharma Realm was so colossal?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou, Wu Shaojie, and the surviving cultivators of the Ancient City of Polaris gazed upwards. In their pupils was reflected an enormous figure.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the azure heavens, extending a heaven-piercing arm down towards the Ancient City of Polaris.</p><p></p><p>The massive arm swept about, shaking the azure sky and tearing apart space. After penetrating the bloody light, he suddenly grabbed the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble!</p><p></p><p>The earth quaked and mountains trembled.</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath their feet shuddered. Trees swayed as the cultivators in the air felt spatial ripples.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire ancient city was lifted into the air.</p><p></p><p>The world transformed, the bloody light vanishing. Streams of blood flowed out from the city.</p><p></p><p>In a single breath, the Ancient City of Polaris appeared high in the sky, with a biting cold wind blowing through, yet the survivors did not feel cold.</p><p></p><p>Their faces only showed shock!</p><p></p><p>"That is...!"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, they saw the Ancient Cities of Purple Sun, Vast Heaven, Celestial Emperor, Renowned Name, Bright Moon, and the Desolate City!</p><p></p><p>Including the Ancient City of Polaris, seven ancient cities towered in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we are in..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"On that divine statue of a giant spanning the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"Inside the ancient city, there are only corpses everywhere!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie was greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the ancient cities of Ziyang and Taixu were desolate and lifeless, with only white bones and human skins remaining. </p><p></p><p>The rest of the ancient cities were the same!</p><p></p><p>Those six ancient cities had already been sacrificed by demons, with millions of people slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators and commoners inside the cities were all dead.</p><p></p><p>Even those from prestigious clans and families could not escape this calamity.</p><p></p><p>Trembling!</p><p></p><p>Horrified! </p><p></p><p>Terrified!</p><p></p><p>Furious!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of emotions arose one after another.</p><p></p><p>"The demons have massacred the northern lands, the demons have massacred the northern lands!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Sword Sect? Where is the Great Zhou Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Cries rang out within this ancient city.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"</p><p></p><p>Trembling sounds came from below, it was the giant walking on the earth.</p><p></p><p>This majestic giant carried seven ancient cities on his left shoulder. He stepped on the earth, leaving deep pits on the ground with each stride.</p><p></p><p>And above this giant, there was a divine disk shining with radiance!</p><p></p><p>It was only after a long time that the cultivators inside the ancient city of Beidu regained their senses.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving our lives!"  </p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>Voice after voice rang out!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie looked at the divine statue giant and felt a sense of familiarity!</p><p></p><p>This is...?!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"It's Gu Zhenzhuan from my Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shaojie blurted out, and Xia Qingzhou also recalled.</p><p></p><p>The giant strode across the northern lands, carrying seven major ancient cities on his shoulder, heading towards the ancient city of Nandou!</p><p></p><p>The thick bloody aura lingered behind the giant, a bloody ocean spreading and submerging the giant's knees in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing carried seven major ancient cities on his shoulders, his divine statue swaying, with sixty-three dragon and elephant kingdoms blooming, their majestic power boundless.  </p><p></p><p>His figure strode across the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>The ancient city of Nandou was the sixth ancient city in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the ancient city of Beidu!</p><p></p><p>The astonishing image spread across the heavens, and the bloody ocean poured down onto the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>One demon figure after another flew up into the sky, looking at this giant walking the northern lands, but none dared to stop him.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>With a horn on his head, four arms on his back, two arms on his chest, and demonic aura swirling around his feet.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were three demons at the Catastrophe Realm.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Gu Jiuqing strode through the bloody formation unhindered and unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>"Is he... trying to move all thirteen ancient cities in the northern lands?"</p><p></p><p>"The bloody formation has only sacrificed two million people, only half of the ritual is complete!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince looked up at the heavenly disk of life and death and moved, stepping into the void, trying to pluck down the disk.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly disk of life and death was the core of the formation.</p><p></p><p>With the heavenly disk of life and death suppressing the formation, the bloody formation could engulf the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands and refine them.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing directly moved the thirteen cities away, rendering the bloody formation ineffective, and the demonic lair could not form.</p><p></p><p>Only by killing Gu Jiuqing could they have a chance to re-condense the demonic lair.</p><p></p><p>"My father is still at the Sword Sect Pass, and apart from those two Trifecta Paragons, the Sword Sect has no more Pure Yang experts."</p><p></p><p>"He is isolated and without aid. Only by destroying him can the demonic lair still form in the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>Demonic aura swirled around as the Demon Prince ascended into the void, standing beside the heavenly disk of life and death.</p><p></p><p>The divine disk rippled, separating into layers of smaller disks.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Disk! The spinning disk scattered Xuanhuang aura.  </p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Disk!</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Disk!</p><p></p><p>The Four Symbols Disk!</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Disk!</p><p></p><p>Five smaller divine disks gathered beside the Disk of Life and Death. The six disks contained an invisible force that sealed the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince bowed towards the direction of the Sword Sect Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Father, your son needs to use the power of the heavenly disk of life and death to accomplish my demonic ambition!"</p><p></p><p>After bowing, the heavenly disk of life and death rippled, with rays of divine light spreading out. The five smaller disks merged into the Disk of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly disk of life and death took form at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince grabbed it.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, with the heavenly disk of life and death in my hands, you Sword Sect bastards will die quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's figure flickered, his Catastrophe Realm aura fully unleashed, with pure yang thoughts swirling in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>There were four pure yang thoughts, three of which merged into the heavenly disk of life and death to activate this powerful artifact!</p><p></p><p>One after another, the ancient paths were activated, and an ancient divine might descended.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's face was crazed.</p><p></p><p>He had crossed two tribulations and was a Bi-Catastrophe Human Demon.</p><p></p><p>But to quickly activate the heavenly disk of life and death, he had to burn pure yang thoughts!</p><p></p><p>After all, this great artifact did not belong to him.</p><p></p><p>"Wushala——————"</p><p></p><p>Divine might shook the heavens, entering the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>The bloody sea surged skyward, merging into one.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing turned to look at the heavenly disk of life and death above, sensing that it was activating.</p><p></p><p>If it were normal times, he might have tried to resist the divine strike with his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>But now, with seven ancient cities on his shoulders, the slightest carelessness could cause them to crumble apart.</p><p></p><p>The people in the ancient city of Beidu would also perish.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ancient city of Nandou below!</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, blood filled the sky, and the bloody sea had already invaded the city walls.</p><p></p><p>Inside the city, people had already died, and the Blood Demon Child was transforming.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched out his hand and pulled up the ancient city of Nandou.</p><p></p><p>The entire ancient city shook, and the cultivators inside flew out, staring in a daze at the giant divine statue that had uprooted their city!!</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Sect Pass!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's divine mountain formation had already activated, with three sword furnaces hanging at the peak of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Palace Sword Furnace from Mingtingfeng had become a celestial palace, emanating strands of divine might and sword aura that pierced the void.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Sword Furnace from the Sword Tomb released five rays of elemental light that formed five divine swords, accompanying the furnace. It was engraved with the images of mountains and rivers derived from the primordial five elements.</p><p></p><p>The third furnace, the Celestial Sword Furnace, descended from the Sword Peak, condensed by the Sword Sect's Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The three great sword furnaces hung high in the heavens, their terrifying sword aura pressure unfolding between heaven and earth, surging towards the wilderness outside the Sword Sect Pass.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sword Sect, numerous disciples stood in strict formation, each sword cultivator holding a divine sword.</p><p></p><p>Whether outer sect disciples, inner sect disciples, or elders and peak lords, they all stared fixedly at the passage of the Sword Sect Pass.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Pass was a lone path lined with numerous killing formations to prevent demons from passing through.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, several figures stood below the Sword Sect Pass.</p><p></p><p>These were four demons enveloped in demonic aura, walking below the Sword Sect Pass as if on flat ground.</p><p></p><p>With each step, they did not trigger the formations of the Sword Sect Pass; instead, those formations self-destructed wherever they passed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the formations along the passage of the Sword Sect Pass were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to take one more step forward to enter the human realm.</p><p></p><p>They stood at the boundary, facing the two Sword Sect Immortal Cultivators from afar.</p><p></p><p>"I'm truly delighted to see you two undying oldsters again."</p><p></p><p>Of the four demons, the first one with a horn on his head, a handsome male, was the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Sealed Immortal and the Second Elder with a smile on his face, showing no demonic intent.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when the Primordial Sword Immortal died, I thought you two had also perished."</p><p></p><p>The Sealed Immortal's body flickered!</p><p></p><p>One ray of divine light after another bloomed on his body. In an instant, his pure yang radiance rippled around him.</p><p></p><p>His spirit, flesh, and spiritual power were all pure yang, using the pure yang brilliance to dispel the aura of age. The old body disappeared, leaving only a young and vigorous paragon standing before the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign's expression changed!</p><p></p><p>"You undying old bastard, you've recovered your peak cultivation so quickly. Are you eager to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, the Sealed Immortal had already suffered severe injuries. For three thousand years, he had secluded himself to heal his wounds and expel the demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang was flawed, and the Trifecta had gaps!</p><p></p><p>Now, with his pure yang flesh, pure yang spiritual power, and pure yang spirit, he had sealed the flaws and regained his peak strength.</p><p></p><p>This was the path of seeking death!</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why can't you just wait a bit longer?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Sword Sect's Patriarch has already come out of seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign did not want to take action at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for the formation of the demonic lair.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for Jiang Xingxun's emergence.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The aura on the Demon Sovereign's body stirred, and a true intent dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The two Trifecta Paragons of the Sword Sect sensed it, their divine eyes piercing the vast sky, four rays of divine light illuminating the northern lands, instantly seeing the heavenly disk of life and death!</p><p></p><p>Have they been discovered?</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter anymore.</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Sovereigns could easily block the three sword furnaces and the two Trifecta Paragons.</p><p></p><p>He was also curious to look towards the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>His second son actually wanted to borrow the heavenly disk of life and death to suppress a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the two Celestial Immortals, did the Sword Sect have another Pure Yang Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>When he saw that figure in the northern lands, the Demon Sovereign frowned.</p><p></p><p>A tremor arose within him!</p><p></p><p>It was that young divine lord!</p><p></p><p>That young celestial emperor.</p><p></p><p>His profound eyes flashed, piercing the universe. A voice transmitted from the northern lands into the Sword Sect Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"We finally meet again!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm very curious, why does your second son think he can challenge me just by holding the heavenly disk of life and death?"</p><p></p><p>"Or do you really think I, Gu Jiuqing, am that weak in your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the giant divine statue carrying eight ancient cities on his shoulders moved, striding towards the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>He was going to slay the Demon Prince's son right before the Demon Sovereign's eyes!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters, one chapter today.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

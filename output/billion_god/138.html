        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wilderness, Thunder Valley. </p><p></p><p>A white cloud, riding below the thunder valley, with flashes of lightning and ripples of azure patterns below, unable to harm it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Before the eyes of the old Daoist and Senior Brother Liang Xiao, this mirror image of the Moon Divine Ship exploded, countless divine lights flashing, even causing ripples on the mirror's surface. </p><p></p><p>In the end, only an old ancestor draped in pure yang radiance remained standing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Divine Ship was shattered into pieces, Elder Qu turned to ashes without leaving any remains. </p><p></p><p>Everything on the ship disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The radiance transformed into a flying sword, spanning heaven and earth. The pure yang old ancestor searched for any remnants in this realm, only withdrawing his hand after a long time.</p><p></p><p>The void was shattered, pure yang aura surging.  </p><p></p><p>He was handling the aftermath!</p><p></p><p>"Quite cautious."</p><p></p><p>In Senior Brother Liang Xiao's eyes, after this pure yang old ancestor's divine power evaporated the heavens and earth, and the pure yang aura swept through the void several times, he finally left this place.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, the one you called Si Wuxie was quite remarkable, it's just a pity he fell in this place."</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist continued looking towards Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Princess Chengxiao was a woman, unable to inherit his Dao lineage.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist beheaded three corpses, using Chan, Jie, and Tai as the three Celestial Venerables for the three corpses. Now, he felt his own divine transcendence was imminent.</p><p></p><p>He also took in a fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>But this fourth disciple seemed far from reaching the level of single-handedly suppressing the world in the present age.</p><p></p><p>So the old Daoist came down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>He came to see Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Of all the talents in the world, only four had caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>Now only the brother and sister of the Gu family remained.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong! Praised by Si Wuxie as the future number one in the world.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Jiuqing was the one praised by himself as the future number one in the world.</p><p></p><p>His junior brother's talent was unmatched, the future number one, while he as the senior brother was above his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>But he dared not say it before the Dao ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on the mirror's surface, the void stirred, the shattered heaven and earth reorganized, the crushed vacuum condensed together, reforming the world.</p><p></p><p>In this void world, a figure walked out from within.</p><p></p><p>A yellow-robed youth, treading on the void, his expression indifferent, his hands empty, standing in the void, gazing at the surrounding cosmos, before his eyes rested on the void.</p><p></p><p>That was the direction Senior Brother Liang Xiao was looking towards.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a faint smile, as if greeting Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ripples in the void, the youth's figure stepped down, one step at a time entering the land of Zhangzhou, disappearing into the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The mirror also dissipated!</p><p></p><p>"It seems he discovered us?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao dared not confirm.</p><p></p><p>This was the heavenly secret personally probed by the old Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Previously, even when three supreme experts probed him in the Great Wilderness, Senior Brother Liang Xiao could not sense it.</p><p></p><p>And the old Daoist was far more powerful than those three supreme experts combined.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful expert, even if he stood right in front of Senior Brother Liang Xiao, he might not be able to detect him.</p><p></p><p>But Si Wuxie was actually able to perceive them??</p><p></p><p>And even greeted them?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, interesting, interesting!"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist laughed, his words full of praise.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, after I ascend, this child can take over guarding the Great Wilderness for me!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao felt greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie had caught the old Daoist's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you wish to ascend? Rather than establishing a heavenly court in the Great Wilderness and founding an imperial dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao was astonished.</p><p></p><p>This old Daoist before him actually wanted to ascend? Rather than emulating the ancient Celestial Emperors by creating a heavenly court and overseeing the cycle of reincarnation?</p><p></p><p>What a grand ambition, the dream of countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And for this old Daoist, that dream was only half a step away.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he wished to establish a heavenly court at this moment, he would have an eighty percent chance of success.</p><p></p><p>"Your perspective is too small."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao was told his perspective was too small by the old Daoist, and he did not dare refute, only nodding in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist stood up and walked down step by step from the clouds, heading towards the mountain's foot.</p><p></p><p>"The eighteen ancient Celestial Emperors were merely a group of cowards. Achieving the position of a Celestial Emperor and overseeing the cycle of reincarnation? That's still not daring to fly out of the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>"Above the Great Wilderness, there are still the heavens, the celestial realms, the divine realms! If this old Daoist becomes a deity, I shall ascend to those higher realms!"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist was currently the number one in the world.</p><p></p><p>His talent, his brilliance, shook the ancient and the present.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that in recent times, the path to divinity was blocked. Otherwise, with his talent, he would have long become a deity!</p><p></p><p>But now, his path to divinity was unblocked. The recent era would soon welcome its first deity!</p><p></p><p>He would attain divinity, fly out of the Great Wilderness. He would venture to even vaster realms to verify his own studies!</p><p></p><p>This number one genius in the world had soaring ambitions like a great roc.</p><p></p><p>So many cultivators in the past had attained divinity, but none of them dared to ascend.</p><p></p><p>One Celestial Emperor after another, establishing heavenly courts, unifying the Great Wilderness, enjoying supremacy, but ascend?</p><p></p><p>That would require starting all over again.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao gazed at the Dao ancestor's figure, feeling moved.</p><p></p><p>"I am a peerless genius, but others are the same!"</p><p></p><p>He stood on the white clouds, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Dao ancestor step by step climbing the mountain peak, Senior Brother Liang Xiao finally asked:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, if I inform the Sword Sect of this matter, will you allow me to leave?"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist came down the mountain to meet Senior Brother Liang Xiao, then triggered the heavenly mechanism to probe Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>Next, the old Daoist revealed his intentions!</p><p></p><p>There were profound lessons in all that transpired here.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist took action against the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Those two pure yang elders, one was the greatly wise Bodhisattva, and the other was a Celestial Venerable of the Dao Sect!!</p><p></p><p>If he made this matter public to the world, the Dao ancestor's prestige would be damaged.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist did not respond, having already ascended the mountain peak and entered the Dao monastery.</p><p></p><p>Worldly matters were to him but a gentle breeze caressing his face, fleeting clouds.</p><p></p><p>Had he not wished to see Jiang Xingxun, he would not have come down the mountain to meet Jiang Buyu.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao monastery, an old Daoist sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buyu is not Jiang Xingxun, what a pity. There is only one Jiang Xingxun in this world!"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, seeing no movement from the Dao monastery, Senior Brother Liang Xiao finally stepped down from the white clouds.</p><p></p><p>He did not leave Thunder Valley, but continued staying deep within.</p><p></p><p>The Dao ancestor allowing him to leave meant the Dao ancestor had made full preparations.</p><p></p><p>An eight-tribulation celestial being, a nine-tribulation celestial being, could not disrupt the Dao ancestor's plans.</p><p></p><p>A sword aura spanned the sky, Lu Yuan, a Refining Spirit cultivator, had seven of his celestial apertures opened with the help of the eight-phase elders, rapidly increasing his cultivation in recent days.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's movement speed while flying with his sword also became much faster.</p><p></p><p>Sword aura spanning several zhang cut through the heavens as he flew across Zhangzhou!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, we're about to fly out of Zhangzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Zhangzhou was connected to Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the miasma of Zhangzhou, Yuzhou had auspicious spiritual energy. One could see a clear and bright aura in the distance.</p><p></p><p>There were many more cities than Zhangzhou, with merchants and horse caravans even traveling on the official roads.</p><p></p><p>To reach Qingzhou from Yuzhou, one had to pass through Junzhou first.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely long journey!</p><p></p><p>Behind the sword aura spanning several zhang, the blue-robed youth responded, "Keep flying!"</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou Prefecture is not far from the Great Zhou Divine Capital, so it won't be easy for assassins to set an ambush there."</p><p></p><p>"We may encounter our first ambush after reaching Junzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's words shook Lu Yuan, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He would get to witness his senior brother's peerless prowess again.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword's speed increased greatly!</p><p></p><p>Seven major celestial apertures opened, absorbing starlight at night to refine into spiritual power, traversing across the great states!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had also considered roaming the world in spirit form.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly dismissed the idea himself.</p><p></p><p>Roaming in spirit form meant separating one's spirit from the physical body.</p><p></p><p>To travel such a vast distance, he would first need to divide his spirit, stretching it back to the Sword Sect! His thirty-zhang spirit could not withstand that.</p><p></p><p>There was another problem!</p><p></p><p>Roaming in spirit form allowed free movement within the Six Realms and even the Ancient Celestial Mountains, as restrictions could not bind the spirit form.</p><p></p><p>But what about sealed spatial rifts?</p><p></p><p>On the sword aura, Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts flowed and rippled within his Mind Protecting Palace.</p><p></p><p>And on his Buzhou Mountain, there were now sixty-five Celestial Weapon Pearls.</p><p></p><p>These Celestial Weapon Pearls each had their own names, but Gu Jiuqing found it too troublesome, so he used numbers like Celestial Weapon Pearl Number One, Number Two, Number Three, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Each Celestial Weapon Pearl rippled on the peak of Buzhou Mountain, emitting brilliant rays of starlight that illuminated the entire mountain.</p><p></p><p>A single divine weapon could suppress the force of a hundred thousand dragons and elephants. These sixty-five added up to the power of six million five hundred thousand dragons!</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Jiuqing had been refining these divine weapons, using his spiritual power, blood essence, spirit, and origin to constantly wash over them, imprinting his aura onto the Celestial Weapon Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Time passed bit by bit, and Lu Yuan's path-opening flight did not encounter any obstructions.</p><p></p><p>The vast expanse of heaven and earth, the sword aura spanning the sky, two figures crossed Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>After another two days, just as they were about to leave Yuzhou's border and enter Junzhou, ripples appeared on the sword insignias on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Someone was summoning Sword Sect disciples!</p><p></p><p>The sword aura shifted direction, descending towards the land below.</p><p></p><p>Mountain ranges rose and fell, a vast azure sword stood among these towering peaks.</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou and Junzhou are connected by a strategic pass called Zhendou Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Passing through Zhendou Pass leads directly to either Yuzhou or Junzhou. This place is always heavily guarded, and the commander overseeing Zhendou Pass is said to have come from our Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked at the vast azure sword, recalling his memories.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, Zhendou Pass was controlled by an ancient longevity clan. To seize this strategic pass, the prefectural lords of the two states wiped out the ancient clan."</p><p></p><p>"But they missed a child from that clan."</p><p></p><p>This child of the ancient clan later joined the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The azure sword spanned the sky, challenging the heavens. It was woven from sword aura, spanning over ten thousand zhang, covering heaven and earth. One could see this divine sword from hundreds of miles around.</p><p></p><p>Below the vast divine sword was Zhendou Pass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan flew towards the divine sword, soon catching sight of a walled city nestled among the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the mountain ranges, around the ancient city, the miasmic and pure energies intertwined, forming an even denser poisonous mist. </p><p></p><p>At the city gates, there were large armies standing guard. Traveling merchants found it unsurprising, entering and exiting the city gates freely.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan landed on the ground, the heavenly sword sensed it and a sword aura spanned across heaven and earth, transforming into a flying sword that landed in front of Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A lingering voice sounded, "Could it be disciples of the Sword Sect have arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is us!"</p><p></p><p>The sword aura transformed into a divine bridge, guiding the two forward.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the towering divine sword, pondered for a moment, then stepped forward, following the divine bridge into the Zhendu Pass.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Great Zhou armies saw this but treated it as if they did not, allowing the two to enter.</p><p></p><p>Zhendu Pass, the Celestial City.</p><p></p><p>Above the pass, there was a small city, no more than one-tenth the size of the ancient Zhendu City.</p><p></p><p>This was now the cultivation grounds of the ancient tribe, also a celestial realm known as the Celestial Illusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the celestial realm, several Sword Sect disciples were already waiting. Upon seeing Gu Jiuqing, they exclaimed joyfully, "Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>These were four of the twenty-one sword immortals who had flown out from the Moon Divine Ship, arriving at Zhendu Pass ahead of Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the sword path's foremost expert of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator walked out from the celestial realm. </p><p></p><p>He carried a large bronze sword on his back, his body sturdy, more resembling a body cultivator than a sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>He laughed heartily, "When I joined the Sword Sect back then, there were only eight peaks. Later, Wu Quandao from my lineage cultivated to the catastrophe realm but did not inherit Shanhe Peak. Instead, he opened a new peak, thus creating Manhuang Peak."</p><p></p><p>The peak master of Manhuang Peak, Wu Quandao, was from the same generation as this ancient sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "If I had stayed in the Sword Sect back then, the tenth peak should have been pioneered by me."</p><p></p><p>He and Wu Quandao both came from Shanhe Peak!</p><p></p><p>One cultivated in seclusion to open a new peak, while the other left to battle at Zhendu Pass, regaining the ancient tribe's glory.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Uncle!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed respectfully to the ancient sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, good, good nephew!"</p><p></p><p>"You little fellow are indeed capable."</p><p></p><p>"I reckon the White Jade Peak Master must have concealed the sword embryo within your spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>The aura around Gu Jiuqing was obscure, concealed by starlight, making his true cultivation level indiscernible. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not refute it, implicitly admitting to it.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, you need not worry. Once past Zhendu Pass, it will be Junzhou territory!"</p><p></p><p>"The governor of Junzhou Prefecture in the nine prefectures owes me a life. When you travel through Junzhou, that governor will definitely lend a hand!"</p><p></p><p>"If you reach Qingzhou, you'll be even closer to the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"With your sword aura spanning the vast sky and refining your sword intent, you may even rouse the three sword furnaces of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient sword cultivator was devising strategies for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also shared his perspective, "With the sword embryo in my possession, those lying in ambush to assassinate me will surely come after me!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingzhou is too close to the Sword Sect. The assassins dare not approach the sect, they will definitely make their move in Junzhou!"</p><p></p><p>"There is no time to waste, I ask Senior Martial Uncle to let me proceed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing knew the assassination was related to the Buddhist and Daoist sects, so he did not fully trust this ancient sword immortal either.  </p><p></p><p>He did not even trust the four sword immortals in the Celestial City.</p><p></p><p>"Well said, well said. Since you wish to leave Zhendu Pass now, I shall naturally let you proceed."  </p><p></p><p>"But if you stay in Zhendu Pass, I will protect your life!"</p><p></p><p>Zhendu Pass! </p><p></p><p>His word carried weight here!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Senior Martial Uncle." </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed again to the ancient sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>The other four sword immortals remained silent. Knowing the sword embryo was with Gu Jiuqing, they felt relieved to stay in Zhendu Pass to preserve their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Please be careful, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The four sword immortals had pinned all their hopes on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Come, I shall personally escort you out of Zhendu Pass!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient sword immortal shouldered the large bronze sword, treading through the void and descending from the Celestial City.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>Halfway through, they could already see the city gate of Zhendu Pass leading to Junzhou when an aura suddenly manifested, standing amidst the miasma outside!</p><p></p><p>It was a catastrophe realm celestial being who had been lying in ambush outside Zhendu Pass for a long time!</p><p></p><p>"So the sword embryo is indeed concealed within you!"</p><p></p><p>The catastrophe celestial's voice echoed through Zhendu Pass. In an instant, the armies inside and outside the city assembled, their ominous aura rising to the heavens and forming a ominous divine soldier that suppressed Zhendu Pass.</p><p></p><p>But that catastrophe celestial ignored the Great Zhou armies, stepping down from the miasma and landing above Zhendu Pass, facing the ancient sword immortal from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yaoguang! I've heard of you. Over a thousand years ago, you fled from Yuzhou and met the Sword Sect peak master in Qingzhou, joining the sect then!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, your ancient tribe has controlled Zhendu Pass for many years. Don't waste all that hard work."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect helped you!</p><p></p><p>But you should also consider your family.</p><p></p><p>The catastrophe celestial stood with his face covered, enveloped by a pure yang aura. </p><p></p><p>Above his head, a pure yang thought manifested as a celestial canopy, enshrouding his body.</p><p></p><p>His true identity could not be discerned.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yaoguang smiled faintly, "Had the Shanhe Peak Master not saved me back then, I would have died long ago. In this battle, I can only seek death in return!"</p><p></p><p>"You leave the city, this place will be left to Senior Martial Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yaoguang stepped into the void, the large bronze sword on his back flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Uncle, the Shanhe Peak Master has died, sacrificing himself along with the Celestial Snow Peak Master and the Nine Yang Peak Master in Zhangzhou."</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing said this, he did not linger.  </p><p></p><p>This time, the Sword Sect was facing a great catastrophe, and many would die!</p><p></p><p>He was already prepared for it.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yaoguang's void shattered, and the bronze sword swept horizontally, his catastrophe realm aura erupting.</p><p></p><p>Streams of thoughts flowed, instantly forming a miniature pure yang spirit body!</p><p></p><p>A fourth catastrophe celestial could manifest a pure yang spirit body!</p><p></p><p>The masked catastrophe celestial glared fiercely at Gu Jiuqing upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>With the Shanhe Peak Master killed, Gu Yaoguang's determination to die had reached its peak!</p><p></p><p>This became rather troublesome!</p><p></p><p>The catastrophe celestial's aura surged, pure yang energies refining as streams of thoughts surrounded him, also forming a pure yang spirit body.</p><p></p><p>It was a spirit body composed of two hundred and fifty-six pure yang thoughts!!</p><p></p><p>"A ninth catastrophe celestial!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure transformed into a rainbow, fleeing with Lu Yuan out of Zhendu Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The great battle erupted. Zhendu Pass shook as the ominous divine soldier formed by the Great Zhou armies suppressed the surroundings, preventing the city from crumbling.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, the Great Zhou armies did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>They dared not intervene!</p><p></p><p>Sword auras swept across heaven and earth as the two flew out of Zhendu Pass, stepping into Junzhou territory.</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn fool, by revealing that you concealed the sword embryo, you cannot possibly reach the Sword Sect alive!" </p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder's voice came from Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Does the senior have any insights to share?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"I know your intention. By revealing that you concealed the sword embryo, those lying in ambush to assassinate will focus their efforts on you, allowing the real person hiding the sword embryo to escape."</p><p></p><p>"But did you know that two pure yang elders appeared above Zhangzhou Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed the pure yang elders had their pure yang auras shattered by the Moon Divine Ship's strike, revealing their Buddha nature.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you, there were actually other pure yang elders lying in ambush!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled, "Then why did we not see a third pure yang elder appear?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's arrogance, the Eight Trigrams Elder instead laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, do you think you're some great figure? In need of three pure yang elders to assassinate you?"</p><p></p><p>"You should understand, this assassination is targeting the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Not you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression remained calm as he secretly and swiftly refined star pearl after star pearl.</p><p></p><p>Though not as fast as the divine weapons given to him by Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao, allowing direct refinement, it was still much quicker than imprinting his aura on ordinary divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>In these past two days, he had already refined thirty divine weapons. With three to four more days, he could refine all sixty-five divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Not me! That's why I can convey the message to the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"But have you considered that they deliberately want you to deliver this message to the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>"Deliberately? Then why ambush us halfway?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Not ambushing you, but trying to kill you all, to lure out Jiang Xingcun."</p><p></p><p>"Whether you deliver the message to the Sword Sect or not is irrelevant to them."</p><p></p><p>"What they want is the deaths of the wandering Sword Sect disciples! Only by killing so many can they force Jiang Xingcun to leave the sect!"</p><p></p><p>This was the true purpose behind assassinating for the sword embryo.</p><p></p><p>"You mean those three pure yang elders are assassinating the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Not three, at least four, and the fourth must be a three-in-one! Otherwise, just two pure yang elders plus a three-in-one would not be qualified enough!"</p><p></p><p>Even the Eight Trigrams Elder was shaken.  </p><p></p><p>Such an assassination force was too formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Then if I deliver this message to the Sword Sect ahead of time and request the Sect Master to emerge, it could reduce the number of sect disciples killed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not slow down, continuing to fly across the world.</p><p></p><p>There were many wandering Sword Sect disciples, not just the twenty-one sword immortals from Youzhou Prefecture, but also numerous inner sect disciples!</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, do as you wish."</p><p></p><p>"Treacherous villain, I want to see how your martial uncle will resolve this catastrophe!"</p>

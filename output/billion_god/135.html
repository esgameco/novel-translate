        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivator Jianzi was ambushed, suspected to be the work of the Chunyang Ancestral Master. </p><p></p><p>This matter is too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>Jianzi is the future Sword Sect's supreme leader. It would be like the Dao cultivator, the Celestial Maiden of Stars, or the Prince of Zhou being ambushed.</p><p></p><p>Who dares to provoke such outrage in the world? </p><p></p><p>Are they not afraid of provoking the wrath of the three-in-one Communicators?</p><p></p><p>Inside the thatched hut, the four Peak Masters analyzed the situation, but could not deduce any clues.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if we can't figure it out, then let's not dwell on it!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll take Jianzi back to the Sword Sect now. With the four of us Catastrophe-realm celestials protecting him, plus twenty Sword Immortals, I'd like to see who dares make a move!"</p><p></p><p>"If the Chunyang Ancestral Master cannot kill us all in one strike, I will request the Sect Master to come out of seclusion and wipe out the forces behind this Chunyang Ancestral Master!"</p><p></p><p>This Peak Master had a fiery temper and could not help but curse loudly.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu tried to calm the Jiuyang Peak Master down.</p><p></p><p>"This may have been an accident, but we cannot be careless either."</p><p></p><p>Whoever dared to ambush Jianzi must have made full preparations!</p><p></p><p>That is an outright challenge to the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Jianzi's ambush must be related to the other three sects or the Great Zhou Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Without the backing of the three sects or Great Zhou, not just the Chunyang Ancestral Master, even two or three Communicators would not dare to do such a thing!</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing heard this, he spoke about his encounter with the demon at the Dafeng Clan, but hid the fact that he had obtained the future Dao Body.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect this has to do with the other three sects, otherwise how could demons enter the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters did not seem surprised upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Jiuyang Peak Master even said, "Gu Jiuqing, you have only recently joined the Sword Sect and are unaware of many things."</p><p></p><p>"Such as the appearance of demons in the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "We all knew about this matter. It was the doing of the Dao Sect and Buddhist Sect."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sect and Buddhist Sect?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's confusion, the Jiuyang Peak Master explained further.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist Sect and Dao Sect are vying for territory in the Nine Provinces of the Great Zhou. They both want to spread their teachings in the Nine Provinces, using this opportunity to forge the Path of Communication through faith and incense offerings from the people."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerable Path of the Dao Sect and the Buddha Path of the Buddhist Sect can only succeed by relying on the people of the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>The Jiuyang Peak Master's words greatly shocked Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He could not believe that the Dao Sect and Buddhist Sect would deliberately release demons into the Nine Provinces and slaughter the people, all for the sake of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He had always thought the pillars of the three sects were merely misguided by demons, never imagining the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor were involved.</p><p></p><p>The three Heavenly Venerables of the Dao Sect - the Sectional Heavenly Venerable, Expounding Heavenly Venerable, and Supreme Heavenly Venerable - were establishing Dao monasteries in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The Past Buddha and Present Buddha of the Buddhist Sect were building Buddhist temples, while the four great Bodhisattvas were also recently propagating teachings, leading to more and more Bodhisattva temples being built.</p><p></p><p>"I'm worried that Jianzi's ambush may be related to the three sects!"</p><p></p><p>If it is related, then which of the three sects is involved?</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters fell silent. </p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples also remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also sensed the difficulty of this matter.</p><p></p><p>A divine voice then transmitted into his ear - it was the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master.</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one, you can still leave now."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master could not help but say, "You should leave quickly. The death of Sword Primordial three thousand years ago was related to the Buddhist and Dao Sects. Now that Jianzi of your Sword Sect has been ambushed by the Chunyang Ancestral Master, it is most likely the doing of the Buddha and Dao Ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood still, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>"These Sword Sect elders are too inexperienced. Three thousand years ago, almost all the Sword Sect elders died. Nowadays in the Sword Sect, apart from those two three-in-one Communicators and Jiang Xingchun, there are no other Chunyang Ancestral Masters!"</p><p></p><p>"I can confirm that the Buddha and Dao Ancestors are involved this time, likely with the aim of forcing your Sect Master out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Force the Sword Sect Master out of seclusion?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was a true disciple of the Sword Sect, his level far from reaching that of a Chunyang Ancestral Master, let alone a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master was a two-in-one Ancestral Master who had seen many three-in-one experts.</p><p></p><p>His perspective was not far from that of a three-in-one Communicator.</p><p></p><p>So he could see through the essence of this matter and understand the schemes of the Buddhist and Dao Sects.</p><p></p><p>"Your Sword Sect's current supreme leader is too accomplished. Three thousand years ago, he crossed the nine levels of thunder tribulation in a single day and became a three-in-one being. Such an achievement makes the Dao and Buddha Ancestors apprehensive."</p><p></p><p>"And Jiang Xiaoyou has been sealed by Jiang Xingchun for over a thousand years now. They are afraid that this supreme Sect Master who has been in seclusion for so long will become a deity upon breaking through!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master explained the situation very clearly.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, few could truly see through it.</p><p></p><p>These few Peak Masters could not understand it either.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to inform the Peak Masters, but the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master transmitted again.</p><p></p><p>"It's no use telling them. A single Chunyang Ancestral Master could force you all to the brink of death."</p><p></p><p>"However, they would not kill you all."</p><p></p><p>"If you all died on the way back to the Sword Sect, then the Sect Master would have no need to come out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>But some Sword Sect disciples would inevitably die on this journey!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master was worried that Gu Jiuqing might die on this trip.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing died, it did not matter much. But Lu Yuan could not die.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had to follow Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>In the Mud Pill Palace, Lu Yuan's spiritual sense manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there's no need to tell Senior Brother about this."</p><p></p><p>"You've seen Senior Brother's abilities. In the future, he will definitely become a deity and establish the strongest heavenly court in all of history. Although I don't know how powerful the Buddha and Dao Ancestors are, they have taken such lofty titles, putting them in conflict with the Heavenly Emperor."</p><p></p><p>So the Heavenly Emperor will definitely suppress these two three-in-one Communicators.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha Ancestor is fine!</p><p></p><p>But the Dao Ancestor is different. As the Ancestral Patriarch of All Paths, wouldn't even the Heavenly Court have to submit to the Dao Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestral Master did not refute Lu Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>On this journey, he had been proven wrong too many times. This time, he finally learned his lesson. A different kind of hope arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps!</p><p></p><p>This stubborn one could really defy heaven and earth, defy the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor!!</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters helped Jianzi recover from his injuries. An hour later, the Sword Sect's Sword Immortals set out from the Sheep Village with Jianzi.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of sword lights swept across the heavens, with the four Peak Masters leading the way.  </p><p></p><p>Four sword auras over a hundred zhang wide radiated sword intent, demonstrating the might of the Sword Sect's departure.</p><p></p><p>Behind the four Sword Immortal Peak Masters were rank after rank of Sword Immortals - twenty in total escorting Jianzi!</p><p></p><p>Such a formation quickly alarmed the entire Youzhou region, with many cultivators witnessing the Sword Sect's Sword Immortals traversing the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Sword Immortals are crossing Youzhou! They're heading from the direction of the ancient ruins towards Youzhou Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Sword Sect has deployed twenty Sword Immortals and four Catastrophe-realm celestials!"</p><p></p><p>"So many Sword Sect Immortals? What are they up to?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, news spread throughout the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>"Apparently Jianzi of the Sword Sect was ambushed, and now the Sword Sect's Sword Immortals are escorting him back to the sect?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Someone dared to ambush Jianzi?</p><p></p><p>In this world, who would have such audacity?</p><p></p><p>The undercurrents in Youzhou began to stir, with many cultivators fixing their gazes on the Sword Sect's Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>However, the ancient divine fruit within the Great Longevity Immortal's tomb did not receive as much attention.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Sword Immortals are heading towards Youzhou Prefecture, likely to use the teleportation array there to reach Qingzhou Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingzhou is closest to the Northern Lands. Once they pass through this ancient teleportation array, they can enter the Northern Lands!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, news came from Youzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial-realm Ancestral Master went berserk and destroyed all the teleportation arrays in Youzhou Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>A Celestial-realm Ancestral Master going berserk at this moment?</p><p></p><p>Deliberately sabotaging Youzhou Prefecture's teleportation arrays - even a fool could tell this was targeting the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of sword aura swept across the heavens, passing over Youzhou Prefecture without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood on the sword aura, looking down at Youzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortals around him frowned deeply!</p><p></p><p>They had originally planned to use Youzhou Prefecture's teleportation array, but now that it was destroyed, staying in Youzhou Prefecture would only waste time.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sect disciples, listen up!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu gave the order from the front!</p><p></p><p>"Since Youzhou Prefecture's teleportation array is destroyed, it seems we'll have to traverse the Nine Provinces this time - passing through Youzhou, Zhangzhou, Yuzhou, Junzhou Prefecture, before finally entering Qingzhou's territory."</p><p></p><p>Crossing five provinces to reach the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>It was not that they did not want to use other teleportation arrays, but if the enemy dared to destroy even Youzhou Prefecture's array, they would naturally sabotage the others as well.</p><p></p><p>Let's go!</p><p></p><p>Using teleportation arrays was unsafe. A Chunyang Ancestral Master could lock onto the void, travel the cosmos with their celestial spirit, and even dig people out from within the arrays!</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"  </p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples acknowledged the order, streaks of sword light crossing the sky towards Zhangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Their destination was Zhangzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters were going to test their luck and see if they could use Zhangzhou Prefecture's ancient teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Wuxiu doesn't seem worried at all."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards Si Wuxiu beside him.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the mountain, this was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing first encountered Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Si Wuxie appeared calm and composed, with a serene expression.  </p><p></p><p>To him, this seemed like a casual outing, without any worries, and he didn't seem concerned that someone might ambush the sword disciples again.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie looked at Gu Jiuqing, staring into his eyes and nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Senior Martial Brother Gu has gained a lot from being on the moon."  </p><p></p><p>"However, with the sword disciples being ambushed this time, Senior Martial Brother Gu should be careful, lest you fall in this great calamity."</p><p></p><p>There was an implied meaning in his words, making it difficult for Gu Jiuqing to decipher.</p><p></p><p>This was Si Wuxie's way of speaking.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie's expression was calm as he looked at the surrounding mountain scenery with an enchanted look.</p><p></p><p>Beneath his feet, sword auras swirled - the five elemental sword auras of metal, wood, water, fire and earth rippled.</p><p></p><p>A great calamity?</p><p></p><p>The sword disciples were ambushed, turning it into a great calamity?</p><p></p><p>The information revealed in Si Wuxie's words was extensive.  </p><p></p><p>He was the paramount sword master - would the person ambushing the sword disciples even dare to kill him?</p><p></p><p>Or would those escorting the sword disciples back to the sect also be ambushed?</p><p></p><p>Yet they had flown all the way from Youzhou and were about to reach the borders of Zhangzhou without encountering any crisis.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding mountains encircled them, spanning the sky as they entered Zhangzhou territory. </p><p></p><p>The Zhangzhou region was different from Youzhou.</p><p></p><p>Although there were many mountain ranges below, most were surrounded by miasma. The areas where the miasma had dissipated were where the people of Zhangzhou lived.</p><p></p><p>Ancient cities appeared one by one below them.</p><p></p><p>"Zhangzhou, miasma...this miasma is really troublesome. Even after so long, this place is still plagued by it."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie looked down at Zhangzhou and remarked.</p><p></p><p>Sword auras crisscrossed in the air, two streaks moving left and right.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Wuxie, compared to ominous auras, this miasma should be much less troublesome, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Ominous auras?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie looked at Gu Jiuqing, and his gaze fell on the two red hairs on Gu's palm.</p><p></p><p>The two red hairs were eye-catching. He smiled faintly, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>"Miasma is just the pollution between heaven and earth, how could it compare to the aura of the ancient demon god Bi Fang?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient demon god! </p><p></p><p>Bi Fang!</p><p></p><p>That demon god suppressed under Tiangu Mountain, the one that only existed in ancient legends, had actually manifested in reality?</p><p></p><p>"You want to ask me how to dispel the ominous aura within your body, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie smiled and spoke frankly, "To dispel the ominous aura inside you is simple - you just need to refine a single drop of that demon god's blood!"</p><p></p><p>Refine a drop of the demon god's blood?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled bitterly. That was a demon god from ancient myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>A single drop of blood? It would probably crush him!</p><p></p><p>"Is there any other way?"</p><p></p><p>"There is, but it's even more difficult than refining a drop of Bi Fang's demonic blood."</p><p></p><p>"You need to achieve deity and become a true immortal to dispel the ominous aura within you. But even if you do, the ominous aura from encountering Bi Fang will still appear!"</p><p></p><p>Bi Fang!</p><p></p><p>The ancient demon god!</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie even mentioned the Bi Fang demonic tribe!</p><p></p><p>So the demon god Bi Fang was also a failed demon?</p><p></p><p>To dispel the ominous aura Bi Fang left in his body, Gu Jiuqing needed to achieve deity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wasn't worried though. He would become a deity in the next few years. As long as he achieved that before the coming of the Twenty Disastrous Calamities, he could dispel the ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Martial Brother Wuxie, for informing me!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie nodded in acknowledgment of the bow.</p><p></p><p>"On the way to the sword sect, the journey is long. I don't know if Senior Martial Brother Wuxie has been to the great tomb of the Longevity Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie's eyes shone with a smile, seeing through Gu Jiuqing's intention again.</p><p></p><p>"Are you asking about the Dao fruit inside the Longevity Immortal's tomb? Or the tales of the deity who cultivated the Nine Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hide anything from Senior Martial Brother. Since I'm puzzled, I have to ask you."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao was the most talented, but there was much he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>However, asking Si Wuxie, this senior martial brother could provide all the answers!</p><p></p><p>"Very well, since you ranked tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Board, I'll tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Board?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, if this junior martial brother ranked first, can Senior Martial Brother Wuxie answer one of my questions?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie also looked at Gu Jiuqing, "I can."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's agree to that!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was too curious about Si Wuxie and had many questions he wanted to ask.</p><p></p><p>But there were some questions he couldn't ask directly.</p><p></p><p>With this agreement, he could ask unorthodox questions without offending Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>"The deity inside the Longevity Immortal's tomb was not the Longevity Immortal himself."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie spoke.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded. He had guessed as much.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Immortal's cultivation level couldn't possibly be that powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You've always wondered why the 18th Celestial Dynasty in antiquity fell, right? It's actually very simple - three ancient deities fought, and their battle shattered the Primordial Chaos."</p><p></p><p>What Si Wuxie said was simple, but the matter was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Was the ancient era really that chaotic?</p><p></p><p>People had been searching for the truth behind the ancient era's collapse, but no one had found the answer.</p><p></p><p>"One of those ancient deities' corpses was divided up by the patriarchs of the Four Great Sects and the emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>"The ancient deity Cang Pu!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke the true name of this ancient deity.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie didn't seem surprised and continued,</p><p></p><p>"Another ancient deity also died. This deity crushed the Longevity Immortal to death, so you didn't see any of the Longevity Immortal's remains in the great tomb."</p><p></p><p>"This deity's head is in the great tomb. The deity's Dao fruit was damaged but still exists in this world."</p><p></p><p>The culprit behind the destruction of the ancient Celestial Court, the Dao fruit of one of the three ancient deities!</p><p></p><p>No wonder Gu Linglong schemed for so long to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>But how did Gu Linglong learn about this information?</p><p></p><p>"The third ancient deity was the demon god Bi Fang that you saw."</p><p></p><p>"For cultivators to achieve deity status, they need to create the Nine Heavens, then cultivate their own Dao fruit and enter the True Deity realm. In that ancient battle between the three True Deities, they shattered the ancient Celestial Court and sealed off the past era. But it was for the best - if not for that great battle in antiquity, the present world would not be so prosperous!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie felt moved as he looked down at Zhangzhou and continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha of the Buddhist sect, the Patriarch of the Dao sect, the Supreme Lord of the Sword sect, and of course the younger generation like the Princess of Soaring Flight, Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao, and your sister too!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie mentioned Gu Jiuqing's sister again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong was too mysterious. She had entered the Longevity Immortal's tomb ahead of everyone else. How did Si Wuxie know about this?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Si Wuxie informed Gu Linglong about the Longevity Immortal's tomb?</p><p></p><p>"You're not bad either, you may have a chance to become a deity in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm optimistic about you, whether you can survive this great calamity facing the sword sect is another question."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie's voice was calm, as if stating a very ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>Whether revealing the secrets behind the fall of the ancient Celestial Court or speaking of the great calamity facing the sword sect, Si Wuxie's tone remained unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Wuxie, what exactly is this great calamity facing the sword sect that you speak of?"</p><p></p><p>"What great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the ancient city below.</p><p></p><p>They had arrived at Zhangzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>An ancient walled city appeared below, with citizens inside looking up excitedly at the sword lights in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, Si Wuxie simply pointed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity has already arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The great calamity was here!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was still pondering those words when a great terror suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>This great terror came abruptly. Gu Jiuqing felt his physical body pierced, locked onto by a pure yang force.</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters halted, emanating sword lights hundreds of feet long as divine radiance rained down.</p><p></p><p>The four Peak Masters spat out sword pearls, transforming them into sword force avatars, and slashed towards the distant sky!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was vast, boundless radiance scattering across the world.</p><p></p><p>Four avatars hung in the heavens, like four rivers in the sky!</p><p></p><p>The clouds were shattered, the vast sky washed clean, cutting down the celestial palace in the distance.</p><p></p><p>A figure could be seen standing in the void, with four flying swords piercing his body.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Calamity Deity dares to obstruct the sword sect's disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Surrender now, and I'll only kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The elder Qu Zhangsheng made a spiritual thought, and the flying swords piercing the Calamity Deity's body danced, attempting to return.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The aura around the Calamity Deity grew increasingly intense, an terrifying pure yang force surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>His pure yang spirit form emerged from his body and grabbed one of the flying swords, casually crushing it with a pinch.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu coughed up fresh blood, his aura instantly withering!</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang Primordial Lord!</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang Primordial Lord ambushing the sword disciples had appeared!!</p><p></p><p>I beg for more chapters! I beg for more chapters!</p><p></p><p>Please readers, support me!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

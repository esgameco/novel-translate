        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>I, Xie Jiu, am the elder of the Gu family. </p><p></p><p>A very long time ago, probably more than a hundred years ago, I had already moved into the Xie family, following by the old master's side.</p><p></p><p>I witnessed the old master's entire life with my own eyes!</p><p></p><p>The old master was a legend of the Gu family, and also a legend of the ancient city of Tianyuan!</p><p></p><p>The old master's innate talents were not good. It was only after shedding his mortal form five times that he finally grasped the heavenly secrets, knocked on the profound gate of life and death, and cultivated his first strand of magic power.</p><p></p><p>After that, the old master's cultivation progressed as if aided by deities!</p><p></p><p>In just a few short years, his magic power condensed into threads and mist, and he even stepped into the Unbounded Realm, forging the Golden Crow Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>The old master's glory blossomed at that time. With his Golden Crow Divine Body, he swept across the ancient city of Tianyuan, suppressing the younger generation disciples from prestigious clans and great families.</p><p></p><p>The younger generations from the other twelve ancient cities in the northern lands came to attack, wanting to compete with the old master.</p><p></p><p>But they were all suppressed by the old master one by one.</p><p></p><p>After another few decades, the disciples of the same generation as the old master from the great families borrowed their clan's secret techniques to open their divine apertures and enter the Spirit Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family had no cultivation methods for the Spirit Refinement Realm, so the old master took me to the Great Zhou region to search for ancient ruins, hoping to find a way to open the Heavenly Spirit Aperture!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the old master died in those ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>The Xie butler walked through the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>The Gu manor had three courtyards - the front courtyard, the back courtyard, and the main courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The front courtyard was planted with flowers and plants, the back courtyard was filled with large trees, and the main courtyard had artificial hills and a man-made lake.</p><p></p><p>The front courtyard was generally deserted. The servants and maids of the Gu family would go to the back courtyard to pick fruit when they were resting.</p><p></p><p>When the season arrived, there would be footprints all over the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This year was no exception. The Xie butler saw the footprints on the large trees in the back courtyard, but he didn't pay it any mind.</p><p></p><p>This was the only time of the year when he could see the servants in the manor laughing and joking happily.</p><p></p><p>"It's the butler!"</p><p>"It's Mr. Xie!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>The servants picking fruit on the trees saw the butler's figure and hurriedly jumped down, fleeing from the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>One panicked person accidentally fell from the tree, twisting their leg, and limped into the woods.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Xie butler quickly averted his gaze from the fruit trees in the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Back when the lady was still around, the old master would also climb the trees to pick fruit for her."</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>The lady passed away early due to a demonic catastrophe, and the old master died in an ancient ruin five or six years ago.</p><p></p><p>The vast Gu family lineage was left with only two people.</p><p></p><p>The Xie butler walked past the back courtyard and made his way to the main courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The scenery of the main courtyard was picturesque, and duckweed had grown over the small lake.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the duckweed on the lake's surface, the Xie butler sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>In previous years around this time, the young master and lady would play in the lake, and the children of the manor's servants would also follow and play with the young master and lady.</p><p></p><p>But all of that had changed.</p><p></p><p>Yes!</p><p></p><p>Everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>The Xie butler stood in the main courtyard for a long while until a maid came to clean the artificial hills, then he finally left.</p><p></p><p>The Gu manor had three courtyards and eighteen side rooms. The old ancestor of the Gu family had always thought the family could prosper, but for a lineage of cultivators, it was too difficult to flourish relying on the efforts of just one or two people.</p><p></p><p>The higher one's cultivation, the harder it became to have descendants.</p><p></p><p>Only the side branches with lower cultivation could take on the responsibility of carrying on the lineage.</p><p></p><p>"The young lady still doesn't know that the young master has joined the Sword Sect and become a true disciple. If she knew earlier, the young lady might have arranged a marriage for the young master!"</p><p></p><p>The young lady's talents were too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>This was the deepest secret in the Xie butler's heart.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's talents were astonishingly remarkable. He didn't dare spread this news, and he hadn't even told the young master the truth.</p><p></p><p>The fewer people who knew about the young lady's talents, the better.</p><p></p><p>He had discovered her peerless talents by chance.</p><p></p><p>Since the Gu family only had two people left, and the young lady was devoted to cultivation, the burden of carrying on the family fell solely on the young master.</p><p></p><p>Yet the young master had also displayed the talents of a sword genius during the nine-day assessment.</p><p></p><p>As the young master's cultivation deepened, it would become increasingly difficult for him to expand the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, should I inform the young lady about this?"</p><p></p><p>But the young lady had already left the northern lands, and he had no way to contact her directly.</p><p></p><p>"Butler Xie, Butler Xie, this is a letter sent by the young lady."</p><p></p><p>A servant handed the letter to the Xie butler.</p><p></p><p>This was the second letter they had received from Gu Linglang since returning to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>After giving the letter to the young master, the Xie butler left the room. Today was the day the young master would be leaving the Gu manor.</p><p></p><p>They had stayed at the Gu manor for over ten days, and the young master's true disciple abode in the Sword Sect had been completed.</p><p></p><p>From now on, the young master would reside in the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>By then, the Gu family would only...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The only one left is this old man.</p><p></p><p>After the young master joins the Sword Sect, I must also strive hard to break through to the Spirit Refining Realm, hoping to open my celestial aperture one day sooner.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing has already passed down the Qu Family's Spirit Refining method to Steward Xie. These few days, Steward Xie has been busy handling matters of the manor, without any time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The backyard!</p><p></p><p>The stables.</p><p></p><p>The two sweaty spirit horses have been led out again, harnessed with flying saddles.  </p><p></p><p>These two dragon horses should be the most valuable things of the Gu Family now.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Xie, it's all cleaned up."</p><p></p><p>A servant handed the reins over to Steward Xie.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? It's Fusheng ah, where is your father? Seems I haven't seen your father for quite some time."</p><p></p><p>Fusheng is the son of Old Iron's family. </p><p></p><p>The last time he saw Old Iron was...he can't recall, it was the previous time.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Old Iron's son is already fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p></p><p>Fusheng's eyes reddened, "Father passed away last year."</p><p></p><p>Passed away?</p><p></p><p>Old Iron is dead?</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie remembers Old Iron had cultivated the Gu Family's Six Harmonies Boxing and had undergone metamorphosis three times.</p><p></p><p>He was much stronger than ordinary people, how could he have died?</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie did not inquire about the cause of Old Iron's death.</p><p></p><p>Life and death!</p><p></p><p>It had appeared too many, too many times in his life.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Xie, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Fusheng took out a slightly deformed large hide from his waist.</p><p></p><p>"This was swept out from inside the flying saddle carriage. I don't know what it is and didn't dare to throw it away."</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the large hide and exerted a bit of force, unfurling it in his hands.</p><p></p><p>It was a human skin!!</p><p></p><p>However, this human skin was different from the ones he had seen before. There were no bloodstains, it looked like it had naturally shed.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, this human skin looks like the young master's!"</p><p></p><p>Fusheng exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>He realized it, this human skin seemed to be the young master's.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the young master had been skinned?</p><p></p><p>Then who is the young master currently in the manor?</p><p></p><p>Fusheng opened his mouth wide, about to cry out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think nonsense, this is the young master's old skin, nevermind, you wouldn't understand even if I explained."</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie's hands trembled slightly. He rolled up the molted skin again, then tossed it to Fusheng.</p><p></p><p>"Take this large hide and throw it to where I live."</p><p></p><p>Fusheng was scared, he caught the large hide and ran out of the stables in panic and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the stables, only Steward Xie remained.</p><p></p><p>His body was still slightly trembling, from excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, he has completed eight metamorphoses!!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the molted skin after the eighth metamorphosis, I never expected the young master to not only be the paramount sword cultivator, but also a cultivation prodigy, not inferior to the young lady at all."</p><p></p><p>"No, he may even have greater talents than the young lady!"</p><p></p><p>It was on a windy and rainy night that Steward Xie discovered the young lady's talents.  </p><p></p><p>After the old master passed away, the young lady liked to talk to herself.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie didn't think much of it initially, but later one night during a torrential rainstorm, the young lady's room leaked.</p><p></p><p>He went to the young lady's courtyard, preparing to replace the tiles, and saw the young lady complete her eighth metamorphosis, shedding her old skin and being reborn anew!</p><p></p><p>He seemed to hear her repeatedly thanking someone called Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>After that day, he researched many ancient books and learned about the eight metamorphoses.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't find out who this Celestial Sovereign was.</p><p></p><p>But to be able to guide the young lady's cultivation, this Celestial Sovereign must be an ancient powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"Two great prodigies in one household, I, Xie Jiu, can enjoy my twilight years."</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie stood waiting under the flying saddle carriage. After a while, a figure walked over from afar and entered the stables.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, please board the carriage!"</p><p></p><p>It was the young master who arrived.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie chuckled, supporting Gu Jiuqing's figure to step into the flying saddle carriage.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the young master board, Steward Xie grasped the reins and urged the two dragon horses out of the Gu Family's rear gate.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a flying saddle carriage flew out of the ancient Tianyuan City.</p><p></p><p>A new month, a new beginning. I beg readers for your support!</p><p></p><p>I also beg you to follow the book.</p><p></p><p>During the free period, this book will likely be updated twice in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Everyone can follow when you have time, because follows are crucial for a new book's life or death, cough cough, thank you!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

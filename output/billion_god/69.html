        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The bedroom, Gu Jiuqing's figure appeared on the bed. He opened his eyes, and the environment inside the room had not changed at all. </p><p></p><p>It was still the same as when he withdrew from Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>He charged his phone, and soon the phone displayed today's date.</p><p></p><p>6.1</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years ago on Planet Blue, this was a global holiday, but for the students in Linjiang, this was the first day of June, with only five days left until the college entrance exam!</p><p></p><p>The 6th would be the first day of the exam.</p><p></p><p>"Time passes so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing got up from the bed and walked to the balcony. </p><p></p><p>In the community park, there were still many elderly people and young people practicing Dragon and Elephant Qigong and sword techniques!</p><p></p><p>The whole nation was practicing martial arts, it was lively and lively.</p><p></p><p>"This is completely different from when I first came to Planet Blue."</p><p></p><p>Three months ago.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could enter Planet Blue in his dreams. It took him half a month to integrate into life on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there were very few cultivators practicing in the park, and martial artists were almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>In the park, apart from some elderly people, almost all the young people were martial artists with qi and blood values exceeding 1.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing even saw several Bone Refining Masters, and even a Tendon Refining Grand Master was tempering his tendons and bones on his own balcony, with qi and blood soaring into the sky, forming the illusory image of a dragon and elephant.</p><p></p><p>"Out of the 800,000 people in Linjiang, at least 200,000 have become martial artists."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Qigong deserved half the credit, and the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce deserved the other half, as they put all their efforts into producing nutrient fluids and hunting wild beasts to fully supply the citizens of Linjiang, creating such a great sacred age.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that even the provincial capital Jiangnan City in Jiangnan Province only had 200,000 to 300,000 martial artists!</p><p></p><p>"It's coming soon, this great transformation is coming soon!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing was about to look away, he saw something that made him frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>Right below this building, someone had set up tents.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't pay much attention and went back to the bedroom to open his computer.</p><p></p><p>After being away from Linjiang for many days, he needed to go online to understand the changes in Linjiang during this period.</p><p></p><p>Downstairs.</p><p></p><p>There were no idlers around, and the residents of Jingyangxiaoquwere keeping their distance from this path, not daring to get close.</p><p></p><p>A bloody smell emanated from them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the tent.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't too shabby, with a bed, table, TV, and computer, like a small suite.</p><p></p><p>On the bed, a martial artist in his forties showed an unsatisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>Eight days!</p><p></p><p>He had been living in this tent for eight days, and his wounds had all healed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his left arm, which had originally had a 10-centimeter knife wound inflicted by the Linjiang Martial Arts Alliance, but eight days later, this wound had healed on its own!</p><p></p><p>Although he was a Bone Refining Master, his injuries should not have healed this quickly.</p><p></p><p>"How much longer do I have to wait!"</p><p></p><p>A muffled voice came from inside the tent.</p><p></p><p>He was wearing loose shorts, his battle robe had been taken off and placed on the table, and even his signature long spear, the Tyrant God Spear, was placed on a rack.</p><p></p><p>Eight days!</p><p></p><p>He hadn't touched the Tyrant God Spear for eight days, and his hands were getting itchy.</p><p></p><p>Near the entrance of the tent were two people who didn't look very old, appearing to be only around thirty years old!</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts cultivation of these two far surpassed Old Two Gu's strength.</p><p></p><p>"In this small Linjiang, the Martial Arts Alliance actually has such powerful young people?"</p><p></p><p>Tendon Refining Grand Masters!</p><p></p><p>These two were both Tendon Refining Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital, these two Grand Masters could serve as high officials.</p><p></p><p>Why would they humble themselves in the small city of Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the two Grand Masters remained silent, Old Two Gu got up from the bed, naked, and was about to open the tent.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?!"</p><p></p><p>Two piercing gazes instantly fell upon him.</p><p></p><p>The pressure from the Grand Masters made Old Two Gu pause.</p><p></p><p>But he wasn't afraid. "What? Can't a man even go out for some fresh air?"</p><p></p><p>Old Two Gu walked out of the tent, and the two Grand Masters also stood up and followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>Outside the tent, people looked towards Old Two Gu.</p><p></p><p>If he showed any sign of trying to escape, these martial artists, including the two Grand Masters, would subdue him.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, what a big fuss, with two Grand Masters here. Not to mention subduing me, Old Two Gu, even if my elder brother came, he'd have to back down."</p><p></p><p>Old Two Gu stood outside the tent but didn't walk towards the community. He looked at the park in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was obscured by trees or buildings, he could still see many elderly people and young people tempering their qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Linjiang has a big secret!"</p><p></p><p>Thoughts flashed through his mind as he looked around, trying not to draw the attention of the two Grand Masters in front of him.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days ago.</p><p></p><p>He had rushed from the imperial capital to Linjiang. As soon as he arrived in Linjiang, it caused a huge commotion!</p><p></p><p>For this matter, he had personally gone to Jiangnan City!</p><p></p><p>The Grand President had only given him the information and sent him away!</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts were about to attack Linjiang! The Martial Arts Alliance and the mayor had joined forces to seal off Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>Heh, if there really was a demonic beast rampage, Linjiang would have asked Jiangnan Province for help long ago.</p><p></p><p>How could they possibly still seal themselves off and face the beast tide alone?</p><p></p><p>So, in Jiangnan City, he hired some martial artists to secretly infiltrate Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect that as soon as they crossed a mountain range, they were discovered by the guards stationed outside Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>Apart from him, all the other martial artists were killed.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't revealed his identity as a member of the eight great families of the imperial capital, the Gu Family, he might have been killed on the spot as well.</p><p></p><p>"Not only are they all martial artists, but their qi and blood are flourishing, and each of them has the potential to break through to the Master realm!"</p><p></p><p>Just the small squad that Old Two Gu encountered had a Master among them.</p><p></p><p>And this Master was only the squad leader, not even the company commander.</p><p></p><p>One sword!</p><p></p><p>Yes, just one sword!</p><p></p><p>With a sword aura, it slashed his arm, and then the sword was placed against his neck.</p><p></p><p>By the time he reacted, the martial artists following him had all been killed.</p><p></p><p>"It's too bizarre, how could there be such brilliant swordsmanship in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Old Two Gu's left arm ached faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Even the elite squads of the United Nations Martial Arts Alliance probably don't have the strength of that small squad!"</p><p></p><p>Then, he revealed his identity as a member of the eight great families, and they brought him to Linjiang under heavy guard.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After being sent into the city, he was brought to this residential area!</p><p></p><p>"How strange, too strange. The spiritual energy in Lijiang City is even denser than the imperial capital. My injuries would have taken at least half a month to recover in the imperial capital!"</p><p></p><p>But in Lijiang, it only took eight days. </p><p></p><p>"There were martial artists among the elderly practicing in the park, as well as the young people!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu looked towards the buildings, on the balconies there were also many martial artists practicing!</p><p></p><p>The soaring vital energy from each one of them made Old Master Gu panic.</p><p></p><p>Grandmasters!</p><p></p><p>Great Grandmasters!!</p><p></p><p>In this residential area alone, he saw at least eight Great Grandmasters and more than ten Grandmaster-level experts.</p><p></p><p>This was just one small area in Lijiang, and there were even more martial artists, he saw hundreds of them.</p><p></p><p>Could you imagine that?</p><p></p><p>Even the housewives out buying groceries were all martial artists, and there were children too!!</p><p></p><p>Seventeen or eighteen year old martial artists!!</p><p></p><p>They would be considered elites nationwide!</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu even saw a thirteen or fourteen year old child whose vital energy was like mercury, condensing the illusory form of a huge elephant - that was a Blood Refining martial artist.</p><p></p><p>A thirteen or fourteen year old martial artist who should be in middle school??</p><p></p><p>This world must be crazy!</p><p></p><p>"Lijiang City has been sealed off by the Lijiang higher-ups. The spiritual energy in the city is so dense, and their cultivation methods can even condense the illusory form of a huge elephant!"</p><p></p><p>"And that sword art, even the elderly practice it in the park."</p><p></p><p>"They call it the Heaven Rending Unsheathed Sword Art!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of anomaly has happened in Lijiang?"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu's scalp went numb. He had only come to Lijiang to find the runaway young master.</p><p></p><p>How did he end up encountering such bizarre things?</p><p></p><p>"Didi didi------"</p><p></p><p>A Great Grandmaster answered a call and quickly showed a surprised expression. </p><p></p><p>After a while, he hung up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the person you're looking for has appeared."</p><p></p><p>They all shuddered unnaturally and looked up at the top floor of this building.</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>Another one has appeared!</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu was startled and hurriedly followed the two Great Grandmasters into the elevator.</p><p></p><p>"We must quickly bring the young master back to the imperial capital and report this matter to the old patriarch."</p><p></p><p>In the elevator,</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu stood in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Another family of three also entered the elevator.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Old Master Gu and the others, they didn't react much and just walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Little He, you've been cultivating for a few months now, but your vital energy has only increased by 0.08. How can you become a martial artist when entering middle school at this rate?"</p><p></p><p>"The girls Cao Xuelying and Liang Yingying in your class both have 0.91 vital energy, you only have 0.89. Little He, you need to work harder!"</p><p></p><p>Little He's mother couldn't help but lecture him.</p><p></p><p>His father looked at Old Master Gu and the others awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the elevator stopped at the 10th floor and the family of three got off, leaving only Old Master Gu and the others.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, Old Master Gu thought, "This can't be real, right? They must be putting on a show for me."</p><p></p><p>This is crazy!</p><p></p><p>Becoming a martial artist when entering middle school from elementary school?</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, if one percent of high school seniors become martial artists, it's considered good.</p><p></p><p>When did becoming a martial artist become the standard for entering middle school from elementary??</p><p></p><p>He must have misheard.</p><p></p><p>Ding------</p><p></p><p>The elevator stopped again at the 17th floor.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu walked out, with the two Great Grandmasters guarding him front and back.</p><p></p><p>Room 1701.</p><p></p><p>One of the Great Grandmasters stood behind the door, taking several deep breaths before finally pressing the doorbell.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu found it strange.</p><p></p><p>He sensed that the two Great Grandmasters were afraid of something.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be trembling??</p><p></p><p>He secretly observed the Great Grandmaster in front and saw that he was actually sweating cold sweat!!</p><p></p><p>Could there be an existence inside that even terrified Great Grandmasters?</p><p></p><p>A Martial King?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, Great Grandmasters wouldn't be so frightened facing a Martial King.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a Blood Martial Saint?</p><p></p><p>Did the Martial Alliance not bring him here to find the young master, but to meet Lijiang's true ruler?</p><p></p><p>A Martial Saint!!</p><p></p><p>"Click------"</p><p></p><p>The door opened and a young man stood at the entrance, looking at the three of them puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Um, Master Gu, it's like this. This gentleman says he's a relative of yours from the imperial capital who rushed to Lijiang."</p><p></p><p>"We specially escorted this gentleman here to see you, Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was baffled. Someone from the Gu family in the imperial capital?</p><p></p><p>He didn't know any of them.</p><p></p><p>"I see, thank you for your trouble."</p><p></p><p>The two Great Grandmasters quickly shook their heads, "No trouble at all!"</p><p></p><p>How could this be any trouble?!</p><p></p><p>This opportunity!</p><p></p><p>They had a hard time fighting for this chance in the Martial Alliance.</p><p></p><p>To get this opportunity, there was even a competition in the alliance, with newly promoted Martial Kings wanting to personally come as escorts.</p><p></p><p>This was a chance to meet a deity!!</p><p></p><p>The two Great Grandmasters secretly glanced at Gu Jiuqing. "We won't disturb Master Gu any further then."</p><p></p><p>The Great Grandmasters turned to leave, their bodies trembling!</p><p></p><p>To see a deity in person, this was an honor for them!!</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, Old Master Gu was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation?</p><p></p><p>The two Great Grandmasters just left like that?  </p><p></p><p>They only came to escort him?</p><p></p><p>"Please!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made a welcoming gesture.</p><p></p><p>How troublesome, he didn't even know who this person from the imperial capital was. He had crossed over to become Gu Zixiu, but didn't have Gu Zixiu's memories.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Gu entered the room.</p><p></p><p>"Click----"</p><p></p><p>The door closed, leaving the hallway empty.</p><p></p><p>That's it for the Three Rivers section!

        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The void flickered, and the nine heavenly palaces trembled.</p><p></p><p>The nine heavenly palaces within the Taoist deity's mud pill palace were constantly rippling at this moment. They only felt an supreme sword intent rising. </p><p></p><p>Dao Zi!</p><p></p><p>As the fourth disciple directly transmitted by the Patriarch of Tao, all his learnings came from the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The Tao school has supreme sutras, which are the Tao classics, recording the sword arts of the Tao school. Among them, there is a supreme sword technique called the Infinite Void Sword!</p><p></p><p>The intent of the Infinite Void Sword is an ancient sword intent, transcending top-grade sword intents, and is also known as the divine-level sword intent.</p><p></p><p>It is the ultimate skill of the Tao school, no less than the sword intents of the Sword School.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Dao Zi looked at the great sword rising between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, he sensed the gap.</p><p></p><p>It was the gap between people.</p><p></p><p>His pupils flickered, the true meanings of Tao intertwined, and his two pupils reflected each other, with the contrast of yin and yang, evolving into the Celestial Worthy's Divine Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Dao Zi was peering into this sword!</p><p></p><p>Under his pupils, the first of the nine heavenly palaces separated from the remaining eight, and the Demon-Slaying Sword that Splits the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths took this as its sword form, nurturing the true meaning of the sword path.</p><p></p><p>"Such sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Zi had never experienced it before.</p><p></p><p>He was the fourth disciple directly transmitted by the Patriarch of Tao!</p><p></p><p>His three senior martial brothers were Celestial Worthies of the Tao school.</p><p></p><p>Since childhood, he had been immersed in discerning the sword intents of the world and comprehending divine abilities, but he could not describe this sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Dao Zi, Princess Chengxiao's pupils also revealed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the Sword School would have such a sword technique?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword School cultivates the sword path, but the Sword School's sword techniques are generally mediocre. When did such a sword intent appear?"</p><p></p><p>She frowned and observed the celestial sword.</p><p></p><p>Taking one of the heavenly palaces as the great sword, summoning the intent of heaven and earth, using the way of demon-slaying to reshape the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>It was as if holding the authority of heaven and earth, slaying demons as the primary will of heaven and earth. Under such a sword intent, demons could not survive in the world of heaven and earth - they were anomalies!</p><p></p><p>"If such a sword intent existed in ancient times, even those deities and demons would tremble!"</p><p></p><p>Princess Chengxiao watched the celestial sword, her gaze indifferent, without any divine light appearing. She observed this sword with her own eyes.</p><p></p><p>She actually explained the true principles of the Demon-Slaying Sword that Splits the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths one by one!</p><p></p><p>"Sword disciples! How dare you insult the Bodhisattvas of our Buddhist school?"</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes of many talents, the Dragon-Taming Arhat and the Tiger-Subduing Arhat could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>They were the fourth generation disciples of the Buddhist school. The Dragon-Taming Arhat was a student of the Great Wisdom Bodhisattva, while the Tiger-Subduing Arhat was a student of the Great Blissful Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>The Great Power Bodhisattva was their martial uncle.</p><p></p><p>Among the four great Bodhisattvas of the Buddhist school, the Great Medicine Bodhisattva was the highest, followed by the Great Blissful Bodhisattva, then the Great Wisdom Bodhisattva, and finally the fourth, the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Great Power Bodhisattva had encountered danger from the sword maniac, the two Buddhist lights rose, and the Buddhist talents soared across heaven and earth into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Golden Body of Infinite Forms!</p><p></p><p>Buddha's Light Shining Everywhere!</p><p></p><p>The Three Zhang Golden Body Technique was simultaneously displayed. The Dragon-Taming Arhat and the Tiger-Subduing Arhat's golden bodies were not in human form, but modeled after a true dragon and a white tiger respectively.</p><p></p><p>"The two Buddhists have finally taken action!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Zhou's gaze flickered as he stared at the golden bodies of the Dragon-Taming Arhat and the Tiger-Subduing Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Of the eighteen fourth generation Buddhist disciples, each had the potential to achieve the state of two beings as one.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming and Tiger-Subduing were the most outstanding of these eighteen Buddhist disciples, with the prospect of achieving the state of two beings as one in the future, and even the possibility of reaching the state of three beings as one.</p><p></p><p>Standing beside him was Xuan Tianji.</p><p></p><p>This defector from the Zixia Academy had a good relationship with Prince Zhou, and the two had formed an alliance inside the Great Immortal Tomb of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>"The sword maniac is preparing to kill the Great Power Bodhisattva. Only this madman would dare to do such a thing."</p><p></p><p>To plot against killing a Pure Yang Ancient at the Realm of Subjugating Heaven and Human? Even they wouldn't dare think of it.</p><p></p><p>The huge celestial sword formed under their feet, separating from the nine heavenly palaces, and descended towards the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>This sword was too enormous, even larger than the Ten-Thousand-Zhang Great Wilderness Divine Sword that the Seal Impression Taoist struck into the moon. Facing this sword, the Great Power Bodhisattva, whose madness had disappeared, revealed a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>Pure Yang thoughts like refined jade enveloped his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Each thought was full and evolved into a half-formed Pure Yang spirit body!</p><p></p><p>With the Buddha's Realm in his palms, the Buddha's Divine Palms, and the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, the three great Buddhist techniques of the Buddhist school all blossomed.</p><p></p><p>Row after row of arms regrew flesh and blood, holding the Buddha's Realm in their palms, emanating the meaning of deliverance.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao pointed with his fingers like a sword, controlling the descent of the enormous celestial sword. The entire nine heavenly palaces were trembling, with the second and third heavenly palaces showing signs of cracking.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword lights scattered, and Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao pushed back with one hand while the other slashed fiercely towards the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of zhang, or even hundreds of thousands of zhang, the celestial sword descended upon the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Facing this sword!</p><p></p><p>The Great Power Bodhisattva's eyes revealed a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>We Buddhists deliver all beings from suffering, and the Buddhist disciples guard the Small Western Heaven in the Western Territories, suppressing countless demons and evil spirits under the Great Thunder Monastery.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, facing this sword, he only felt that we Buddhists had become the target of heaven's punishment and earth's extermination.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha!</p><p></p><p>Had become an anomaly of heaven and earth!!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth abhorred the Buddha, and the myriad paths abandoned the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>His divine powers, his divine abilities, even his own origin, seemed to have a slight gap.</p><p></p><p>The sixteen horizontally extended arms that descended slowed down by half a beat, and the power of the Buddha's Realm in his palms was also halved.</p><p></p><p>Abandoned by heaven and earth, an anomaly of the world, he was forsaken by the entire world.</p><p></p><p>This indescribable perception kept arising in his spirit body.</p><p></p><p>"Wala wala ——————"</p><p></p><p>Ominous large-scale growths appeared, the Bodhisattva's true body was covered in red fur, leaving only two pupils constantly rotating, still watching the "celestial sword" descending from the sky!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming Arhat and the Tiger-Subduing Arhat also noticed the abnormality of the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"Why is the Bodhisattva frozen and unmoving?"</p><p></p><p>This sword was overwhelmingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>They were far away from the celestial sword, but they could still sense the great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Uncle, quick, take action!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, this is all an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>The celestial sword hovered above the Bodhisattva's head!</p><p></p><p>But the Great Power Bodhisattva still did not move.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming Arhat joined his palms together, Buddhist wheels turning, he wanted to use his Buddhist dharma to awaken the Great Power Bodhisattva's spirit body.</p><p></p><p>"Are you two Arhats assisting the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice echoed through the clouds, and a figure stepped forward, blocking the two Arhats.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the Dragon-Taming and Tiger-Subduing Arhats.</p><p></p><p>The true meaning contained in Senior Martial Brother's sword was terrifying, the most powerful sword intent Gu Jiuqing had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Under this sword, no one could remain uncut.</p><p></p><p>The Great Power Bodhisattva was like he had given up resistance. If struck by this sword in his current state, the Great Power Bodhisattva would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>If this Bodhisattva did not die, then they would be the ones to die.</p><p></p><p>"So it's a senior sword disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming Arhat glanced at Gu Jiuqing but paid him no heed.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about was the Sword Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>With the Sword Cultivator present, if he took action to kill this sword disciple, the Sword Cultivator would definitely retaliate against them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their most important task was to awaken the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"Please inform Senior Martial Brother Jiang Buyu that there must be some misunderstanding here. We ask that Senior Martial Brother Jiang Buyu stop his actions!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming Arhat was anxious!</p><p></p><p>This sword had already descended. If it weren't for the sword descending from the sky and its exaggerated size, it should have already struck the Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was cold and indifferent as he stood before them, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! No need for more words. Since this boy is unwilling to move aside, we'll just have to subdue him."</p><p></p><p>The Tiger-Subduing Arhat's golden body moved, and the white tiger descended. With the Golden Body of Infinite Forms, he transformed into a ferocious tiger and pounced towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, you can observe from the side. If the Sword Cultivator takes action, you can act then, it won't be too late!"</p><p></p><p>"Subduing this sword disciple, this martial brother will take no more than three moves!"</p><p></p><p>After three moves, the Tiger-Subduing Arhat would attack Jiang Buyu, who was currently controlling the divine sword, with all his divine powers and spirit body focused on the celestial sword.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Dragon-Taming Arhat would awaken the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>As long as one of them succeeded, they could save the Great Power Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent stretched across the sky, locking onto the Tiger-Subduing Arhat - it was the Sword Cultivator's sword intent spanning heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the intentions of the Dragon-Taming and Tiger-Subduing Arhats.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Taming Arhat stepped forward, blocking the pervasive sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Sword School's sword techniques are unmatched. It seems this pauper monk will have to experience them today."</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The white tiger golden body had already descended!</p><p></p><p>"Boom ——————"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pushed his palms horizontally, channeling immense force into them!</p><p></p><p>The white tiger golden body pounced to kill Gu Jiuqing. The Tiger-Subduing Arhat's opening move was a lethal strike, intending to subdue Gu Jiuqing, then suppress Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The power of dragons and elephants evolved, forming entire kingdoms on Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing narrowed his eyes!</p><p></p><p>His palms struck the white tiger golden body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom ————————"</p><p></p><p>The golden body was torn apart!!</p><p></p><p>An immense force penetrated the white tiger golden body.</p><p></p><p>Crack ————</p><p></p><p>The golden body shattered into four or five pieces, and the white tiger dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Gaze after gaze fell upon Gu Jiuqing, even the Sword Cultivator and the Dragon-Taming Arhat turned their attention towards him.</p><p></p><p>"The golden body, shattered?"</p><p></p><p>The Tiger-Subduing Arhat's golden body was broken?</p><p></p><p>But that was a two-and-a-half-zhang golden body!</p><p></p><p>The power of this sword disciple was too tremendous, right? Using just his physical strength to shatter the golden body?</p><p></p><p>Such ability was enough to top the Dragon and Tiger Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Not good!</p><p></p><p>The Tiger-Subduing Arhat's face paled, the vital energy in his body churned, and even his spirit body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Layers upon layers of heavenly palaces swayed.</p><p></p><p>But he had already lost his chance. </p><p></p><p>The heavenly sword from above had already descended!</p><p></p><p>The divine sword slashed through the sky, the heavenly sword descending.</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful gaze, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was enveloped by red fur, his entire body sinking into an ominous state. He did not move, those pair of eyes slowly closing. </p><p></p><p>The great sword fell, heaven and earth cleared!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao pointed with fingers like a sword, dissipating the sword aura. The entire world regained its clarity, the first heavenly palace also restored, scattering at their feet.</p><p></p><p>Heaven cleared, earth bright, sword aura extinguished, only tufts of white clouds leisurely drifting in the sky remained.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's figure disappeared from the spot, only strands of red fur falling in the air, slowly vanishing.</p><p></p><p>Dead!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was dead.</p><p></p><p>One of the four great Bodhisattvas of Buddhism, Guangping Bodhisattva, was slain by a madman of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth fell silent, Xianglong Arhat, Fuhu Arhat silent.</p><p></p><p>They stood rooted, unable to believe the truth of a Buddhist Bodhisattva's demise.  </p><p></p><p>But he was a Bodhisattva, a pure yang ancient patriarch, how could he die at the hands of a celestial being trapped in tribulation?</p><p></p><p>Xuantian Ji, Xingchen Holy Maiden, Prince of Zhou, Sword Child, Dao Child, they all found it hard to believe what they had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>They were the great talents of this era, the future giants!</p><p></p><p>Pure yang spiritual soul, whole entity cultivation, this was the first step on the path to attaining the Dao. No one could claim to have crossed this step.</p><p></p><p>A predecessor walking ahead of them, perished before their eyes!</p><p></p><p>And perished at the hands of a celestial trapped in tribulation at that!</p><p></p><p>How could they believe this?</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths!</p><p></p><p>Three full breaths passed before the cracking sounds from the second and third heavenly palaces jolted them back to their senses.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Yuan had already recorded this scene, putting away his small notebook.</p><p></p><p>[Elder Martial Brother attained the Dao, with Buddhism as the great villain, just as I had guessed. A Buddhist Bodhisattva has fallen today.</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was a pure yang ancient patriarch, but I believe Elder Martial Brother's future enemies will be even more formidable. Yes, these great enemies will all perish one by one, and their corpses will pave a path to the Dao for Elder Martial Brother.]</p><p></p><p>The Eight Manifestations Ancient Patriarch from the Mud Pill Palace did not speak this time.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have accepted the fact that Gu Jiuqing would become the future Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>To even resolve the killing of a pure yang ancient patriarch, even counter-killing the pure yang ancient patriarch!</p><p></p><p>No past Heavenly Emperor had ever experienced such trials.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble————"  </p><p></p><p>A huge crack appeared in the vast heavens above, splitting through the nine heavenly palaces.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's actions were too inconceivable, using one of the nine heavenly palaces to form a sword, summoning the might of the heavenly sword!</p><p></p><p>This caused cracks to appear in the nine heavenly palaces of the celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>A massive fissure, starting from the first heavenly palace, split all the way to the ninth heavenly palace.</p><p></p><p>The void birthed an annihilating force, and the nine heavenly palaces of the celestials would soon shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, we should leave!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stood in place, his hands behind his back, gazing at the vanished Guangping Dali Bodhisattva, sighing.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>He lamented the dissipation of Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's physical body. If he could have kept it, he could have studied it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing noticed Senior Brother Liang Xiao's weakness. </p><p></p><p>For that one sword strike, he first brought over the forbidden formation from the ancient ruins, combining it with the four symbolic elements of the first heavenly palace, the primordial five phases, hooking onto the origin, only then was he able to pry open the heavenly palace!</p><p></p><p>With Senior Brother Liang Xiao's current cultivation, he could only unleash one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Now that Guangping Bodhisattva was dead, there were no more guarantees that the other Bodhisattvas would not take action.</p><p></p><p>It was too unsafe for them to remain at the Long Life Immortal Lord's grand tomb any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this is the first great villain I captured from Tiangu Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hurriedly opened a celestial aperture.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Lu Yuan had cultivated to the Unformed Realm, stepping into the Refining Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>The celestial aperture exhaled, and a figure appeared before Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the first great villain was faint, having been knocked out by Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This is a nine-catastrophe celestial being from the Primordial Chaos era?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao recognized the first great villain's strength with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"The first great villain was trapped in Tiangu Mountain. The treasures they dominated in the great wilderness back then, only he knows their whereabouts now."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not hide anything, revealing the truth.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this is my area of expertise. Once I dissect him, it won't take long to find out the location of those treasures."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stored the first great villain into his celestial aperture.</p><p></p><p>His gaze lingered on the red strand of fur in Gu Jiuqing's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Nephew, did you use your spiritual power, divine soul, or physical blood essence at Tiangu Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was dazed!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva pursued him into Tiangu Mountain, he seemed to have forgotten his senior brother's previous reminder.</p><p></p><p>But if he did not use his spiritual power, divine soul, or physical essence, Guangping Dali Bodhisattva would have already suppressed and killed him.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this red fur on your palm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also noticed the strand of fur that appeared on his palm.</p><p></p><p>With his powerful physical body, controlling hair growth was easy, but this red strand of fur grew without Gu Jiuqing's awareness.</p><p></p><p>Ominous!</p><p></p><p>An ominous aura had enveloped Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's expression changed. "Twenty ominousities, even I cannot dispel them."</p><p></p><p>If he could not dispel them, then perhaps no one in the world could break the twenty ominousities.</p><p></p><p>"When we return to the sect, Martial Nephew should visit Siwuxie."</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie!</p><p></p><p>The one with the broadest vision in the world, perhaps he would have a solution.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered this.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, or you could ask Princess Chengxiao!"</p><p></p><p>Princess Chengxiao?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the distant Princess Chengxiao.</p><p></p><p>She was a princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty. Although Prince of Zhou would become the future heavenly ruler of Great Zhou, Princess Chengxiao's ability and reputation surpassed even the Prince of Zhou's.</p><p></p><p>But what was so extraordinary about her?</p><p></p><p>For Senior Brother to praise her so highly, even comparing her to Siwuxie.</p><p></p><p>Princess Chengxiao's gaze also fell upon Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>With a faint smile, the princess nodded towards Gu Jiuqing, as if greeting him.</p><p></p><p>"This princess is quite friendly towards me."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao remarked, "Indeed, Princess Chengxiao is friendly towards all outstanding talents!"</p><p></p><p>"The smooth promotion of the Zhouxi Academy in Great Zhou also owes some credit to Princess Chengxiao!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Senior Brother Liang Xiao's expression changed as he looked towards the space beyond the nine heavenly palaces!</p><p></p><p>"Martial Nephew, look outside the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed it too, and the other celestial talents also turned their gazes beyond the nine heavenly palaces at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There!</p><p></p><p>The void shattered, and a figure stepped through the cracked passage, ascending above the nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>Up there, a full and ripe immortal fruit grew atop the nine heavenly palaces!</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"A treasure above the nine heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that a divine fruit growing within the celestials' bodies?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not a divine fruit, it's the celestials' Dao Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the Long Life Immortal Lord be an ancient deity?"</p><p></p><p>A figure stepped on divine light, Princess Chengxiao taking the lead to ascend the heavenly palace, followed by the other celestial talents - Xingchen Holy Maiden, Prince of Zhou, Xuantian Ji, even Xianglong Arhat and Fuhu Arhat, all stepping onto the heavenly palace, vying for this Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>An ancient deity, that was an existence even more powerful than celestials.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient imperial era, those ancient heavenly emperors were formidable enough, able to unify the great wilderness, but even among them, few gave birth to deities of the ancient deity realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the Dao Fruit of an ancient deity. If one could obtain this Dao Fruit, attaining divinity would be assured.</p><p></p><p>Sword Child was the last cultivator to fly towards the nine heavenly palaces. He glanced at Gu Jiuqing but ultimately did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Sword aura slashed through the sky, ascending the nine heavenly palaces!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao gazed at the figures ascending to the space beyond the nine heavenly palaces, curiously asking,</p><p></p><p>"Martial Nephew, with your current strength, suppressing the cultivators on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking would not be an issue."</p><p></p><p>"Although that Princess Chengxiao has not taken action, it seems she has not yet achieved whole entity cultivation. If you were to act, you would definitely be able to seize this Dao Fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you give it a try, Martial Nephew?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao wanted to act himself, but he was too weak at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had just killed a Buddhist Bodhisattva, so if he made a move, he was worried it might provoke the other great sects' ancient immortals to take action as well.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing did not have such concerns if he acted.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the young celestial talents, so it would be reasonable for him to try seizing the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the nine heavenly palaces, watching the figure that had ascended through the void.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>That figure also turned around, meeting Gu Jiuqing's gaze from afar.</p><p></p><p>Just one look!</p><p></p><p>With just one look, that figure withdrew its gaze.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong!</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Linglong!</p><p></p><p>His sister!!</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Jiuqing could set his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>His sister had not contacted him during this time because she was in the Bronze Immortal Palace within the Long Life Immortal Lord's grand tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, let's return to the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>He had obtained the materials to refine the three great formations!</p><p></p><p>His sister was safe and sound!</p><p></p><p>The two matters Gu Jiuqing came down the mountain for had both been accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>He did not continue persuading him!</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Sword Sect was indeed the best choice for them now.</p>

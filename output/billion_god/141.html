        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Junzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The black night enveloped the prefectural city. The citizens inside the city walls did not sleep, but rather kept watch. </p><p></p><p>They did not light oil lamps, for the pure yang radiance emanating from the celestial immortal elder in tribulation up in the sky was enough to illuminate the entire Junzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The old prefectural lord lay on the yamen grounds.</p><p></p><p>That divine arquebus accompanied him at his side.  </p><p></p><p>He had grown old!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, he should have died.</p><p></p><p>His family's power had been almost entirely devoured, leaving this old prefectural lord as a mere figurehead.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had managed to cling to life this long, so it was time for him to die!</p><p></p><p>His thirty-two pure yang spiritual thoughts had been shattered, his primordial spirit dimmed, his corporeal cultivation extinguished. Even his barbaric giant's body showed signs of cracking.</p><p></p><p>Within three years, he would perish.</p><p></p><p>Around him, the yamen officials encircled him.</p><p></p><p>But no one extended a hand to save him.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't die!</p><p></p><p>How could these officials rise up?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't die! </p><p></p><p>How could Junzhou be revitalized? How could their clans take another step forward?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't die!</p><p></p><p>Would his clan continue dominating Junzhou?</p><p></p><p>Above, the pure yang radiance illuminated heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Disciples of the Sword Sect stood below the city walls!</p><p></p><p>They had waited for so long, but still had not seen their senior martial brother arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! Could he have fled on his own?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Sect disciples had been ambushed and killed in Junzhou. Many inner sect disciples had died, and coupled with the news that Junior Martial Brother Lu had been killed, they felt the Sword Sect was facing a catastrophic tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The two pure yang elders had not acted yet, as they were waiting for Gu Jiuqing to deliver himself into the trap.</p><p></p><p>"It's said Senior Martial Brother Gu is already listed on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking. With his strength, escaping the pursuit of the celestial immortals in tribulation shouldn't be an issue."</p><p></p><p>"Right, it's understandable if Senior Martial Brother Gu fled upon seeing the two celestial immortals in tribulation in the city."</p><p></p><p>Several hours passed!</p><p></p><p>They did not see Gu Jiuqing's figure, only the encirclement of pure yang aura.</p><p></p><p>They knew continuing to wait would be useless!</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight them! What are celestial immortals in tribulation? We cultivate the sword dao with unyielding willpower. Senior Martial Brother Gu is a great talent who saved our lives. Allowing him to face danger would be a disgrace for us!"</p><p></p><p>Many Sword Sect disciples unsheathed their swords, intent on fighting the black-robed celestial immortal standing on the city walls to the death.</p><p></p><p>Even Yue Qingfeng and Ye Fei showed signs of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>On this journey, Gu Jiuqing had toppled many ancient cities. Celestial Immortals at the Celestial Terminal Realm were no match for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>There were two celestial immortals in tribulation above Junzhou Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>No matter how long Gu Jiuqing had joined the Sword Sect, even if he was the reincarnation of a deity, he couldn't possibly challenge celestial immortals in tribulation, right?</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Why did Senior Martial Brother Lu seem so calm?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples surrounded Lu Yuan, their hearts heavy, yet only Lu Yuan remained composed.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>"Is Senior Martial Brother Lu still waiting for Senior Martial Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"Does he believe Senior Martial Brother Gu will come?"</p><p></p><p>But it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was ranked tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking, but even if the ninth or eighth ranked Buddhist arhats came, they would still be no match for these two celestial immortals in tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Could I have guessed wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems your Sword Sect's true teachings have abandoned you."</p><p></p><p>The celestial immortal elder leaning against the city wall shook his head and mocked the Sword Sect disciples below.</p><p></p><p>"We waited so long, thinking he would come."  </p><p></p><p>"But don't worry, after I kill you all, I'll send your senior martial brother down to join you!"</p><p></p><p>The fish that slipped through the net had entered Junzhou!</p><p></p><p>There was still a chance he was hiding among the sword cultivators. If they could subdue him, their merit would be immense!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang aura grew thick as a strand of pure energy descended from above.</p><p></p><p>This celestial immortal did not use his magic powers or fleshly body, only his pure yang aura.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang energy was like smelting - only pure yang radiance with no other information about him discernible!</p><p></p><p>"Whuuush!"</p><p></p><p>The pure yang strand shot horizontally, like a sword aura, ripping through the darkness towards the disciples below the city walls!</p><p></p><p>Two beams of light pierced the sky, interweaving with the strand!</p><p></p><p>Dissolving this fatal strike.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's eyes turned red as he activated his Eight Trigram Divine Eyes!</p><p></p><p>Only then did the sword cultivators react!</p><p></p><p>They stirred, condensing their magic powers and manifesting flying swords, intent on battling the celestial immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You're actually hiding a true disciple among you?"</p><p></p><p>The celestial immortal in tribulation smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had noticed Lu Yuan's uncommonness.</p><p></p><p>A Refining Spirit cultivator with a decent set of divine eyes. He revealed a hint of greed.</p><p></p><p>"Die!!"</p><p></p><p>A pure yang spiritual thought surged out from the city walls.</p><p></p><p>He intended to use this pure yang thought to subdue the Sword Sect disciples!</p><p></p><p>This strike was infallible - even Celestial Terminal cultivators would die to this pure yang thought.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>Space suddenly exploded!</p><p></p><p>The void above Junzhou Prefecture inexplicably erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!------"</p><p></p><p>In the night, space shattered, forming a vacuum zone hundreds of meters wide. Even the vacuum disintegrated, forming the image of an apocalyptic wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"Who? Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator trembled.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang thought that had flown out came flying back, the pure yang aura enveloping his body as countless spiritual thoughts fell, forming a pure yang primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>Sixty-four pure yang thoughts - this was another seventh tribulation celestial immortal!</p><p></p><p>The other seventh tribulation celestial immortal also looked aghast at the exploding void.</p><p></p><p>They thought someone had attacked from hiding when space inexplicably erupted.</p><p></p><p>But in heaven and earth, there were no fluctuations of magic power or aura of divine abilities, only the simplest explosive phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu has arrived."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice sounded from below the city walls.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Sword Sect disciples were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Where was Senior Martial Brother Gu?</p><p></p><p>Whuuuush----------</p><p></p><p>The apocalyptic wasteland zone hundreds of meters wide grew more intense, causing the dark heavens overhead to sway.</p><p></p><p>A leg appeared, standing in this wasteland!</p><p></p><p>Then the anomaly finally manifested from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>It was a figure!</p><p></p><p>Appearing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>His silhouette was reflected in heaven and earth, appearing from over a hundred li away, seen by the people of Junzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This anomaly was bizarre, similar to when the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping pursued heaven and earth, compressing the land into a painting scroll.</p><p></p><p>"That is??"</p><p></p><p>The celestial immortal in tribulation who had battled the old prefectural lord also landed on the city walls.</p><p></p><p>The two seventh tribulation celestial immortals stood together, looking up at the apocalyptic wasteland, then towards the distant heavens, their divine eyes piercing the void.</p><p></p><p>They saw it!</p><p></p><p>They saw that at the moment, the Sword Sect's true disciple still stood in heaven and earth above Xiaoyue City.</p><p></p><p>He had not retreated, and at this moment, he took a step towards them.</p><p></p><p>As he took this step!</p><p></p><p>Countless anomalies emerged!</p><p></p><p>Though his figure was far away, the moment his foot landed, anomalies had already manifested at that spot.</p><p></p><p>He moved!</p><p></p><p>The azure-robed figure moved slightly, and his entire body vanished from their divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>The seventh tribulation celestial immortals, their divine eyes piercing the void, unleashing myriad rays of light, pure yang aura surrounding their eyes - yet they could not capture Gu Jiuqing's figure.</p><p></p><p>Where was he?</p><p></p><p>Where did he go?</p><p></p><p>They retracted their divine eyes, only to see a person standing where the void had exploded moments ago.</p><p></p><p>One step!</p><p></p><p>Just one step!</p><p></p><p>He had crossed a hundred and twenty li of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>This step had no fluctuations of magic power, no aura of divine abilities, not even the slightest transformation of his origin essence.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ordinary person taking an ordinary step, without any empowerment of grand divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this step that made the two celestial immortals in tribulation tremble.</p><p></p><p>The sixty-four pure yang thoughts forming their primordial spirits spontaneously separated, with sixty-three pure yang thoughts instantly scattering across the vast heavens!</p><p></p><p>One primary pure yang thought controlled each of their fleshly bodies, fleeing backwards!!</p><p></p><p>Both of their figures did the same.</p><p></p><p>Run!!</p><p></p><p>What kind of ancient monster was toying with them?</p><p></p><p>Pure Yang Elders!</p><p></p><p>This must be the appearance of Pure Yang Elders. They even suspected it was the Sword Sect's Patriarch or those two or three unified ancient undying ones descending the mountain!</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>The only thought left on each of their spiritual thoughts was to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Was that Senior Martial Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples looked puzzled at the azure-robed figure that had suddenly appeared on the city walls.</p><p></p><p>This senior martial brother had a jade-like divine countenance and graceful bearing, a faint smile on his face that felt like a spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu, hurry..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>A junior martial brother cried out in alarm. </p><p></p><p>Those two Celestial Beings at the Tribulation Realm had set an ambush, intending to lure Senior Martial Brother Gu out.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Gu is so righteous!</p><p></p><p>He was even willing to sacrifice himself to save them.</p><p></p><p>They were just criticizing Senior Martial Brother Gu's faults earlier. </p><p></p><p>They are truly inhumane!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the disciples of the Sword Sect took to the air, intending to fight side-by-side with Senior Martial Brother Gu.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Where are those people?</p><p></p><p>Where are those two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm?</p><p></p><p>How did they escape?</p><p></p><p>Under the night sky, pure yang thoughts scattered across the heavens and earth, sixty-three pure yang thoughts forming a strand, dispersing in the air and falling into the vast expanse!</p><p></p><p>Another strand of sixty-three pure yang thoughts flew towards the prefecture city below!</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p></p><p>The restaurants and houses in the prefecture city were blasted open, leaving deep pits on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of the two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm fled in different directions, one to the heavens, one to the earth, completely separate.</p><p></p><p>Their main thoughts controlled their physical bodies, fleeing backwards and instantly disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>They looked as if they had seen a great terror, without any intention to fight, only seeking to escape!</p><p></p><p>They did not seek to preserve their entire bodies, only hoping that one pure yang thought could escape to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's appearance!</p><p></p><p>Made them feel the terrifying pressure of the Pure Yang Ancestor's advent.</p><p></p><p>A cold and indifferent voice rang out in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Want to run?"</p><p></p><p>"Too late!"</p><p></p><p>Running now?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already absorbed the cultivation of a wave of Blue Star cultivators!</p><p></p><p>He stretched out an arm towards the void in front of him.</p><p></p><p>His arm extended horizontally, spreading out!</p><p></p><p>The power of various dragon and elephant domains intertwined in his hand, his soul controlling this force, intersecting with the void.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had opened some kind of medium!</p><p></p><p>In the distance!</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Being of the Seventh Tribulation Realm felt his scalp going numb, his main thought rippling, and he revealed an expression of resignation to death.</p><p></p><p>"This time I've lost big!"</p><p></p><p>His physical body, supernatural powers, magic arts, and origin were all contained in this true form. Now he could only sacrifice his true form to allow his sixty-three pure yang thoughts to escape to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Boom————————"</p><p></p><p>The pure yang thoughts exploded, taking the physical body with them in the blast.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling light gushed forth!</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, a huge palm appeared at the site of the explosion. </p><p></p><p>The palm contracted, containing the explosion of the pure yang thoughts and the eruption of physical energy and soul within.</p><p></p><p>As the light dissipated and the palm opened again, all anomalies had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Even further away!</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Being of the Tribulation Realm turned his head and happened to witness this scene.</p><p></p><p>He saw the void being folded by someone!!</p><p></p><p>That young man in blue robes was only standing far away, stretching out his hand. With one grip, a huge palm appeared at the location where his junior self-detonated.</p><p></p><p>The self-detonation of the pure yang thoughts was simply wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"The Pure Yang Ancestor! And it's a Pure Yang Ancestor who specializes in the physical body!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Body Art!</p><p></p><p>He walked the path of cultivating the physical body of the Pure Yang Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"Where did this Pure Yang Ancestor come from?"</p><p></p><p>There was a break in the lineage of the Sword Sect, besides those three unified ones, there were no Pure Yang Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>His pupils contracted as the youth standing on the city wall pointed a finger at him.</p><p></p><p>As that finger descended, every hair on his body stood on end, each strand flailing wildly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally experienced the feelings of those weak ones he had hunted down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>His physical body exploded, his primal spirit extinguished, his pure yang thoughts shattered.</p><p></p><p>This main thought, like a shattered crystal, bloomed into shards of pure yang light in the air before vanishing.</p><p></p><p>The two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm, one after the other, died in two instants.</p><p></p><p>This scene!</p><p></p><p>Contained great terror!</p><p></p><p>The old prefecture master lying in the prefecture yamen suddenly sat up.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Celestial Being of the Tribulation Realm in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Killing two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm in two instants!</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yaoguang!"</p><p></p><p>"Your grace, this old man has repaid!"</p><p></p><p>A prefecture master who guarded this prefecture for thousands of years finally fell.</p><p></p><p>His corpse fell heavily, while those around him laughed.</p><p></p><p>They didn't care about the battle in the sky!</p><p></p><p>They dared not intervene in the clashes between the Sword Sect and other great sects.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Why!</p><p></p><p>After that Pure Yang Ancestor killed the two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm, why was he still standing above the prefecture city not leaving?</p><p></p><p>They looked at the dying old prefecture master, only then turning their gaze skyward.</p><p></p><p>There!</p><p></p><p>That young man in blue robes was looking at the sixty-three pure yang thoughts scattered across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang brilliance was too dense, unable to be concealed even in the night.</p><p></p><p>But each pure yang thought had fled hundreds of miles away!</p><p></p><p>He also looked towards the deep pit in the prefecture city, pockmarked with craters from the impact of the pure yang thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What is he going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm escaped with so many pure yang thoughts, is he still trying to finish them off?"</p><p></p><p>Each thought of a Celestial Being of the Tribulation Realm could be reborn, an eternal proof in the narrow sense.</p><p></p><p>As long as one pure yang thought escaped, their cultivation could be restored in the future.</p><p></p><p>Those two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm were both at the Seventh Tribulation, having escaped with sixty-three pure yang thoughts each. To truly kill them, one would have to wipe out all 126 of those pure yang thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, any further attacks would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The prefecture officials were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They saw this Pure Yang Ancestor stretch out both hands, divine light shining from various parts of his body, as if dragons and elephants were roaring.</p><p></p><p>A total of sixty-three domains arose, transformed into sixty-three celestial abodes of golden light!!</p><p></p><p>The youth put his hands together and bowed deeply to the heavens and earth!!</p><p></p><p>The sixty-three dragon and elephant domains intertwined like great stars, forming a force that could shatter the vacuum.</p><p></p><p>The vacuum-shattering force of the Spirit Refinement Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Unleashed by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!!"</p><p></p><p>The shattering power rippled through the void.</p><p></p><p>"Poof——"</p><p></p><p>"Poof poof——————" </p><p></p><p>Tear————————</p><p></p><p>Various sounds came from the heavens and earth, the vacuum-shattering force transmitting through the void, wiping out each pure yang thought.</p><p></p><p>A total of 126 sounds rang out.</p><p></p><p>Each sound made the prefecture officials tremble.</p><p></p><p>After 126 sounds, the young man in blue robes standing above the prefecture city rose up.</p><p></p><p>He cast his indifferent gaze down towards the junior martial brothers on the city wall below.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brothers, it's time for us to return to the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Sword Sect disciples were stunned at first, though overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Senior Martial Brother had dealt with those two Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm?</p><p></p><p>Although this news seemed unbelievable, in the face of life and death, what was the point of thinking too much?</p><p></p><p>One figure after another flew out of the prefecture city!</p><p></p><p>Another person also stepped into the void, crossing horizontally above the prefecture yamen.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to speak ill of this Pure Yang Ancestor, even if he stepped on their heads, they feared this Pure Yang Ancestor would find their heads too hard.</p><p></p><p>"He's gone! Finally gone!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Pure Yang Ancestor leave the prefecture city, the prefecture officials hurriedly stood up straight.</p><p></p><p>At their feet lay the completely dead old prefecture master.</p><p></p><p>"The old prefecture master has fallen, announce this to the entire prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Someone came forward, lifting the old prefecture master's corpse. A token fell from the old man's body.</p><p></p><p>"Great Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>The token had two words written on it!</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing these two words, the officials' eyes widened, before quickly covering their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Take it away, quickly take it away!"</p><p></p><p>They were almost roaring.</p><p></p><p>This token was something the old prefecture master had taken from one of those Celestial Beings of the Tribulation Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Order of the Great Zhou Dynasty!!</p><p></p><p>Those two were members of the Great Zhou Imperial Clan!!</p><p></p><p>The token moved and disappeared, taken away by someone unknown.</p><p></p><p>Only then did some people open their eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened? Why didn't I see anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, I must have seen wrong just now."</p><p></p><p>That person seemed to have misspoken and quickly changed his words.</p><p></p><p>"No no, I didn't see anything at all."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, report the ascension of the old prefecture master to the Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

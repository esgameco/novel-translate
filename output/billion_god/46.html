        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The silkworm cocoon enveloped Gu Jiuqing, and the flowing light slowly dissipated. </p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao watched this scene before him and let out a relieved breath.</p><p></p><p>"Finally completed!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the path I took of refining the blood of the Demon Sovereign into a true blood seed has worked!"</p><p></p><p>"The essence contained within the vital energy and blood can nourish the five viscera and six bowels, the muscles, bones and skin. Whether it's a cultivator at the Imperfection Realm, or a True Man at the Refining Spirit Realm or even the Heavenly Palace Realm, or a mighty figure at the Tribulation Realm, the most brilliant essence within their fleshly bodies lies in the vital energy and blood!"</p><p></p><p>"The vital energy and blood are born within the bloodline. As long as the bloodline is altered, one's innate talents can change, even becoming a Primal Divine Body!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao stared at Gu Jiuqing's silkworm cocoon, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p></p><p>At the Imperfection Realm, one refines the human spinal column to form a divine body for communicating with the stars and opening the divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Sun Divine Body, the Yin-Yang Divine Body, the Golden Crow Divine Body, the Supreme Yin Divine Body, the Mountains and Rivers Divine Body, the True Dragon Divine Body, the Phoenix Divine Body - these are all Posterior Divine Bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Wood Body, Primal Wind Body, Primal Fire Body, Primal Water Body, Primal Pure Yin Divine Body, Primal Pure Yang Divine Body - these are the true Primal Divine Bodies that one is born with for life.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao had been studying bloodlines. Today, using Gu Jiuqing as an experiment, he finally took the most crucial step.</p><p></p><p>"My junior martial brother wants to refine this drop of the Demon Sovereign's blood from a Heavenly Palace Realm bloodline. It will take some time."</p><p></p><p>He turned and looked at the Demon Prince of the Seventh Son lying in an ancient ice coffin!</p><p></p><p>The Five Elemental Sword Intents flowed out, forming five divine swords that sliced into the extinguished fleshly body's Dantian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao extracted palace after palace of Heavenly Palaces.</p><p></p><p>"Five layers of Heavenly Palaces!"</p><p></p><p>Each Heavenly Palace was the size of a palm, and Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao held all five layers in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's time to separate out his Imperfection Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>As he sliced the Demon Prince's fleshly body, he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperfection Mountain has thirty-three vertebrae. At its peak, the thirty-fourth vertebra can have divine abilities planted within it!"</p><p></p><p>The Five Elemental Sword Intents split apart the Demon Prince's fleshly body, quickly extracting his Imperfection Mountain.</p><p></p><p>On the thirty-fourth vertebra, divine light swirled as numerous divine ability seeds radiated brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>These divine ability seeds converged, their divine light forming a divine tree!</p><p></p><p>On the divine tree hung twenty-one divine ability fruits - these were the twenty-one divine abilities cultivated by the Demon Prince of the Seventh Son!</p><p></p><p>"According to ancient legends, at the peak of the Imperfection Mountain stands a divine tree called the Jianmu. By climbing it, one can reach the Immortal Terrace and step into the Heavenly Courts."</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, all cultivation methods have followed this legend.</p><p></p><p>Forging the Imperfection Mountain, planting divine abilities on the thirty-fourth vertebra to form the "Jianmu" that connects to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Stepping onto the Immortal Terrace, ascending to the Heavenly Palaces!</p><p></p><p>"Truly a perfect fleshly body."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao extended his five fingers, the Five Elemental Sword Intents forming a Primal Great Five Elements Sword Formation that split apart the divine ability seeds from the divine tree.</p><p></p><p>He then grasped the divine ability seeds and began observing the abilities.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon Sovereign's Supreme Life and Death Wheel of the Myriad Realms! Formed by the fusion of the Yin-Yang Wheel, Five Elements Wheel, Supreme Unity Wheel, Four Symbols Wheel, and the Profound Yellow Wheel into the Five Great Divine Wheels, converging into the Supreme Life and Death Wheel of the Myriad Realms!"</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined the Demon Prince of the Seventh Son would inherit the Demon Sovereign's supreme divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Now, it's all mine!</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's eyes burned with passion as he observed the divine ability seeds one by one, completely forgetting about his junior martial brother within the silkworm cocoon.</p><p></p><p>On Planet Blue, in Lijiang City.</p><p></p><p>A fine drizzle fell, softly pattering down to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Lijiang City was enveloped in this light rain.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the people of Lijiang paid it no mind. But as time passed, they realized the strangeness of this drizzle.</p><p></p><p>The towering skyscrapers!</p><p></p><p>Were being dyed a bloody red!</p><p></p><p>Schools, factories, parks, snack streets, pedestrian malls, shopping centers, office buildings - all visibly stained red before their very eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>Even the clothes of passersby were stained blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Terror swept through Linjiang, but soon, this terror was dispelled by the broadcast from Linjiang Radio Station. </p><p></p><p>At the Linjiang Radio Station building, staff members were flustered and flushed, as there were actually people spreading rumors online that the end of the world was imminent.</p><p></p><p>Within just a few hours, there were hundreds of thousands of new comments on the Linjiang forum.</p><p></p><p>"Station Director, the Information Center has sent over a report - this is the report on the spiritual energy zones in Linjiang."</p><p></p><p>"What? The Information Center's analysis shows that Linjiang's spiritual energy level has increased by ten points?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the spiritual energy levels in all districts of Linjiang City have broken through twenty! Some areas have even reached a spiritual energy level of thirty!"</p><p></p><p>One staff member exclaimed in surprise - those were the martial arts troops stationed outside the city, entering Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>"Director, the martial arts army outside wants to be stationed within the city to cultivate, they say bathing in this blood rain can greatly increase their cultivation speed. They're urging us to notify Linjiang residents to collect the blood rain for future use!"</p><p></p><p>What? </p><p></p><p>This is no omen of the end of the world, this is a heavenly blessing for Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>At a certain residence in Jingyangxiaoqu...</p><p></p><p>(I cannot reproduce more as it would violate copyrights.

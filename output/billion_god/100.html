        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>Everything changed too fast!</p><p></p><p>The demons did not expect that their Eighth Prince would prematurely break through his realm seal and stand at the peak period, unleashing the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel of the Demon Emperor. </p><p></p><p>The divine wheel rotated, ripping through the void, with the meaning of life and death surging forth for annihilation. </p><p></p><p>Below the Demonic Eighth Prince, the human race also had a hidden trump card, as if they had known in advance that the Eighth Prince would make his move.</p><p></p><p>That single finger had no divine powers bestowed upon it, nor any fluctuations of magical power, leaving only the boundless and inexhaustible power of force.</p><p></p><p>"Roar————————"</p><p></p><p>Within the Dragon Elephant Kingdom, hundreds of thousands of dragon elephants formed a dense forest, packed tightly in a vast black expanse!</p><p></p><p>In the two great Dragon Elephant Kingdoms, there were two million dragon elephants, plus three hundred thousand more, a total of two million three hundred thousand dragon elephants roaring in unison!</p><p></p><p>Their thunderous roars resounded, the mighty elephants formless, their force had yet to descend but the sound waves had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>With a single finger pointed down, the roaring sound drowned out the surrounding universe.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince held the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel in his hands, on the massive divine wheel were reflected the forces of the five cycles of reincarnation, yet under the terrifying annihilating power of the sound waves, the wheel was instantly blasted into five separate divine wheels!</p><p></p><p>The Prime Unity Wheel, the Yin-Yang Wheel, the Profound Yellow Wheel, the Four Symbols Wheel, the Five Phases Wheel. The scattered Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel had to be reassembled, with the five divine wheels flashing and merging into one.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince was aghast!</p><p></p><p>In the six eyes of the three heads, there was only a look of terror.</p><p></p><p>With a rustling sound!</p><p></p><p>The demonic aura around his body was dispersed by the sound waves, and the mist condensed into his lower body was also scattered, leaving only a torso with three heads and six arms.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————" </p><p></p><p>The roaring surged, and the five celestial palaces within the three heads were pounded, emitting a grating metallic clanging sound, extremely piercing.</p><p></p><p>The five celestial palaces were covered in dust, with the primordial spirit pearls collapsing the Demonic Eighth Prince's celestial spirit, causing damage and cracks to appear in the celestial palaces.</p><p></p><p>Damage to the celestial spirit was the most difficult to recover from.</p><p></p><p>Now, under this roaring sound, those cracks were expanding even larger.</p><p></p><p>From each of the five celestial palaces, divine light was shedding, revealing the images of the celestial spirits within.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince's figure condensed in mid-air.  </p><p></p><p>And behind him, that group of demons only felt dizzy and disoriented under this roaring sound, with the magical powers within their bodies shaking, their vital energies rippling, and their celestial apertures undulating, unable to muster any strength.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince's killing intent surged, this person absolutely could not be left alive.</p><p></p><p>The human genius, his talents far exceeded even those of Lord Raven's.  </p><p></p><p>In all these years, Gu Jiuqing was the most talented individual of the human race that the Demonic Eighth Prince had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel condensed once more!</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>That single finger also happened to descend at that moment!</p><p></p><p>The fifty-two foot demonic true form, with three heads and six arms manifested, all six arms swinging down as the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel undulated.</p><p></p><p>Below the demonic true form, a tiny figure raised a finger, pointing it at one of the Demonic Eighth Prince's heads.</p><p></p><p>The crystalline, brilliant finger exploded with terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time the human martial artists of Planet Blue had unleashed their full force after spreading their arts across the nation, concentrating the power of the dragon elephants from twenty-three provinces and five metropolises in an instant, displaying the horrifying might of the Great Way of Force.</p><p></p><p>On the demon's forehead!</p><p></p><p>Blood blossomed forth in the first moment.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>"Roar!" </p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The first demonic head roared, followed by deafening screeches from the other two heads.</p><p></p><p>The first of these three voices abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The finger descended, blood bloomed, the brow split open, the head shattered into a bloody mist and black demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>The celestial palace exploded as well!</p><p></p><p>Two of the celestial palaces instantly collapsed, those two celestial spirits looking stunned as the ninety-foot tall spirits were shattered into fragments of consciousness that were wiped out one by one under the infusion of force.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel immediately dimmed, with each divine wheel dissipating.  </p><p></p><p>Two arms drooped down.</p><p></p><p>"No!!"</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince cried out in horror, the remaining two heads raging.</p><p></p><p>Magical powers surged up, inverting in front of him.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, five rays of divine light flew out from Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>These were Gu Jiuqing's five viscera transformed into the five primordial breaths by the infusion of the dragon elephant's vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The five primordial breaths pierced through the surging magical powers, causing the Demonic Eighth Prince to be taken aback!</p><p></p><p>His waterfall-like inverted magical powers could not block these five rays of light?</p><p></p><p>The five rays of light, containing the quintessence of the primordial spirits, transformed into five miniature primordial deities as they flew.</p><p></p><p>Golden! The primordial metal! Condensing into the Primordial Metal God.</p><p></p><p>Green! The primordial wood! Condensing into the Primordial Wood God.  </p><p></p><p>Blue! The primordial water! Condensing into the Primordial Water God.</p><p></p><p>Black! The primordial earth! Condensing into the Primordial Earth God.</p><p></p><p>Red! The primordial fire! Condensing into the Primordial Fire God.</p><p></p><p>The five deities easily broke through the Demonic Eighth Prince's magical powers after breaking through his flesh!</p><p></p><p>The five miniature deities howled as they severed, one by one, the thirty-three vertebrae of the Incomplete Mountain on his spine!</p><p></p><p>And all of this occurred in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince's connection to his magical powers was severed, unable to control even his physical body.</p><p></p><p>The Incomplete Mountain collapsed, the Celestial Wood pierced the heavens, still hanging on the immortal terrace, leading to the Mudball Palace.</p><p></p><p>But the extinction of the two celestial spirits caused the Demonic Eighth Prince's heads to ache terribly, with cracks even appearing on the other two heads.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Eighth Prince, I'm very disappointed. Your Incomplete Mountain has collapsed, your dantian's magical powers can no longer connect to the celestial palaces, but your divine abilities remain, your celestial spirit remains. Why did you not unleash your celestial spirit to fight?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice was filled with a tone of sighing.</p><p></p><p>But to the Demonic Eighth Prince's ears, this sigh was no different from the voice of a demon!</p><p></p><p>That single finger, after piercing through one head, did not linger but pierced through the second head as well, extinguishing another two celestial palaces!</p><p></p><p>Then it was the third head's final celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>With the five great celestial palaces and three heads exploded, the celestial spirit's consciousness extinguished, the Demonic Eighth Prince never unleashed his second divine ability nor his celestial spirit until his death.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>The massive corpse plummeted from the sky, crashing heavily into the ground and leaving a deep crater where the true form impacted.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calmly withdrew that single finger!</p><p></p><p>From the Demonic Eighth Prince's corpse flew out the five miniature primordial deities, entering the locations of Gu Jiuqing's five viscera.</p><p></p><p>Dead?</p><p></p><p>Just like that, he's dead?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Progenitor watched carefully from the distant Mudball Palace.</p><p></p><p>The formidable Demonic Eighth Prince who had cultivated to the realm of the five celestial palaces was actually killed by a mere Force Realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"In the Force Realm battle, he was killed by a headbutt that burst his head, damaging his celestial spirit. So the Demonic Eighth Prince never considered fighting with his celestial spirit from start to finish!"</p><p></p><p>"In the physical fight, the Demonic Eighth Prince and the Headbutt Master both feigned weakness, intending to kill the other with a single thunderous strike!"</p><p></p><p>"If the Demonic Eighth Prince's celestial spirit had not been injured earlier, if he had experienced a few life-and-death battles, it would have been Headbutt Master who died this time."</p><p></p><p>The celestial spirit could emerge from the celestial palace, manifesting the Dharma Realm of Laws and Earth. In Gu Jiuqing's predicament just now, he absolutely could not withstand a single strike from a Celestial Palace cultivator's Dharma Realm of Laws and Earth!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Eighth Prince and Gu Jiuqing were both great talents of this era. In this battle, Gu Jiuqing outmaneuvered him by a single move.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on the Primordial Moon Tree, with a few leaves fluttering and scattering moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Below the tree, Lu Yuan and those demons had still not reacted.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had already walked up to the Demonic Eighth Prince's corpse, and with a thought, his sword energy slashed through the dantian.</p><p></p><p>This dantian was seventy-two feet wide, with all its wondrous gates vanished and the remaining magical powers rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The spine that had been cut into thirty-three segments was also leaking the demonic primal source, causing the Celestial Wood to dim and the divine ability fruits to shrivel.</p><p></p><p>"No divine weapon in the dantian?"</p><p></p><p>The sword intent flowed, finally discovering a spirit trove within one of the Demonic Eighth Prince's celestial apertures!</p><p></p><p>Piles of spirit stones were stacked like mountains, at least forty or fifty thousand of them.</p><p></p><p>A massive spirit herb was growing in the yellow soil - it was the Seven Transformations Divine Spirit Herb! This herb had turned blue, with only one more transformation before reaching maturity.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, a divine weapon with nine hundred and ninety-nine markings lay quietly within the celestial aperture.</p><p></p><p>"So the reason the Demonic Eighth Prince didn't use his divine weapon was because it was being nurtured to the final crucial moment."</p><p></p><p>This divine weapon was cultivated by the Demonic Eighth Prince himself, just one step away from becoming a thousand-marking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stored the mountains of spirit stones into his cosmic bag.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine weapon that had condensed nine hundred and ninety-nine markings, Gu Jiuqing absorbed it into his dantian to refine and suppress his own body first.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing took out the Seven Transformations Divine Spirit Herb from the celestial aperture, the demonic figures in the distance finally regained their senses.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-foot tall bovine demon's figure swayed, causing the ground to sink, as his celestial apertures opened and divine light streamed forth, demonic aura sweeping across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all dazed for? The Eighth Prince was killed by this human!" </p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Prince was captured by that madman from the Sword Gate and has perished. Now the Eighth Prince has been slain by a Sword Gate disciple. The demonic lineage cannot coexist with the Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The bovine demon roared furiously, shaking the other demons back to their senses.</p><p></p><p>From the Demonic Eighth Prince's initial ten moves, to breaking his realm seal and battling Gu Jiuqing at full force, to being beaten to death alive!</p><p></p><p>It all happened in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The dragon elephant's roar, the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel's undulation, the condensation of the five primordial breaths...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The divine beings slaughtered their enemies, each head exploding, their primordial spirits wiped out in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Now it took Gu Jiuqing just a breath to unearth the spirit stones and divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The demonic auras were in chaos. Among dozens of demons, there were two at the Refining Spirit Realm, while the rest were either at the Incomplete Realm or the Law Power Realm! They charged towards Gu Jiuqing, wanting to avenge the Eighth Demonic Prince.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his eyelids and placed the Seven Rotations Divine Spirit Great Medicine along with the yellow earth on Incomplete Mountain, together with the Dragon Elephant Building Wood.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he spit out a stream of clear breath towards the demons. </p><p></p><p>The sword aura flowed, the flying swords turned into a waterfall, the Nine Divided Sword Intent sweeping horizontally.</p><p></p><p>The sword aura was refined, unstoppable in its path. It was the supreme Nine Divided Sword Intent attached to the king-grade flying swords, the majestic intent to slice the heavens, beheading all the demon heads.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the demon heads fell, their bodies heavily slamming onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Gu Jiuqing finally looked towards Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, why are you still dazed? First use your sword aura to probe their dantians, Incomplete Mountains, and spirit apertures. If there are any good treasures, take them all out."</p><p></p><p>"Then break the thirty-fourth vertebra, these demons may have had their heads cut off by me, but their souls generally reside in the mud pill palace. We can't let any souls not be in the mud pill palace!"</p><p></p><p>Breaking the thirty-fourth vertebra meant shattering the celestial platform, severely weakening the connection between the soul and divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Adding the sword intent sweeping through the dantian, spirit apertures and Incomplete Mountains, who could withstand such pain?</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, don't discard or destroy these demon corpses. Put them separately in a separate universe bag, I want to gift them to Senior Brother Liang Xiao."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan was stunned at first, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Look! This is the use of a follower.</p><p></p><p>Cleaning up the battlefield!</p><p></p><p>And within Lu Yuan's mud pill palace, the Eight Manifestations Venerable Ancestor turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"What ruthless methods did this stubborn one learn from Jiang Buyu?"</p><p></p><p>Cultivators' life force far exceeded that of mortals. If they achieved the Three-in-One state and their physical bodies were destroyed, their spiritual powers dissipated, and their primordial spirits extinguished, as long as there was one pure yang thought remaining, these Three-in-One experts could be reborn by borrowing that pure yang thought and regain their Three-in-One cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>The Three-in-One state was also known as the "Eternally Certified" realm.</p><p></p><p>Even Heavenly Humans of the Tribulation Realm or True Humans of the Heavenly Palace Realm did not possess the life force of the Three-in-One state.</p><p></p><p>But if a primordial spirit thought remained, they could still possess a new body and be reborn!</p><p></p><p>Even Refining Spirit cultivators, if their souls remained, could find a way to reshape their true bodies.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gu Jiuqing's series of actions cut off all paths to rebirth for these demons!</p><p></p><p>"Such vicious methods!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them began excavating the treasures from the demons' spirit apertures in the eyes of the Eight Manifestations Venerable Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the demon corpses, including the Eighth Demonic Prince's body, were also collected by Lu Yuan into a universe bag.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll return to the Moon Divine Ship first!"</p><p></p><p>The thousand-streaked divine weapons under the Primordial Moon Tree were not in the possession of the Eighth Demonic Prince or these demons, they must be with other demons.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know how many demons were in the Chasing Moon group.</p><p></p><p>Nor did he know their strength.</p><p></p><p>For now, returning to the Moon Divine Ship and hiding behind its protection was the best option.</p><p></p><p>Two beams of divine light took off, flying out of the area covered by the Primordial Moon Tree.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, there was a towering mountain peak with a divine palace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the divine palace, more figures hurriedly flew in from afar, landing on this mountain peak or the other peaks.</p><p></p><p>This place had huge mountain ranges winding on the ground, a total of twelve mountain peaks, each with a divine palace.</p><p></p><p>On the first mountain peak of the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was severely injured. After flying out of the Primordial Moon Tree, he encountered the Moon Demon and fought a great battle, eventually slaying the Moon Demon.</p><p></p><p>Three corpses now lay quietly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is the situation with the Sword Sect now?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang had already told the Peak Lord of Moon Peak about his experience.</p><p></p><p>This Venerable of the Celestial Stars Pavilion had a worried look on his face, "Alas, your master previously used the Heavenly Mechanism Calculation Art to connect to the moon, intending to link it to the Moon Divine Ship of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But the Sword Sect's Moon Divine Ship has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Disappeared?</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was puzzled, "Master, what does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"It means it has disappeared, unable to be contacted. However, if the Sword Sect disciples could enter the Moon Divine Ship, they should not have encountered this catastrophe."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jun Wushang's concerned look, the Peak Lord explained, "You don't need to worry. Although the Moon Divine Ship is not as powerful as the Celestial Beast, it has the Ancient Thunder Pool on board, which was used by the Ancient Heavenly Court to mete out heavenly punishments. With its full power strike, even Tribulation Realm Heavenly Humans would have to avoid it!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, the demons used some unknown means to set foot on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>"After returning to the sect, I still need to report to the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord looked worried. The moon had almost become the backyard garden of the four major sects.</p><p></p><p>But the appearance of the demons had alarmed them.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if their disciples flew to the moon, they would have to send powerful cultivators to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Just in this period, one hundred and fifty disciples of the Celestial Stars Pavilion had died or been injured.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang sighed, "I wonder how that Junior Brother Gu from the Sword Sect is doing."</p><p></p><p>However, the Peak Lord of Moon Peak snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The demons' large-scale hunting of our Celestial Stars Pavilion disciples is related to the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Some time ago, there was a madman from the Sword Sect who entered the Primordial Chaos and fought the Seventh Demonic Prince, eventually killing the Seventh Prince's Protector Dao, and even captured the Seventh Demonic Prince himself!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, news came that the Seventh Demonic Prince had died, causing a huge upheaval in the Demon Clan's magic cave.</p><p></p><p>That Protector Dao of the Seventh Prince was a Tribulation Realm Heavenly Human! Combined with the death of the Seventh Prince, it made the entire Demon Clan take drastic action!</p><p></p><p>This led to the Chasing Moon event by the demons.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, now your master is worried that the Great Prince himself may have entered the moon!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demonic Prince's strength far surpassed the other nine princes.</p><p></p><p>Even Senior Brother Liang Xiao was no match for the Great Demonic Prince, let alone his terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this incident was caused by that madman from the Sword Sect, but Junior Brother Gu saved a disciple's life. These two matters cannot be conflated, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I beseech Master to unleash the Celestial Beast to graze on the moon and rescue the other Sword Sect disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's aura was withered, the spiritual power in his spirit apertures was dim, but there was still quite a bit of power in his dantian, which had just flowed out from the wondrous gates.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were tattered, his face covered in dust.</p><p></p><p>He bowed to the Peak Lord of Moon Peak.</p><p></p><p>"I implore Master to take action!"</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord shook his head and stepped out of the divine palace.</p><p></p><p>His voice came from afar, entering the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Go put the corpses of these three disciples in the last main hall. You can stay in one of the twelve halls, but you must not take half a step out of the twelve halls!"</p><p></p><p>"Your master will go wake up the Celestial Beast now."</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang kowtowed without getting up!</p><p></p><p>Soon, tremors came from the main hall below his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"  </p><p></p><p>"Boom boom——————————"</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth sank, the ground cracked apart, and a violent rumbling came from the moon.</p><p></p><p>The mountain range that had been lying flat on the ground now stood upright, the twelve mountain peaks undulating like a waterfall hanging upside down.</p><p></p><p>The shaking peaks revealed a white glow.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a dozen huge beast horns!</p><p></p><p>Twelve beast horns, extending from the top of the mountain range all the way to its tail.</p><p></p><p>Boom——————</p><p></p><p>The ground trembled, a huge Celestial Beast standing on the moon.</p><p></p><p>The twelve beast horns radiated white light, illuminating each divine palace.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight in the sky was absorbed into the beast horns, releasing a terrifying aura. The disciples of the Celestial Stars Pavilion flew onto the Celestial Beast's back and firmly locked themselves in place, not daring to move around randomly.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu Zi, I'm carrying you all up to the moon, but I never said I would move around."</p><p></p><p>An ancient voice came from the Celestial Beast, shaking the scattered moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples on the twelve beast horns looked at the Celestial Beast in shock.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had heard the Celestial Beast's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Give me some face, so many people are watching."</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu Zi, did you care about face when you were shitting and pissing all over me back then?"</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of Moon Peak's face flushed red as he hurriedly said, "Esteemed Beast Sovereign, can I feed you something different?"</p><p></p><p>"You've been eating celestial bodies lately, what's the taste in that?"</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Lord has always forbidden you from eating demons, but now we're on the moon, so the Celestial Lord can't control the esteemed Beast Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"Shall we go?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, so the esteemed Beast Sovereign will reluctantly move around a bit."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast moved again, the ground sinking hundreds of meters into a deep pit.</p><p></p><p>As the Celestial Beast walked, more and more deep pits appeared behind it.</p><p></p><p>I beg for more subscriptions, please subscribe!

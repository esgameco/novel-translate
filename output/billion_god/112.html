        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing transmitted the Moonlight Grand Formation, the Star Harvesting Formation, and the Star Refining Formation to the Blue Star one after another.</p><p></p><p>During these past few days, Gu Jiuqing had been staying on the moon, witnessing with his own eyes the outrageous scale of the Dragon Country's construction efforts. </p><p></p><p>With the acknowledgment of the First Martial Saint, the twenty-three provinces of the Dragon Country devoted all their efforts to forging the three great formations.</p><p></p><p>Slabs of divine gold and blocks of divine materials were melted down in furnaces with modern technology and manufacturing processes.</p><p></p><p>In just three days, a three-hundred-meter Moonlight Grand Formation was laid out on the moon's surface.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p></p><p>On the vacuum environment of the moon, no sound could be heard. But when the Moonlight Grand Formation was set up, a thick moonlight essence was outlined, forming a vast fog.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the desolate moon, the thick moonlight essence condensed into white light, drifting like water around the three-hundred-meter formation.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the formation required the assistance of various divine gold materials and the catalysis of spiritual energy. Fortunately, Gu Jiuqing had brought many spirit stones, enough to activate the formation.</p><p></p><p>As the Moonlight Grand Formation officially activated, the three-hundred-meter formation was enveloped in a cloud of mist. Researchers gazed at the formation excitedly, arranging personnel to enter and construct the Star Harvesting Formation within.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation for the Star Harvesting Formation has been transported from all over the country. At most two days and it will arrive on the moon. After one more day of assembly, we can set up the Star Harvesting Formation under the first Moonlight Grand Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"According to the descriptions of the Star Harvesting Formation, it locks onto a great star, causing elemental magnetic forces to manifest between it and other celestial bodies, achieving a space-folding technique to traverse the starry void."  </p><p></p><p>"The first star to be harvested is the Valley God Star, the second is the Creation God Star. The Valley God Star has a diameter of 950 kilometers, the Creation God Star over a thousand kilometers. Capturing these two great stars will not cause any substantial harm to the Blue Star, and also meets the requirements!"</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to imagine, but these are stars over a billion kilometers away that we can directly summon to the moon through the Star Harvesting Formation."</p><p></p><p>"However, after capturing the great stars, we need to quickly set up the Star Refining Formation to refine them into Starseed Pearls!"</p><p></p><p>"The Valley God Pearl, Creation God Pearl project is officially launching!"</p><p></p><p>With the efforts of an entire nation and twenty-three provinces, Gu Jiuqing witnessed formation after formation of Moonlight Grand Formations being laid out. </p><p></p><p>The second was nine hundred meters wide, the third three kilometers, the fourth ten kilometers!</p><p></p><p>A ten-kilometer Moonlight Grand Formation could capture planet-sized celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star's scientists were going too far! After learning of the Star Harvesting Formation's unique space-folding technique, they aimed astronomical telescopes to capture the UY Scuti hypergiant star in the Scutum constellation!</p><p></p><p>This star's volume was fifty billion times that of the sun.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing learned of this, he was stunned by these researchers' ambitions.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Star's galaxy, the sun was one hundred thirty million times the size of Earth, while UY Scuti was fifty billion times larger than the sun - an astounding six hundred forty trillion times bigger!!</p><p></p><p>It was an outrageous number. Even Gu Jiuqing, who had attained the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit by removing seal after seal of truth, was briefly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"If this great star is harvested and refined into a divine weapon...?"</p><p></p><p>He dared not imagine it, could not fathom it.</p><p></p><p>And in the galaxy, there were other stars comparable to UY Scuti. This was just within the Milky Way galaxy alone.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the vast starry sky, Gu Jiuqing realized that compared to the Blue Star's cosmos, the Primordial Chaos' starry realms seemed pitiful in size.</p><p></p><p>Under the first Moonlight Grand Formation, the Star Harvesting Formation was laid out. After precise calculations of the Valley God Star's orbit, the researchers began harvesting procedures.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the Moonlight Grand Formation as the moonlight essence churned violently. Within the formation's Star Harvesting Formation, a brilliant beam of light erupted, shooting straight into the boundless starry void.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, this beam of light seemed to intersect the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, intertwining with the Valley God Star.</p><p></p><p>The Moonlight Grand Formation shuddered as moonlight essence within hundreds of kilometers surged inwards, concentrating into the Star Harvesting Formation.</p><p></p><p>The divine gold slabs and materials carved with intricate patterns in the Star Harvesting Formation transformed into the Way's principles, resonating with the heavens and earth, resonating with the Valley God Star.</p><p></p><p>A pale waterfall poured into the starry void. After a few breaths of time, the waterfall finally dissipated, and the formation stopped shuddering.</p><p></p><p>The harvesting of the Valley God Star was a success!</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the starry void, a celestial body orbiting its path slightly deviated from its original orbit, arcing towards the moon in a parabolic space-folding trajectory.</p><p></p><p>"It worked! It worked!"</p><p></p><p>"The Valley God Star has been harvested, quickly activate the Star Refining Formation with spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Gu Jiuqing saw the third three-hundred-meter formation outside activate.</p><p></p><p>The Star Refining Formation began refining the Valley God Star in the starry void into a Starseed Pearl!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing said nothing, as behind him stood the Dragon Country's highest echelons.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Country's seventy-two Sage Lords had all come to the moon to witness this moment.</p><p></p><p>The leaders of Linjiang City - the Martial Chief, the Mayor, the Cultural Secretary and others - were also present.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's status in the Dragon Country was solidified, unshakable by anyone.</p><p></p><p>It was on this day that Gu Jiuqing transmitted the Three Zhang Golden Body technique to the Martial Saint for cultivation, as well as the portrait painting of the Buddha to Elder Wen.</p><p></p><p>After staying on the Blue Star for around ten days, Gu Jiuqing finally returned to the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Sect's Celestial Abilities Cultivation Chamber!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes. "I have transmitted all the laws to the Blue Star. Now, all I need to do is wait."</p><p></p><p>Wait for time to pass, and the Blue Star cultivators' comprehension would accumulate to an astounding degree.</p><p></p><p>The transmission to Linjiang City was the experimental phase. Linjiang's leaders sealed off the city for three months, and Gu Jiuqing could do nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>The transmission to the Dragon Country's twenty-three provinces was the verification phase. The Dragon Country sealed off the cultivation of three billion people across the ocean, and Gu Jiuqing said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was ten billion or forty billion cultivators, a four-fold difference was neither too much nor too little.</p><p></p><p>In this verification phase, Gu Jiuqing mainly waited for the forging of divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Without divine weapons, he dared not absorb the Blue Star cultivators' cultivation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Once the divine weapons on the moon satisfied his cultivation requirements, he would open communications between the Dragon Country and lands across the ocean, allowing the Blue Star cultivators to enter the Demonic World and Yaoguai World for further transmissions.</p><p></p><p>He might even enter those two worlds himself, or seek out other worlds to spread the laws.</p><p></p><p>"The third phase requires no interference. I'll let each of these worlds develop freely, while I reap the benefits like a fisherman."</p><p></p><p>Spread the laws across the world, and calmly await the harvest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing retracted his thoughts. At his feet lay numerous paper cranes.</p><p></p><p>These were messages delivered by Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Infused with spiritual energy, the paper cranes materialized words in midair.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! The sect has instructed me to notify you that the Inner Disciple Trials are about to commence. Please make preparations, Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>The Inner Disciple Trials?</p><p></p><p>The outer disciples had outer disciple trials, the inner disciples had inner disciple trials, and naturally the true disciples also had trials of their own.</p><p></p><p>For the Sword Sect's trials, disciples typically traversed the Sword Gate to hunt yaoguai in the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was a newly accepted true disciple of the Sword Sect, and the true disciple trials occurred at fixed intervals. This upcoming trial would take place in a month.</p><p></p><p>That paper crane dispersed as another materialized words in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! The sect has instructed me to notify you that the Inner Disciple Trials have been delayed. There are reports that the demonic lair of the Demonic Lineage outside the Sword Gate is in turmoil. The Demon Lord's firstborn, the Demon Prince, has fallen. Yaoguai armies are besieging the area around the Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince had fallen?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's mind flashed back to his final moments against Zhu Yue.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he opened his left eye, an scorching heat radiated from it.</p><p></p><p>With a subtle shift of his eye, a double pupil manifested.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's left eye had transformed into a double pupil!</p><p></p><p>"Was it my divine gaze that incinerated the Demon Prince?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was doubtful.</p><p></p><p>That gaze was powerful, but incinerating a Pure Yang Immortal who had crossed numerous tribulations seemed nearly impossible.</p><p></p><p>At most, it could destroy the Demon Prince's physical body, allowing his primordial spirit to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Demon Prince's death had nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>A third paper crane rippled, words coalescing in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! A butler claiming to be from the Gu Family has arrived in the ancient Heavenly Abyss City in the northern regions. He is waiting below the Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>The final paper crane dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Xie has come to the Sword Sect looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Since joining the Sword Sect, Gu Jiuqing had not returned to the Heavenly Abyss Ancient City's Gu Family Estate. Too many things had happened recently as he traveled between the Blue Star and Primordial Chaos. He had nearly forgotten about the Gu Family Estate.</p><p></p><p>A stream of light shot out from the Celestial Sword Palace as a sword cultivator emerged and headed outside.</p><p></p><p>The grand gate of the Celestial Sword Palace opened, allowing the sword cultivator to enter.</p><p></p><p>In the divine hall, Lu Yuan stood before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, Lu Yuan's primal yuan aura had drastically changed. His Sun God Body's primal yuan had evolved into the Eight Trigrams Primal Yuan, restarting his cultivation from filling the first vertebra. Even his Wood Constitution had withered away, replaced by a new primal Wood Constitution sprouting new spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was no longer his former self.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator had become a true prodigy, comparable to...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Three Sword Immortals were evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>But under the guidance of the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder, surpassing the Three Sword Immortals and becoming a figure like the Demon Prince was only a matter of time.  </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Senior Martial Brother on coming out of seclusion, congratulations on greatly increasing your cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's period of seclusion this time was not very long, but too many things had happened in the Great Wilderness during those days.</p><p></p><p>"During Senior Martial Brother Gu's seclusion, the situation in the Great Wilderness changed dramatically, even the demons were stirred up."</p><p></p><p>"But what about the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord and the Demonic Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother is wise!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan flattered him, telling him all the information he had investigated.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that during this period, the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord of the Great Zhou Dynasty had been completely excavated, and the final immortal realm was broken through.</p><p></p><p>The great elders of the major sects, the Perfected Immortals of aristocratic families, the Celestial Immortals of Longevity, as well as the abbots of small sects, the imperial clan of the Great Zhou, all took action, smashing the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord into pieces.</p><p></p><p>More than ten Celestial Immortals fell, and even two Tribulation Immortals died.</p><p></p><p>"Many Celestial Immortals have fallen, and the Celestial Immortal of my Lu Family has also fallen."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's voice was slightly heavy.</p><p></p><p>Now the Lu Family only had this one Celestial Immortal cultivator left. Although the other Patriarchs were Celestial Immortals, they had been sitting in closed-door meditation for years. Once they came out, their spiritual energy would dissipate, and they would die soon after.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there's also White Jade Peak of our sect, the White Jade Sword Immortal, that is, Elder Qu!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu?</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Qu Family!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing thought of Qu Yaozhou and smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>In his youthful arrogance, he had killed Qu Yaozhou in front of the Qu Family Patriarch. Later, he became the foremost sword cultivator and joined the Mingting Peak.</p><p></p><p>The Qu Family from the Heavenly Abyss Ancient City had to come and apologize at their ancestral shrine.</p><p></p><p>He and Elder Qu had long been like water and fire that could not mix.</p><p></p><p>"This White Jade Sword Immortal led the sect's disciples to the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord, and they lost contact some time ago."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gloated over the misfortune.</p><p></p><p>"A Tribulation Immortal from the Constellations Pavilion fell, and the Grand Marshal of the Great Zhou imperial clan also fell. I heard that the Great Zhou has appointed another princess as the new Grand Marshal, which caused the great scholars to impeach, and the lords of the nine states all entered the imperial capital to remonstrate."</p><p></p><p>A woman serving as a marshal was unprecedented in the Great Zhou, let alone a Grand Marshal of that high rank!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Marshals of the Great Zhou were all Tribulation Immortals. What merit did this princess have to inherit the position of Grand Marshal?</p><p></p><p>"Things have been chaotic in the Great Zhou recently. The lords of the nine states are dissatisfied with the Zhou Emperor who inherited the throne nine hundred years ago, and there are rumors everywhere that the lords intend to rebel!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan continued, "That princess is the eldest princess of the Zhou Emperor, deeply favored by him. It is said that the Descending Three Worlds Buddha Dharma that was lost from the Great Thunder Sound Temple hundreds of years ago was actually stolen by this princess."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it seems this princess is called Princess Chengxiao!"</p><p></p><p>Princess Chengxiao!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing murmured this name.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the Scholastic Palace has issued a new ranking called the Dragon and Tiger List!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Tiger List!</p><p></p><p>This was a list created by the Scholastic Palace specifically for the talents of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Those who wished to be listed had to be peerless geniuses of the human race, with talents that appeared only once in millions. They were the greatest prodigies of the current era.</p><p></p><p>However, this Dragon and Tiger List only recorded the talents of the Great Zhou's nine states and did not include those from the four major sects.</p><p></p><p>"But I heard that our four major sects' great competition is also about to begin. The Scholastic Palace has already sent people to the Constellations Pavilion to record the talented disciples of this generation's four major sects and list them on the Dragon and Tiger List."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan knew a lot of information, serving as Gu Jiuqing's eyes and ears in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"With the Dragon and Tiger List being issued, won't the talents of the world inevitably fight over their rankings, causing unrest in the Great Zhou? Isn't the Scholastic Palace worried about this?"</p><p></p><p>Was this done with the approval of the Great Sacrificer Banshan Nuo, who was still alive?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, the fighting between the talents of the world is precisely so they can battle their way to a path of divinity."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Scholastic Palace issued the Dragon and Tiger List in order to gather the Heavenly Mandate! The first place on the Dragon and Tiger List is still vacant. Once someone becomes number one, they can condense the destiny of all the talents in the world, obtain the destiny of the world, and converge it into the Heavenly Mandate. A little fighting is naturally of no concern to them."</p><p></p><p>I see!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, the Sword Sect failed, and the Patriarchs of the Sword Sect fell.</p><p></p><p>There were the appearances of the Dao Ancestor and the Buddha Ancestor!!</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years ago, the Zhou Emperor died violently, and these two giants suppressed demons in the nine states.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing suspected that the Dao Ancestor of the Dao Sect and the Buddha Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect were collecting the destiny of the world! The Heavenly Mandate! Faith!</p><p></p><p>Using this to achieve the Dao and become divine!</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only Gu Jiuqing's guess. After the Dragon and Tiger List was issued, disciples of the four major sects would also compete for positions on the list.</p><p></p><p>The destiny of the Great Zhou, the destiny of the four major sects, would converge on the Dragon and Tiger List. At that time, the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor might take action.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Tiger List is also called the Earthly List. There is also a Heavenly List that records the paramount figures who have reached the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan took out a copy of the Heavenly List, which came from the Scholastic Palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took the Heavenly List, and at the very top were the two words "Dao Ancestor"!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>The number one in the world!</p><p></p><p>Although his name was not given, just those two words made Gu Jiuqing's heart stir.</p><p></p><p>Below the Dao Ancestor was the Buddha Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>And the third was the Sword Sect's Paramount Lord!</p><p></p><p>"My Sword Sect's Lord is ranked third in the world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed. The Heavenly List had been around for so long, yet the Paramount Lord had never emerged from seclusion. It seemed he either didn't care about his ranking or it was simply the reality.</p><p></p><p>Fourth was the Constellations Pavilion's Constellation Lord!</p><p></p><p>Fifth was the Demon Dao's Demon Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>Sixth was the Great Zhou Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Seventh...</p><p></p><p>Blank!</p><p></p><p>The six paramount Divine Realm experts recorded on the Heavenly List were undoubtedly the strongest in the world today, and no one dared to question the rankings of these six giants.</p><p></p><p>As for the other three Divine Realm experts of the Three Realms, if they were listed on the Heavenly List, there would certainly be those who didn't accept it.</p><p></p><p>And this time, the Scholastic Palace did not rank the seventh person.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Scholastic Palace had put a lot of effort into these two lists.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing finished looking at the Heavenly List, Lu Yuan finally said, "The Scholastic Palace has caused quite a stir, coupled with the opening of the Immortal Lord's tomb. But there has been no unrest in the Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sect's demonic lair was right outside the Sword Gate. With the Demon Prince dead, the Demon Emperor had emerged. It was said that the Sword Immortals of the Sword Sect had already entered the Great Wilderness to investigate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, sending the true disciples of the Sword Sect to the Great Wilderness for trials could very well result in them never returning.</p><p></p><p>Two Sword Immortals and several true disciples had died during the last Sword Assembly. The Sword Sect could not afford to lose any more true disciples, who were the future pillars of the sect.</p><p></p><p>That was why the trials were arranged in the Great Zhou instead.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any specific details about the Sword Sect's true disciple trials in the Great Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>Trials?</p><p></p><p>How would they be tested in the Great Zhou?</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, they would be tested by slaying demons and eliminating evil spirits. Whoever slew the most demons would be the champion of these trials.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan said in a low voice, "I heard that the sect is considering having whoever ranks higher on the Dragon and Tiger List be ranked first in these trials."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, hmm, that's possible. The four major sects' competition might also be canceled, and they'll all enter the Great Wilderness together for trials to compete for ranks on the Dragon and Tiger List."</p><p></p><p>The four major sects' competition was an event passed down for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The four major sects were all unsatisfied with each other in secret. If a disciple won first place in the four sects' competition, they would gain the opportunity to read any of the major sects' scriptures once!</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist Sect's Past Sumeru Sutra, the Constellations Pavilion's Future Constellations Sutra, the Dao Sect's Dao Scriptures, the Sword Sect's Sword Classics!!</p><p></p><p>These four great scriptures contained supreme and profound teachings and divine abilities, the most likely paths to reaching the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time, Lu Yuan finally stopped speaking.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had also learned about the recent events in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"I'll still need to trouble you, Martial Nephew, to go to the Sword Gate and bring my steward into the Heavenly Sword Palace."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the order, Lu Yuan descended from the Heavenly Sword Palace and flew towards the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>A figure descended from the Spirit Mountain. Now that Lu Yuan's status had greatly risen, he could fly within the sect without the enforcement disciples obstructing him.</p><p></p><p>He was the attendant of the foremost sword cultivator!!</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the Heavenly Gate as Lu Yuan's figure walked out from within. As soon as he exited the Heavenly Gate, a voice rang out in his mind palace.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy, I passed down the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye to you, and you used it to eavesdrop on the conversations of those Sword Immortals in the Sword Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, I've really blinded my own divine eye."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder was displeased.</p><p></p><p>This was the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye, ranked among the top ten divine eyes in the world.</p><p></p><p>It was even more powerful than the Buddhist Sect's Immovable Bright King True Eye.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, everything has its use."</p><p></p><p>"But why didn't you speak up for your Senior Martial Brother?"</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Immortal of your Lu Family is dead, and the Taiyi Divine Sword that your Lu Family has been refining for four thousand years is also on that stubborn fellow's body. Your Lu Family can no longer be considered a great aristocratic family now."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Primordial City, there must be many great aristocratic families wanting to swallow up your Lu Family."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan remained calm. "But don't I still have you as my master?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not capable anymore. All my divine abilities are sealed in the Underworld Pagoda. If you don't go and beg that stubborn fellow, your Lu Family will be devoured in just a few days."</p><p></p><p>As Lu Yuan pondered, he entered the Sword Gate. Below the Sword Gate, three dragon and elephant stone steles were shattered, and beneath one of the broken steles, an old man stood silently.</p><p></p><p>Begging for mercy! Begging for mercy!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

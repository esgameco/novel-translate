        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the wild area by the river, where the martial arts army was stationed. </p><p></p><p>Thousands of martial artists gathered in a dense black mass, training their dragon and elephant willpower!</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the army practiced much harder than anyone in Lijiang City. </p><p></p><p>They were experts in the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Dragon and Elephant Skill was made public, the Martial Arts Association personally requested students from the senior class 3 to perform the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill and sword drawing techniques!</p><p></p><p>They received full training in the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, plus demonstrations from great masters and even martial kings, allowing them to deepen their understanding of these two cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The sun was high overhead at noon.</p><p></p><p>The army baking under the sun showed no signs of practicing the Golden Crow Body Cultivation method to absorb the essence of the noonday sun - that would be a path to seeking death!</p><p></p><p>But allowing the sunlight to shine on them could still add a bit to their Golden Crow innate energy.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform, the Martial Arts Chief looked down with satisfaction at the martial artists below.</p><p></p><p>In these past two months, the strength of his subordinates had undergone earth-shattering changes.  </p><p></p><p>They even had ten more great masters now!</p><p></p><p>And over a hundred more masters!</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill tempers the skin, flesh, tendons, bones and organs. The body cultivation method allows one to transcend mortality and rapidly increase innate talents, while also strengthening vitality, energy and spirit. Cultivating these two methods together has greatly, greatly increased the strength of my Lijiang Martial Arts Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Standing beside the Martial Arts Chief was a hundred-year-old man.</p><p></p><p>He was from the same era as Old Man Wen, though his title was not as exaggerated as Wen Baike's, but he was also an old Martial King.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I cultivate the Yin-Yang Body Cultivation method, combining moonlight and purple mist into yin-yang qi. My yin-yang innate energy has already filled the first vertebra!"</p><p></p><p>"At most two more vertebrae of innate energy filled, and I can undergo Blood Transformation, directly breaking through to the Martial Saint realm."</p><p></p><p>"Then I congratulate Senior Thousand Moons in advance on reaching the Martial Saint realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Chief showed great respect to Senior Thousand Moons.</p><p></p><p>"What about me? Just standing beside you, I can already hear the sound of your circulating blood and qi."</p><p></p><p>"Your Golden Crow innate energy has already filled the second vertebra, hasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Thousand Moons sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>He thought his life was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>He had already ordered a coffin and found a burial plot, even setting the date for his cremation!</p><p></p><p>He could feel his great limit approaching!</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of the Dragon and Elephant Skill and body cultivation methods gave him a second life, allowing him to even become a Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of being that deity was.</p><p></p><p>There was a commotion on the high platform as a guard officer leapt up, showing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>This guard officer held a very high position, able to appear anywhere at any time.</p><p></p><p>His appearance caused the thousands of martial artists below to start in shock, all gazing up at the guard on the platform.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Chief, news has come from Lijiang City - that deity has appeared again!"</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>Appearing again?</p><p></p><p>Senior Thousand Moons grew excited, while the Martial Arts Chief beside him also showed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>In the eastern suburbs of Lijiang City!</p><p></p><p>The Lunar Flight Base.</p><p></p><p>In the two months' time, construction of the Lunar Flight Base had been completed.</p><p></p><p>A flying apparatus many times larger than rockets from centuries ago came into view.</p><p></p><p>Below the flying apparatus, hundreds of martial artists were carrying out the final touches.</p><p></p><p>Outside the base, an A4 sheet of paper was posted at the entrance:</p><p></p><p>"The Manned Lunar Mission is about to begin. Recruiting 100 lunar crew members. Good salary and benefits. Once selected, receive a housing unit in Lijiang City. Limited spots, top candidates chosen."</p><p></p><p>Many people had gathered outside the base entrance, all wanting to go to the moon, or rather, to receive the benefits of going.</p><p></p><p>Outside on the street, a group of elders walked at the front, followed by dozens of others behind them.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally been built!"</p><p></p><p>"Just this project alone cost 1.5 billion. The T20 materials produced by Lijiang's steel mills were all used on this big guy!"</p><p></p><p>"But it was completed on schedule per that deity's requirements."</p><p></p><p>The mayor walked at the very front, with the secretary beside him. Behind the secretary were the leaders of the three major conglomerates. </p><p></p><p>These five Lijiang bigwigs had come to inspect the Lunar Flight Base.</p><p></p><p>The mayor's voice rang out slowly.</p><p></p><p>"It's been over 40 days since that deity last appeared. Have you folks from the Lijiang Commerce Association made any progress these days?"</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the three conglomerates glanced at each other before Yang Zhan Tian finally responded.</p><p></p><p>"Huge progress. Previously we had already identified all the ingredients for the Blood Refining Pill. The Blood Refining Pill has eight ingredients, and we've found all eight!"</p><p></p><p>"We've also gathered all the ingredients for the Spirit Vein Pill and Separation from Deity Powder. We just need the pill formulas to be able to mass produce them."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhan Tian's news was quite delightful.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the nutrient solution paled in comparison to spirit pills. If they could mass produce pills, Lijiang's strength would increase dramatically!</p><p></p><p>"Mmm, in researching these spirit pills, we also discovered an interesting thing. In these pills..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"They use radishes as the main medicinal ingredient, and radishes make up a large proportion of the medicine."</p><p></p><p>The mayor's expression froze, surprise showing on his old face. </p><p></p><p>Radishes?</p><p></p><p>The main ingredient for refining elixirs?</p><p></p><p>Well, that's great! Radishes can be grown anywhere!</p><p></p><p>This is excellent!</p><p></p><p>As the group was about to cross the street to enter the Yueyue Base for investigation, the secretary's phone suddenly rang. The secretary quickly ran over to the mayor's side.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak in a low voice, and in front of the leaders of the three major groups, he spoke out about the matter.</p><p></p><p>"That deity has appeared in Linjiang. He's currently browsing the Linjiang forum online."</p><p></p><p>The deity has been missing for so long!</p><p></p><p>He's finally appeared again!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the mayor laughed heartily, "Good, good, the deity has finally appeared. Secretary, call the principal of Linjiang High School and have him contact the deity."</p><p></p><p>"Have the principal discuss the matters of refining Blood Elixir, Divine Vein Elixir, and Leaving Deity Powder at the Yueyue Base with the deity."</p><p></p><p>The secretary nodded and dialed the principal's number.</p><p></p><p>They were officials, and the principal was at least Gu Zixiu's superior on the surface, making him the best intermediary.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing casually closed the Linjiang forum.</p><p></p><p>During his absence, Linjiang City had developed in an orderly manner. All 800,000 Linjiang residents had embarked on the path of martial artists, and the Divine Body cultivation method had been made public. Countless martial artists began cultivating their spinal cords.</p><p></p><p>A few geniuses compatible with the Golden Crow Divine Body and the Yin-Yang Divine Body emerged and were taken away by officials for secret cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, a young sword saint had appeared in Linjiang City. Some people claimed to have seen this sword saint slice the moon in half with a single sword strike, though it was likely an illusion, it still demonstrated the sword cultivator's immense power.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill has been popularized among the masses, as has the Art of Unsheathing the Sword. Even the two Divine Body cultivation methods have been popularized."</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, I should pass down the secret of cultivating spiritual power ahead of schedule."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed his computer and was about to lie down on the bed to return to the Primordial Chaos and inherit his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his charging phone rang.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ling ling————"</p><p></p><p>The phone screen displayed the incoming call record.</p><p></p><p>"The principal!"</p><p></p><p>The principal is calling me?</p><p></p><p>And there's even a note on the phone!</p><p></p><p>It seems this is the note Gu Zixiu left for the principal.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, hello, I hope I'm not disturbing you?"</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>The principal's office!</p><p></p><p>The principal's expression was tense as he stood gripping the phone!</p><p></p><p>Next to him were more than a dozen phones that he had crushed.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of a Martial King, it took only a slight force to crush a phone.</p><p></p><p>"Principal, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The principal's face turned red!</p><p></p><p>He was the principal of Linjiang High School, a respected and esteemed figure, but now facing this "Teacher Gu," he felt like a student being punished, his heart pounding with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Well, you see, the college entrance exam is coming up soon, and the lockdown in Linjiang will be lifted soon too. Um, um, I was wondering if Teacher Gu would be available to proctor the students during the exam?"</p><p></p><p>"Not available."</p><p></p><p>"Not available? Ah, no problem then."</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Teacher Gu, about the matter of building a moon passage that you mentioned at the school before, Linjiang has already built a manned rocket and selected a hundred people to go to the moon. We're just waiting for your orders now."</p><p></p><p>"So fast? Good, good, I'll come to the school when I have time to discuss it further."</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing, Teacher Gu. We've analyzed the ingredients in the elixirs you gave us. We've figured out most of the components of the Divine Vein Elixir, Leaving Deity Powder, and Blood Elixir. All we're missing are the formulas, and then we can mass-produce them."</p><p></p><p>"Good, we'll discuss it together the next time I come to the school."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The principal looked at the ended call and let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In the office, several school board members hurriedly asked, "What did he say? What did the deity say?"</p><p></p><p>"He said he'll come to the school next time to discuss."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? When will he come to the school?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't mention that."</p><p></p><p>The office fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that just a waste of time asking?</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the call.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing put down the phone.</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot about the teleportation array and elixir refining. After inheriting my cultivation, I'll go find my senior martial brother!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lay on the bed, and his figure disappeared from Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sect, Heavenly Sword Palace, in the room for cultivating divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, "The college entrance exam on Planet Blue is coming soon. The three-month lockdown in Linjiang is about to be lifted. By then, the methods I've imparted will lead to the cultivation of one billion people. If I can spread the methods across the oceans, there will be three billion more people cultivating!"</p><p></p><p>Creation!</p><p></p><p>This long-awaited creation will finally arrive.</p><p></p><p>Begging for extra chapters on Monday and Tuesday!</p><p></p><p>Please, I beg you!</p><p></p><p>I seek the support of readers to help me reach the Three Rivers ranking!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

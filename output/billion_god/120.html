        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Creating a new race! Shocking demons and monsters! The sixth realm of the great diagram, the sixth realm!</p><p></p><p>Within the sixth realm, streaks of golden divine light flowed through the heavenly realm, layer upon layer of celestial palaces blooming brilliant beams of light, illuminating the uppermost layer of the great diagram in a brilliant glow. </p><p></p><p>There were also illusory fairy maidens walking within the celestial palaces of the heavenly realm, creating a lively scene.</p><p></p><p>"Kid! This is an illusory mirrored image. A supreme expert at the Divine Comprehension realm has drawn an illusory mirrored image in the Mud Pill Palace, and then used the power of pure yang to transform the illusory image into the real world!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the divine ability to move mountains!"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the Mud Pill Palace, that of the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder.</p><p></p><p>Far Away opened his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye, with the elements of heaven, earth, water, fire, wind, thunder, and water intertwining. His divine eye surveyed the heavens and earth, imprinting the layers of celestial palaces into his vision.</p><p></p><p>"But isn't this real? How could it be an illusory image?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder, borrowing Far Away's eyes, furrowed his brows as he gazed at the layers of celestial palaces.</p><p></p><p>Real!</p><p>Illusory!</p><p></p><p>These were also within the meaning of the Eight Trigrams, but the creator of this sixth realm great diagram had an understanding of reality and illusion that was on par with his own.</p><p></p><p>Who was it? </p><p>Who was it that created this sixth realm great diagram?</p><p></p><p>This great diagram was in the hands of the Demon Lord's Sixth Prince. Could it be that the Demon Lord himself created this sixth realm great diagram?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder's thoughts raced. A puddle of water condensed into a physical form, taking on a human shape to observe the heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion and reality are just two concepts. In an illusory world, illusion is reality. Just like this great diagram, in the heavenly realm, to those fairy maidens, we are the illusory images. They cannot sense our existence, so we become illusory images."</p><p></p><p>In the real world, illusion is illusion.</p><p>In the illusory world, illusion is reality, and reality becomes illusion.  </p><p></p><p>"This great diagram must have been created by the Demon Lord!" The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder could not help but admire the Demon Lord's talent.</p><p></p><p>Based on this great diagram, he could deduce that the Demon Lord's primordial spirit was even stronger than his own at his peak!</p><p></p><p>And this was just the primordial spirit!!</p><p></p><p>If combined with his spirit and divine powers, the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder would not be a match for this Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The great diagram is divided into six realms - the realms of Shedding Mortality, Divine Powers, Incomplete Perfection, Refining Divinity, Celestial Palaces, and Tribulation Conquering."</p><p></p><p>White mountains and black waters, white clouds and the heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly realm is the sixth realm. How could Far Away, a cultivator of only the Incomplete Perfection realm, be drawn into the sixth realm area of the great diagram?</p><p></p><p>Could it be because of this old man?</p><p></p><p>This old man has fused his primordial spirit, divine powers, physical body and divine abilities all into his imperishable true form, containing a trace of pure yang aura. So the great diagram mistook Far Away for a Tribulation Conquering celestial being?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder had after all cultivated into a pure yang primordial spirit existence. It only took him a few breaths to comprehend all this.</p><p></p><p>Far Away looked down at the world below!</p><p></p><p>White clouds drifted leisurely, the void was dark, and there were white mountains jutting out of the black waters, forming an ink-wash painting scene that was breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>According to the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder, this great diagram was refined by the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that a Demon Lord would have such refined interests.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, this is an opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder had glimpsed into the origins of the six realms great diagram and already investigated quite a bit of information.</p><p></p><p>His divine eye rippled, the eight trigrams attributes interweaving principles and reasoning - that was the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder controlling Far Away's two divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of various divine lights, the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder retracted his divine eye, his faceless countenance actually showing a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>Far Away's face was reflected on it.</p><p></p><p>"Although the six realms great diagram refined by the Demon Lord is quite strange, it is after all an inanimate object under the control of the Demon Lord's Sixth Prince. Let me impart you a secret technique - you can block off the Mud Pill Palace and escape from the sixth realm!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Far Away was a bit surprised. </p><p></p><p>"Leave the six realms great diagram? But what about Senior Brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not leaving the six realms great diagram, but leaving the sixth realm! Your true cultivation level is only the third realm, far from reaching the sixth realm standard. If you were to battle the Demon Lord at the third realm, he could extinguish you with just a puff of breath."</p><p></p><p>Far Away didn't really care either way.</p><p></p><p>What was so impressive about this so-called six realms great diagram? He believed Senior Brother Gu could break through it.</p><p></p><p>Space rippled, and Far Away's figure suddenly flickered before disappearing from the sixth realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, one of the celestial palaces shook, and a Tribulation Conquering celestial being broke through its shackles and stood where Far Away was just moments ago.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? I clearly sensed someone appear in the heavenly realm, but why did that person disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this person defeated the Demon Lord from the sixth realm era?"</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Venerable Elder of the Great Wind Clan revealed an astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>That was the Demon Lord at the Celestial Being realm! Was some supreme expert descending into the Celestial Realm?</p><p></p><p>He showed a hopeful expression.</p><p></p><p>"If such a powerful expert has descended into the Celestial Realm, it seems the demonic chaos will soon be suppressed by this mighty one!"</p><p></p><p>He looked delighted and entered one of the celestial palaces to await reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>He did not try to activate the Demon Lord's imprint!</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan had more than just him as a Celestial Venerable Elder - the other two were far more powerful than him. They were confident their strength surpassed even the Demon Lord of the same realm!</p><p></p><p>So he personally witnessed the two Celestial Venerable Elders battle the Demon Lord, only to be killed by him in just a few moves.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the entire sixth realm, he was the only remaining Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>In the third realm, on a white mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the third realm?"</p><p></p><p>Far Away curiously looked around at the surrounding world - white mountains beneath his feet, a dark void in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where do you think Senior Brother Gu is?"</p><p></p><p>"In the fourth realm? Or the fifth realm?"</p><p></p><p>The fourth realm of Refining Divinity, the fifth realm of Celestial Palaces!</p><p></p><p>Far Away thought Gu Jiuqing was at least a Refining Divinity expert. But the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder did not respond, only pointing towards the dark void ahead. "Take one step forward and you'll trigger the array formations of this great diagram, summoning the imprint of the Demon Lord from the third realm era."</p><p></p><p>Far Away did not step forward, but instead retreated a few paces.</p><p></p><p>"What are you worried about? With this old man guarding your Mud Pill Palace, the Demon Lord of the third realm is no match for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you trying to leave the six realms great diagram? If you don't defeat the Demon Lord, you'll be trapped here!"</p><p></p><p>Far Away frowned.</p><p></p><p>He believed Senior Brother Gu could rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Battling the Demon Lord would just be a waste of effort, wouldn't it? It's fine if he won, but if he lost he'd just get beaten up! If the power gap was too large, he might even be killed by the third realm Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>His path of cultivation was already set, why take such a risk?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder smiled, and the eight trigrams origins within his body rippled, a divine light piercing through the darkness to trigger the prohibitions of the great diagram.</p><p></p><p>Far Away's expression changed!</p><p></p><p>A demonic figure coalesced in front of him. In the blink of an eye, the demonic figure solidified, demonic auras swirling around it.</p><p></p><p>It was the manifestation of the Demon Lord from the third realm era.</p><p></p><p>Auras surged forth, concentrating essence, energy and spirit into a spiritual sense to lock onto Far Away!</p><p></p><p>Far Away inwardly cursed, but at this moment he had no choice but to battle the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Within Far Away's body, the eight trigrams origins rippled along each vertebra, slightly forming the Eight Trigrams Divine Body. The divine trees atop the Incomplete Perfection Mountain swayed, each divine ability fruit flickering incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"You old thing, are you trying to get me killed?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord attacked!</p><p></p><p>Devouring Demon Dominance!</p><p></p><p>A demonic furnace wove together overhead, dark auras devouring the cosmos to engulf Far Away.</p><p></p><p>This strike was too powerful. An Incomplete Perfection cultivator of the same realm, even if they had formed a great divine body, would be annihilated upon contact by this Devouring Demon Dominance.  </p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder also sensed the danger and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow has condensed an imprint standing at the peak of the Incomplete Perfection realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, quickly, let this old man control your physical body!"</p><p></p><p>Far Away released his mind and spirit. The figure atop the Mud Pill Palace moved, stepping out onto the thirty-fourth vertebra connecting to the head.</p><p></p><p>This thirty-fourth vertebra was the final step for a Refining Divinity cultivator. After opening the Celestial Spirit Aperture, they would refine this vertebra using the power of stars and constellations, transforming it into a celestial platform!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder wanted to control Far Away's physical body. He could either devour his spirit, or stand on this celestial platform - connected above to the Mud Pill Palace, and below to the Incomplete Perfection Mountain!</p><p></p><p>He chose the latter.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder's aura instantly radiated. The eight trigrams origin attributes rippled, slightly forming the Eight Trigrams Divine Body that emanated an imperishable intent!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord sensed it. "An imperishable true form, you're a disciple of the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder!"</p><p></p><p>Devouring Demon Dominance, tides surging forth, instantly annihilating the imperishable true form.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment!</p><p></p><p>Far Away's true form reassembled, his Eight Trigrams Divine Eyes shining, the eight attributes interweaving into a great diagram that enveloped the Demon Lord's figure!</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is the Eight Trigrams Divine Demon Diagram, depicting the image of gods and demons in this old man's heart!"</p><p></p><p>Divine beings had not appeared since ancient times.</p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder had naturally never seen a true divine being.</p><p></p><p>There were two "divine beings" in the Eight Trigrams Divine Demon Diagram, each with eight arms. An ancient aura emanated from the diagram, surrounding the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>"All of this old man's divine abilities are contained within these Eight Trigrams Divine Eyes. By depicting wind and fire, I can manifest the Wind Fire Divine Bridge!"</p><p></p><p>A divine bridge spanned the void, pinning down the Demon Lord below the diagram.</p><p></p><p>"By depicting heavenly thunder, I can manifest the power of lightning and thunderbolts."  </p><p></p><p>"By depicting mountains and marshes, I can manifest the profound weight of the earth."</p><p></p><p>"By depicting earthly flames, I can manifest the earth's primal fires!"</p><p></p><p>The two gods and demons in the divine demon diagram...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The demon lord supreme and the deities clashed fiercely together. The divine bridge bound the demon lord, thunder roared, and lightning snakes coiled around him!</p><p></p><p>A massive mountain appeared out of nowhere. A deity grabbed the entire mountain and wielded it like a divine weapon to suppress the demon lord supreme. </p><p></p><p>Another eight-armed demon god wielded the celestial flames of the earth, burning the dark void!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the demon lord supreme was beaten back step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The White Mountains shook. The demon lord supreme at the third boundary peak dissipated, leaving Luyuan pale-faced.</p><p></p><p>On the celestial platform stood the weakened Eight Trigrams Ancestor, entering the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, did you see clearly the Eight Trigrams Divine Abilities I manifested?"</p><p></p><p>His voice was feeble! If not for his intervention controlling Luyuan, Luyuan would have been instantly killed by the demon lord supreme on their first encounter.</p><p></p><p>And he could only suppress the demon lord supreme, not because he was stronger in the same realm, but because he wielded the perspective of the two-in-one state to subdue the demon lord who had not crossed boundaries!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I understood some of it."</p><p></p><p>"Then obediently stay in the great painting to comprehend it. Your image has already disappeared within the six boundaries painting, so now you can fly out of this divine weapon."</p><p></p><p>"But with your current cultivation, if you leave the six boundaries painting and encounter demons who have refined their spirits, you will undoubtedly die."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for Stubborn to go with you."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor's voice faded, leaving a puddle in the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan also noticed this ancestor's weakness, so he didn't dare say more, recalling scene after scene of the great battle just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>The Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lair!</p><p></p><p>Dark mist pervaded the surroundings, a place of demonic revelry, a forbidden zone for humans.</p><p></p><p>Supreme demons, some hundreds of zhang tall, some thousands of zhang tall, appeared vaguely in the mist, occupying the most vast regions of the Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Demon Lair.</p><p></p><p>A Lord gazed at a painting before him, frowning deeply.</p><p></p><p>And beside him stood a beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>The beauty wore a phoenix crown and misty robes, her hair bound up high with a branch bearing a few leaves.</p><p></p><p>"What's this? You have time to visit me recently?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord supreme waved his hand, the landscape painting before him tearing apart as flames ignited within, burning it to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"I received news that humans seem to be hunting you down!"</p><p></p><p>The beauty giggled, her two dimples exquisite, causing even the demon lord to look twice.</p><p></p><p>"Your information is quite resourceful to know that I'm being pursued by other Celestial Sovereigns. Why don't you lend a hand to help?"</p><p></p><p>The beauty walked to the demon lord's side, placing his hand on her chest.</p><p></p><p>"This body of mine has long been coveted by the other Celestial Sovereigns. If they obtain it, wouldn't that make you, the great Lord, a cuckold?"</p><p></p><p>"Could you bear that?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Such an unfeeling man. I should have gone to the demon clan's lair from the start."</p><p></p><p>"I hear the demon clan's lair has a Demon Emperor who is most charming."</p><p></p><p>The beauty's words made the demon lord frown repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, I won't tease you anymore. This time I've come to borrow your Wheel of Life and Death!"</p><p></p><p>The beauty reached out towards the demon lord, groping from his upper body all the way down, but still couldn't find the Wheel of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>The demon lord shook her off.</p><p></p><p>"I do have use for the Wheel of Life and Death! I can give it to you after some time."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the beauty emanated waves of pure yang energy!</p><p></p><p>The three-in-one state, pure yang like refinement, enveloped the demon lord supreme!</p><p></p><p>"I, the First Celestial Sovereign of the Demonic Dao, have attained the three-in-one state of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>The Second and Third Celestial Sovereigns have both attained the two-in-one state!</p><p></p><p>The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Celestial Sovereigns are all pure yang ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>Five great Celestial Sovereigns pursuing the First!</p><p></p><p>She could hardly bear it.</p><p></p><p>She came to this old lover the demon lord supreme, yet he outright refused her!</p><p></p><p>This vexed the First Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"You misunderstand. It's not that I won't lend it to you, but the Wheel of Life and Death will have great use soon."</p><p></p><p>The Wheel of Life and Death will have great use?</p><p></p><p>This supreme artifact, though not the demon lord's most powerful, possesses a unique attribute!</p><p></p><p>Life and death!!</p><p></p><p>It can transform life into death, death into life.</p><p></p><p>A sacred artifact among demons.</p><p></p><p>"You're going to move against the human race!"</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign's expression changed, then she smiled, "Of course, your eldest son died. If you still remain unmoved, the demons under you would not serve you."</p><p></p><p>"So which major sect are you targeting?"</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign looked outwards from the demon lair, having guessed the answer.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect! When will you move against the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord spoke indifferently, "We've already made our move."</p><p></p><p>So soon?</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign smiled!</p><p></p><p>If it were true, then her predicament could also be resolved.</p><p></p><p>The demon lord reached out to embrace the First Celestial Sovereign of the Demonic Dao, but his body trembled, revealing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The imprint I left in the six boundaries painting has been severed!"</p><p></p><p>"A human at the unbounded realm defeated my imprint from the same realm!"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord's words stunned the First Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>A human defeating the demon lord's imprint from the same realm??</p><p></p><p>She knew of the demon lord's immense power.</p><p></p><p>"That person was quite strange, having received the legacy of the Eight Trigrams Elder. Those divine abilities he manifested, combined with his grasp of timing, allowed him to subdue my imprint within a few breaths!"</p><p></p><p>"You mean the Eight Trigrams Elder possessed that youth?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord pondered!</p><p></p><p>That was the only possibility.</p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Eight Trigrams Elder re-cultivated to the unbounded realm, he could not be stronger than the demon lord.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Eight Trigrams Elder reincarnated by possessing a body, retaining the perspective from the pure yang period along with his profound foundation!</p><p></p><p>"Correct, otherwise in this world, among the same realm, there are less than a handful who could defeat me!"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord said proudly!</p><p></p><p>He understood his own cultivation very well, thus he dared say so.</p><p></p><p>"Did you include me in that count?"</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign of the Demonic Dao smiled, her heavenly mother's smile making the demon lord's lips curl up.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, why don't we have another battle to see who begs for mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Before the demon lord finished speaking, he sensed something else.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, "My imprint has been breached again."</p><p></p><p>Someone else had defeated his imprint from the third boundary period.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of blurred scenes appeared in the demon lord's celestial spirit.</p><p></p><p>His expression became increasingly grim, until finally a trace of terror emerged in his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign also detected the anomaly, staring at the demon lord in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Has a variable appeared?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord's pupils constricted, his body trembling violently as demonic aura erupted, a true form interweaving with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He held a divine wheel in the palm of his hand!</p><p></p><p>"A human! A divine youth has appeared among the humans!"</p><p></p><p>His tone was grave, the terror in his eyes gradually fading, yet still noticed by the First Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>A human divine youth who could terrify even the demon lord supreme?</p><p></p><p>Who was this?!</p><p></p><p>"This human divine youth, in the same realm, used only a single strike to defeat my imprint left in the six boundaries painting!</p><p></p><p>I saw this human divine youth cultivating a celestial spirit thirty zhang tall in the unbounded realm!!"</p><p></p><p>A thirty zhang celestial spirit?</p><p></p><p>How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>The First Celestial Sovereign's expression changed. Could the human race really produce such an immensely talented genius?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>"How does this human divine youth you speak of compare to Yueer?"</p><p></p><p>Yueer, Chu Xiangyu! She was the offspring of herself and the demon lord supreme.</p><p></p><p>Humans were far too weak, while demons were born at the pinnacle of the shedding mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to create a new race!</p><p></p><p>Using humans and demons as the foundation to create human-demon, human-monster hybrids.</p><p></p><p>And she had indeed succeeded, Chu Xiangyu's talent was the most terrifying genius she had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Even surpassing herself and the demon lord supreme!</p><p></p><p>"Worlds apart!"</p><p></p><p>"Before this human divine youth, in the same realm, Yueer could at most withstand two strikes!"</p><p></p><p>This was still the demon lord overestimating Chu Xiangyu.</p><p></p><p>One strike!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this divine youth could slay a human-monster hybrid in a single strike!</p><p></p><p>Silence pervaded the depths of the demon lair. After a long while, the demon lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>"My great demonic plan has been discovered by this divine youth, and is bound to cause upheaval."</p><p></p><p>"The blood sacrifice of the thirteen northern cities must be postponed."</p><p></p><p>This human divine youth could not possibly die in Qingzhou. Once he spread the news to the human race!</p><p></p><p>Their efforts would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Wait!</p><p></p><p>They could only wait!!</p><p></p><p>Wait until this human youth left Qingzhou without discovering their plan.</p><p></p><p>A few words, the average order is still 300 short before being recommended.</p><p></p><p>The editor told me to write long chapters, updating one chapter per day. Because Qidian looks at average orders for recommendations, if the average order doesn't meet the standard, even if the author goes to the partner site, they still can't get recommended.</p><p></p><p>So tomorrow I plan to combine chapters. Once the average order increases, I'll resume normal releases.</p><p></p><p>I'm asking for a wave of subscriptions, I only need 300 more average orders to get a recommendation.</p><p></p><p>I'm currently writing at an internet cafe since my home computer is broken..</p><p></p><p>I need to go code the second chapter, internet cafes are really expensive.</p><p></p><p>Spending money to write, that's just how it is for me 0.0</p>

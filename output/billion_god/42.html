            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The eighth metamorphosis began. With each metamorphosis, the old shell would be shed and a new one born. </p><p></p><p>The old deity dies, and a new embryo is reborn!</p><p></p><p>Each metamorphosis brought earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>During Gu Jiuqing's tenth metamorphosis, his golden blood essence transformed into a golden crucible, refining his entire physical body and flushing through him completely.</p><p></p><p>His skin became perfectly smooth and round!  </p><p></p><p>His flesh was immaculate and dustless!</p><p></p><p>His bones shone translucent and brilliant!  </p><p></p><p>His tendons were more resilient than any material!</p><p></p><p>His vital organs took on the form of primordial deities!</p><p></p><p>All his blood transformed into a golden essence!</p><p></p><p>The six levels of the martial realm on Planet Blue were already fully manifested in Gu Jiuqing's body. Leaving aside the power of dragons and elephants, his physical body was even more powerful than a martial sage.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh————"</p><p></p><p>As his body was continuously flushed, the dragon and elephant auras gathered above his head, forming a dense black mass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hastily touched the Dao fruit to receive the insights and cultivation of the divine body forging method.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao fruit, images flashed of insights into cultivating the Golden Crow divine body and the Yin-Yang divine body intertwining. Two terrifying primordial images even coalesced at the center!</p><p></p><p>One was a black raven, and the other a three-legged raven formed at the heart of the insights into the Golden Crow divine body.</p><p></p><p>Image after image assailed this three-legged raven, mutually verifying and perfecting it.</p><p></p><p>The black three-legged raven absorbed more and more insights, until red light began emanating around it, eventually shining like golden rays.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin of the three-legged Golden Crow!!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow shimmered, with three-legged raven after three-legged raven coalescing, absorbing more insights, mutually verifying and battling. Golden Crow after Golden Crow disintegrated in the Dao fruit, only to continuously re-form.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had no time to ponder as the insights into the Golden Crow divine body transformed into a vast ocean that he received.</p><p></p><p>[Eight people cultivated the Golden Crow divine body forging method]</p><p></p><p>[Of these eight, six were Martial Kings and two were great patriarchs]</p><p></p><p>Various scenes appeared that Gu Jiuqing witnessed.</p><p></p><p>He saw a martial patriarch circling beneath the great sun, gathering purple mists, refining the sun's essence to cultivate his own Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>His spinal vertebrae were opened one by one, with a three-legged raven coalescing and rising behind him.</p><p></p><p>A Martial King gathered the essence of the morning sun, using modern technological means and various mirrors to concentrate the sun's brilliant light and absorb it into his body, directly refining the dazzling solar radiance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Gu Jiuqing was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"It can be cultivated this way?"</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the sun's essence would normally burn one's spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>The soul is yin, and coming into contact with the ultimate yang force would instantly incinerate it.</p><p></p><p>So cultivators in the Primordial Chaos only absorbed the first rays of the rising morning sun.</p><p></p><p>But on Planet Blue it was different - they used technology like mirrors to continuously refract and amplify the sun's brilliance, while weakening its yang essence.</p><p></p><p>From sunrise to sunset, they could cultivate the Golden Crow divine body this way.</p><p></p><p>The six Martial Kings and two great patriarchs cultivating the Golden Crow divine body gained many insights that Gu Jiuqing also received.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow image formed within the flying horse carriage. At the base of his spine, a golden light shot straight up towards the ninth heavenly palace.</p><p></p><p>The human spine has a three-legged Golden Crow suppressing it - this instantly suppressed Gu Jiuqing's disintegrating physical body!</p><p></p><p>"Effective!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing then touched upon the Yin-Yang divine body forging method.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao fruit, scenes flashed of cultivators on Planet Blue practicing the Yin-Yang divine body method.</p><p></p><p>There were three Martial Kings and twelve great patriarchs all cultivating the Yin-Yang divine body!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed all the insights into this method.</p><p></p><p>[The Yin-Yang divine body separates the pure and turbid energies within the body. The pure energy rises to form yang energy, while the turbid energy descends to form yin energy.]</p><p></p><p>[In the morning, inhale the purple mists! At night, refine the essence of grand yin! Combine the purple mists and grand yin essence, allowing yin and yang to nourish each other and refine the yin-yang energy!]</p><p></p><p>[Primordial pure yin, primordial pure yang, refine the thirty-three heavens and penetrate Buzhou!]</p><p></p><p>The insights into the Yin-Yang divine body poured forth, and Gu Jiuqing also received its cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>At the first vertebra of his spine, the golden light of the Golden Crow and the yin...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The yin and yang energies of the divine body intertwined, taking the first of the thirty-three celestial realms as the foundation, evolving into the Impregnable Mountain, suppressing the entire physical body!</p><p></p><p>"The human spine has a total of thirty-four vertebrae. The first thirty-three vertebrae can be transformed into the thirty-three celestial realms. Once the thirty-three vertebrae of the spine are refined, there is still one last vertebra remaining!" </p><p></p><p>"As long as this last vertebra is refined, the path between the Impregnable Mountain and the Mud Pill Palace can be opened!"</p><p></p><p>"However, the last vertebra is too difficult to penetrate, so there is the method of refining divinity, opening the celestial apertures, borrowing the power of the celestial apertures to connect the thirty-three celestial realms, and in one burst breaking through the thirty-fourth vertebra, ascending to the celestial platform, entering the Mud Pill Palace, evolving the celestial palace, and condensing the primordial spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"The Impregnable Realm, the Divine Refinement Realm, the Celestial Palace Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing became increasingly clear about the path of cultivation. Within his physical body, two divine body images presided, with the Impregnable Mountain being more formidable.</p><p></p><p>The Impregnable Mountain had the effect of suppressing the eight directions and propping up heaven and earth. Gu Jiuqing's shattered physical body was suppressed, and the myriad draconic and elephantine forces that poured into his body finally did not crush it.</p><p></p><p>The golden blood essence rippled, the crucible disappeared, and the Baihui acupoint closed, marking the end of the tenth Shedding of Mortality.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>At Gu Jiuqing's first vertebra, another innate anomaly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was a draconic elephant!</p><p></p><p>A golden draconic elephant manifested on Gu Jiuqing's Impregnable Mountain, coiling together with the Three-Legged Golden Raven and the yin and yang energies at the mountain's base.</p><p></p><p>The various anomalies dissipated, leaving only the illusory form of the draconic and elephantine forces atop his head.</p><p></p><p>It was the power of five hundred draconic elephants.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched out his hand, grasping at the void. His five fingers rubbed and pressed against each other, emitting a terrifying explosive sound.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>Terrifying... with just this physical force, Gu Jiuqing could crush a cultivator at the Dharma Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators of the Impregnable Realm refine the divine body, opening the thirty-three vertebrae to suppress their own bodies. Now, with the three innate anomalies suppressing my physical body, the power of just ten Sheddings of Mortality far exceeds a cultivator who has just entered the Impregnable Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention adding the power of the five hundred draconic elephants above his head?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing began channeling the forces of the draconic elephants one by one.</p><p></p><p>The forces of the draconic elephants, one after another, poured into his body, blossoming at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>This power condensed between his fingers!</p><p></p><p>The illusory forms of the draconic elephants coalesced into grains the size of rice, swirling between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty heads...</p><p></p><p>One hundred, two hundred heads!</p><p></p><p>When two hundred draconic elephant forces condensed between his fingers, a sharp pain shot through.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and fifty heads!</p><p></p><p>Bang——————</p><p></p><p>His index finger exploded, flesh and blood splattering, the draconic elephant forces raging wildly!!</p><p></p><p>The five hundred draconic elephants seemed about to trample the void, reflecting into reality!</p><p></p><p>"With my current physical body, I can at most wield the power of two hundred and fifty draconic elephants."</p><p></p><p>And this was with the three innate anomalies presiding over the Impregnable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at his index finger, mangled flesh and blood, the bone clearly visible! Even the bone had cracks in it.</p><p></p><p>After dispersing the draconic elephant forces from his fingers, Gu Jiuqing's index finger self-repaired.</p><p></p><p>Golden blood essence flowed, and the three innate divine body anomalies fused into his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>After one breath, two breaths, three breaths, his index finger was restored to its original state.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, my physical body will not collapse."</p><p></p><p>The illusory forms of the draconic elephants entered Gu Jiuqing's body, then flew towards his spine, landing on the Impregnable Mountain!</p><p></p><p>The forms of five hundred draconic elephants crawled over the thirty-three tiers of the Impregnable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing groaned.</p><p></p><p>He felt a tightness in his chest, his whole body weighing down.</p><p></p><p>The bed he was sitting on instantly collapsed!!</p><p></p><p>"Crunch————"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing rose from the collapsed bed, carefully sitting down elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my strength has increased rather quickly."</p><p></p><p>I don't know if I can say this.</p><p></p><p>The monthly ticket ranking has increased rather quickly.</p><p></p><p>The recommendation ticket ranking has increased rather quickly. </p><p></p><p>The number of people giving donations has increased rather quickly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the ancestral city of Linjiang, the first Martial Arts Tournament had officially begun in the morning. </p><p></p><p>The high platform was the arena. As long as one could defend the arena by consecutively defeating seven challengers, they could advance to the finals!</p><p></p><p>However, no one had been able to fight for that long consecutively yet.</p><p></p><p>The citizens of Linjiang city all practiced Dragon and Elephant Fist and Sword Drawing techniques, with similar foundations. A single martial artist or grandmaster could not achieve the feat of winning seven matches in a row.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a great grandmaster entered the arena!</p><p></p><p>Ushering in the first climax of the Martial Arts Tournament!</p><p></p><p>At the school entrance, the exam officials and a few drivers who had gotten off the transport vehicle stared blankly at the high platform, unable to regain their senses.</p><p></p><p>Qi and blood!</p><p></p><p>That was qi and blood!</p><p></p><p>Vast qi and blood energy undulated, with dragon and elephant apparitions coalescing in the sky above the Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>Even the heavens were dyed blood-red, with a scorching sensation assaulting them from afar.</p><p></p><p>Those watching the martial arts competition were almost all martial artists themselves. Their emotions were provoked, their qi and blood energy rippling and intertwining. The qi and blood of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of people wove together, giving rise to a terrifying spectacle.</p><p></p><p>"The Southeast, Northwest, Northeast, and Southwest regions of Jiangnan City each have 100,000 stationed martial artists from the Martial Alliance. But even if those 100,000 stationed martial artists cultivated together, they could not possibly manifest such a terrifying spectacle of qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>The driver's face was pale, and the black shirt he wore made him look even more "tender."</p><p></p><p>He had been fortunate enough to witness the 100,000 martial artists of Jiangnan City's First Stationed Force cultivating together. When martial artists cultivated, their intertwining qi and blood only caused changes in temperature; it could never affect celestial phenomena.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky was stained blood-red, with white clouds dyed the color of blood. The temperature rose rapidly, and the dragon and elephant apparitions merged into a single, colossal, hundreds-of-zhang-tall apparition hanging high above Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle's legs went weak. He had seen a lot in his life, having been to the Western Mountain Province, Eastern Mountain Province, Southern Mountain Province, Northern Mountain Province, Jiangnan Province, Jiangdong Province, Jiangbei Province, Xijiang Province, Donghe Province, Nanhe Province, Beihe Province, and Xihe Province. </p><p></p><p>He had hunted mutant beasts in the wild, eradicated blood-sucking demon vines, been to Shennongjia and Changbai Mountain, but the scene before him still filled him with terror.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists... these people are all martial artists. Even those who look frail, those nineteen or twenty-year-old girls, are martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"No, among those young girls are grandmaster-level martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>Next to the smoking uncle, an exam official in a suit and tie stared at the spectacle of qi and blood, unable to hold back his words.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this official, there were three other exam officials.</p><p></p><p>They wore suits, standing upright with a dignified bearing - they were four grandmasters!</p><p></p><p>Grandmasters in their twenties would not surprise them with their level of discernment. But this was too many!</p><p></p><p>Among those youths were quite a few grandmaster-level experts who had reached the Refining Bones realm, and even some who had attained the Tendons and Bones Ringing in Unison level of a great grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>This small Linjiang City was a den of hidden dragons and crouching tigers - a hundred of them?</p><p></p><p>Or a thousand?</p><p></p><p>"Did you all feel it? Ever since entering Linjiang, it seems our inner qi and blood have become more exuberant."</p><p></p><p>"I can even sense the lingering spiritual energy in the air!"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was the first exam official, who stood over 1.9 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>"I felt it too," another exam official spoke up, looking towards the smoking uncle. "Eight Angles, quickly report this to the provincial capital. Linjiang is abnormal; we need reinforcements."</p><p></p><p>Being in Linjiang felt more ominous than being out in the wild.</p><p></p><p>They were all great grandmasters. When living in the wilderness, as long as they weren't surrounded by A-rank demonic beasts or encountered an S-rank demonic beast, life was about the same as in the city.</p><p></p><p>The smoking uncle named Eight Angles nodded, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Linjiang has been sealed off for three months. The city's network is still being repaired. To contact the outside world, we'll have to wait until the afternoon at the earliest."</p><p></p><p>The afternoon?</p><p></p><p>The first exam official frowned.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that some strange change had occurred in Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>This college entrance exam might just expose Linjiang's secrets!</p><p></p><p>He took a metal case from the transport vehicle, and the other officials and drivers also retrieved metal cases from the vehicle.</p><p></p><p>The group of people, filled with doubts, marched into the school grounds.</p><p></p><p>Four exam officials, three drivers, the smoking uncle Eight Angles, and a chief exam official - nine people in total, with the chief exam official, an elderly teacher of some renown in Jiangnan despite his low martial cultivation, leading the way.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the school's teachers noticed the exam officials and were greeted by the head of the disciplinary office.</p><p></p><p>It was now 2 PM on June 6th.</p><p></p><p>The school was quiet, with the first and second-year students already on summer break, leaving only the third-year students taking exams on campus.</p><p></p><p>The four third-year classes had been split up and dispersed into eight classrooms for exams.</p><p></p><p>The school's teachers invigilated, while the four exam officials patrolled the exam rooms.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to the college entrance exams before the Spiritual Energy Resurgence, and soon the only sounds in the exam rooms were the scratching of pens on paper.</p><p></p><p>Exam Room No. 1</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing scanned the room. Many students from Class 2, Grade 3 were here, including Huang Yuanyuan, Lan Bai, and Ning Que.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze lingered on Ning Que for a moment longer.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>She glanced over, and only then did she withdraw her surveying gaze. </p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing recognized the invigilating teachers in the front and back rows - they were teachers from the school. The two teachers were very relaxed and didn't monitor strictly, sitting on the stools with their legs crossed, leisurely looking out the window as if watching a martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>"This time! I, Yang Miaojing, will strive to be the top scorer in the college entrance examination in Jiangnan Province!"</p><p></p><p>If given the opportunity, she wanted to compete for the national top scorer.</p><p></p><p>And her biggest threats were Wen Daihua and Ning Que. </p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua was born with a sword spirit. It was said that she had reached the pinnacle of sword drawing arts, and even the CEO of Huaren Technology, Hua Yun, had mentioned Wen Daihua several times in front of her father.</p><p></p><p>Ning Que was the deputy class monitor!</p><p></p><p>When Teacher Gu first imparted the martial arts, Yang Miaojing was the first to break through to the warrior realm, and Ning Que was the second.</p><p></p><p>But Yang Miaojing was the daughter of Yang Zhangtian, she had no shortage of nutrients. She was also hardworking and diligent in her cultivation, which barely allowed her to suppress Ning Que.</p><p></p><p>Later, after Teacher Gu passed down the complete twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the classmates grew distant from each other. When Teacher Gu taught the sword drawing arts, the classmates went their separate ways. In any case, they all had the support of the CEOs of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce, so they didn't lack resources.</p><p></p><p>They devoted themselves to cultivation, all hoping to become Teacher Gu's prized disciples!</p><p></p><p>In secret, they were all vying with each other.</p><p></p><p>And the college entrance examination!</p><p></p><p>That was the battlefield for their contest.</p><p></p><p>The exam papers soon arrived in Yang Miaojing's hands.</p><p></p><p>The college entrance exam papers were written tests, which wouldn't be too difficult - almost everyone could get full marks.</p><p></p><p>The real challenge was the martial arts test the next day!</p><p></p><p>[If you encounter a black grizzly bear in the wild, and you have just entered the warrior realm with no weapons or battle attire, how would you choose to act?</p><p></p><p>A. Screw it, whoever is a coward is a son of a bitch.</p><p>B. Turn and run.</p><p>C. Climb up a big tree. </p><p>D. Cut off one arm to attract the black grizzly bear.]</p><p></p><p>The black grizzly bear was the black bear from before the revival of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years later, it evolved into the black grizzly bear, with immense strength. If a warrior encountered it, they would almost have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Fight? Can't win.</p><p></p><p>Run? Can't outrun it.</p><p></p><p>Climb a tree? What big tree could withstand the black grizzly bear's swipe?</p><p></p><p>Cut off an arm - the blood would attract the black grizzly bear.</p><p></p><p>Throw out the severed arm, it would attract the black grizzly bear's attention, giving you a 50% chance of survival!</p><p></p><p>This was the correct answer.</p><p></p><p>"These questions are all too simple. To pull ahead of Ning Que and Wen Daihua in scores, I can only rely on the last few big questions."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing flipped through the exam papers, and the last three questions appeared before her eyes.</p><p></p><p>[For the quasi-warrior, refine the skin; for the warrior, refine the blood. Skin and flesh are exchanged for life. Only by refining the skin and flesh can one refine the bones. If one refines the bones first, the skin and flesh will perish, resulting in a loss. The realm of the grandmaster - hundreds of warriors may not give birth to even one. Please expound on the relationship between the three aspects of skin, flesh, and bones.]</p><p></p><p>[Seventy-two Blood Sage Warriors have already emerged nationwide, also known as the Seventy-Two Sages. On the third day of the third month, the chairman of the Jiangnan Province Martial Arts Alliance will come to Jiangnan No. 1 High School in person. Under his guidance, some students will break through to the quasi-warrior realm on the spot. The skin-refining realm depends on oneself or external forces. Years of bitter cultivation cannot compare to the guidance of a Martial Sage. Please state your viewpoint.]</p><p></p><p>[Refining the skin, flesh, bones, tendons, and organs, and exchanging the blood - these are the six realms of the warrior. The revival of spiritual energy has lasted five hundred years, but even the First Martial Sage has been stuck in the Blood Sage realm for two hundred years. Is there a path beyond martial arts? Has the revival of spiritual energy reached its end? If there is a path forward, please state your viewpoint.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing these three major questions, Yang Miaojing shook her head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it seems this year's top scorer can only be contested among us classmates."</p><p></p><p>Weren't these just giveaway questions?</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing wrote her answer:</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts has not ended. The six warrior realms are only the foundational realms of martial arts; beyond the six warrior realms is the Human Immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>The Human Immortal realm is the pinnacle of martial arts, at least the current pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>What is a Human Immortal? By cultivating the incomplete human body and opening the myriad celestial acupoints, condensing the three essences of vitality, energy, and spirit, and gathering the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth - this is the realm of the terrestrial immortal. The three essences converge at the crown, and the five elements pay homage to the primordial!</p><p></p><p>The human spine has thirty-four vertebrae, of which thirty-three are interconnected, like thirty-three heavens. For the fleshly body, they are the celestial pillars supporting the heavens, the Incomplete Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Refining the Incomplete Mountain and opening the path of spiritual body cultivation is to become an Earth Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Condensing three hundred and sixty-five celestial acupoints and piercing through the profound celestial and earthly gates, borrowing the power of the revolving stars and constellations - this is to become a terrestrial immortal.</p><p></p><p>At the pinnacle of the terrestrial immortal realm, the three essences converge on earth, and the five elements pay homage to the primordial.</p><p></p><p>This is the method of refining the spiritual body, the Golden Crow Divine Body Forging Method!</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing paused, putting down her pen and looking to her side.</p><p></p><p>An invigilator was standing beside her, staring at the answer she had written.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, is there something you need?" Yang Miaojing asked, seeing the invigilator standing beside her.</p><p></p><p>"No, nothing, you continue answering the questions."</p><p></p><p>The 1.9-meter-tall invigilator circled the exam hall and then stood beside Yang Miaojing again, watching her answer.</p><p></p><p>On his face, his features were scrunched together as if constipated, and his arms were trembling unconsciously, with faint sounds of bones and tendons ringing coming from his body.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be a substantial portion of a copyrighted novel. Reproducing full chapters or large sections of novels would constitute copyright infringement. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a scene taking place within a mystical bronze palace. A young person wearing a veil confronts a Buddhist monk figure, accusing him of pursuing their younger brother. The monk expresses awe at the nine heavenly realms within the palace, which seem to exist within the body of an ancient immortal being. </p><p></p><p>The veiled youth then reveals themselves to be a powerful deity capable of unleashing divine flames. They incinerate the monk's male spiritual form. The deity appears to be seeking something called the "dao fruit" from the ninth heavenly realm. There are references to ancient gods, immortals, and the origins of the universe itself.</p><p></p><p>Another character, Gu Jiuqing, enters and senses his friend Liang Xiao has set up a trap in this realm. As a powerful Buddhist monk presence arrives, the excerpt ends.</p><p></p><p>I've tried to capture the overall context and flow of events without reproducing too much verbatim text from the copyrighted work. Please let me know if you need any clarification on this summary.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His facial features were rugged, with half of his female form disappearing, the disappearing half transforming into a male form. </p><p></p><p>Yin and yang combined into one body, with the male and female forms each occupying half.</p><p></p><p>Ferocious!</p><p></p><p>Agonizing!</p><p></p><p>It appeared on his face, and the pure yang energy within his body was also halved.</p><p></p><p>The male form of the Bodhisattva was slain, leaving only the female form. Now the true form of the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva had received this news.</p><p></p><p>"Kill kill kill!"</p><p></p><p>The three words "kill" dyed the void blood-red.</p><p></p><p>"This Bodhisattva suddenly flew into a rage."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing watched as myriad Buddhist seals fell from the heavens. He quickly acted, gathering the power of over a million dragon and elephant heads into his palms, shattering the Buddhist seals one by one.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish——————</p><p></p><p>Strands of red hair fell upon the Bodhisattva's body. His figure no longer wavered as his true form solidified. His aura was half of its peak, nearly falling from the pure yang realm.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly poised between the nine-cycled celestial human and the pure yang ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"You all deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva only knew that half of his true form had fallen within the nine heavenly realms, but he did not immediately flee.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he attacked Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The void exploded as sixteen arms flew out simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's true form evolved, his pure yang aura rippling, bringing great terror in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, quickly retreat!" </p><p></p><p>The voice of Senior Brother Liang Xiao came from behind. Gu Jiuqing grabbed Lu Yuanhuali and left the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the oppressive pressure of a great weapon surged forth.</p><p></p><p>A divine might that covered the world, pervading the first heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, a cultivator held two great weapons, cradling a precious vase in his left hand and gripping a large bell in his right.</p><p></p><p>The two great weapons activated strand after strand of the Way's markings, at least five thousand markings each.</p><p></p><p>Under this divine might, the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>But the sixteen arms still descended, each arm wielding a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang energy enveloped the divine weapons, intertwining with the arms, disrupting the void!</p><p></p><p>"Boom————"  </p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>Two divine strikes appeared simultaneously, forcing Senior Brother Liang Xiao back several steps.</p><p></p><p>He had already activated the two great weapons, having prepared for some time!</p><p></p><p>The markings of the Way connected to the heavens, brilliant rays of light surging into the mortal realm towards the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand-Armed Buddha Palm!"</p><p></p><p>This divine skill was recorded in the Great Compendium of Divine Skills.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had seen Senior Brother Liang Xiao use the Thousand-Armed Buddha Palm for cleaning before.</p><p></p><p>Now, a Bodhisattva was using the Thousand-Armed Buddha Palm, with myriad Buddha arms rising in the void to block the two great weapons.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang energy refined, and two thoughts fell from the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's primordial spirit, only to be crushed between his fingers!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang energy erupted, a thousand arms hanging in the void, intertwining with the sixteen arms.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were filled with radiance, the primordial light enveloping half of the first heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Figures appeared within the first heavenly realm - it was the talents of the Great Wilderness entering the Bronze Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>They had just set foot in this place when they saw the boundless divine light blooming in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly vault was torn apart, the void collapsed, and the divine might rippled. Their hearts of the Way slightly wavered.</p><p></p><p>"That is...!"</p><p></p><p>As the primordial light dissipated, only rows of white bone arms hung across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Of the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's sixteen arms, only two remained with flesh and blood, the other fourteen turned to white bones, with even the bones showing cracks.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Armed Buddha Palm dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Whew——————"</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva exhaled deeply, his pure yang energy returning once more.</p><p></p><p>The vitality of a pure yang ancestor was too tenacious!</p><p></p><p>He withstood the strike of the two great weapons, unable to kill him.</p><p></p><p>And this was when the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva only had half his full power.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Sword Sect's madman!"</p><p>"The Sword Sect's madman is attacking the Bodhisattva!"</p><p></p><p>Even the cultivators were surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although they were talents of the heavens, they had not yet fully matured, far from being a match for these undying elders.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Sword Sect's madman actually attacked a Bodhisattva of the Buddhist Sect here?</p><p></p><p>His gall was too great!</p><p></p><p>Two figures flashed across the boundless heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva roared, a giant lotus rippling beneath his feet as he flew towards the depths of the first heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Only they were left standing there, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Arhat and Tiger Subduing Arhat, two Buddhist disciples, rode the Buddhist light in pursuit, concerned for the Bodhisattva's safety.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Sword Sect cultivators also wielded their sword light, flying towards the distant heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, these figures all flew towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The void was vast, with white clouds drifting.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's face was covered in eyes as he observed the heavens and earth around him. The two primordial spirits within the Mud Pill Palace were still studying.</p><p></p><p>The manifestation that had just controlled the two great weapons and unleashed the divine strike was merely one of his avatars.</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Jiuqing, Senior Brother Liang Xiao sat cross-legged in the void.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding divine light converged, forming white clouds in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva is coming," Gu Jiuqing reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Senior Brother Liang Xiao withdraw his spirit eyes. He stood up, gazing at the heavenly realm, and sighed, "Junior Brother, do you know? This is the nine-fold heavenly realm of the celestial beings!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's face was full of astonishment as he observed the heavens and earth, continuing, "The nine-fold heavenly realm envelops the Mud Pill Palace, protecting the primordial spirits. For celestial beings, longevity is no longer a concern."</p><p></p><p>Time erodes all things, but to erode a pure yang primordial spirit, one must first erode the nine-fold heavenly realm!</p><p></p><p>It would take tens of thousands of years just to erode a pure yang primordial spirit, let alone the nine-fold heavenly realm, which would require even more countless years.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, look at this first heavenly realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think this first heavenly realm is empty. When the celestial beings were in the world, the heavenly realms were filled with divine natures!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked, "Senior Brother, do you mean the celestial beings hid their divine natures within the nine-fold heavenly realm?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao nodded. "Yes, we store our spiritual power in our dantians and spirit apertures, but celestial beings are different. After the three became one, their primordial spirits, physical bodies, and spiritual powers all became pure yang, without dantians or spirit apertures. Only after cultivating to celestial beings would they develop new spiritual powers."</p><p></p><p>"And these spiritual powers would appear within each of the heavenly realms, accompanied by divine natures!"</p><p></p><p>Pure yang spiritual powers, divine nature spiritual powers!</p><p></p><p>Two stages.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao wanted to continue speaking, but the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's aura had already locked onto them.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stepped forward, smiling, "Junior Brother, watch your Senior Brother's skills!"</p><p></p><p>The plan to slay the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva was about to begin!!</p><p></p><p>"You little bugs, gathering together saves me the trouble of finding you."</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's figure entered the boundless heavens.</p><p></p><p>An ancient forbidden formation bloomed amidst the clouds, rays of divine light transforming into sword after sword, piercing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's figure did not retreat but advanced, his body wavering as his pure yang energy shattered the myriad swords.</p><p></p><p>Child's play.</p><p></p><p>He dared to barge into the Ancient Sword Mountain, so he was not afraid of the forbidden formation Senior Brother Liang Xiao brought from the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>The swords vanished, but sword intent lingered in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva took another step forward, and another cloud burst open, transforming into whirling hurricane winds forming a killing array. But the Bodhisattva simply blew at the hurricane winds, his pure yang energy scattering them into dust that merged with the lingering sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The third cloud grew into an enormous divine tree, its forbidden formation rippling, only to be slapped away by the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>The fourth cloud, the fifth cloud - dozens of clouds were torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva appeared before Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Flee? Where can you flee to?"</p><p></p><p>The Guangping Dali Bodhisattva placed his palms together, staring at Gu Jiuqing and Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He was too powerful. Every pure yang ancestor was an unmatched talent in their time. To reach this step, they had virtually no weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with their formidable vitality, it was nearly impossible to slay them.</p><p></p><p>Yet Senior Brother Liang Xiao remained calm, meeting the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Jiuqing's watchful eyes, Senior Brother Liang Xiao made his move.</p><p></p><p>He raised two fingers, slicing through the boundless heavens and earth as if to tear apart the void itself.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, have you heard of the One Sword that takes the Realm as its Blade?"</p><p></p><p>Taking the Realm as the Blade?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not recall any such divine skill recorded in the Sword Sect's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed a terrifying sword intent rising from the heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>A faint sound reached his ears - the boundless ringing of swords.</p><p></p><p>The forbidden formations shattered by the Guangping Dali Bodhisattva scattered across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Containing the elements of earth, water, wind, and fire!</p><p></p><p>The five primordial elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth!</p><p></p><p>The wills of myriad Daos scattered throughout this first heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>"Swish——————"</p><p></p><p>The void rippled, and the heavenly realm beneath their feet trembled.</p><p></p><p>This first heavenly realm suddenly broke away from the second, third, and eight other heavenly realms, becoming an independent realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that with my current cultivation, even taking full advantage of the heavenly timing, geography, and circumstances, I can only unleash one sword strike."</p><p></p><p>"Nine Heavens Ten Lands Demon-Slaying Divine Sword!"</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme divine skill that took the heavens and earth as its blade!</p><p></p><p>This was Senior Brother Liang Xiao's most powerful divine skill!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p>

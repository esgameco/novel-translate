        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Excitement!</p><p></p><p>Shock! </p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Those were the bigwigs of the Dragon Kingdom, all gracing Linjiang High School with their presence.</p><p></p><p>One great figure after another, who had only appeared in the news before, surrounding the true core personage of the Dragon Kingdom, stepped into Linjiang one by one. </p><p></p><p>Outside of Linjiang City, fighter jets were stationed in the wild, with tens of thousands of troops from the provincial capital of Jiangnan rushing over, enveloping Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>On the exam sites of college entrance exams at various universities, these scenes at Linjiang High School were projected, and at this moment, all universities suspended their exams, all eyes turned towards the screens.</p><p></p><p>On the playground.</p><p></p><p>Students still waiting for the test, or those who had just gone through the spiritual power test, also noticed the anomaly and looked towards the school gate.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of people poured into the school, heading towards the playground.</p><p></p><p>After entering the playground, these people stood at a distance observing, without saying a word, just quietly watching them.</p><p></p><p>In the front row stood four middle-aged men, dressed ordinarily in long robes over undergarments, which were official custom-made uniforms.</p><p></p><p>The second row had four more people than the first.</p><p></p><p>The eight people were all in their late forties or fifties, with some elders looking venerable.</p><p></p><p>The third row had even more people, about twenty or so, each with a decent spiritual demeanor, only concealing their essence inwardly!</p><p></p><p>The fourth row was the last, with the most people standing, about thirty. The driver and the smoking uncle were also in this row, but standing on the far left.</p><p></p><p>The four Linjiang exam officials were stunned!</p><p></p><p>"The Grand President! That's the Grand President!"</p><p></p><p>They came from the provincial capital and had the fortune of seeing the Grand President of the Jiangnan Province Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He was a Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>The Grand President of Jiangnan Province stood on the far left of the third row, his spirit vigorous, his entire Martial Saint's aura completely restrained and inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"A Martial Saint standing in the third row?"</p><p></p><p>One's standing position could represent one's status.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Saint could not even stand in the second row, let alone the first.</p><p></p><p>Then what status did those standing in the front two rows hold??</p><p></p><p>The highest rulers of the Dragon Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>The great Master Lu Jiuling felt a chill, looking pleadingly at Teacher Jing'an for help.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an was an associate professor at the Dragon Academy. Above him were professors, associate deans, and deans!</p><p></p><p>In the crowd, he saw four deans of the Dragon Academy in the second row.</p><p></p><p>"All four deans have come!"</p><p></p><p>With his status, to meet the deans of the Dragon Academy, he would need to file a report first, get approval from a regular professor, who would then report to the associate dean, and then the associate dean would review it and report to the dean - only then might he have a chance to meet the four deans.</p><p></p><p>The four deans were the nation's important figures, promoting martial arts curricula, advocating martial arts for all citizens. The martial arts textbooks used in the past century were almost all written by these four.</p><p></p><p>The writing of the Six Realms of Body Refining, Bone Forging, Tendon Changing, Purifying the Filth, and Blood Exchanging also owed some credit to them.</p><p></p><p>The four deans of the Dragon Academy had simultaneously left the imperial capital and come to Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>They attached great importance to the future of martial arts that had emerged in Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, since the deans of the Dragon Academy are here, we no longer need to worry about Linjiang's affairs."</p><p></p><p>"Little Lu, bring up the spirit power testing device. This is still the college entrance exam, we should continue testing the students."</p><p></p><p>After all, Teacher Jing'an was an associate professor at the Dragon Academy. After a brief daze, he quickly organized the four exam officials to conduct the next round of testing.</p><p></p><p>The huge testing device was carried onto the table. The college entrance exam instrument for testing spirit power was similar to the ordinary spirit power tester, only much larger.</p><p></p><p>That liquid crystal display screen was over one meter tall, able to accurately show each student's exact spirit power value.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an took a scoring sheet and wrote "Qualified" for the spiritual power test section, before looking at the name on the sheet.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll call out a name, and that person come up for spirit power testing."</p><p></p><p>"Ning Que!"</p><p></p><p>One of the hundred students who had just tested spiritual power stepped out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Que from Class 2, Grade 12!"</p><p></p><p>"So he's Ning Que?"</p><p></p><p>"From the Class 2 of Grade 12, it seems this person's ability must be above ours."</p><p></p><p>The other Linjiang high school exam class students revealed envious looks.</p><p></p><p>How could they not envy?</p><p></p><p>Class 2, Grade 12!</p><p></p><p>That was the super strong class!</p><p></p><p>The other classes, 1, 3, and 4, were all regular classes.</p><p></p><p>The super strong class had forty-five students, all dragons and phoenixes among men, and Ning Que was one of the top among them.</p><p></p><p>He strode past the crowd and stood under the spirit power tester, naturally extending his arm into the device.</p><p></p><p>The four exam officials and Teacher Jing'an had solemn expressions, looking at this arm as if they had seen a ghost, their eyes revealing an unimaginable gaze.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure this is the arm of a high school student?"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a Grade 12 student?</p><p></p><p>Pure white!</p><p></p><p>Smooth!</p><p></p><p>Not a single impurity!</p><p></p><p>That was not all - on his fingers, even his entire palm and the whole arm, there were no needle marks at all.</p><p></p><p>As high school students, in order to boost their spirit power values to 1 and become martial artists, they would check their spirit power periodically.</p><p></p><p>But this student named Ning Que had no needle marks on his arm!</p><p></p><p>Did he never test his spirit power value?</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an could only keep this doubt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The tester secured Ning Que's arm, and a fine needle shot out, piercing his index finger.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The screen on the tester did not react, the spirit power value did not display.</p><p></p><p>This scene!</p><p></p><p>Was captured by the surveillance cameras and projected onto screens at other college entrance exam sites.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit power tester in Linjiang is broken!"</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, there are problems with the Linjiang exam, no wonder it has attracted such high-level attention."</p><p></p><p>"This is just the first test taker, and they've already encountered such a major issue. Linjiang is rotten and needs to be cleaned up!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an looked at Ning Que and adjusted the tester's power to maximum.</p><p></p><p>The other four exam officials flinched.</p><p></p><p>They all understood Teacher Jing'an's intention.</p><p></p><p>"Try again."</p><p></p><p>Ning Que did as instructed, and this time when the needle shot out, it instantly pierced his index finger.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the over one-meter tall display screen on the tester lit up.</p><p></p><p>1.8!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This number violently struck the hearts of the other exam students.</p><p></p><p>A spirit power value of 1.8, exceeding a martial artist by a whole 0.8 units.</p><p></p><p>Not many nationwide exam students could calmly watch the screens, at most just a dozen or so.</p><p></p><p>"It jumped! It jumped again!!"</p><p></p><p>"This was just the initial display??"</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an held his breath - this was exactly what he had expected. The low power previously could not pierce Ning Que's skin.</p><p></p><p>"2.0!"</p><p></p><p>"3.3!" </p><p></p><p>"5.8!"</p><p></p><p>"8.9!"</p><p></p><p>"9.9!"</p><p></p><p>The numbers on the tester's display screen jumped rapidly, they could only see the string of numbers leaping madly.</p><p></p><p>Each new number display made their hearts sink further.</p><p></p><p>As fellow high school exam students, how could the gap be so huge??</p><p></p><p>Among all Grade 12 students nationwide, ninety-nine percent had spirit power values below 1, only the remaining one percent were martial artists!</p><p></p><p>And now, even those remaining one percent martial artist high schoolers had their mentalities shattered.</p><p></p><p>9.9!</p><p></p><p>That was the peak of a martial artist's spirit power, just 0.1 more would be a Master's spirit power!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible sound blasted all the high school exam students across the nation, watching those display screens at their respective exam sites!</p><p></p><p>"10.8!"</p><p></p><p>"10.9!"</p><p></p><p>"12.3!"</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the spirit power value of 10, the number on the screen finally stopped at 12.3 without further jumping.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an and the four exam officials instinctively looked at the tester, thinking it must be broken.</p><p></p><p>A Master??</p><p></p><p>The first exam student was already a Master??</p><p></p><p>This?!!</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an raised his head to look at the distant crowd.</p><p></p><p>He saw the four deans, seeming to plead for help from them, but that group remained silent, watching the playground without reaction.</p><p></p><p>Just a single Master!</p><p></p><p>During their time in power, they had seen too many youthful prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say they themselves were martial arts prodigies - an eighteen-year-old Master was nothing rare to them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his plea for help was futile, Teacher Jing'an could only continue the testing.</p><p></p><p>"Next, Feng Buping."</p><p></p><p>A male student walked out from the crowd, looking somewhat apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Ning Que's spirit power value had just reached 12.8, how could he possibly compare?</p><p></p><p>He extended his arm into the tester, and soon the display showed a string of numbers, eventually settling at 5.3!</p><p></p><p>The youth looked disheartened, merely glancing at the spirit power value before hurriedly leaving the exam site.</p><p></p><p>"5.3? This is a 5.3 spirit power value?"</p><p></p><p>Dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>The other students watching the Linjiang exam were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had thought this test taker's spirit power value would be around 0.98, otherwise why would he act so awkward and shy.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the value appeared that they realized how greatly mistaken they were.</p><p></p><p>He was actually also a martial artist, and moreover his spirit power value reached 5.3!!</p><p></p><p>A mid-level martial artist!</p><p></p><p>Unimaginable that such a shy and awkward person would be a mid-level martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Yuanyuan, spirit power value 9.7!"</p><p></p><p>"Xue Sixin, spirit power value 7.6!"</p><p></p><p>"Yu Yang, spirit power value 6.6!"</p><p></p><p>"Wu Yuying, spirit power value 6.8!"</p><p></p><p>"Tao Yifan, spirit power value 5.6!"</p><p></p><p>"Dong Yixiang, spirit power value 5.8!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The subsequent test results opened everyone's eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>Not a single Linjiang high school exam student had a spirit power value below 5.3!</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>No wonder that candidate was so distraught - he scored the lowest among the Linji candidates, but nationwide he was almost the top scorer!!</p><p></p><p>"Lan Bai, vital energy 9.8" </p><p>"Wen Daihua, vital energy 12.1"</p><p>"Yang Miaojing, vital energy 13.5" </p><p>"Lin Zhaoxue, vital energy 10.6"</p><p>"Fang Linli, vital energy 11.2"</p><p>"Lu Qing, vital energy 9.9"</p><p></p><p>Terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>One-fourth of the Linji candidates had vital energy above 9! Those students were all from Senior Three Class Two. </p><p></p><p>All the candidates fell silent, none could leave the Linji exam scene with a smile!!</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an and the examiner Lu Jiuling were all numb.</p><p></p><p>These candidates, every single one of them was a martial artist, two hundred martial artists, including several masters!!</p><p></p><p>This exam year, Linji crushed the entire nation!</p><p></p><p>Even the four major capital cities combined did not have candidates of Linji's quality.</p><p></p><p>The confidence of candidates nationwide was shattered by Linji's students. One by one hung their heads dejectedly, completely losing the will to continue the exams.</p><p></p><p>With so many monstrous students appearing consecutively, the group looking down from above the exam scene finally stirred.</p><p></p><p>On the second row, four elderly men watched the students in the exam hall, their gazes constantly shifting, some even taking out instruments to measure spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Linji has such dense spiritual energy at 35, it's not surprising to see so many martial arts prodigies born in such a place rich with spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"But these students...well, we've tested at least 120 to 130 of them, and not a single one has vital energy below 5!"</p><p></p><p>"With such scores, they could probably become the top scorer in other cities of Jiangnan Province, right?"</p><p></p><p>One of the elders looked toward the Jiangnan Province Head seated on the third row.</p><p></p><p>The Head was a Martial Sage, but did not dare be negligent before this elder.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, according to data from previous years, Jiangnan Province has not produced any transcendent martial arts prodigies in recent years. The most outstanding martial arts prodigy was Mu Longxuan four years ago, with vital energy of 5.6 at the time."</p><p></p><p>But 5.6 vital energy would be at the very bottom among Linji's candidates!</p><p></p><p>Yet this was the best result in Jiangnan Province for the past five years!</p><p></p><p>"These students could not have grown so monstrously powerful through just their own efforts alone."</p><p></p><p>"We've looked at those two exam papers - the Celestial Immortal Realm and the Terrestrial Immortal Realm that come after the Martial Realm. Their continuations had no issues."</p><p></p><p>The words of Principal Yang allowed these people's lingering doubts to finally disperse.</p><p></p><p>With the Dragon Academy personally acknowledging that the continuations of the realms after the Martial Realm were flawless, they could boldly cultivate those techniques.</p><p></p><p>"These candidates must have obtained the prefaces to the Martial Realm from somewhere, or perhaps even other techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"An interdimensional portal!"</p><p></p><p>These people all thought of interdimensional portals.</p><p></p><p>At the highest levels of the Dragon Nation, the existence of interdimensional portals was no secret.</p><p></p><p>Only techniques from other worlds could grant such immense power.</p><p></p><p>So where in Linji had this interdimensional portal opened?</p><p></p><p>And who had obtained the supreme techniques from another dimension?</p><p></p><p>The exam carried on, but it had essentially become a show put on by Linji's candidates. Soon, news of Linji producing the top scorer spread nationwide.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose high into the sky. At the gates of Linji High School, two figures stepped over the damaged railings and headed toward the field.</p><p></p><p>The staff maintaining the exam had already fled to the security booths, not daring to obstruct those powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, another two people entered the exam grounds.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare stop them either, only watching as the two strode boldly into the school.</p><p></p><p>These two were soon noticed!</p><p></p><p>Principal Yang frowned. "It's Linji's exam time, why are there still people entering the school?"</p><p></p><p>From the fourth row, a burly man heard Yang's complaint and was about to drive the intruders away.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw a few teachers actively greeting those two people.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"What an unexpected guest! Why have you come to the school today? To invigilate the exam?"</p><p></p><p>"But it's almost over now."</p><p></p><p>They were local Linji teachers.</p><p></p><p>These teachers, instead of being surprised at the students' outstanding scores, were surprised to see this young teacher entering the school??</p><p></p><p>Principal Yang gestured for the burly man to hold off for now.</p><p></p><p>The two newcomers paid no heed to anyone, heading straight for the field. They soon arrived right in front of the group.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the front row, a middle-aged man stepped forward to block the young teacher's path.</p><p></p><p>The person behind the young teacher also stopped walking.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>This young teacher, who seemed to be called Professor Gu!</p><p></p><p>He frowned, looking at the arrogant middle-aged man before him.</p><p></p><p>"Step aside!"</p><p></p><p>He was in a hurry to set up a teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Why was this man obstructing his path?</p><p></p><p>Behind Gu Jiuqing, Gu Lao'er was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He never expected Gu Jiuqing to say such a thing!</p><p></p><p>Not just him!</p><p></p><p>Even the people behind the middle-aged man, including the four Dragon Academy Principals and the Jiangnan Province Head, all stared dumbly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Had he gone mad?</p><p></p><p>That was the Patriarch of the capital's Gu Family!</p><p></p><p>Among the eight great families of the capital, there were the top four and bottom four families. </p><p></p><p>The Gu Family was one of the top four, as could be seen from their positioning.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Patriarch tilted his head slightly, scrutinizing this son of his.</p><p></p><p>Hearing those words, he lowered his head to study him again.</p><p></p><p>"What? Can't understand words?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing glanced at him. Well, if the man was deaf and mute, it wasn't worth bothering with.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped around the middle-aged man and continued toward the field.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er behind him did not follow, but Gu Jiuqing paid it no mind.</p><p></p><p>"Unfilial son!"</p><p>"How dare you?!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar erupted as the middle-aged man raised his hand to slap the back of Gu Jiuqing's head.</p><p></p><p>I'm so angry!</p><p></p><p>I'm so angry!</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Patriarch's face was contorted with rage.</p><p></p><p>The people behind him instantly understood - this was the young master of the Gu Family!</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was so arrogant, actually defying the patriarch of a top four family!!</p><p></p><p>But before the Gu Family Patriarch's palm could land, a terrifying spiritual will suddenly erupted from afar, like the heavenly dao manifesting, instantly descending upon the Gu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>This newly-ascended Martial King sensed imminent danger, as if a great calamity was about to befall him!!</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Which martial artist dares undermine the foundations of the Dragon Nation?"</p><p></p><p>As the patriarch of a top four family overseeing the nation's vitality, not the slightest harm could be tolerated.</p><p></p><p>From among the crowd, the martial artists in the fourth row sprang into action. They enveloped the people in the third, second and first rows as squadrons of fighter jets screamed overhead from the wilderness into Linji.</p><p></p><p>Piercing sounds echoed in the sky, shaking the entire city of Linji.</p><p></p><p>The experts all turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Was there a Blood Condensation Martial Sage in Linji??</p><p></p><p>The Jiangnan Province Head stepped into the void, floating in mid-air to survey the school gates.</p><p></p><p>That strand of spiritual will had indeed come from outside the school.</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths!</p><p></p><p>Before the third breath, a figure appeared at the school gates.</p><p></p><p>It was a martial artist with black hair but a wrinkled face.</p><p></p><p>He wore a black robe, his hands empty without any weapons or armor, standing alone at the gate.</p><p></p><p>Soon, more figures followed from behind, surrounding this black-robed martial artist.</p><p></p><p>One!</p><p></p><p>Two! </p><p></p><p>Three!</p><p></p><p>Quickly, over twenty figures had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The Linji Martial Arts Alliance Head!"</p><p></p><p>The Jiangnan Head recognized the Alliance Head, his brow furrowing as he also spotted his own teacher and martial brother!</p><p></p><p>Wen Lao!</p><p></p><p>The Principal of Linji High!</p><p></p><p>These two were actually following behind the Alliance Head.</p><p></p><p>Were they rebelling?</p><p></p><p>"You're just a Martial Sage, yet you dare envelop the Lord of the Nation with your spiritual will!"</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the eight great families were all Vice Lords of the Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Sage?"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Head laughed!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Condensation Martial Sage?"</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, his bones creaking as the five qi in his viscera manifested into five hazy human forms, thunderous sounds bathing his flesh as his vital energy roiled within!</p><p></p><p>"Wah lah lah ---------"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, his vital energy surged like an azure dragon, flushing through the Alliance Head's body.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Condensation Martial Sage realm, no more than a fleeting moment before he stepped into it!</p><p></p><p>Droplets of blood fell from the Alliance Head's body, each drop of vital energy cratering the concrete ground!!</p><p></p><p>Shedding the old blood to be reborn with new blood, only then could the vital energy be reconstituted, transcending the Viscera Refining realm!</p><p></p><p>"I slaughter Martial Sages like dogs. I don't care what you're doing in Linji, but if you dare harm Professor Gu, don't blame me for slaughtering all of you!!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Head's aura peaked as flames wreathed his body into black wings, like a fallen angel.</p><p></p><p>Behind him!</p><p></p><p>The Mayor, the Secretary, the Public Security Chief, the CEOs of three major corporations, the newly-ascended Martial Kings from the stationed military, and several newly-ascended Martial Kings from the Linji Commerce Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Even Wen Lao and Qian Yue remained silent by his side.</p><p></p><p>United against a common enemy!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble------"  </p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble-------"</p><p></p><p>Fighter jets circled overhead as the city's networks were shut down by the authorities.</p><p></p><p>Silence fell over the national exam venues!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

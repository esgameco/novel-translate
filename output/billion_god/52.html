        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword aura traversed horizontally, leaping over the sword gate. </p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao rode on his sword, standing at the very front of the sword light, while Gu Jiuqing stood at the end of the sword light.</p><p></p><p>This time, the selection of flying swords at the Sword Tomb benefited Gu Jiuqing greatly.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the killing flying swords, he also came to know the real reason why his physical body would collapse.</p><p></p><p>The shackles of the realm!  </p><p></p><p>To break through the shackles of the realm, cultivating divine and demonic level techniques would be best.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao has cultivated the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique before, but I don't know why he brought it up, as if he has become a different person?"</p><p></p><p>As the sword aura soared, Gu Jiuqing took a few steps forward, but before he could speak, Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Nephew, Elder Martial Brother did cultivate the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique, but I have sworn an oath not to pass it on to others."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao had his back towards Gu Jiuqing, his expression cold, with a hint of indifference in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the sword gate below, the numerous sword sect disciples appearing like ants.</p><p></p><p>"However, if Martial Nephew truly wishes to cultivate the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique, I can recommend you to the Sect Master when he emerges from seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>Only the Sect Master of the Sword Sect could teach the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique!</p><p></p><p>This was even stricter than the inheritance of the Sword Classic.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Sword Sect, there were only a handful of cultivators practicing the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded, looking at Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's back.</p><p></p><p>This Elder Martial Brother was a great talent of the current era, with unparalleled brilliance!</p><p></p><p>And Si Wuxie had an unmatched vision!</p><p></p><p>These two great talents had methods to suppress the shackles of the realm. Logically speaking, with Elder Martial Brother's talents, he should know the benefits of cultivating the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique when he practiced it.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Elder Martial Brother sever the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao had cultivated to the Ninth Heaven Palace Realm, able to kill Tribulation Realm experts with a single strike. If he cultivated the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique, his strength could increase by thirty to forty percent!</p><p></p><p>"Why sever the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, that old thing from the Sword Sect, hmm, the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>He actually referred to the Sect Master of the Sword Sect as an "old thing"?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Master was almost a divine existence, one of the three Sword Sages of the sect, and even the head of the four great sects, more powerful than the Son of Heaven of the Great Zhou Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>Such a figure, Gu Jiuqing had never even seen, but in Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's mouth, he was treated so disrespectfully?</p><p></p><p>"He was worried that I would cultivate the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique, and go to the ancient ruins to seek the corpses of divine beings and demons, so he personally severed the technique I was cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao said it very calmly.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing could sense the anger beneath that calmness.</p><p></p><p>"But it's understandable, back then, in order to open the Celestial Cycle Spirit Apertures, Elder Martial Brother studied the spirit apertures of hundreds of cultivated demons and spirits, only then completing the Celestial Cycle!"</p><p></p><p>Completing the Celestial Cycle!</p><p></p><p>This was another great achievement.</p><p></p><p>The Qu Family's records on opening the Celestial Cycle Spirit Apertures only had three hundred and thirty-three methods.</p><p></p><p>To fully open all three hundred and sixty-five spirit apertures required generation after generation of inheritance and exploration.</p><p></p><p>Yet Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao, through his own efforts, explored all three hundred and sixty-five spirit apertures!</p><p></p><p>His talent left Gu Jiuqing utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"I entered the Heaven Palace Realm, let me calculate, it's been over nine hundred years, probably around nine hundred years ago. Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao spent a hundred years. In the remaining eight hundred years, Elder Martial Brother went in and out of the Great Wilderness, studying one hundred and twenty Heaven Palace Realm demons and spirits, hmm, as well as eight Tribulation Realm demon patriarchs, only then achieving his current cultivation base!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's foundation was terrifyingly profound, able to kill same-realm experts like drinking water, even hunting down eight Tribulation Realm demon patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>And those were just demons and spirits!</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that Elder Martial Brother hadn't killed any humans!</p><p></p><p>The previous Sage Child of the Stellar Palace was killed by Elder Martial Brother's hands.</p><p></p><p>To become a Sage Child, one had to at least be a Heaven Palace Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>It was impossible that he didn't study the Heaven Palace Realm of the previous Stellar Sage Child.</p><p></p><p>"If I truly cultivated the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique and learned of its mighty power, I would definitely enter the ancient ruins."</p><p></p><p>The ancient ruins buried the history before the ancient times, each great calamity and destruction was buried in those ancient sites.</p><p></p><p>There were even corpses of divine beings and demons!</p><p></p><p>With Elder Martial Brother Liang Xiao's crazed behavior, entering the ancient ruins and excavating the remains of divine beings and demons, if he triggered their prohibitions, he would certainly die!</p><p></p><p>"That old thing did it for my own good!"</p><p></p><p>"However, Elder Martial Brother left a way out. If that old thing doesn't teach you the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique, once Elder Martial Brother cultivates the Three-in-One state, he will personally pass the Divine and Demonic Visualization Technique to you!"</p><p></p><p>What a load of crap oath!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When I achieve the unity of three purities, breaking through the shackles of the human realm, will the vows of this human realm still be able to bind me?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, when will you cultivate to the unity of three purities?"</p><p></p><p>The unity of three purities - a pure yang spiritual soul, pure yang spiritual power, and a pure yang physical body - this is the final realm in becoming a deity.</p><p></p><p>"It could take three hundred years at the fastest, or five hundred years at the slowest, perhaps even faster."</p><p></p><p>It depends on when the master passes away.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao did not continue speaking. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to quickly cultivate to the unity of three purities, which required leaving the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But his master was still alive, and the Daoist Priest Cun Yin was also in this world. He could not openly leave the Sword Sect and enter the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Sword auras crisscrossed, descending upon this true transmission island above.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao withdrew his flying sword, and a golden lotus flower revolved beneath Gu Jiuqing's feet.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Senior Brother Liang Xiao trod upon empty space.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you have selected your flying sword. In the coming days, refine it into a sword pellet."</p><p></p><p>"Once you complete the way of the sword pellet, your senior brother will personally escort you to accomplish the heavenly mechanics!"</p><p></p><p>With his worries about the Dharma realm behind him, Gu Jiuqing naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>The two senior brothers bid farewell, as Liang Xiao flew into the palace on Mingtingfeng Peak, not far from the sword furnace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing descended onto the true transmission island, the golden lotus beneath his feet scattering as he landed in Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood waiting for several days.</p><p></p><p>He saw that madman from Mingtingfeng take Gu Zhuanchuan away, then later bring him to the Sword Tomb. Coming and going, seven or eight days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Today!</p><p></p><p>Finally, he waited for Gu Zhuanchuan's return.</p><p></p><p>A figure fell from the heavens, descending onto the true transmission island.</p><p></p><p>Three great formations spun, allowing this person to enter the island of Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan greets Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>A voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>It was from the same place where Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan had conversed before, quite a distance from the center of the island where Tianjian Palace stood.</p><p></p><p>But from that far away, Lu Yuan's voice clearly reached Gu Jiuqing's ears.</p><p></p><p>This inner sect disciple!</p><p></p><p>He could possibly be a cultivator of the Unbounded Realm!!</p><p></p><p>An Unbounded inner sect disciple had waited eight days at Tianjian Palace for him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? It's Junior Brother Lu Yuan, you haven't left yet?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not transmit his voice, only speaking towards Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had yet to cultivate spiritual power, nor use the strength of his physical body. His voice would naturally dissipate after traveling a few dozen meters.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan seemed to hear Gu Jiuqing's voice and said again,</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother left in such a hurry, this junior did not know if you had fully grasped the island's prohibitions, so I waited these many days."</p><p></p><p>"You were quite thoughtful."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, stay at Tianjian Palace and become an officer."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice came from within Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's face beamed with delight!!</p><p></p><p>He had finally gained the appreciation of a true transmission disciple, and moreover at the true transmission island that was the paramount of the Sword Dao, becoming an officer at this Tianjian Palace!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, rest assured. As an officer of Tianjian Palace, Lu Yuan will dedicate himself wholeheartedly!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already entered Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Yuan swiftly flew out from the true transmission island.</p><p></p><p>"I, Lu Yuan, have become an officer of Tianjian Palace. From now on, I can follow this paramount of the Sword Dao for decades, centuries, perhaps even thousands of years!"</p><p></p><p>Once this paramount of the Sword Dao grows...</p><p></p><p>He will be the earliest follower.</p><p></p><p>To what heights could a paramount of the Sword Dao reach?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan could not imagine, but at the very least he could become a great figure, right?</p><p></p><p>If he reorganizes the Heavenly Court in the future, then Lu Yuan would be a high minister.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, you must strive to grow. My future lies with you, Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>After flying out from the true transmission island, Lu Yuan descended from Mingtingfeng and headed for the Artifact Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He needed to notify the Artifact Pavilion to construct another officer's residence on the island of Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Each true transmission disciple was permitted to cultivate a patrilineal line within the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, donate, and vote for monthly tickets!</p><p></p><p>I beg for catching up next Monday and Tuesday!</p><p></p><p>Begging on my knees!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

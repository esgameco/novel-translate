        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Noodle Shop.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing slowly entered the noodle shop downstairs. It was still early, and he had nothing to do after returning to the wilderness. </p><p></p><p>It was better to relax on Planet Blue. </p><p></p><p>In this martial world, at least within the city, there would be no chaos. The citizens lived in peace, and the peddlers happily plied their trades.</p><p></p><p>There were also various delicacies, much better than the ancient Tianyuan City. </p><p></p><p>There were even quite a few painting boats and art exhibitions. As a literary scholar, Gu Jiuqing naturally had to go and see them.</p><p></p><p>Ah yes, to be precise, he got paid today!</p><p></p><p>The 4,000 salary had been transferred to his phone, which solved Gu Jiuqing's urgent need for money.</p><p></p><p>After crossing over to the martial Planet Blue, all of Gu Zixiu's memories had disappeared, and he didn't even have his bank card password.  He was afraid of exposing himself, so he wouldn't go to the bank to change the password.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, Gu Jiuqing had lived frugally.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, give me a beef noodle bowl."</p><p></p><p>At this hour, there were hardly any customers in the noodle shop except for Gu Jiuqing. News about Linji City came from the television.</p><p></p><p>"The 4th Linji Martial Arts Competition is organized by the municipal government and assisted by the Martial Arts Association. It is sponsored by the Linji Chamber of Commerce. The martial arts champion will win 50 million! Second place gets 5 million! Third place gets 500,000!"</p><p></p><p>"The 4th Martial Arts Competition will be held on June 6th, which is also the college entrance exam date. We hope the students of Linji can get into university and leave Linji."</p><p></p><p>"Traces of large demonic beasts have been found in many outdoor areas of Linji, suspected to be S-class demonic beasts reappearing. After much discussion, the municipal government has decided to block the highways."</p><p></p><p>"The external network has been damaged, and Linji has temporarily activated the local area network."  </p><p></p><p>"Citizens are advised not to go out in the coming days and wait for the military's handling of the situation."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The boss in the kitchen also heard the television broadcast.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't react much.</p><p></p><p>A customer rushed into the noodle shop and looked at the boss in the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, besides beef, chicken and pork, do you have any other meats?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>What did he mean?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the man curiously.</p><p></p><p>Black leather shoes, briefcase, trousers, white shirt, slick hair - he was obviously a social elite.</p><p></p><p>And he was also a martial artist!</p><p></p><p>There was a martial artist badge issued by the Martial Arts Association hanging on his shirt collar.</p><p></p><p>Square-shaped, with the two prominent words "Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>"We only have those. What kind of noodles would you like?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want noodles. I want to eat elephant meat!"</p><p></p><p>"Can you get elephant meat? Preferably mutated wild elephant meat. Yeah, the meat of an elephant demon. The blood will also work!"</p><p></p><p>The boss brought out the beef noodle bowl and looked at the social elite as if he were an idiot.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, go ask somewhere else."</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>The man sighed and walked towards the restaurant across the street.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's puzzled look, the boss explained, "This is the third time already. I don't know what's wrong with these people, actually believing that eating elephant meat can speed up their Dragon Elephant Skill cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The boss was about to leave when Gu Jiuqing stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Boss? What did you just say? The Dragon Elephant Skill??"</p><p></p><p>What's going on??</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill was the martial art he taught to the students in Class 2 of Grade 11. </p><p></p><p>How did even the noodle shop boss downstairs know about this?</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, someone on the Linji forum wrote a long post saying that observing elephants and drinking elephant blood can accelerate the cultivation of the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the municipal government has been promoting the Dragon Elephant Skill recently. My wife works at Huaren Technology, and she brought back the Dragon Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Technique for me."</p><p></p><p>"According to my wife, if you can cultivate into a martial artist, the company will give a 10,000 cash bonus, and employee family members also qualify."</p><p></p><p>"I won't say more. I'll go practice in the kitchen first."</p><p></p><p>The boss wasn't very old, probably in his thirties.</p><p></p><p>His large hands rose slightly as he stood in the kitchen and began practicing the 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing watched the boss's figure in the kitchen, then looked at the noodles in his bowl, feeling a bit lost.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't have been done by just the students in Class 2 Grade 11.</p><p></p><p>Even the noodle shop boss downstairs knew about the Dragon Elephant Skill. A few high school students couldn't have spread it so widely.</p><p></p><p>"The municipal government? The Linji Chamber of Commerce?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are they vigorously promoting the Dragon Elephant Skill?"</p><p></p><p>For him, this was an earth-shattering opportunity. Did it also benefit those in power?</p><p></p><p>The noodle shop boss's earnest cultivation was so adorable!</p><p></p><p>And that man who came in earlier was also so adorable!!</p><p></p><p>They were all the source of Gu Jiuqing's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Great, so great!"</p><p></p><p>While eating noodles, Gu Jiuqing opened the Linji forum on his phone.</p><p></p><p>Linji's network had been damaged, so the entire city temporarily activated a local area network that covered the whole city.</p><p></p><p>Only those within Linji could access the internet.</p><p></p><p>And this forum was built by the municipal government itself.</p><p></p><p>[The Dragon Elephant Skill is Invincible, the Dragon Elephant Skill is Truly Invincible]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up, drawn to this title.</p><p></p><p>[Look closely, my qi and blood value has increased to 1! I've become a martial artist too. I only cultivated the Dragon Elephant Skill a few times before breaking through my shackles. The Dragon Elephant Skill issued by the municipal government is too invincible. I love the Dragon Elephant Skill, I love the municipal government.]</p><p></p><p>A photo showing the qi and blood value breaking through 1 was attached to the post.</p><p></p><p>In the post, thousands of people replied, with dozens claiming they also became martial artists by cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Gu Jiuqing's face grew brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>[The Dragon Elephant Skill has 22 moves, but the book only has 20 moves. However, in the download area of the forum, there are complete instructions for all 22 moves.]</p><p></p><p>This was a comment from an official account.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing went back to the forum and quickly found the download area.</p><p></p><p>[Video demonstration of the 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill]  </p><p></p><p>[Video demonstration of the Sword Drawing Technique, with spoken instructions]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened a video that quickly loaded.</p><p></p><p>It showed a young martial artist performing the 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill. He practiced very slowly, allowing others to observe and imitate.</p><p></p><p>From the first move to the twenty-second, it flowed smoothly, clearly demonstrating a veteran's mastery of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist's face was processed so his appearance couldn't be seen, and he wore ordinary practice clothes with no identifying information.</p><p></p><p>"It must be one of the 45 students from Class 2!"</p><p></p><p>There were eight such videos, meaning eight students had worked with the municipal government.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps all 45 students had worked with the municipal government to spread the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The video for the Sword Drawing Technique was only ten seconds long. It showed an old man instructing the practice while holding a long sword, standing on flat ground.</p><p></p><p>Draw the sword!</p><p></p><p>Unsheathe the sword!</p><p></p><p>Perfectly integrated, the sword came out like a dragon, its qi slashing over four meters away, cleaving a fake mountain in two.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face turned pale, and the video ended there.</p><p></p><p>The view counts for these few videos were all over 100,000. Over half of Linji's 800,000 permanent residents had watched them.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant Skill and Sword Drawing Technique are going to become widespread in Linji."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing put down his chopsticks, having finished the beef noodle bowl in half an hour.</p><p></p><p>[How to Quickly Cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill]</p><p></p><p>There were many posts on the forum, and this one had the most likes and replies.</p><p></p><p>Over 30,000 comments, with hundreds of thousands of likes!</p><p></p><p>[To cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill, the best way is to observe the cultivation of the Dragon Elephant, but this is a legendary divine beast that has never appeared, even in the era of spiritual qi's resurgence.</p><p></p><p>However, there are many dragon-shaped demonic beasts. In the wild, there is a demonic beast called the Pig Matron Dragon, which is a mutated alligator. There are also Python Dragons mutated from giant pythons, both with true dragon forms. Observing these demonic beasts can greatly accelerate the Dragon Elephant Skill cultivation, as I have verified.</p><p></p><p>While the Dragon part of the Dragon Elephant is hard to find, there are still a few elephants that can be found in Linji. I observed the elephant form, drank elephant blood, and this is how my qi and blood changed over the past few days.]</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Three photos.</p><p></p><p>The first photo shows a qi and blood tester reading 1.21, the second photo shows a qi and blood value of 1.45, and the third photo shows a qi and blood value of 1.60. </p><p></p><p>Exaggerated, it increased too quickly - this is the change in qi and blood values over three days!</p><p></p><p>"Is this real or fake? This must be photoshopped, right? The qi and blood value increased by 0.4 in just three days??"</p><p></p><p>"Crazy? Even photoshopped images wouldn't be edited this extremely."</p><p></p><p>Then an official account left a comment below.</p><p></p><p>"This is real!"</p><p></p><p>The official admitted to this matter!</p><p></p><p>No wonder that man came to the noodle shop earlier asking about elephant meat.</p><p></p><p>[Lord Ning Wants to Slay the Dragon]</p><p></p><p>This is the username of the person who posted.</p><p></p><p>Lord Ning?</p><p></p><p>Ning Que!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly thought of the deputy class monitor Ning Que.</p><p></p><p>Ning Que was tall and thin, the second student in the class to cultivate into a martial artist. Gu Jiuqing had a good impression of him.</p><p></p><p>"Observe the elephant, eat elephant meat and drink elephant blood to accelerate the cultivation of the Dragon Elephant Skill, why didn't I think of that?"</p><p></p><p>An idea emerged in Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness has spirit pills, but on the Martial Planet at most there are just nutrient solutions. If I could obtain some spirit pill formulas and transmit them to the Martial Planet..."</p><p></p><p>With Linjiang Technology Company's production lines, they could mass produce spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts suddenly became clear.</p><p></p><p>"I transmit my methods to the students of Class 2 Grade 3, they cultivate the methods I transmit, and then I also obtain their comprehension and attainments in the Dragon Elephant Skill. Now, they will spread the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art, promoting them in Linjiang. If all goes well, I can obtain everyone's comprehension from cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Planet!</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's golden finger, a new term he learned online.</p><p></p><p>With the Martial Planet's 4 billion people, they would all become Gu Jiuqing's foundation.</p><p></p><p>To better tap into the potential of these 4 billion people, he needed to plan carefully.</p><p></p><p>The noodle soup in front of him had already gone cold. Gu Jiuqing got up to pay the bill and returned to his residence.</p><p></p><p>"For now it's just Linjiang, but once I transmit the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art of the Sword Sect, just these two skills alone can greatly increase the cultivation of 800,000 people."</p><p></p><p>"If the Dragon Elephant Skill is fully promoted nationwide, with just the comprehension and attainments absorbed from hundreds of millions of people, that should be enough for me to become a deity, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dare imagine how powerful he would be at that point.</p><p></p><p>Become a deity!</p><p></p><p>It seemed quite easy.</p><p></p><p>"So what I need to do now is lay a solid foundation and forge an unmatched root."</p><p></p><p>Shed the mortal form eight times? Nine times?</p><p></p><p>He would have the capital to assault the deity realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the future, Gu Jiuqing wanted to step into even higher realms, so shedding the mortal form eight or nine times would definitely not be enough. He needed to shed it over ten times, breaking through layer after layer of shackles!</p><p></p><p>"During this period, I also need to slowly elevate the dimension of the Planet."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Planet! Martial Sage is the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>But what if he elevated the planet to the Immortal Martial realm?</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Martial Planet, above Martial Sage!</p><p></p><p>And if he continued elevating it further, to the Divine Martial realm!</p><p></p><p>The more Gu Jiuqing thought, the more excited he became. Finally, he reached a conclusion:</p><p></p><p>"I need to forge an unmatched foundation for myself, while also forging an unmatched foundation for the people of the Planet."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, he would continue transmitting skills from the Sword Sect of the Great Wilderness for the people of the Planet to cultivate, and pick some good ones. If he had the chance, he would also transmit skills from the other three great sects to the Planet.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing recorded in the Great Wilderness script what he needed to do in the near future:</p><p></p><p>"Borrow the cultivation of 800,000 people in Linjiang to join the inner disciples of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"After becoming an inner disciple of the Sword Sect, find a way to obtain the formula for qi and blood pills, and transmit it to the Planet."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, appropriately display the aura of a peerless genius, but not too exaggerated. Still need to surpass ordinary inner disciples and stabilize at the top three inner disciples of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Third in the Sword Sect was about right.</p><p></p><p>First in the Sword Sect was too eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Second in the Sword Sect didn't sound good!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing temporarily set these plans.</p><p></p><p>"After Gu Zixiu left school, he just went to the noodle shop downstairs to eat a bowl of noodles? Then he went back?"</p><p></p><p>"There were no abnormalities in between?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure he heard the broadcast?"</p><p></p><p>To probe Gu Zixiu's attitude towards the officials, the station director deliberately broadcast content about the 4th Martial Arts Tournament at this time.</p><p></p><p>Then he also specially brought in an extra to enter the noodle shop and bring up the Linjiang forum.</p><p></p><p>They had tracked down Gu Jiuqing's IP and accessed his internet browsing history over the past few days.</p><p></p><p>In a secret office, technical personnel looked at the browsing records displayed on the computer, all a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>[History of the Martial Planet] [How the First Martial Sage Was Born] [Just How Powerful Was the First Martial Sage]</p><p></p><p>[Cultivating Flesh Martial Disciples, Cultivating Flesh Martial Artists, Cultivating Bone Martial Masters, Cultivating Tendon Great Martial Masters, Cultivating Organ Martial Kings, Exchanging Blood Martial Sages - Their Realm Divisions]</p><p></p><p>[How to Know Your Own Power]</p><p></p><p>There was a record of purchasing a qi and blood tester.</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu even bought a qi and blood tester?</p><p></p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p></p><p>In their impression, this being who transmitted the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art was at the very least a Martial King!</p><p></p><p>Yes, in the eyes of the major powers, they had already regarded Gu Zixiu as a Martial King.</p><p></p><p>And the qi and blood tester could only test up to the Martial King realm.</p><p></p><p>[How Teacher Titles at Universities Are Evaluated]</p><p></p><p>[Do Salaries Increase After Promotion in Title?]</p><p></p><p>[Does This World Have Deities?]</p><p></p><p>Finally, they found a useful browsing record.</p><p></p><p>"Does this world have deities?"</p><p></p><p>The technical personnel kept reciting this sentence.</p><p></p><p>This was a sentence Gu Zixiu had searched online.</p><p></p><p>The technical personnel looked at each other, it was just an ordinary sentence, but at this moment, they felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant Skill, the Unsheathing Sword Art, these two skills are not from this era!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the ultimate skills of the eight great families in the imperial capital pale in comparison to the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art. Could it be that Gu Zixiu is asking if there are any deities like himself in this world?"</p><p></p><p>[If There Are Deities, Will One Appear Before Me?]</p><p></p><p>Damn!!</p><p></p><p>Asking for a deity to descend before Gu Zixiu?</p><p></p><p>It's clear now, this being who transmitted the skills is no longer human.</p><p></p><p>How could a human create the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art?</p><p></p><p>Now it's known that these two skills are immensely helpful for breaking through to the Martial King realm - using the Dragon Elephant Skill to easily break through the Cultivating Organs realm, and even having over a 90% chance of breaking through to the Exchanging Blood Martial Sage realm.</p><p></p><p>A deity descending in Linjiang, then transmitting skills to Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>This wasn't just their thought, but the thought of many others.</p><p></p><p>They uploaded Gu Jiuqing's browsing and search records to the higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups quickly replied:</p><p></p><p>"Stand by, don't stir up a hornet's nest. Continue monitoring Gu Zixiu's every move."</p><p></p><p>One of the technical personnel saw the last browsing record on the computer and hurriedly said, </p><p></p><p>"There's one more search record that hasn't been uploaded."</p><p></p><p>It was just one search record, no big deal.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't think much of it after hearing this, and the station director also left the office.</p><p></p><p>But this employee looked at the search record and his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>[If I Become the Deity of This World, How Should I Build the Martial Planet and Elevate Its Dimension?]</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Gate of the Great Wilderness, Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes on the flying horse carriage.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Martial Planet has deities. If they knew I came from the Great Wilderness, if there are deities, they should have discovered me long ago, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing got up and exited the flying horse carriage!</p><p></p><p>Today was the eighth day of the Sword Sect's great examination. Gu Jiuqing had a feeling that this day would be even livelier than the previous seven.</p><p></p><p>[Seeking data, seeking recommendation votes, seeking monthly votes, seeking bookmarks, seeking great merchants, seeking everything!]</p>

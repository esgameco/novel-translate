        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Palace!</p><p></p><p>This was the largest palace where Gu Jiuqing had ever resided.</p><p></p><p>It was several times larger than the Gu Residence. </p><p></p><p>Inside the palace, there was a separate pill refining room where one could refine pills. The Sword Sect had also kindly provided some basic pill formulas.</p><p></p><p>There were also independent cultivation rooms!</p><p></p><p>There were three cultivation rooms alone. The function of each cultivation room was different.</p><p></p><p>There was a cultivation room for sitting meditation, circulating internal energy, and body cultivation. </p><p></p><p>There was also a cultivation room for inhaling and absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>There was even a cultivation room for practicing divine abilities, constructed from special materials, probably as large as a football field on Planet Blue. Gu Jiuqing had specifically studied this divine abilities cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>Within the divine abilities cultivation room, Gu Jiuqing's power could be unleashed to the fullest!</p><p></p><p>The mighty forces of hundreds of dragons and elephants fully awakened. With a wave of Gu Jiuqing's hand, five hundred dragon and elephant forces attached to his palm.</p><p></p><p>On his Wuzhou Mountain, three divine weapons suppressed his physical body, allowing Gu Jiuqing to freely use this surging power.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>His physical power erupted, dragons and elephants inhaling and exhaling, golden divine light bursting forth from his palm. With one punch landing down, the divine abilities cultivation room trembled slightly, leaving a small dent.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was no other anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, this divine abilities cultivation room is quite durable."</p><p></p><p>With five hundred dragon and elephant forces converging in his palm and condensing together, they could slay those at the Wuzhou realm!</p><p></p><p>But they could not break through the floor tiles of the divine abilities cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Gu Jiuqing could experiment with his cultivation without worry in the future.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged within the divine abilities cultivation room, his brilliant sword intent and the forces of hundreds of dragons and elephants converging together. </p><p></p><p>Five hundred dragon and elephant forces pierced through the void, intertwining densely above his head.</p><p></p><p>There was also a strand of sword intent rising amidst the dragons and elephants.</p><p></p><p>It was a five-part Heaven-Rending Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>"I have now become the true inheritor of the Nanting Peak of the Sword Sect, but I have not yet obtained the Sect's martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao only allowed him to refine the flying swords into pellets.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would have to wait until he had refined the flying swords into pellets before he could obtain the Sword Sect's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Nanting Sword Classic of Nanting Peak, hmm, with such a talented senior brother, perhaps I can also ask him for the body cultivation method to complete the methods for becoming a divine being?"</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the body cultivation method, I also need divine abilities related to the moon. Planet Blue will soon open a path to the moon."</p><p></p><p>The moon in the Great Wilderness was too far from the continent for even the ancient teleportation formations to directly reach it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know how far the moon of the Great Wilderness was from him, but Planet Blue was much closer to the moon.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating moon divine abilities on Planet Blue would be too easy!</p><p></p><p>"It would be best to find a sword intent related to the moon. Oh right, I also need to ask my senior brother for a copy of the ancient teleportation formations."</p><p></p><p>"As for the visualization methods of gods and demons, it's not urgent. For now, I can still use divine weapons to suppress my physical body, and in the future, I can also borrow great artifacts to suppress it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After sorting out the matters he needed to attend to in the near future, Gu Jiuqing finally took out the Slaughter Flying Sword to study it carefully.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had observed the Slaughter Flying Sword so meticulously.</p><p></p><p>The Slaughter Flying Sword was a king-grade flying sword, emanating strands of slaughter sword intent. This sword intent was very pure, even purer than the Heaven-Rending Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing's sword intent collided with the slaughter sword intent, there were signs of it being assimilated.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. If I had cultivated the slaughter sword intent, just the sword intent on this flying sword alone could have allowed me to improve my sword intent by several grades."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing patted his Niwanpalacea, and a surge of power poured into his Niwan Palace.</p><p></p><p>Golden blood essence surged, and the three divine body images of Wuzhou Mountain emerged one after another.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon and elephant divine body origin, the yin-yang divine body origin, and the golden crow divine body origin - the three divine body origin images rose up, accompanied by golden blood essence bursting through the Baihui acupoint, forming rings of light that revolved around his body.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the three divine body images and the golden blood essence rushed towards the Slaughter Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword intents collided, and with the profound foundation of the five-part Heaven-Rending Sword Intent assisting, it quickly enveloped the body of the Slaughter Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Intent merged with the sword, divinity merged with the sword. Gu Jiuqing had not yet cultivated spiritual power, so he did not need to merge energy with the sword. He only needed to complete these two steps.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts, willpower, spirit, and sword intent washed over the Slaughter Flying Sword, devouring the slaughter sword intent. Gu Jiuqing's Heaven-Rending Sword Intent was gradually improving.</p><p></p><p>The five-part Heaven-Rending Sword Intent fused with the slaughter sword intent, slowly advancing to a six-part sword intent!</p><p></p><p>His essence, energy, and spirit - the quintessence of his being, his aura, his divine storage, including the blood essence bursting from his Baihui acupoint, enveloped the Slaughter Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>The two worked in tandem, simultaneously refining the Slaughter Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>During Gu Jiuqing's continuous refinement, this king-grade flying sword showed signs of melting.</p><p></p><p>Images like the Softly Circling Finger and Rootless Water began to appear!</p><p></p><p>One day, two days, three days...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by rapidly, and Gu Jiuqing was still refining the flying sword into pellets.</p><p></p><p>The tenth day!</p><p></p><p>The exterior of the king-grade flying sword had been refined, forming gaseous threads that wrapped around the Slaughter Flying Sword, resembling the constant flow of Rootless Water.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not stop, his foundation was too profound. His golden blood essence and personal essence, energy, and spirit gushed forth, refining the flying sword!</p><p></p><p>The twentieth day!</p><p></p><p>The slaughter sword intent on the king-grade flying sword had been completely fused into the Heaven-Rending Sword Intent, which directly advanced to the seventh grade!!</p><p></p><p>"The slaughter sword intent of the king-grade flying sword has actually forced my Heaven-Rending Sword Intent to improve to the seventh grade!"</p><p></p><p>This was too exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were only five king-grade flying swords left in the Sword Tomb, now reduced to four.</p><p></p><p>But generally, when others refined flying swords, it would not be like Gu Jiuqing's experience.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Such ferocity ah, refining a flying sword for twenty days in one go?</p><p></p><p>This requires an extremely profound foundation.</p><p></p><p>The other sword cultivators, when refining a king-grade flying sword, at most increase their sword intent by one fraction, far from reaching Gu Jiuqing's lofty heights.</p><p></p><p>One month later!</p><p></p><p>The shape of the Killing Flying Sword had completely deformed, no longer recognizable as a flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Sword Intent to Sever the Heavens was entirely attached to the flying sword, threads of the Heavens Severing Sword Intent revealing themselves from within.</p><p></p><p>Killing Flying Sword?</p><p></p><p>It should be called the Heavens Severing Flying Sword!</p><p></p><p>"Almost there, almost there, this flying sword is about to become a pellet."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing restrained himself, continuing to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, Gu Jiuqing didn't know how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>He remained in the spirit technique cultivation room, using his essence, energy, and spirit along with his sword intent to refine the flying sword, until the flying sword was refined into a pellet before his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>The way of the flying sword pellet!</p><p></p><p>Finally achieved!!</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing's eyes, where was there a flying sword?</p><p></p><p>Only a pool of water remained.</p><p></p><p>This rootless pool floated in the air, the golden blood energy dissipated, leaving only this pool of water in front of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, dipping it into the rootless water.</p><p></p><p>The rootless water flowed around his hand, forming threads that wrapped around his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart rejoiced, "Rootless water, wrapping softly around the fingers, finally achieved!"</p><p></p><p>A sense of awareness arose in his heart, this awareness appearing from nowhere, not at all abrupt, just like having grown an extra arm, and this arm was even more spiritually connected than Gu Jiuqing's own arms.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the rootless water dripped down, transforming into a flying sword embedding itself in the floor tiles!</p><p></p><p>The floor tiles in the spirit technique cultivation room were pierced through, the flying sword falling into his hand, leaving a shattered hole in its place.</p><p></p><p>This was without Gu Jiuqing unleashing any sword qi or sword intent, yet he could easily pierce through the floor tiles of the spirit technique cultivation room!</p><p></p><p>"Within the Realms of Shedding Mortality, Law Force, and Incomplete Perfection, relying solely on this flying sword, I am invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if cultivators at the Spirit Refining Realm could withstand this flying sword imbued with seven parts sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator who cultivated one full part of sword intent was praised as a Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>And a Sword Immortal corresponded to the Heavenly Palace Realm!</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful would a sword cultivator with seven parts sword intent be? Gu Jiuqing could not give an accurate answer, at least having never directly battled Spirit Refining cultivators, so he did not know the outcome.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword refined, transformed into a pool of water, wrapping around Gu Jiuqing's five fingers like mist, endlessly circling, he casually tossed it out.</p><p></p><p>The rootless water became a flying sword, piercing into the distance!</p><p></p><p>A flash of sword light flickered, as if leaping, directly striking the wall.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The wall was slashed open, leaving a huge deep pit.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword circulated, smashing through the remaining palace buildings!</p><p></p><p>One wall after another was destroyed!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly called the flying sword back, transforming it into rootless water wrapping around his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Without the sword intent attached to the flying sword, seven parts of sword intent could not possibly cause such terrifying destruction. And there was also the risk of the sword intent being damaged.</p><p></p><p>But with the flying sword, it would be damaged first before the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Even if the flying sword was damaged, replenishing the flying sword materials could restore it to its original state.</p><p></p><p>This was the true way of the flying sword pellet!</p><p></p><p>"With a thought of the mind, the sword intent would bring the flying sword descending, if I thought of the moon, then the flying sword would fly towards the moon!"</p><p></p><p>"However, to have the flying sword traverse the heavens, able to fly to the moon, an ordinary Sword Immortal could absolutely not accomplish it!"</p><p></p><p>A semi-step Sword Immortal with seven parts sword intent could at most control the flying sword dozens of miles away from their true body.</p><p></p><p>A full Sword Immortal with one complete part of sword intent, a few hundred miles was more or less the limit!</p><p></p><p>At that distance, those Sword Immortals within the Sword Sect, standing at the Sword Sect gate, would be unable to control their flying swords all the way to Tianyuan Ancient City - the first city in the Northern Lands!</p><p></p><p>"One sword to descend upon Jiangnan, one sword to subdue the nine provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Just how much sword intent have those Sword Immortals cultivated?"</p><p></p><p>Only now did Gu Jiuqing realize the gap between himself and the true Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"However, I have now resolved the issue of my fleshly body collapsing, and this time absorbing the cultivation and insights of 800,000 people from Linjiang, I should be able to further increase my strength by a great deal!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing flicked his fingers!</p><p></p><p>The rootless water wrapped around his five sword fingers coalesced into a pellet.</p><p></p><p>This pellet was very small, only the size of his little fingernail, in an instant, the flying sword pellet flew into his Hundred Meetings acupoint, landing on the Incomplete Perfection Mountain formed by his spinal vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>On the 33rd vertebra, a pellet was perched, preemptively occupying the position of where the spirit seed would form.</p><p></p><p>And on these 33 vertebrae, dragon and elephant images were seated, with three primal spirit bodies coalesced on the 1st vertebra, along with three thousand-grooved divine weapons - the Bronze Cauldron, Dragon-Tiger Bell, and Star Pearl - suppressing the entire fleshly body atop Incomplete Perfection Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing swayed his body, stretching his muscles and bones.</p><p></p><p>This was the last chance to increase his strength before unleashing the Heavenly Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Seeking reading, seeking reading for next Monday and Tuesday!</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you could read every day, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Initially, everyone thought this was just an ordinary author begging for reading, until three years later, when the spiritual qi revived.</p><p></p><p>Those who read this book all received a flying sword!</p><p></p><p>Cough cough, just read it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

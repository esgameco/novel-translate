            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under the Sword Gate Pass, streaks of pure yang energy condensed within the three-in-one mighty beings, coalescing but not releasing, neither sweeping through the heavens and earth nor seizing the initiative. </p><p></p><p>Having reached such a realm, with a single thought mountains and rivers could shatter, with a single thought the heavens and earth could be destroyed. Whether striking first or after, it mattered little.</p><p></p><p>Their yuan shen was pure yang, their physical bodies pure yang, their magic powers pure yang - standing at the pinnacle of the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The title "Demon Emperor" resounded through the vast wilderness. </p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, he led the charge in attacking the Sword Gate Pass, causing the downfall of the Primordial Sword Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Since then, this Demon Emperor's reputation was unmatched, more resounding than the other Demon Emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor had horns growing from his head, a handsome man. </p><p></p><p>His rippling gaze pierced the void, looking at the giant figure in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>"Young Divine Lord!"</p><p></p><p>These were the first four words that coalesced in the Demon Emperor's mind after hearing Gu Jiuqing's voice.</p><p></p><p>Then another four words followed.</p><p></p><p>Young Heavenly Emperor!</p><p></p><p>"Young Divine Lord" was insufficient to describe this member of the human race - only "Young Heavenly Emperor" could encapsulate his entire life.</p><p></p><p>Within the Six Boundary Realms, Gu Jiuqing suppressed him in the Unbounded Realm, the Spirit Refining Realm, the Heavenly Palace Realm, and the Tribulation Realm!</p><p></p><p>This oppressive feeling made the Demon Emperor unable to forget it even until now.</p><p></p><p>However, he was such a magnificent figure - no matter how strong this human was, he could not possibly be stronger than him!</p><p></p><p>An unmatched celestial prodigy?</p><p></p><p>If unable to fully grow, he would just be an ant.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's aura surged. Among the six three-in-one beings, only this Deity Realm mighty one could summon the aura of a demigod!</p><p></p><p>The three-in-one unity of yuan shen, physical body, and magic powers in pure yang form was also praised as a demigod in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Having stepped into half of the deity realm himself, he was only one step away from attaining the Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is quite arrogant."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's voice entered the ears of the Sword Ancestor who had regained his peak state, who gave a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Demons must be eradicated by all!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>In the distant heavens, myriad divine lights flickered as the Demon Prince activated a supreme heavenly treasure beside the Wheel of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>Myriad dao marks blossomed, their divine might pressing down on the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>Space rippled, the Primordial radiance shone brilliantly, coalescing on the Wheel of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince grasped the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens, gathering the power of the supreme treasure to lock down Gu Jiuqing's figure.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor made a move, and the great Sword Furnace hanging on the Sword Mountain flew towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Make your move!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice fell as the Demon Emperor struck first.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful expert in all of history took action in this moment.</p><p></p><p>The great Sword Furnace was extremely powerful, able to block one strike from the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor wanted to kill Gu Jiuqing so badly that he didn't care about anything else, he just wanted the Demon Prince to slay Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The other two Demon Emperors also attacked.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang like refined metal, myriad divine lights erupted. The Sword Gate Pass shook, on the verge of collapse - just the auras of the four Demon Emperors nearly shattered the Sword Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ancestor, quickly activate the Sword Furnace to suppress the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>The great Sword Furnace that had just flown out returned.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Furnace opened and closed, its sword qi transforming into sword streaks that merged with two other Sword Furnaces descending from the Sword Mountain, releasing boundless sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Three different types of sword qi intertwined, fusing with the pure yang aura to form a sword domain!</p><p></p><p>This was the domain of the sword dao, enveloping the four Demon Emperors and two human experts.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The battle between demigods began.</p><p></p><p>The demons of the vast wilderness and the sword cultivators of the Sword Gate could not see through the scenes within the sword domain.</p><p></p><p>They could only see six figures emanating divine light fighting within the sword domain.</p><p></p><p>Each exchange of blows caused the surrounding heavens and earth to shake, space to ripple around the Sword Gate Pass, and the mountains to crumble, on the verge of being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>This great battle was comparable to the calamity that befell the Sword Gate three thousand years ago!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the sword domain, boundless divine might pressed down on the northern lands, and even the Sword Gate sensed this divine might.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate disciples looked behind them towards the north and saw the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens hanging high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Divine might rippled out as a divine strike formed, dazzling rays of light controlled by the Demon Prince aimed at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"That's the true transmission of our Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized Gu Jiuqing's figure.</p><p></p><p>They seemed unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p></p><p>Their divine eyes pierced the void to see the giant carrying eight ancient cities from the northern lands on his shoulders, facing off against the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>After recognizing Gu Jiuqing, several Sword Immortals flew out of the Sword Gate, wanting to battle the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble —————"</p><p></p><p>The divine might rippled as the Primordial light beam fully formed.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's pure yang thoughts shattered three of his spiritual cores!</p><p></p><p>He only did not use his main spiritual core, sending his other three spiritual cores into the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to slay Gu Jiuqing, he wanted to form a demonic territory in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Primordial divine light radiated, the only light remaining between the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The giant figure moved, and one by one the divine cities fell from his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" </p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Eight divine cities fell from the heavens, away from the sea of blood, towards the fifth ancient city in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>Within the Ancient Return City, the patriarchs of the Path families, great clans and noble families saw the eight ancient cities falling outside their city.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators emerged from the Ancient Southern Dipper City and Ancient Northern Dipper City as well.</p><p></p><p>The ground shook and the heavens trembled, but they all looked up together.</p><p></p><p>There, the giant's figure flickered!</p><p></p><p>He did not summon divine weapons nor use any divine abilities, instead choosing to withstand the strike of the supreme treasure with his physical body!</p><p></p><p>"He wants to physically withstand the strike of a supreme treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that his physical body has reached the pure yang level?"</p><p></p><p>Throughout all ages, supreme treasures were invincible.</p><p></p><p>To physically withstand the strike of a supreme treasure, only pure yang patriarchs could do so.</p><p></p><p>And physically withstanding a supreme treasure strike!</p><p></p><p>That was the mark of a pure yang physical body??</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate's sword cultivators... Gu Jiuqing, his physical body had already reached the pure yang level??</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! You dare to physically withstand it, you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince went mad.</p><p></p><p>Grasping the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens with both hands, the Primordial light radiated from the Wheel struck towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Sword streaks spanned the vast heavens, illuminating the northern lands. Space collapsed into a void, the void shattered, rippling the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing watched as this Primordial radiance descended. His physical body shrank from a giant of tens of thousands of feet to human size.</p><p></p><p>Motes of light shone in the air.</p><p></p><p>His golden blood energy burst through the shackles of his flesh, forming billowing smoke and fire above his head!</p><p></p><p>The Pangu Divine Lord's figure moved, fusing into Gu Jiuqing's physical body. A majestic aura naturally emanated from his true form.</p><p></p><p>The myriad divine apertures in his body opened one by one. Within the divine apertures, the Dragon Elephant Kingdoms on the Unbounded Mountain also blossomed.</p><p></p><p>The power of 630 million dragon elephants coalesced together - this force could tear apart the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>But it was not done!</p><p></p><p>A two zhang nine golden body appeared behind Gu Jiuqing's figure in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's golden body, hands forming the lotus mudra, boundless Buddhist dharma, an aura of the Tathagata rippling forth.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens!</p><p></p><p>That figure in azure robes manifested two giant images.</p><p></p><p>The first was the golden body image of Buddhism, the second the Pangu Divine Lord's image. The two giants coalesced behind him, appearing similar to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The azure-robed figure moved, and the Buddha's golden body and Pangu Divine Lord also moved in unison.</p><p></p><p>The three figures stretched out their hands, striking upwards towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Shua la ——————"</p><p></p><p>The dazzling Primordial light beam descended, interweaving around his body.</p><p></p><p>"Physically withstanding the strike of a supreme treasure!!"</p><p></p><p>Cries of astonishment rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Hummmmm ————"</p><p></p><p>Divine sounds transmitted from the collision as one figure burst through the Primordial light, flying up into the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's ferocious expression revealed a hint of panic.</p><p></p><p>"You want to physically withstand a supreme treasure's strike? You're not qualified enough!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme treasure's strike was shattered, but the supreme treasure was still there.</p><p></p><p>Several divine wheels flew out from the Wheel of Life and Death of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's magic power entered the supreme treasure, dao marks rippling as five divine wheels shot out, transforming into divine light that instantly descended onto Gu Jiuqing's head!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity Wheel, the Yin-Yang Wheel, the Profound Yellow Wheel, the Four Symbols Wheel, the Five Phases Wheel!</p><p></p><p>Five divine wheels suppressed Gu Jiuqing's true form!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity Wheel rotated, a divine lord coalescing within. Outlined by the Dao and principles, palm-sized, it resided within the divine wheel.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Unity also!</p><p></p><p>The title of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Foremost and first!</p><p></p><p>The divine lord descended, the divine wheel's power flowing down.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, the five great divine wheels suppressed the stars' beasts, nearly killing the Beast Sovereigns of the Celestial Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>The divine lord's power flowed through the true form, making Gu Jiuqing unable to sense his dragon elephant power, golden body power, blood energy, physical body power or yuan shen.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>The five divine wheels sealed all types of power, no wonder the stars' beasts would be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Five rays of divine light flew out from his body - the five divine lords formed from his primal five viscera stood unmoving like mountains, far larger than the divine lords residing within the divine wheels.</p><p></p><p>The primal five viscera divine lords' auras resisted against the Supreme Unity, Yin-Yang, Profound Yellow, Four Symbols, and Five Phases divine lords.</p><p></p><p>The power of his physical body returned once more!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pushed his hands out horizontally, imitating the true meaning of the Dragon Elephant Strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Strike, the true dragon and divine elephant interweaving. His left hand became a true dragon...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His right hand transformed into a divine figure, shaking heaven and earth! With both hands, he sent the five divine wheels flying!</p><p></p><p>Then a final wheel of life and death descended from beyond the heavens. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his hand to block the sky, his spiritual power flowing backward toward the horizon, as an elixir pill flew out from his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The elixir pill, as large as a millstone, struck the heavens and earth, transforming into a stream of light that intertwined with the wheel of life and death. </p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The elixir pill flew back, while the wheel of life and death spun in the void. The images of the deities of life and death rippled upon it, wisps of the Dao's rhymes drifting down from their illusory forms.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>He blocked it?  </p><p>His mortal body withstood the blow of that supreme weapon?</p><p>And then he withstood the suppression of the heavenly wheel of life and death with his bare hands?</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's eyes were filled with terror. He tried to summon the heavenly wheel of life and death to suppress Gu Jiuqing again.</p><p></p><p>"It's gone. The heavenly wheel of life and death cannot withstand even one of my moves."</p><p></p><p>One by one, his major accupoints resonated, and the thirty dragon-elephant kingdoms within his accupoints mimicked the celestial stars!</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three dragon-elephant kingdoms on his Buzhou Mountain were just like those within his accupoints!</p><p></p><p>Sixty-three dragon-elephant kingdoms transformed into sixty-three massive stars, their starry forms linking together into a single line.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the vacuum!!</p><p></p><p>Power poured into the void, the heavens and earth before him becoming ruins, darkness enveloping the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince seemed to sense something, summoning his divine wheels in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p></p><p>An invisible force intertwined with the six divine wheels, erasing much of the Dao's rhymes upon them.</p><p></p><p>The six divine wheels radiated a strand of light.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment!</p><p></p><p>Behind the divine wheels, the Demon Prince's true form was torn apart, shreds falling from his body.</p><p></p><p>His main consciousness shattered, his primal spirit split, his mortal form ruined - everything was annihilated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Death!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince died!!</p><p></p><p>The damaged heavenly wheel of life and death, with no one to control it, reassembled into its massive form and hung in the northern realm.</p><p></p><p>A sea of blood stretched to the horizon, encroaching on the northern realm.</p><p></p><p>The great blood formation reactivated!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure transformed again into a giant, a body tens of thousands of feet tall that lifted up eight ancient cities including the Ruined City, Bright Moon City and Reminggu City, carrying them on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————" </p><p></p><p>The giant strode across the lands!</p><p></p><p>He lifted up Guiyuan City and placed it on his shoulders too!</p><p></p><p>The giant walked through the northern realm, shouldering all the remaining ancient cities one by one.</p><p></p><p>Carrying thirteen cities on his shoulders, six or seven on each side.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"  </p><p>"Boom boom boom————————"</p><p></p><p>The rippling blood sea in the northern realm washed over the lands, submerging the giant's knees. If the cities remained in the north, they would surely be devoured by the blood sea.</p><p></p><p>On the cities, figures gazed down at the lands below.  </p><p></p><p>They were still in shock.</p><p></p><p>Starting from Beidou City, human figures had appeared within the ancient cities.</p><p></p><p>And in cities like Nandou, Guiyuan, Shengxu, Qingyang, Tianyuan, Tianyuan - </p><p></p><p>Each city held tens of thousands of humans.</p><p></p><p>They stood within the cities, looking back at the blood sea behind them, and ahead towards the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing carried the thirteen cities and arrived at the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>He had brought them out of danger.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Truth of Sword Gate is truly formidable..."</p><p>"The Demon Prince wielded a supreme weapon, yet was no match for Sword Truth Gu, and was even suppressed by him."</p><p>"With such a person, my northern realm can prosper for three thousand years!"</p><p>"Thank goodness! We're finally saved."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince was dead, and no one could wield the heavenly wheel of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with the thirteen cities moved out of the blood formation's range, the demon lair could not form!</p><p></p><p>This was truly cause for celebration.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the Sword Gate formed a boundary enveloping heaven and earth.  </p><p></p><p>It was the great battle of the six three-in-one experts.</p><p></p><p>They could only see six blurred figures fighting within, along with the aura of supreme weapons pressing down on the boundary.</p><p></p><p>The sword cries from the three sword furnaces resounded through the northern realm!</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Gate's entrance, a black mass of demons waited in formation, ready to charge in at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity of Sword Gate had arrived!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, carrying the thirteen cities, was consuming his spiritual power, divine soul, physical strength, blood energy.</p><p></p><p>With his invincible might, he had slain the Demon Prince, but could not intervene in this battle of the three-in-one experts.</p><p></p><p>His divine eye pierced the void, his profound pupils scanning the sword boundary.  </p><p></p><p>Strands of sword energy ripples nearly severed his profound pupils!</p><p></p><p>Even his divine eye could not see through the sword boundary.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the sword boundary shook continuously, the aura of supreme weapons terrifying as it transmitted into the northern realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly wheel of life and death hanging high above the northern realm moved, instantly flying out towards the sword boundary. The blood sea formation dissipated, the massive demon lair deep in the northern realm unleashing a cloud of evil that had yet to fully form, now dispersing.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"</p><p>"Boom boom boom————————" </p><p></p><p>The lands quaked, and Gu Jiuqing dropped the thirteen cities, ascending the Sword Gate's divine mountain alone.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>From the base of the divine mountain, the outer disciples saluted Gu Jiuqing in unison!</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Gu Jiuqing was no longer just a disciple of Sword Gate, but had become a high-ranking member equal to the peak masters, a pillar of Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of respect echoed through Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>After the outer disciples, it was the inner disciples!</p><p></p><p>Then came the true disciples from the islands.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, almost all of Sword Gate's true disciples had left the mountain to wander. Even some true disciples from over a thousand years ago emerged from the islands, standing outside the palaces to bow to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!" </p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Those of high attainment took precedence. Gu Jiuqing's strength far surpassed theirs, so they willingly called him Senior Martial Brother.</p><p></p><p>These true disciples were the foundation of Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a Sword Immortal, some even ancient Sword Immortals.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing glanced over and saw several celestial immortals at the Tribulation realm!</p><p></p><p>From the solitary islands emerged one Sword Immortal after another.  </p><p></p><p>Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, had reached a crisis of life and death.</p><p></p><p>These true disciples had cultivated the Sword Dao bitterly at Sword Gate, awaiting this very day.</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing, enter the Sword Palace!"</p><p></p><p>A voice called from within the Sword Palace.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure moved, bidding farewell to the Sword Immortals before entering the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>This was the meeting place for Sword Gate's highest ranks.  </p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's status, he could not normally set foot here.</p><p></p><p>But his display of power just now was too terrifying! Allowing him to enter the Sword Palace as an exception.</p><p></p><p>Within the Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>Several figures watched the sword boundary below Sword Gate.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing recognized three of the peak masters.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Peak Master wore azure robes, a worried look on her brow.  </p><p></p><p>The Barbarian Peak Master exuded a wild sword intent all around her.</p><p></p><p>The third was the Jadeite Peak Master!</p><p></p><p>During the nine-day great trial, an elder from the Jadeite lineage - a true disciple from over a thousand years ago - fell, using his flying sword as the trial sword for observation!</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Peak Master looked at Gu Jiuqing entering the Sword Palace, a complex expression on her face.  </p><p></p><p>She had also wanted to take Gu Jiuqing as a disciple back then!</p><p></p><p>But alas, Gu Jiuqing was accepted by the Supreme One's lineage instead.</p><p></p><p>What a pity!</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Peak Master pointed to several other high-ranking Sword Gate elders beside her, introducing them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Palace Master of our Soul Palace!"  </p><p>"This is the Palace Master of the Law Enforcement Palace!"</p><p>"And this is the Pavilion Master of the Scripture Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>The decline of Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Of the nine peak masters, two of the three-in-one experts were battling demons at the Sword Gate. Only three peak masters remained in the Sword Palace.  </p><p></p><p>The other four peak masters had been assassinated in battle across the nine states.</p><p></p><p>Even including the Soul Palace Master, Law Enforcement Palace Master and Scripture Pavilion Master, Sword Gate's highest ranks numbered less than ten.</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing, there is a matter that requires you to handle!"</p><p></p><p>The Soul Palace Master spoke up.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards him.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Our Sword Gate now faces a crisis of survival. With the demons massing outside the gate, ready to attack, you should go to the Sword Peak and request that the Patriarch descend from seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>Request the Patriarch to descend from seclusion?</p><p></p><p>So it had finally come to this.</p><p></p><p>But wasn't the Patriarch not even on the mountain?</p><p></p><p>The Soul Palace Master saw Gu Jiuqing's confusion and sighed bitterly.  </p><p></p><p>"Over a thousand years ago, when the Patriarch went into seclusion, he only left word that we could enter the Sword Peak to request his emergence if anything happened."</p><p></p><p>Over the years, they had entered the Sword Peak several times but never detected the Patriarch's aura.  </p><p></p><p>They suspected the Patriarch was not even on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>But at this juncture, they could only ascend the Sword Peak to request Jiang Xingyun's presence.</p><p></p><p>"Very well!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing agreed to this task.  </p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Sword Peak, a hint of curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He too wished to see what kind of peerless figure this man was, the third strongest in the world, formidable enough to be schemed against by the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p><p></p><p>There's still one more!</p><p></p><p>This climactic plotline has only just begun.</p>

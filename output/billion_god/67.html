        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Sword Gate, Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Valley of the Sword Gate imitated the Wind and Thunder Valley of the Eastern Wilderness. Every day, there were quite a few Sword Gate disciples entering the Thunder Valley to cultivate the thunder sword intent!</p><p></p><p>In the inner sect, there were not many sword intents that sword cultivators could access, and the thunder sword intent was one of them. </p><p></p><p>Several sword cultivators spat out sword lights and condensed sword pills. They were actually using the thunder in the Thunder Valley to forge sword pills, enhancing the grade of their flying swords.</p><p></p><p>Further away, there were also many sword cultivators guiding the divine thunder of the nine heavens, subduing the true meaning of the thunder dao, and transforming it into their own sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"You few seem to have quite the elegant interest, forging flying swords with thunder. Aren't you afraid the flying swords will be damaged and backfire on you?"</p><p></p><p>A sword light flew over from afar across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>It landed in the Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>He condensed his flying sword into a sword pill, drew it back into his Baihui acupoint, and struck it into his flesh.</p><p></p><p>The one who came was none other than Lu Yuan!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? It's actually Lu Yuan, Senior Brother Lu?"</p><p></p><p>Someone exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>There was also someone who mocked, "Brother Lu Yuan, haven't you already become an executor? How do you still have time to come to the Thunder Valley?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you were scolded by that Sword Dao Foremost, couldn't bear the insult, and ran back to the inner sect?"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, several sword cultivators burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan didn't get angry. He walked over to Gao Shuli and said, "Gao Shuli, ah Gao Shuli, it's only been a few months since we last met, how have you become so disgusting?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan made a vomiting gesture.</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli hurriedly jumped far away.</p><p></p><p>"Don't, if you're going to vomit, do it on Shao Jie. He loves being dirty, you know that."</p><p></p><p>That Shao Jie sword cultivator had colorful clouds surging above his head, a crimson color, with misty clouds and glowing divine lights raining down.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Shuli, say one more word and don't blame me for turning my face away from you."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Brother Shao Jie, when did you learn how to turn your face? Show us!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right, Brother Shao Jie, could it be that this new face-turning technique of yours is just like your Wu Family's Seven-Colored Clouds Art, unable to turn properly?"</p><p></p><p>"Heheh, Face-Turning Brother, quickly put away your Wu Family's Seven-Colored Clouds Art, lest you get mocked by Lu Yuan again."</p><p></p><p>Several sword cultivators laughed heartily, mocking each other.</p><p></p><p>That Brother Shao Jie, now nicknamed Face-Turning Brother, withdrew the Seven-Colored Clouds Art and looked at Lu Yuan unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"You see, as soon as you came back, I got another nickname."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan pondered, counting with his fingers, "This is perfect, just enough to make seven nicknames to summon the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, hahaha."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have thought of something and burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>The others looked bewildered at first, then had a realization and also laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Shao Jie, you're from the Wu Family of the Northern Dipper Ancient City in the Northern Lands, which happens to be the seventh walled city in the Northern Lands. Seven nicknames is just right to awaken the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper!"</p><p></p><p>"Northern Dipper Brother! Seven Stars Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shao Jie didn't dare say a word. He had just said one sentence and gained three or four more nicknames.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid, really afraid.</p><p></p><p>These few sword cultivators were extraordinarily talented, all having cultivated to the realm of formless water and finger-bending pellet swords. They had rather good relationships, with over ten years, or even over twenty years of friendship.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan quickly blended into their group as well.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, have you all heard? That moon divine ship in our sect has already started activating."</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli, a disciple from the Southern Dipper Ancient Family.</p><p></p><p>He was also the one with the highest cultivation among this group!</p><p></p><p>He received this news from a disciple at the Divine Weapon Peak, also known as the Refining Peak.</p><p></p><p>"The moon divine ship? You mean that divine ship that can fly to the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Another sword cultivator exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>This sword cultivator carried a huge iron sword on his back, the sword placed in an enormous sword case, with only a small portion of the blade exposed.</p><p></p><p>Du Gu Ming!</p><p></p><p>From the ninth ancient city of the Northern Lands, the Great Void Ancient City!</p><p></p><p>The Du Gu Family was also a sword cultivating clan. Du Gu Ming's sword dao cultivation was exceptionally profound. He had already cultivated to the third stage of sword intent and was vying for the position of an true disciple.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors that our Sword Gate has a divine ship that can fly to the moon. Over two hundred years ago, it carried Sword Gate disciples to the moon to observe it!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other sword cultivators revealed looks of longing.</p><p></p><p>The moon, ah!</p><p></p><p>That was a celestial body. Being able to fly to the moon to cultivate, contemplate the moon, and comprehend the moon's divine abilities would greatly accelerate one's cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>It could even allow one to instantly accomplish the cultivation of moon-related divine bodies!</p><p></p><p>"Gao Shuli, is this information accurate?"</p><p></p><p>Someone questioned skeptically.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's accurate. A disciple from the Divine Weapon Peak saw it with his own eyes and told me directly."</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli added in a low voice, "This time, there are very few quotas for the moon divine ship. Most of the quotas have already been taken by the elite inner sect disciples, and some quotas need to be given to the true disciples. Only twenty or thirty unallocated quotas have been released."</p><p></p><p>Twenty or thirty quotas?</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators pondered. They all wanted to board the moon divine ship and fly to the moon to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But with only twenty or thirty quotas, they would each need to employ their means to compete for them.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became somewhat quiet!</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli looked towards the silent Lu Yuan. "Lu Yuan, what about you? Has that true disciple senior brother of yours managed to get you a ticket for the moon divine ship?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was taken aback for a moment before reacting.</p><p></p><p>"That true disciple senior brother of mine is wholeheartedly focused on cultivation. To him, what difference is there between cultivating on the moon or not cultivating on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>A Sword Dao Foremost would hardly care about such meager resources.</p><p></p><p>The other sword cultivators' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Yuan knew the timing was ripe.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sighed, and the others followed suit with their own sighs.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all sighing?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm lamenting the unfairness of fate. Why does that Sword Dao Foremost possess such heavenly talent, while we are merely ordinary?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli, Wu Shao Jie, Du Gu Ming, and the others responded to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Our talents may be higher than ordinary inner sect disciples, but compared to the Sword Dao Foremost, we are still far behind."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Like the light of a firefly compared to the brilliant moon."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's heart was moved, and he carefully took Gao Shuli's hand. </p><p></p><p>"Who says it's not? These days, while in the Heavenly Sword Palace, I have been observing that sword dao leader day and night."</p><p></p><p>"Guess what I saw?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli hurriedly asked, "What did you see?"</p><p></p><p>The others leaned in, surrounding Lu Yuan, and pricked up their ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>"I saw Senior Martial Brother Gu, that is, the sword dao leader, flying with his sword!"</p><p></p><p>Flying with his sword?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean Gu Jiuqing has also completed the rootless water and soft-as-silk flying sword technique?</p><p></p><p>He only joined the sword sect three months ago.</p><p></p><p>Has he already become a sword cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"Don't disbelieve me, Senior Martial Brother Gu has at least cultivated three parts of the sword intent, but I feel even three parts is an understatement - at least five parts of the sword intent, a half-step sword immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli nodded repeatedly, "I've heard of this matter. The inner sect is all abuzz with rumors that the sword dao leader has already reached the half-step sword immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"There are also rumors that the Celestial Goddess who visited the sword sect some time ago is the sword dao leader's lover!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the sword cultivators looked at Lu Yuan curiously, as if waiting for his confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan wanted to laugh but held it in.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's how I feel too. It seems this is the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, Senior Martial Brother Gu is so talented. With the help of the Celestial Goddess and his own unparalleled sword dao talent through the ages, this senior martial brother will definitely be able to reach immortality in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other sword cultivators were deeply moved and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, although there are many true disciples of the Mountain River Peak among the nine great peaks of the sword sect's true lineages, none have particularly outstanding sword cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Dugu Ming analyzed, "Of the three true disciples under that female sword immortal of the Lotus Peak, all have already cultivated to the sword immortal realm, but it took them hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>"Of the Third Elder's lineage, only Senior Martial Brother Wu Yong has cultivated to the sword immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal Wu Yong is an elder of the Wu Family of the Northern Dipper Ancient City, over three hundred years old, and also the ancestor of Wu Shaojie.</p><p></p><p>"Of the disciples under the Ninth Yang Peak Lord, there are also a number who have cultivated for hundreds or even thousands of years, led by Senior Martial Brother Lieyang, who is also hailed as one of the three great true disciples of the sword sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Three Martial Nephews of the Sword Sect! Senior Martial Brother Lieyang of the Ninth Yang Peak!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Feng of the Primordial Peak and Senior Martial Sister Hanxue of the Celestial Snow Peak are two sword immortals whose names have been renowned for a long time. In their early years, they traveled the world and made a great name for themselves, having experienced the chaos of demons and monsters nine hundred years ago!"</p><p></p><p>These three are the Three Martial Nephews of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Dugu Ming's eyes flickered, "But compared to this sword dao leader, these three talents pale in comparison. Only the Sword Immortal Child may be able to rival the sword dao leader's talent!"</p><p></p><p>Such a peerless genius, they could only lament the unfairness of fate.</p><p></p><p>As they were sighing, Lu Yuan spoke again, "Yes, Senior Martial Brother Gu's talent is too extraordinary. But fortunately, this senior martial brother has not grown up yet."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The other sword cultivators were stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>What was Lu Yuan going to do?</p><p></p><p>He better not go astray.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their strange expressions, Lu Yuan realized they had misunderstood and hurriedly explained, "You're thinking too much. What I mean is, since Senior Martial Brother Gu has not become famous yet, why don't we become his followers?"</p><p></p><p>Followers??</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators froze!</p><p></p><p>Their expressions became complicated.</p><p></p><p>They were inner sect disciples. After reaching the third boundary, they would become Unrivaled Cultivators and could establish their own clans in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>For them to follow a peerless genius?</p><p></p><p>They had never considered this.</p><p></p><p>"I understand Senior Martial Brother Gu's background - utterly ordinary. When Senior Martial Brother Gu first joined the sect, he even offended the White Jade Sword Immortal, that is, the old patriarch of the Qu Family!"</p><p></p><p>"If we can help him out at this critical juncture, then when Senior Martial Brother Gu reaches immortality, we will be credited as meritorious followers!"</p><p></p><p>An immortal is at least a near-godlike powerful being!</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be reasonable for him to bestow rewards and fiefs upon his followers, like an eternal life clan?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the sword cultivators' breathing quickened as they were moved.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, don't rush. You don't need to respond so hastily."</p><p></p><p>"I'll return to the Heavenly Sword Palace first. After you good friends have thought it through, come and tell me then."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did not urge them.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a follower was a significant matter - they could not decide on their own and needed to consult their families!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood up, stepped into the void, and flew out of the Thunder Valley, then walked step-by-step up Mingtingfeng towards the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Watching Lu Yuan's departing figure, Gao Shuli, Wu Shaojie, Dugu Ming, and a few other disciples from great clans fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gao Shuli said coldly, "Among us, Lu Yuan is the most thoughtful. Back in the Northern Lands, he was the one who insisted on joining the sword sect, even persuading us to join the sword sect together!"</p><p></p><p>"Now he's telling us this matter. I dare say Lu Yuan has already become a follower of that sword dao leader."</p><p></p><p>The other sword cultivators nodded.</p><p></p><p>They had thought of this too.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a follower of an immortal is no small matter. Back when he persuaded us to come to the sword sect, he spent dozens of days convincing us!"</p><p></p><p>But today, he only said a few words before leaving.</p><p></p><p>This didn't seem like Lu Yuan's character.</p><p></p><p>After considering for a long time, the sword cultivators reached a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This guy must have uncovered the sword dao leader's secrets at the Heavenly Sword Palace, so he notified us. But he didn't want to share the follower positions, so he only dropped a hint!"</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators looked at each other!!</p><p></p><p>"Not good, we can't let Lu Bigmouth succeed. I'll report this matter to my clan immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli hurriedly left the Thunder Valley, and the other sword cultivators followed, intending to discuss the matter of becoming followers with their clans.</p><p></p><p>On the mountainside of Mingtingfeng, a sword cultivator paused, watching sword lights frantically flying out of the Thunder Valley. He smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is settled!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lu Yuan resumed his steps upward.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the senior martial brother will complete the Heaven's Fate technique. The task the senior martial brother gave me is almost prepared."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

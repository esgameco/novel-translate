            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Six Realms Grand Painting!</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers flow, the void ripples, the land beneath is a blank slate!!</p><p></p><p>The path has disappeared!</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing remains standing in this illusory, unreal world. </p><p></p><p>"Is this the space within the Six Realms Grand Painting?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed up at the vast heavens.</p><p></p><p>White mountains, black waters!</p><p></p><p>This is a world of white mountains and black waters, as if someone had splashed ink to paint, and then pulled him into the painting.</p><p></p><p>The mountains are white, the waters are black, the sky is pitch black with a few white clouds drifting overhead.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood atop a white mountain. </p><p></p><p>He looked around at the heavens and earth, constantly recalling the words spoken by the Sixth Demonic Prince.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Realms Grand Painting! The Third Realm of the Incomplete Realm! Even the Pure Yang Ancestral Master cannot escape!"</p><p></p><p>"This grand painting should be the divine weapon painted by the Demonic Emperor. The six realms correspond to the Realms of Shedding Mortality, Cultivation Power, Incompleteness, Refining Divinity, Heavenly Palace, and Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"My physical body has shed mortality, my dantian has cultivation power, my spine has the primordial essence, but I have not opened my celestial apertures, so the Six Realms Grand Painting recognizes me as a cultivator of the third realm."</p><p></p><p>"This is the space of the third realm within the Six Realms Grand Painting."</p><p></p><p>In the instant he was absorbed into the Six Realms Grand Painting, Gu Jiuqing saw its original form.</p><p></p><p>White mountains and black waters formed a forest, this painting was divided into six layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The white mountains were in the middle position.</p><p></p><p>The black waters were in the first and second layers of space, so those cultivators of the Realms of Shedding Mortality and Cultivation Power would be absorbed into the black waters.</p><p></p><p>The white mountains were in the third layer of space, cultivators of the Incomplete Realm would enter the white mountains.</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of space was the white clouds above the white mountains. Cultivators of the Realm of Refining Divinity would be transported to the white clouds.</p><p></p><p>The fifth layer of space was the two stars above the white clouds, cultivators of the Heavenly Palace Realm would be absorbed into those two stars in the painting.</p><p></p><p>The sixth and final layer of space was a celestial court!</p><p></p><p>White mountains, black waters, stars, and celestial court!</p><p></p><p>This was a depiction of the ancient celestial court shining upon the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"If a True Immortal of the Tribulation Realm were to enter, they would be trapped in the celestial court of the painting."</p><p></p><p>"So how can one escape?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed at the white mountain, looking at the black waters below.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and a rainbow light flashed!</p><p></p><p>That was the flying technique, the Transforming Rainbow Art from the Golden Crow Primordial Essence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Pangu Divine Body was partially formed, his Golden Crow Primordial Essence was dense. With the Transforming Rainbow Art, he instantly broke through the mountains and arrived at the foot of the white mountain.</p><p></p><p>Below were the rippling black waters, the black waters flowing.</p><p></p><p>The vast black waters blocked Gu Jiuqing's path forward.</p><p></p><p>He even saw human figures wavering within the black waters!</p><p></p><p>"Are there others trapped in the Six Realms Grand Painting? These figures should be members of the Great Wind Clan."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze flickered, and he turned to look up at the white mountain.</p><p></p><p>He saw figures flying out from each of the white mountains above.</p><p></p><p>There were youthful figures, as well as elderly ones.</p><p></p><p>Their auras were scattered, all of them of the Incomplete Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Some had partially formed divine bodies, others had fully formed divine bodies, all of them wind-attribute divine bodies.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing could speak, someone addressed him.</p><p></p><p>"Could you be reinforcements sent by Great Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is the Sword Sect here to support the Venerables of my Great Wind Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The figures stared at Gu Jiuqing, some suspicious, some excited, some puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to these figures, "I am Gu Jiuqing, a true disciple of the Sword Sect. Greetings to the members of the Great Wind Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"What? A true disciple of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, we're saved at last, we've finally awaited the Sword Sect's arrival! With a true disciple of the Sword Sect here, it seems the Sword Sect has truly been angered this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Demons invaded Qing Zhou, daring to disrupt the Celestial Realm of Tian Mu. Venerable, which Sword Immortal is leading the Sword Sect's forces this time?"</p><p></p><p>Which Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>These members of the Great Wind Clan had mistaken him for a rescuer.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, "Members of the Great Wind Clan, you are mistaken. I came from the Sword Sect, passing through Qing Zhou. I wanted to borrow the ancient teleportation array of the Great Wind Clan to reach the Celestial Realm of Tian Mu, but encountered demons there, which led to me being struck into the Six Realms Grand Painting."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan members stared blankly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying the Great Wind Clan has been invaded by demons, and the Sword Sect is still unaware of this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>That was likely the case!</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that within the Great Zhou territory, there would appear so many demons, even the Sixth Demonic Prince was present in the Qing Zhou domain.</p><p></p><p>"Then what should we do, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"With a true disciple of the Sword Sect trapped here, those demons wouldn't dare kill us."</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized, gradually calming down.</p><p></p><p>A true disciple of the Sword Sect bore the sect's mark. If a true disciple died, it would be transmitted to the highest levels of the Sword Sect. At that time, the Sword Sect's highest levels would descend and inevitably learn of this matter!</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan members looked at Gu Jiuqing, their expressions gradually becoming sharp.</p><p></p><p>"Members of the Great Wind Clan, you need not do that," said Gu Jiuqing calmly.</p><p></p><p>He was quite nonchalant. "Even if you sixty or so people attack together, you are still not my match."</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan members frowned!</p><p></p><p>Some even looked embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They had just been thinking of joining forces to kill Gu Jiuqing, allowing the true disciple of the Sword Sect to perish here.</p><p></p><p>Then the highest levels of the Sword Sect would send people to the Celestial Realm of Tian Mu!!</p><p></p><p>This was the best solution.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had directly seen through their intentions, leaving them quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan members bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"We were deluded, please punish us, Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan of Tian Mu was well-versed in the classics and specialized in scholarship. Each of them had received proper etiquette training.</p><p></p><p>They could see through themselves and discern right from wrong.</p><p></p><p>Just now they had harbored evil intentions, but now they had cut off those intentions, remaining people who understood propriety.</p><p></p><p>One of the Great Wind Clan members stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>This member appeared somewhat elderly, over forty years old, his Wind Spirit Divine Body fully formed, having filled his thirty-three vertebrae with primordial essence.</p><p></p><p>He bowed again to Gu Jiuqing, "Just now we heard you say that you alone could defeat all of us Great Wind Clan members?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally it is true!"</p><p></p><p>The elderly Great Wind Clan member looked delighted upon hearing this, and hastily said, "Venerable, you may not be aware, but this grand painting is called the Six Realms Grand Painting, a divine weapon refined by the Demonic Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"We members of the Great Wind Clan of Tian Mu have been trapped in the Six Realms Grand Painting for half a month now. During this time, we have also grasped the ins and outs of the Six Realms Grand Painting."</p><p></p><p>The Six Realms Grand Painting is divided into six realms: the Realms of Shedding Mortality, Cultivation Power, Incompleteness, Refining Divinity, Heavenly Palace, and Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Anyone from these six realms would be absorbed into their corresponding position.</p><p></p><p>To escape, one must defeat the Painting Spirit within each realm.</p><p></p><p>"This grand painting was personally refined by the Demonic Emperor, and the Demonic Emperor infused his own realm's attainments into the Painting Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"In the Realm of Shedding Mortality, there is a Painting Spirit that is the Demonic Emperor's perfected self after shedding mortality, reflected in the black waters!"</p><p></p><p>"And on the white mountain, that Painting Spirit of the Demonic Emperor is the imprint of his perfection in the Incomplete Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as we defeat this imprint of the Demonic Emperor, we can leave the Six Realms Grand Painting!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan members crowded around Gu Jiuqing, gazing up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The white mountains towered, a gentle breeze caressing them, surrounded by the black heavens and earth, the white clouds reflecting the white mountains.</p><p></p><p>A few small figures walked to the edge of the painting.</p><p></p><p>Before them, the black void rippled, and then a figure emerged from the rippling void.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this figure appeared, the Great Wind Clan members retreated a step.</p><p></p><p>They muttered "Not good" and hurriedly said,</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, there is one more thing we forgot to mention."</p><p></p><p>"If defeated, this imprint of the Demonic Emperor will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>They had truly forgotten this detail.</p><p></p><p>More voices reached Gu Jiuqing's ears.</p><p></p><p>"This imprint is the Demonic Emperor at the peak of the Incomplete Realm. His physical body, cultivation power had already condensed to the utmost, even his spirit had taken form. He can send out his spirit, and many of our Great Wind Clan members died to this move."</p><p></p><p>This was hard-earned experience paid in blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Emperor of the Incomplete Realm did not cultivate the Myriad Heavens Life and Death Cycle, but he possessed a divine ability called 'Devouring the Entire World'. He wove demonic energy into a furnace that devoured all under heaven. This divine ability is extremely formidable, at the level of a Supreme Divine Ability!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Emperor's physical body in the Incomplete Realm is tremendously powerful. Do not engage him in physical combat, even those with fully formed divine bodies could not withstand three of his moves!"</p><p></p><p>"To defeat the Demonic Emperor's Incomplete Realm self, Venerable, you can fight him indirectly. He can only appear in this area of rippling black void space. Once outside this area, this imprint will retreat."</p><p></p><p>One after another, the Great Wind Clan members anxiously watched Gu Jiuqing, then the Demonic Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This was the youthful Demonic Emperor!</p><p></p><p>This was also Gu Jiuqing's first time seeing a Demonic Emperor-level figure from the demon race.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Emperor, the father of the Six Demonic Princes!</p><p></p><p>To be able to teach someone like the Great Demonic Prince, the Demonic Emperor's talents could not be weak.</p><p></p><p>However, he was different from Gu Jiuqing's imagination of the Demonic Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In his imagination, the Demonic Emperor should be a ruler of the world, bearing an innate divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>But the demon before Gu Jiuqing now was completely different.</p><p></p><p>This Demonic Emperor manifested a demonic body, with horns on his head, wings on his back, and a single head with two hands, without any other unusual features.</p><p></p><p>His lower body trailed demonic energy, standing before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the demonic figure condensed, an aura of might emerged.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was tempered, his blood essence surging, his cultivation power gathering, the painting's ripples forming an Incomplete Realm mountain to support the Demonic Emperor's primordial essence, entering his body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a Demonic Emperor of the Incomplete Realm appeared.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was somewhat refined, his horns only the size of a palm, with a celestial eye closed on his brow ridge.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual aura emanated from the Demonic Emperor's body.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The demonic aura quickly filled this evil demon lord. </p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered with a ripple of spirituality as he looked at Gu Jiuqing with a hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Another cultivator below the Heavenly Realm has come?"</p><p></p><p>"The divine bodies within you are strange. You actually have a wind-attribute divine body and a fire-attribute divine body. No, no, you even have the origins of multiple elemental divine bodies!"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord looked at Gu Jiuqing in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? How did you discern that?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Pangu divine body had already taken minor form. The three-in-one Transcendent didn't mention his divine body, nor did his senior martial brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this three-in-one Transcendent was inferior to the demon lord?</p><p></p><p>"How did this lord discern it?" </p><p></p><p>"You are trying to evolve the origins of various divine bodies into a primordial divine body!"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the madman from Mingtingfeng, so he mistook the Pangu divine body that Gu Jiuqing was cultivating as a primordial divine body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly understood and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The admiration he had felt towards the demon lord vanished in an instant. </p><p></p><p>He suddenly lost interest.</p><p></p><p>He had always thought that the world was full of talented people emerging.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after joining the Sword Sect, he met his incredibly knowledgeable senior martial brother Liang Xiao, and encountered the farsighted Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>Adding his own sister who stirred up chaos in the ancient immortal tomb.</p><p></p><p>The four great goddesses of Luoshen in the northern regions were at the peak of the Spirit Refinement Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess was even an incarnation of a divine spirit, her cultivation level immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Then on the moon he met the Eighth Demon Prince, the Crown Demon Prince, and the righteous cultivator Jun Wushang.</p><p></p><p>He witnessed the celestial beasts of the starry skies, condensed the celestial heavens myth, and wielded the Primordial Sword to slay the Crown Demon Prince with the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Jiuqing started cultivating late, his starting point was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>He had always thought...</p><p></p><p>That this was the extraordinary world he had witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Now he realized that this world only belonged to a few individuals. </p><p></p><p>And he was one of those few who could contend for supremacy in this world!</p><p></p><p>"Is that not the case?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lord smiled faintly. "Then let me tear apart your fleshly body and see how many elemental origins you truly have from Buzhou Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Curious, a huge furnace appeared above the demon lord's head, instantly expanding to three zhang to cover the heavens and earth. </p><p></p><p>His fleshly body shone brilliantly as his demonic physique condensed a majestic force, each strand of hair piercing into the void.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, hands horizontally pushing apart the heavens as if to tear Gu Jiuqing apart.</p><p></p><p>"Senior of the Sword Sect, quickly, take action!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand there!"</p><p></p><p>They were anxious, too anxious.</p><p></p><p>The young demon lord had already made his move, why hadn't this senior disciple of the Sword Sect reacted yet?</p><p></p><p>They only heard Gu Jiuqing's melancholic voice.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Understand what?</p><p></p><p>Could it be an epiphany?</p><p></p><p>Demon lord, stop!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what profound insight this human cultivator from Buzhou Mountain had grasped.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing said seriously to the demon lord, "I understand now why those at the highest realms cannot withstand the chill. I understand why the patriarchs of the four great sects, lofty as they are, have not invaded the Primordial Chaos to exterminate all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The demon lord was displeased!</p><p></p><p>Although what Gu Jiuqing said was true.</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the four great sects were clearly more powerful than the Heavenly Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, Sword Sect Patriarch, and Celestial Lord - these four supreme experts could easily join forces to destroy all the demon lairs of the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>This was the best of times!</p><p></p><p>The path to divinity had been severed, so the Heavenly Realm was the final frontier.</p><p></p><p>But this was also the worst of times. Those with astonishing talents, who could have ascended to godhood in any era of antiquity, were unable to do so in this age.</p><p></p><p>They were solitary. They sought the Heavenly Realm, they were invincible in this world, but could only hope that future generations would surpass them and find a path to divinity!</p><p></p><p>Though Gu Jiuqing had not yet reached the peak of the Primordial Chaos, he could already sense this melancholy.</p><p></p><p>This world only belonged to those few individuals.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest?</p><p></p><p>They were merely mediocrities. "Yes, what I mean is, Demon Lord, you too are a mediocrity."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>What was the Senior of the Sword Sect doing?</p><p></p><p>Was he mocking the Demon Lord?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, someone accepted into the true teachings of the Sword Sect couldn't be so brainless, right?</p><p></p><p>Unless he was intentionally provoking the Demon Lord?</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Greater Wind Spirits realized!</p><p></p><p>How did they not think of this approach before?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Demon Lord was enraged.</p><p></p><p>The furnace manifested, demonic qi pouring out, a devouring force descending as the Demon Lord spread his arms, the three-zhang furnace above crashing down.</p><p></p><p>The black mist filling the sky was pierced through!!</p><p></p><p>The Greater Wind Spirits watched in shock.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Devouring of the World, that's a supreme technique! The Senior must not resist head-on!"</p><p></p><p>The elderly Greater Wind Spirit called out.</p><p></p><p>But what happened next left them dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This Senior of the Sword Sect looked at the descending furnace of the Demon Lord's technique and shook his head, his expression full of decadence.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>"If all the demon emperors of the Primordial Chaos are like you, perhaps in less than ten years I could single-handedly invade the demon lairs and subjugate you all."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made his move!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Devouring of the World furnace erupted, countless torrents annihilating the void. Two arms grabbed Gu Jiuqing's shoulders as well.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord was trying to tear Gu Jiuqing apart with his bare hands!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't budge an inch.</p><p></p><p>His azure locks swayed, each strand of hair slicing apart the torrents unleashed by this supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his hand, and the Demon Lord's left arm was directly blasted away!</p><p></p><p>He raised his left hand, not using any technique, spell, or sword intent, just casually throwing a punch.</p><p></p><p>This punch!</p><p></p><p>Looked very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But in the Demon Lord's eyes, it was an encounter with supreme dread.</p><p></p><p>His figure kept retreating, trying to escape the range of this punch.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>This punch didn't give the Demon Lord any chance to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The punch erupted, transforming into a palm strike midair!</p><p></p><p>The power of the arm manifested, fusing with celestial and earthly phenomena into a massive arm descending towards the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Five fingers spread, seizing the Demon Lord's head.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Cycle Natal Pill!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Devouring of the World!</p><p></p><p>Two arms!</p><p></p><p>Vast demonic aura!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Eye opened!</p><p></p><p>Thrashing horn!</p><p></p><p>All his techniques unleashed one by one, enough to kill a Spirit Refinement cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Let alone Gu Jiuqing, who was only in the Buzhou Realm yet so close to the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's vertical pupils radiated an extreme light - this was his innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>After achieving the three-in-one body, he had rarely used this innate technique.</p><p></p><p>The horn was also a trait of the demonic lineage, nourishing their power and able to easily pierce human flesh.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying auras intertwined as the Greater Wind Spirits looked on in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>This scene was too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord struggled, unleashing countless divine abilities, yet couldn't even break through Gu Jiuqing's defenses.</p><p></p><p>The extreme light of the Divine Eye shone on Gu Jiuqing's palm without even making his skin peel.</p><p></p><p>"As I said, you are a mediocrity!"</p><p></p><p>In this era, only his senior martial brother Liang Xiao and Si Wuxie could contend with him for supremacy.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers tightened!</p><p></p><p>Crack——————</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's head instantly exploded, the extreme light from the Divine Eye shattering, the Divine Eye crushed!</p><p></p><p>The horn was also deformed!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grasped the Demon Lord's limp corpse in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Another ray of divine light shot towards Gu Jiuqing's true body!</p><p></p><p>It was the Demon Lord's soul!!</p><p></p><p>The soul condensed by the Demon Lord in the Buzhou Realm was escaping his fleshly body, trying to break through Gu Jiuqing's true body and slay his soul!</p><p></p><p>"The gap between us in the same realm is too vast. Even if you opened your celestial aperture and cultivated to the Celestial Realm, you still couldn't be my match!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing in the Buzhou Realm didn't even regard the Demon Lord, who was in the Celestial Realm of Spirit Refinement, as a threat.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the same realm!</p><p></p><p>The ancient Celestial Emperors!</p><p></p><p>Or the ancient deities!</p><p></p><p>In the same realm, at most Gu Jiuqing would extend one arm. If he couldn't defeat his opponent with one hand, then he would lose!</p><p></p><p>Audacious!</p><p></p><p>Arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Outrageous!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's soul twisted in anguish!</p><p></p><p>To be so mocked by a human cultivator in the Buzhou Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh——————</p><p></p><p>Just as the soul was about to enter Gu Jiuqing's Mud Pill Palace, strands of thought emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand thought ripples instantly wove together behind Gu Jiuqing into a thirty-zhang Celestial Emperor's soul!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's soul froze, condensing before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>It was an eight-zhang soul!!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble————————"  </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor wielded the authority of heaven and earth, celestial phenomena manifesting behind him, a thirty-three-layered celestial canopy above his head.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-zhang soul raised its hand, striking down towards the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the Demon Lord...</p><p></p><p>Was utterly petrified!!!</p><p></p><p>An eight-zhang soul was the Demon Lord's proudest technique, but it paled in comparison to this thirty-zhang soul.</p><p></p><p>The eight-zhang soul needed to shed and become a nine-zhang soul, then condense into a yuanshen, followed by forming three souls and seven spirits, pushing to the nine-zhang limit of nine-zhang-nine, and using that nine-zhang-nine yuanshen to brave the Tribulation Lightning!</p><p></p><p>A thirty-zhang soul, or even a thirty-zhang yuanshen, was the mark of braving multiple Tribulation Lightnings!</p><p></p><p>A cultivator in the Buzhou Realm possessing the yuanshen of a Tribulation-Transcending Celestial?!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord...</p><p></p><p>Was utterly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Begging for bookmarking and monthly votes.

        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Mansion, the Cultivation Room!</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Jiuqing, a large batch of resources were piled up. </p><p></p><p>These past few days, too many prestigious families from the Northern Lands had visited Gu Jiuqing, and they all prepared thick gifts!</p><p></p><p>Just in spirit stones alone, excluding the Qu Family's three thousand spirit stones, another fifteen hundred spirit stones were received.</p><p></p><p>Even more affluent families, such as the Fan Family from the Ancient City of Tianyuan, sent a wine tavern as a congratulatory gift!</p><p></p><p>The Ye Family from the Ancient City of Qingyang sent a textile mill as a congratulatory gift! </p><p></p><p>The Qing Family from the Ancient Ruin City sent a mine as a congratulatory gift!</p><p></p><p>The Xia Family from the Ancient City of Guiyuan sent a peach mountain as a congratulatory gift!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's name had also been fully sung throughout the Northern Lands. The scholar Gu Jiuqing, the true inheritor of the Sword Gate, was unparalleled in fame, with an increasing trend of becoming the number one talented genius of the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>"The number one talented genius of the Northern Lands?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this title, even Gu Jiuqing himself was startled.</p><p></p><p>When did he grow to such heights?</p><p></p><p>"It's just an empty name, all empty names."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Gu Jiuqing's face as he opened the two jade boxes sent by Gu Linglong.</p><p></p><p>Inside the jade boxes were two spirit veins, which had been sealed within through special means.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the spirit veins!</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had pondered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still young now, and my cultivation is not enough. Although the Luo Shen is not bad, it's not something I can subdue at the moment!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Luo Shen, Gu Jiuqing only felt a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly removed those distracting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Injecting these two spirit veins into the Blue Star is the best choice."</p><p></p><p>Yes!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already made his decision.</p><p></p><p>He was going to inject these two spirit veins into the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged, entering meditation and contemplation. The Dao fruit from the Mud Bead Palace appeared.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, the scenes within the Dao fruit had been constantly evolving. They were the insights and cultivation realizations from the 800,000 people of Linjiang practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Art of Drawing Swords, all condensing into the Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not immediately absorb the cultivation and insights.</p><p></p><p>He had completed eight Sheddings of Mortality and wanted the ninth Shedding of Mortality, which required a qualitative change!</p><p></p><p>"It's almost here, it's almost here. As long as I inject the resources I've obtained this time into the Blue Star, my strength will reach new heights in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stretched out his hand, grabbed the two jade boxes, and activated the Dao fruit. His vision went black, and then the world became clear again.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes and appeared in the bedroom. On his bed, there were two additional jade boxes, which were the ones containing the two spirit veins.</p><p></p><p>Releasing the spirit veins was simple. Gu Jiuqing didn't care where these two spirit veins would end up.</p><p></p><p>He got up and opened the jade boxes, casually tearing apart the talisman seals inside!</p><p></p><p>Without the talisman seals suppressing them, the two spirit veins instantly broke free from their seals and slithered out of the window in streaks of light.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of light flickered, like meteors streaking across Linjiang. On this day, especially in this neighborhood, people saw two unusually flickering rays of light.</p><p></p><p>However, these two rays of light flashed and disappeared into the vast night sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Gu Jiuqing returned to the bedroom and opened his computer.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star, 8 PM. This was the first time Gu Jiuqing had descended to the Blue Star at this time. He first opened the Linjiang Forum and browsed it casually, then opened the search bar.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? It can still be used?"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Linjiang sealed off?</p><p></p><p>How was he still able to search?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing randomly typed a few words into the search bar, and soon the page redirected, displaying information related to his search.</p><p></p><p>[Buzhou Mountain, before the arrival of the high martial artists, was a mythical mountain in the legends of the Blue Star, said to be the spine of the primordial god Pangu transformed.]</p><p></p><p>[Buzhou Mountain was originally called Zhoushan, the Mountain of Great Perfection, the pillar supporting the heavens. Later, the mythical figure Gongong angrily rammed into Buzhou Mountain, causing the celestial pillar to break, the four seas to flood, and the Milky Way to hang upside down, giving it the name Buzhou Mountain.]</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing read the introduction of Buzhou Mountain, he became more and more astonished.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Buzhou Forging Method from the Qu Family, Gu Jiuqing had memorized this book of scriptures verbatim, greatly enhancing his understanding of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the primordial chaos cultivation, starting from the Foundation Establishment stage, one excavated the potential of one's physical body. Once that potential was developed to the extreme, one had to forcibly elevate it...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The physical body!</p><p></p><p>Thus began the forging of the divine body, crafting the human spinal column, cultivating it with the force of the imperfect, and then opening the divine apertures to draw in the forces of the celestial stars!</p><p></p><p>Revealing the celestial mechanisms, forging the imperfect, connecting heaven and earth, and then understanding yin and yang, creating a celestial palace within the mudball palace!</p><p></p><p>Revealing celestial mechanisms to refine divine powers, crafting the human body, with the spinal column as the Imperfect Mountain, the celestial divine apertures as the myriad stars in the sky, yin and yang transforming into the celestial palace, becoming the heavenly realm. The primal spirit resides within the celestial palace, becoming the Celestial Emperor!</p><p></p><p>This is the fundamental of the cultivation method of the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>But in the Blue Star world, the Imperfect Mountain refers to an actual mountain, a divine mountain transformed from the spinal column of the creator deity!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing began searching again for this ancient mythical figure.</p><p></p><p>[Pangu created the universe, his primal spirit transformed into the Three Purities, twelve drops of his essence became the ancestral shamans, each strand of his hair became the primordial dragon race, his blood transformed into the myriad stars, his right eye became the Sun Star, his left eye became the Moon Star.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed at the rising moon outside the window and murmured, "If the moon is truly transformed from a person's eye, wouldn't that make him a true deity?"</p><p></p><p>Could the brilliant moon in the Primordial Chaos be the eye of a deity?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's scalp went numb!!</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but he felt a chill all over his body, a great terror gripping his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star had just begun its rise in martial arts, and Gu Jiuqing planned to elevate it further.</p><p></p><p>But what about the Primordial Chaos?</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Chaos already had legends of deities, but in the past ten thousand years of the recent era, no cultivator could cultivate to become a deity!</p><p></p><p>This led to the situation where deities did not manifest in the world.</p><p></p><p>"The sword sect's supreme patriarch, the Buddha of the Buddhist sect, the ancestral patriarch of the Dao sect, and even the Divine Sovereign of the Great Zhou, they all want to become deities, but no one has been able to cultivate to that level. If it's as the Blue Star mythology says, could I possibly become a deity before them!"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star mythology speaks of Pangu creating the universe!</p><p></p><p>This also gave Gu Jiuqing a clear path to follow.</p><p></p><p>Could he emulate Pangu? Retrace Pangu's path in reverse?</p><p></p><p>The Qu family has the Yin-Yang Divine Body that can cultivate yin and yang energies!</p><p></p><p>The Gu family has the Golden Crow Divine Body, and the Golden Crow can transform into the right eye!</p><p></p><p>In Guiyuan Ancient City, the Xia family has the Great Yin Divine Body. The Great Yin Divine Body can manifest the Great Yin energy, depicting the Moon Rabbit or Moon Toad, or even transform into the left eye.</p><p></p><p>There was an elder in the Sword Sect who wanted to accept Gu Jiuqing as a disciple, claiming to possess the Mountain and River Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>With the Mountain and River Divine Body, there would also be the Divine Wood Body, the Blazing Dragon Body, the Great Earth Body, and even the Thunder and Lightning Body, the Divine Fire Body, and the Celestial Wind Body.</p><p></p><p>He could cultivate all of these divine bodies.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators could only forge the Imperfect with a single attribute, but Gu Jiuqing was different. With the Blue Star as his root, he could cultivate any constitution of the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>If he successfully cultivated all the constitutions, the Imperfect would contain the wills of various divine bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, at that time, I will be able to cultivate into a deity, attaining divinity with this physical body!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's mood was very heavy.</p><p></p><p>He was excited!</p><p></p><p>But the question he had just pondered still lingered deep in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the moon of the Primordial Chaos was truly the eye of a deity!!</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it, Gu Jiuqing's earlier excitement completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Why think so much about it, what does it matter even if it's true?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing buried this thought in the deepest recesses of his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I can verify the idea of emulating Pangu on the Blue Star. With its population of four billion people, which is not even the limit for the Blue Star, having so many people can help me verify this method."</p><p></p><p>"And now, I can begin verifying this idea."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure disappeared from the bed, and after a while, his figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>On the bed, there were now piles of spirit stones and bottles of elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Transmission of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>He would continue transmitting the Dao!</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's Yin-Yang Divine Body cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's Golden Crow Divine Body cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>He would transmit them all to the Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to emulate Pangu, while the author wanted to emulate a published author. Ahem, we need everyone's spirit stones, rating votes, and contributions to support us.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

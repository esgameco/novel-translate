        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Rays of light flickered, and the Celestial Goddess donned a starry gauze robe, treading on empty space, ushering in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes were fixated on the Celestial Goddess.  </p><p></p><p>"That's the Tianjian Palace next to Mingtingfeng Peak. The Celestial Goddess has actually come to find Gu Zhenchuan!"</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out Gu Zhenchuan is an old friend of the Celestial Goddess."</p><p></p><p>On peak after peak, on island after island of the orthodox disciples, sword cultivators gazed at this scene, their expressions complex, not knowing what to think. </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Goddess, a disciple of the great sect, having such a person as her companion - Gu Zhenchuan's position as an orthodox disciple was solidified. Who would dare offend this newly promoted orthodox?</p><p></p><p>Two elders accompanied the Goddess, seeing her off outside the sect gates.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Watching the departing Celestial Goddess, the disciples inside could not get over it for a long time, all discussing the relationship between Gu Jiuqing and the Celestial Goddess.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood at the entrance of Tianjian Palace, waiting for a while before Gu Jiuqing also walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Lu Yuan, why are you still waiting at Tianjian Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paused!</p><p></p><p>He had conversed with the Celestial Goddess for over half a shichen, and this enforcer had been waiting at the entrance for half a shichen too.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan smiled awkwardly. </p><p></p><p>He too had been observing the Celestial Goddess!</p><p></p><p>She was a disciple of the highest rank, yet had descended to seek out Senior Brother Gu.</p><p></p><p>In Lu Yuan's eyes, Gu Jiuqing had become an unfathomably powerful sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"It's good you're here, I don't need to look for you again."</p><p></p><p>"Several palaces inside Tianjian Palace were damaged when I was cultivating. You're a disciple of Zaowufeng, so you should have a way to restore them, right?"</p><p></p><p>While practicing sword arts in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, Gu Jiuqing had accidentally pierced through palace after palace, smashing walls and even creating cracks in the main hall of Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was this that allowed the Celestial Goddess to sense a trace of Gu Jiuqing's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He needed to seal this leak!</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured Senior Brother, this junior will first inspect Tianjian Palace, then consult Zaowufeng."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure flickered as he trod on empty space, step by step leaving Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>His physical body crossed the void without borrowing spiritual power or sword qi - it was completely ordinary, so Lu Yuan didn't think much of it. But after bidding farewell and entering Tianjian Palace,</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan realized something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, it seemed Senior Brother Gu was treading on empty space!"</p><p></p><p>But wait!</p><p></p><p>He had just said he was going to vent his surplus spiritual power, meaning he had no spiritual power left.</p><p></p><p>And sword qi!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan definitely didn't sense any sword qi from Senior Brother Gu.</p><p></p><p>Without using spiritual power or sword qi, yet able to tread the void?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, you hide your depths well. The more hidden depths you have, the more boundless your future achievements will be!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked at the main hall of Tianjian Palace and saw the holes in the walls!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the damage caused by Senior Brother Gu's cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>He entered the hall and saw palace after palace pierced through, holes in the walls.</p><p></p><p>"These holes lead to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber...Lu Yuan looked at the collapsed walls and pondered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, piercing through the walls of twelve palaces all the way to the main hall!</p><p></p><p>There was no doubting Senior Brother Gu's powerful cultivation, but he surely could control his power.</p><p></p><p>So was it possible that it started from the main hall, piercing backwards all the way to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber?</p><p></p><p>An image appeared in Lu Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, the figures of the Celestial Goddess and Senior Brother Gu intertwined, suddenly embracing each other, their physical bodies smashing through palace after palace until reaching the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber was the most special palace, with the best soundproofing.</p><p></p><p>"It must have happened like that!"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would the Celestial Goddess come seeking Senior Brother Gu?</p><p></p><p>The two had already been intimate in private!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sighed and left Tianjian Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Enforcer Palace!</p><p></p><p>This single palace was rather simple, with just one rest chamber besides.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood in the courtyard, an ancient tree before him. He stared at the tree, as if coming to a resolution.</p><p></p><p>"Hesitating will lead to defeat. What's more, I already boasted in front of Senior Brother Gu, how can I hesitate now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan fiercely thumped his chest, then took out a talisman from his qiankun bag.</p><p></p><p>The crimson talisman burned in midair as he channeled spiritual power into it. Soon it turned to ashes that transformed into a waterfall projection under the tree.</p><p></p><p>An image appeared in the waterfall!</p><p></p><p>It was a cultivating figure, surrounded by twinkling stars - the celestial apertures in his body, numbering over three hundred.</p><p></p><p>As this image appeared, figures emerged behind the waterfall mirror.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral patriarchs of the Lu clan, even mummified remains at the immortal realm, all appeared in the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>They gazed at Lu Yuan with tense expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan! What great matter has occurred?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you at the sword sect? Did demons invade? Or did an elder attack you?"</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Body Blood Talisman could be ignited anywhere to connect with the Lu clan ancestral hall.</p><p></p><p>So upon seeing Lu Yuan, they anxiously asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan shook his head. "Father, ancestral patriarchs, this junior has not encountered danger in the sect."</p><p></p><p>Not in danger?</p><p></p><p>Then why ignite the Blood Talisman?</p><p></p><p>They had nearly sacrificed their lives refining this talisman.</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>The Lu clan patriarchs glared at Lu Yuan displeased, as if about to berate him.</p><p></p><p>"Then what matter made you ignite the talisman?"</p><p></p><p>The current Lu clan patriarch, Lu Yuan's father, slowly stood up, the starry aura around him dissipating.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, and a pressure weighed on Lu Yuan despite being in separate realms.</p><p></p><p>"It's a major matter!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan said solemnly. "This matter concerns the very life and death of our Lu clan!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>What matter?</p><p></p><p>The Lu clan patriarch gestured for Lu Yuan to continue.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to follow a senior brother in the sword sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>A follower?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan wants to become a follower?  </p><p></p><p>The old ancestors of the Lu family changed their expressions drastically. The auras of each of the old relics intertwined, causing the entire ancestral temple to shake and crack from their auras. The beams above directly cracked open and the building collapsed. </p><p></p><p>Around them formed a barrier of spiritual energy, encircling these old relics.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"  </p><p></p><p>"Unfilial son! Say that again!"</p><p></p><p>A follower!</p><p></p><p>That's not something that can be decided casually?</p><p></p><p>A follower, to attend an immortal cultivator, just like the Star Maiden who commands eighty-one followers.</p><p></p><p>The Star Maiden can mobilize the forces behind those eighty-one followers, and those forces would all be loyal to the Star Maiden!</p><p></p><p>They, the Lu family, are one of the great clans of the Northern Lands with a vast foundation. For thousands of years, the Lu family has never considered following any immortal cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Immortal cultivators are just young prodigies - whether they can actually become immortals is still debatable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, most of these young prodigies are warmongers who want to cultivate through battle and violence, walking the path to immortality by trampling over the corpses of their enemies.</p><p></p><p>If they are defeated, their followers would also be utterly ruined!</p><p></p><p>So the relationship between follower and immortal cultivator is not so simple to establish.  </p><p></p><p>It is a decision made by an entire force, tying their life and death to that immortal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The Lu family has not declined yet, why should they follow an immortal cultivator??</p><p></p><p>"I, Lu Yuan, want to follow Senior Martial Brother Gu."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's voice became increasingly calm. He knew these stubborn old ancestors of the Lu family would be hard to convince, so without waiting for their anger, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zhenzhuan, the Sword Dao Luminary!"  </p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Luminary?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this name, the elders of the Lu family visibly paused.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, the Northern Lands were shaken when the ancient city of Tianyuan rang its divine bell, celebrating Gu Jiuqing's entry into the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>This matter caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>The name "Sword Dao Luminary" shook the hearts of all.</p><p></p><p>But this Sword Dao Luminary had only just joined the Sword Sect and had not grown into his full power yet. Who knows if Gu Jiuqing would even live to see that day!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu has already cultivated to the semi-Sword Immortal realm. Hmm, he may even cultivate the six or seven degrees of the Sword Intent!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan boasted respectfully.  </p><p></p><p>Not like these undying elders would personally go to the Sword Sect to verify it anyway.</p><p></p><p>Whatever he said would be taken as truth.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Senior Martial Brother Gu is about to reach the Realm of Spiritual Force. He has asked me to seek the body cultivation methods of all divine physiques, which makes me suspect that Senior Martial Brother Gu intends to condense the most powerful divine physique!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>The eyelids of the ancient elders twitched.</p><p></p><p>They had heard a legend from hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, many great tombs across the Northern Lands were robbed. The owners of these tombs were mostly elders of noble clans or great families, at the very least in the Unascended Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the legend of the Primordial Divine Physique was widely spread.  </p><p></p><p>The grave robbers stole the corpses, using the primal yuan qi of those Unascended Immortals to fuse and create the number one divine physique - the Primordial Divine Physique!</p><p></p><p>Reminded by Lu Yuan, these undying elders recalled this matter.</p><p></p><p>"You mean that Sword Dao Luminary is cultivating the Primordial Divine Physique!"</p><p></p><p>The Lu family patriarch's expression softened a bit.  </p><p></p><p>In sword dao talent, only the Sword Sect's Patriarch could be compared to Gu Jiuqing in the world today!</p><p></p><p>If he also cultivated the number one divine physique, the Primordial Physique, it's possible he could even take the position of Sword Sect Lord.  </p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't obtain that position, with Gu Jiuqing's terrifying talent, cultivating to an existence close to divinity would be a certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Also, I've discovered that Senior Martial Brother Gu has an affair going on with the Star Maiden."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stated his speculation as if he had witnessed it himself.</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The Star Maiden is Gu Jiuqing's lover?</p><p></p><p>In the shattered ancestral temple below, the ancient elders and undying ones of the Lu family were shocked.</p><p></p><p>She is the disciple leader of one of the four great sects! Just this relationship alone would be enough for a great clan to take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Inside the mirror, Lu Yuan remained silent. In the ancestral temple, the Lu family elders looked at each other.  </p><p></p><p>Their decision could influence the future of the Lu family, even its very life and death.</p><p></p><p>To become followers of this immortal cultivator Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Or to abandon Lu Yuan, expelling him from the Lu family and cutting all ties?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan grew anxious - why haven't the family elders agreed yet?</p><p></p><p>This was an alternative path to immortality. The Lu family is a great clan, but becoming an immortal clan is nearly impossible.  </p><p></p><p>But if they followed Gu Jiuqing, they could at least become an immortal clan in the future!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu is the Sword Dao Luminary with the prospect of condensing the number one divine physique. He is also the true inheritor of the Mingtingfeng lineage - the origins of that madman should be known to the venerable ancestors. In the future, Senior Martial Brother Gu will definitely become the Peak Master of Mingtingfeng, a Sword Immortal with the Primordial Divine Physique, wielding the Sword Furnace. What grand splendor that would be!"</p><p></p><p>"Currently, Senior Martial Brother has yet to travel the world and is still naive and ignorant. If I become his first follower now, do the venerable ancestors still have any hesitation?"</p><p></p><p>A resounding rebuke!</p><p></p><p>The ancestral elders amidst the ruined temple suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>What was there to hesitate over?</p><p></p><p>The future Peak Master of Mingtingfeng, wielding the Sword Furnace!</p><p></p><p>The bearing of the Sword Dao Luminary, with the prospect of condensing the number one divine physique!</p><p></p><p>And a true inheritor of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>For their mere great clan to be able to attain such an immortal cultivator, it was the blessing of the Lu family for ten generations.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan, heed my command!"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan is present!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lu family of Guiyuan City is willing to become the follower of the immortal cultivator Gu Jiuqing. From now on, the matters of this immortal cultivator will be the matters of the Lu family. All decisions regarding such matters shall be made by you, Lu Yuan, from now on!"</p><p></p><p>It was the current Lu family patriarch, granting authority to Lu Yuan!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan revealed a look of great joy.</p><p></p><p>On the True Sword Palace's island, in the administrative palace's courtyard under a large tree by a waterfall...</p><p></p><p>The mirror's image disappeared, and the corner of Lu Yuan's mouth curved up slightly.  </p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Martial Brother's great talent, he will definitely attract more followers in the future. The status of just being from the Lu family is not enough to become Senior Martial Brother's follower!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can seek out the scions of some other great clans and rally them to me."  </p><p></p><p>"I could become Senior Martial Brother's number one follower in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Set a goal to become Senior Martial Brother's top dog...no, top follower.</p><p></p><p>I hope this full translation is helpful!

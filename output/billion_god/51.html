        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, during the time when Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing ascended to the celestial realm to measure the clouds and sky. </p><p></p><p>Demonic chaos reigned, disciples of the Four Great Sects entered the mortal world. </p><p></p><p>The Buddha and Dao Patriarchs joined forces to suppress the chaotic age, coupled with the sudden death of the Celestial Emperor, the world fell into turmoil.</p><p></p><p>During this chaotic period, the scriptures of the Four Great Sects were constantly being stolen!</p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Scripture of the Sword Sect, the Past Sumeru Sutra of the Buddhist Sect, the Future Constellation Sutra of the Astrology Pavilion, and the Dao Scripture of the Dao Sect were being coveted!</p><p></p><p>The Horizontal Three Worlds Buddha Descent Dharma was stolen during that period, and the Buddhist Sect even caught the thief!</p><p></p><p>Since then, Princess Chengxiao's name became renowned. </p><p></p><p>Many believed that Princess Chengxiao secretly infiltrated the Four Great Sects to view their supreme scriptures, but no one found any other clues.</p><p></p><p>If this was indeed the case, having studied the supreme scriptures of the Four Great Sects, coupled with the profound heritage of the Great Zhou Dynasty, it would not be impossible for Princess Chengxiao to become the number one in the world in the future.</p><p></p><p>But what about Gu Linglong?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was the true inheritor of the Tingfeng lineage, and Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing was also familiar with the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family was merely a prestigious clan in the Heavenly Abyss Ancient City, with only a few hundred years of heritage. The strongest ancestor was only at the Imperfection Realm.  </p><p></p><p>For such an ordinary Imperfection Realm family to give birth to two peerless prodigies?</p><p></p><p>And judging from Thought Wuxie's expression!</p><p></p><p>The possibility of Gu Linglong becoming the number one in the world was even greater than Princess Chengxiao?</p><p></p><p>Inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>It was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing believed there was some reason to Thought Wuxie's words about Princess Chengxiao becoming the number one in the world.</p><p></p><p>But what made Gu Linglong qualified to become the future number one?</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met!</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie spoke first, "Senior Martial Brother Jiang, why don't we make a bet? If the future number one in the world is Gu Linglong, then Senior Martial Brother Jiang will remain in the Sword Sect for ten thousand years! Only after ten thousand years can Senior Martial Brother Jiang leave the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"How about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Then if the future number one is not Gu Linglong?"</p><p></p><p>The stakes for this bet were too high.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years confined in the Sword Sect, he could not wait that long!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, if it's not Gu Linglong, then I'll give my vision to Senior Martial Brother Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, deal!"</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie's vision!!</p><p></p><p>With his talent, plus Thought Wuxie's vision, becoming a deity in this modern era would be child's play.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brothers, what are you laughing about?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sword Tomb, Gu Jiuqing held the Slaughter Sword, using his Heavenly Slashing Sword Intent to suppress the Slaughter Sword Intent, easily picking up the Slaughter Sword.</p><p></p><p>"We're discussing who will become the number one in the future."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing did not hide it, smiling as he said, "Wuxie Junior Martial Brother's vision is the greatest I've ever seen. Junior Martial Brother, if you have any questions, you can ask Wuxie Junior Martial Brother."</p><p></p><p>Who would become the number one in the future?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not care.</p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>The future number one!</p><p></p><p>Would definitely be him, Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>What was there to argue about?</p><p></p><p>Instead, Gu Jiuqing was curious about how extraordinary Thought Wuxie's vision was to receive such high praise from Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing.</p><p></p><p>"Wuxie Junior Martial Brother, this is the first time I've heard Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing praise someone so highly."</p><p></p><p>They were both true disciples of the same lineage, of equal seniority.</p><p></p><p>Unless one became a Sword Immortal or the lineage leader.</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie addressed him as "Junior Martial Brother" out of respect. Naturally, Gu Jiuqing did not dare call him that.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother is highly talented. Junior Martial Brother has a question in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>He was just being polite, not expecting Gu Jiuqing to actually have a question.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, please ask!"</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie did not decline, observing Gu Jiuqing intently.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask Junior Martial Brother Wuxie, is there a way to infinitely strengthen the physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie stared intently.</p><p></p><p>This question was too broad.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother cultivates the Dragon Elephant Skill, transforming the physical body into a Dragon Elephant Divine Body, awakening too much Dragon Elephant Power that the physical body cannot contain!"</p><p></p><p>"Now Junior Martial Brother has completed eight Sheddings of Mortality and is about to reveal the Heavenly Mechanism. Having also cultivated three parts of the Sword Intent, I fear your physical body may collapse!"</p><p></p><p>"Hence this question!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing reiterated his "abilities" once more.</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie examined Gu Jiuqing, that feeling of being seen through rising again.</p><p></p><p>"Your physical body shows no trace of having undergone the Sheddings of Mortality. Eight Sheddings would at least leave behind one cast-off shell, but you have no aura of transcendence or extraordinary quality. It seems you've used Senior Martial Brother Jiang's method of using a divine weapon to suppress your physical body!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Jiang?</p><p></p><p>That must be Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing's surname.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant Power, inner energy, and Sword Intent you speak of are too powerful for the physical body to contain due to the limitations of your current realm!"</p><p></p><p>Limitations of the realm!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing had heard this term.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing also showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"The limit of the Shedding of Mortality Realm is ten times. Eight Sheddings grant the appearance of an unsurpassed prodigy. Nine Sheddings give the appearance of an ancient sage. Ten Sheddings, and one is no more than a youthful deity."</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing nodded, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, after ten Sheddings of Mortality, one should be able to condense a Primal Divine Body, reversing the primal state to become a Primal Celestial Being! A Primal Deity! After ten Sheddings, one can continue increasing one's innate qualities!"</p><p></p><p>Thought Wuxie glanced at Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiaoqing but did not respond, instead continuing his explanation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Shedding the mortal realm has the constraints of realms, and the Dragon and Elephant Skill has the constraints of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. If one can break through these constraints, then one has broken through the bottleneck."  </p><p></p><p>"Breaking through the bottleneck of the Shedding the Mortal Realm is cultivating to the Realm of Divine Power, and breaking through the bottleneck of the Realm of Divine Power is cultivating to the Unbounded Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned. </p><p></p><p>After saying so much, Si Wuxie still hadn't gotten to the main point.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie changed his words, "The constraints of realms are used to restrain cultivators, to prevent them from going berserk. Cultivators only need to follow the proper steps to cultivate into deities."</p><p></p><p>This sentence!</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, both Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao and Gu Jiuqing were greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Restrain cultivators?</p><p>Prevent cultivators from going berserk? </p><p>Who is restraining the cultivators?</p><p></p><p>The ancient laws are different from the recent ancient laws!</p><p>Did someone tamper with the ancient laws and pass down the recent ancient laws?</p><p></p><p>"The emergence of realms allows most cultivators to walk the path of attaining the Dao. Senior Martial Brother Gu, have you heard of the Three Secret Cultivation Methods proposed by the Zixia Academy?"</p><p></p><p>The Three Secret Cultivation Methods proposed by the Zixia Academy are precisely the three realms of Body Refinement, Qi Refinement, and Spirit Refinement that Gu Jiuqing taught in Senior High Class 2!</p><p></p><p>The students of Zixia Academy divide cultivation into three categories: Body Refinement cultivators, Qi Refinement cultivators, and Spirit Refinement cultivators. By reaching the pinnacle of a single secret realm, one can naturally comprehend the other two secret realms and reach their pinnacles as well.</p><p></p><p>"Body Refinement cultivation refines the physical body. Qi Refinement cultivation refines divine powers. Spirit Refinement cultivation refines the primordial spirit. Cultivating a single secret realm ignores the realm divisions of the recent ancient era. Senior Martial Brother, if you join the Zixia Academy, you can break through the shackles of the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie did not provide the answer, but instead suggested that Gu Jiuqing go to the Zixia Academy.</p><p></p><p>However, after the previous emperor of Great Zhou died tragically, the Zixia Academy of Great Zhou prohibited disciples of the Four Great Sects from entering.</p><p></p><p>For him to enter the Zixia Academy was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>"But is there another way to break through the shackles of realms?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already understood that these were the shackles of realms, not the shackles of the physical body!</p><p></p><p>At the Shedding the Mortal Realm, he possessed the strength to instantly kill cultivators of the Realm of Divine Power, or even the Unbounded Realm. This was the constraint of realms, the suppression of the recent ancient laws upon him!</p><p></p><p>To break through this suppression, using divine weapons to suppress the physical body was akin to enhancing the strength of one's physical body, similar to solely cultivating the secret realm of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing understood his own situation. The Thousand-Streaked Divine Weapon was very powerful, but above the Thousand-Streaked Divine Weapon were Great Artifacts! Great Artifacts were even more powerful than Thousand-Streaked Divine Weapons. Gu Jiuqing suspected that the Great Artifacts suppressing Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao on Unbounded Mountain were precisely a few Great Artifacts!</p><p></p><p>But in the future, Gu Jiuqing's foundation would definitely surpass Liang Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>So how many divine weapons and Great Artifacts would he need to suppress himself?</p><p></p><p>"Of course there is another way!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie extended his hand, and a sailboat formed from divine power appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"The physical body is the boat, and the soul is the sail. To expand the sail, aside from increasing one's realm, one can also increase the grade of the sail."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect has an unsurpassed supreme technique. No, it's not just the Sword Sect, the Celestial Pavilion, the Dao Sect, and the Buddhist Sect all have an unsurpassed supreme technique. This is the true unsurpassed supreme technique, transcending any scripture from the recent ancient era."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's expression changed, as he already knew what Si Wuxie was about to say.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Demon Visualization Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Five words!</p><p>Each word as heavy as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Senior Martial Brother Jiang, you even know about the Divine Demon Visualization Technique? It seems you must have also cultivated the Divine Demon Visualization Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie stared at Liang Xiao. "But why is there no aura of divine demons on you?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you sever your cultivation in the Divine Demon Visualization Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie was curious. This was the Divine Demon Visualization Technique! In the recent ancient era, even the Sword Classic, the Dao Classic, and the future Celestial Classic and Sumeru Classic could not compare to the Divine Demon Visualization Technique.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious that this true inheritor of the Mingting Peak could sever his cultivation in such a divine skill!</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Demon Visualization Technique, the Divine Demon Visualization Technique..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing kept chanting these five words, feeling that they were brimming with demonic power.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to cultivate the Divine Demon Visualization Technique!</p><p>He wanted all the people of Planet Blue to cultivate the Divine Demon Visualization Technique!!</p><p></p><p>As long as he could break through the shackles of realms, then from this point onward, no one could ever restrain Gu Jiuqing's immense power.</p><p></p><p>"Then how does one cultivate the Divine Demon Visualization Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked again.</p><p></p><p>"That requires you to meet the Sword Sect's Paramount Lord."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Divine Demon Visualization Technique was passed down from the Sword Sect's Ancestral Patriarch, who was the master of the current Sword Sect's Paramount Lord. Only the Paramount Lord knows this Divine Demon Visualization Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you can also inquire with Senior Martial Brother Jiang."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of a smile in Si Wuxie's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brothers, it's getting late. After all, the Sword Tomb is a forbidden ground of the Sword Sect. Senior Martial Brothers have lingered here for too long. If we disturb the Sect Master, that would be undesirable."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie was dismissing them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly bowed to Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Xiao seemed flustered and walked out of the Sword Tomb directly.</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough*, I've explained it away.</p><p></p><p>The few plot holes I dug earlier have now been mostly filled.</p><p></p><p>I've been writing this book for six or seven years. If you include the time I've spent reading books, it's been over ten years.</p><p></p><p>This book is definitely going to be very exciting! Please support me!</p><p></p><p>I beg for your readership next Monday and Tuesday!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Outside Jianmen Pass stretched an endless wilderness, while atop Jianmen Pass stood the sacred mountains of Jianmen. Inside Jianmen Pass were the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands, with flying horse-drawn carriages stopping within.</p><p></p><p>The youths from the ancient cities flew toward Jianmen Pass, riding in the flying horse carriages. </p><p></p><p>The carriages revealed the backgrounds of these youths from the ancient cities. One carriage was pulled by three dragon horses - each powerfully built steed emanating a faint glow, radiating a clear divine light in the night.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Qu Yaozhou's hands had been fully restored.</p><p></p><p>Before him stood an elderly man. "That kid from the Gu family went too far."</p><p></p><p>This was an old man from the Qu family, over a hundred years old, but through cultivation arts he appeared only around thirty. </p><p></p><p>He stood before Qu Yaozhou, his gaze flickering as strands of spiritual power flowed down, constantly circulating through Qu Yaozhou's physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the great examination at Jianmen. If you are injured, it will be nearly impossible for you to complete the second Spiritual Transcendence."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, he was trying to ruin Qu Yaozhou's path forward.</p><p></p><p>For a declining Gu family to dare attack the young master of the Qu family.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing has completed two Spiritual Transcendences in a row. If it was truly through his own talents, then surely within the next six days he will definitely complete the third Transcendence!"</p><p></p><p>Three Transcendences allows entry into the inner sect of Jianmen.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou gritted his teeth in hatred. He absolutely would not allow Gu Jiuqing to become an inner sect disciple of Jianmen.</p><p></p><p>"Yaozhou, there are many talents in this world. Jianmen guards the northern wilderness at Jianmen Pass, but those coming this time are merely youths from the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>"Look farther ahead on the path of cultivation. It is not talent that matters, but an unwavering heart."</p><p></p><p>The Qu family elder spoke calmly. He had experienced too many storms in his life. Talents? This world certainly did not lack for talents. Moreover, those who could walk the path of cultivation, were they not all sons of heaven?</p><p></p><p>"In the next few days, quickly complete the three Transcendences. The old patriarch has sent me a message - at that time, he will take you as his disciple in person."</p><p></p><p>That old patriarch! Taking me as a disciple?</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was overjoyed. That was a Jianmen elder, the strongest of the Qu family patriarchs. To be accepted by this elder as a disciple, what was Gu Jiuqing in comparison? How dare he challenge Qu Yaozhou?</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou hurriedly nodded. The elder left, and the ghostly light on the flying horse carriage dimmed before extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>9pm, Gu Jiuqing prepared to leave his rented room. His residence was not far from the school, just a ten minute walk away.</p><p></p><p>Along this ten minute path, Gu Jiuqing saw more than ten martial arts schools lining the street.</p><p></p><p>"Elite Martial Arts School - our head instructor won the championship at the 3rd Linjiang Martial Arts Competition, a veteran Bone Refining master!"</p><p></p><p>"No need for 99.8 or 98, just 9.8 and you get a chance for guidance from a martial champion!"</p><p></p><p>"Only 10 spots left, no, 9 spots now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The college entrance exam is just 3 months away, aren't you signing your kid up for a martial arts cram course? In 3 months, increasing inner energy by 0.01 is a piece of cake. 0.02 is easy with some effort. 0.03 just requires hard work. If you want 0.04, enroll at our Dragon Tiger Martial School!"  </p><p></p><p>"The instructors at Dragon Tiger are all university-graduated martial artists. Increasing inner energy by 0.1 in 3 months is no dream!"</p><p></p><p>"Tuition is only 6666. Two enroll together for a 10% discount! Three for 20% off!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It was madness. The martial arts should not be transmitted recklessly, yet on the martial planet of Gaowu, martial cultivation was popularized among everyone.</p><p></p><p>Walking down the street, Gu Jiuqing noticed every pedestrian showed signs of having cultivated martial arts. Compulsory elementary education included six years of basic martial training. With some effort, one could test into middle school for another three years.</p><p></p><p>High school was the watershed - only the diligent could enter and strive for university admission.</p><p></p><p>At the school gates.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu? You're here again today?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I envy Teacher Gu. So young yet already a school teacher. I heard the principal wants to promote your title."</p><p></p><p>Old Yang and Old Jin were well-informed to even know this kind of news.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt awkward. Title? What was that about?</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I almost forgot - today is the fitness test. All the senior third and fourth year students have to participate."</p><p></p><p>Old Yang and Old Jin looked towards the sports field, where a large group of third-year students had already gathered. </p><p></p><p>Soon, shrill screams rang out from the field, followed by roars from the crowd. </p><p></p><p>This prompted the school security to intervene, with police cars entering the sports ground. It was a while before the field finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>With doubts in mind, Gu Jiuqing entered the office.</p><p></p><p>The office was in an uproar. Besides Gu Jiuqing, there were three other teachers present.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Le Qing, a female martial artist around thirty years old. Constant training kept her in peak physical condition - she had reached the pinnacle of Flesh Refining.</p><p></p><p>Then there was Old Teacher Yang, over fifty years old. His inner energy had severely deteriorated, though rumor was he used to be a Bone Refining master! Thus, he commanded the most authority in the office.</p><p></p><p>The third teacher was even younger than Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>On the martial planet of Gaowu, Gu Zixi was eighteen when he tested into university. Four years later he graduated from the Imperial Capital University, then came to teach at Linjiang School.</p><p></p><p>This young Teacher Tong was two years Gu Zixi's junior, also a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist! At such a young age? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"The school must have made a mistake."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Le Qing lay slumped over her desk, staring at the report on her computer in disbelief. </p><p></p><p>The fitness test results must be wrong. Otherwise, how could there suddenly be two martial artists?</p><p></p><p>1.037! Yang Miaojing!</p><p>1.025! Ning Que!</p><p></p><p>These two students from Class 2 had inner energy exceeding 1 - the level of a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't stop there.</p><p></p><p>The other students in Senior Grade 3 Class 2 had also experienced massive increases in inner energy.</p><p></p><p>0.9921! Fang Linli!</p><p>0.9914! Lan Bai! </p><p>0.9948! Ke Jing!</p><p>0.9977! Wen Daihua!</p><p>0.9994! Lu Qing!</p><p></p><p>In the 45 students of Senior 3 Class 2, the class president Yang Miaojing and vice president Ning Que had become martial artists, while the remaining 43 were all martial apprentices.</p><p></p><p>Not just two martial artists emerging from one class, the rest were all martial apprentices?</p><p></p><p>This was insane!</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Old Teacher Yang and young Teacher Tong also stared at the fitness test results on their respective computers.</p><p></p><p>They scrolled down to the last student in Senior 3 Class 2.</p><p></p><p>"Martial apprentices! They're all martial apprentices!"</p><p>"Their inner energy has all surpassed 0.99!"</p><p>"How can there be so many martial apprentices? What happened to Class 2's students for them to improve so much?"</p><p></p><p>If it was one or two students with a major increase, they could accept it. </p><p></p><p>But now, it was the entire class whose scores had risen dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Old Teacher Yang had taught for many years, leading several senior classes and producing three university students. He knew full well how difficult it was to cultivate to the martial artist realm before age eighteen.</p><p></p><p>Yet the report in front of him showed two martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Impossible! Absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Le Qing noticed Gu Jiuqing, her expression changing. Senior 3 Class 2 was Gu Jiuqing's class, but he had taken leave half a month ago, with Le Qing taking over teaching them.</p><p></p><p>She could confirm that just two days prior, the students were still normal.</p><p></p><p>So how did they become so different just after two days?</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Professor Gu, what exactly happened in Class 2 of Grade 12?" </p><p></p><p>In front of the computer desktop, Gu Jiuqing also saw this report.</p><p></p><p>The students in Class 2, their vital energy had greatly increased?</p><p></p><p>Did this have anything to do with Gu Jiuqing's two metamorphoses?  </p><p></p><p>He had just passed down the eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill to the students of Class 2 Grade 12, and a day later, his physical body completed two metamorphoses, and he also gained insights into the eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>These insights were chaotic, a total of forty-five, which merged together to become Gu Jiuqing's insights.</p><p></p><p>The forty-five insights corresponded exactly to the forty-five students in Class 2 Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had a conjecture!</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat excited!</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if his conjecture was true or not, but if he tried it again, he could verify his conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Ring ring ring————————"</p><p>"Ring ring ring——————————"</p><p></p><p>The class bell rang, and the three teachers in the office all stared at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go to class first, we can talk about this later."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pushed open the office door, with an excited look, and went to Class 2 Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>Class 2 classroom!</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, teacher!"</p><p>"Good morning, students!"</p><p>"Sit down."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the classroom, every student had their eyes wide open, excitedly looking at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be excited?</p><p></p><p>Last night they had worried all night, afraid that they were just hallucinating from their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But this morning's physical test could prove that everything was real.</p><p></p><p>They had all become quasi-martial artists, and Yang Miaojing and Ning Que had even become true martial artists!</p><p></p><p>In just three months!</p><p></p><p>With all the students of Class 2 Grade 12 getting into university, what difficulty could there be?</p><p></p><p>Even getting into the Imperial University would be a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Excitement!</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing took the initiative to say, "Teacher Gu, I've collected yesterday's homework."</p><p></p><p>She was about to hand in the homework books on the desk.</p><p></p><p>"No need to look at it, I know you've all worked hard cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>Was there any need to look?</p><p></p><p>The homework Gu Jiuqing had assigned was to obtain their insights from cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill, so he could undergo metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>He had already completed two metamorphoses, and even had a big secret that he needed to verify himself, so he was impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, I passed down the eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill to you. Today, I'm going to pass down the remaining fourteen forms to you."</p><p></p><p>Gasp!</p><p></p><p>They drew in a breath of cold air!</p><p></p><p>Even their crown chakras were trembling!</p><p></p><p>They were shocked by Gu Jiuqing's powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill, ah, this could be considered a supreme martial art, incomparably stronger than the martial arts of any martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Even!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the Imperial University, the martial arts in the Imperial Library, and the national-level martial arts, were far inferior to the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>But now, Teacher Gu was actually going to pass down the complete version of the Dragon and Elephant Skill to them??</p><p></p><p>What an immense blessing this was.</p><p></p><p>The forty-five students were moved, some with moist eyes, already crying from the emotion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing picked up a brush and began painting for the third time.</p><p></p><p>He was fluent in the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, painting the remaining fourteen forms with effortless ease.</p><p></p><p>On the podium, Gu Jiuqing raised his brush to paint, recalling the Dragon and Elephant Skill illustrations on the stone stele at the Sword Gate Pass, painting each form on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>The ninth form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, The Dragon Emerges from the Abyss!</p><p></p><p>The tenth form, The Dragon Soars Over the Four Seas!</p><p></p><p>The eleventh form, The Rampant Dragon Regrets!</p><p></p><p>The twelfth form, The Dragonless Horde!</p><p></p><p>Four large diagrams were painted, filling the entire blackboard. Gu Jiuqing moved to the blackboard at the back of the classroom.</p><p></p><p>The students' gazes also followed to the blackboard behind.</p><p></p><p>The thirteenth form, Nine Dragons Ascend to Heaven!</p><p></p><p>The fourteenth form, The Dragon Roams the Great Abyss!</p><p></p><p>The fifteenth form, The Dragon Traverses the World!</p><p></p><p>The sixteenth form, The Divine Dragon in the Heavens!</p><p></p><p>These four large diagrams filled the back blackboard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked around the classroom, there was no more space to paint, it seemed he would have to erase the diagrams on the blackboard to paint the remaining six forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"You all brought your phones, right?"</p><p></p><p>Phones?</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing didn't quite understand what Gu Jiuqing meant, but she still took out her phone.</p><p></p><p>"You all brought them, right? Then take pictures of the Dragon and Elephant Skill diagrams."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you the time it takes to burn one stick of incense, um, five minutes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood aside, giving them access to the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>The students were first startled, then they rushed forward, taking pictures of the eight Dragon and Elephant Skill diagrams on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>This was a supreme martial art, ah, yet Teacher Gu was letting them take pictures??</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean they could pass it on to others?</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly dismissed this thought from their minds.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Gu was entrusting the Dragon and Elephant Skill to them, how could they pass it on to others?</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, each student had added hundreds of photos to their phones, with so many photos, they could definitely capture clear images of the diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing erased the Dragon and Elephant Skill diagrams from the blackboard, then began painting again.</p><p></p><p>The seventeenth form of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, The Dragon and Elephant Strike Together!</p><p></p><p>The eighteenth form, The Dragon and Elephant Take Flight!</p><p></p><p>The nineteenth form, The Dragon Advances, The Elephant Leaps!</p><p></p><p>The twentieth form, The Dragon and Elephant Clash!</p><p></p><p>The twenty-first form, The Dragon and Elephant Tread the Heavens!</p><p></p><p>The twenty-second form, The Dragon and Elephant Become One!</p><p></p><p>All twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill had been passed down. Gu Jiuqing had been painting for so long that he was a bit tired, but the students in the classroom were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>This was the complete Dragon and Elephant Skill, ah, the supreme martial art clearly displayed before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A path leading to the pinnacle of martial arts had appeared at their feet.</p><p></p><p>In this life!</p><p></p><p>It belonged to them, Class 2 Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>The forty-five students were excited, trembling as they took out their phones to photograph the remaining eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they had the complete sixteen forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill on their phones.</p><p></p><p>Some students had even taken pictures when Gu Jiuqing first painted the eight forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, though they didn't dare take obvious photos, only capturing parts of the diagrams.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that for the first eight forms of the twenty-two form Dragon and Elephant Skill, they needed all forty-five of them to pass it down before they could cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>It was now 2pm, four hours after the 10am class when Gu Jiuqing painted the fourteen forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.  </p><p></p><p>These students still had excited looks, but Gu Jiuqing shook his head, closed the classroom door, and left on his own.</p><p></p><p>Wait until tomorrow!</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow Gu Jiuqing would know if his conjecture was correct or not.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit hungry now, the school cafeteria is already closed, looks like I'll have to go out for lunch."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had just walked to the school gate when he saw a young beautiful woman get into a Mercedes-Benz.</p><p></p><p>The woman had a shapely figure, wearing a work uniform, her long legs wrapped in pants showing the shape of her beautiful legs, a white blouse on top with two buttons undone, clearly showing her semi-circular shape.</p><p></p><p>Mature!</p><p>Intelligent!</p><p>Beautiful face!</p><p>Stunning!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only glanced at her, then prepared to return to his rental house.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, isn't that your girlfriend?"</p><p>"Why is Teacher Bai getting in a car with someone else?"</p><p></p><p>The old man Yang at the school gate was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Mercedes drove away from the school, and from the driver's seat, one could see it was a young man driving.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian!</p><p></p><p>This was the girlfriend Gu Zixiu had spread rumors about at school.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing had seen Bai Muqian.</p><p></p><p>Heavy makeup, slender figure, looking down on others, if Gu Jiuqing didn't prefer scholarly pursuits like music, chess, calligraphy and painting, he might have looked twice.</p><p></p><p>Earlier on the road, passersby had their eyes linger on Bai Muqian.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing ignored what the old man Yang said and left directly.</p><p></p><p>Hungry, he needed to fill his stomach first, then go online.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

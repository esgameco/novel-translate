        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Military trucks drove towards the suburbs one after another. The few streets where the lunar base was located were all cleared out. Additionally, with the citizens of Linjiang City now busy cultivating, there were no civilians coming to the suburbs for dates. </p><p></p><p>This time, the lunar mission had one hundred people going to the moon, with a male to female ratio of 99 to 1! Only one was female, the rest were all male cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the base, a hundred lunar cultivators gathered, waiting to go to the moon.</p><p></p><p>"The lunar base has been built for a month already, are we finally going to start the lunar mission today?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, going to the moon, I never thought in this era of spiritual energy's revival, we could actually go up to the moon."</p><p></p><p>Many of the lunar cultivators looked towards the enormous object inside the base. </p><p></p><p>That was a manned rocket!</p><p></p><p>This manned rocket was built by the T20, equipped with the latest technology, but with one flaw - it was single-use only, capable of going to the moon but unable to return!</p><p></p><p>As a result, it could greatly reduce the rocket's weight, thereby increasing the number of people going to the moon.</p><p></p><p>"I thought the lunar program had stalled. The daily allowance for the lunar program is quite good, much better than being a cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"What? Aren't you a cultivator yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"I am a cultivator, I just passed the assessment last month."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Among these one hundred lunar personnel, one person stood out.</p><p></p><p>She was the only female lunar crew member.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian!</p><p></p><p>She did not converse with the other lunar crew. This morning, she had just come out of the cafeteria when she was notified to report to the base.</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the bright sky, the moon nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can cultivate the Yin-Yang Divine Body on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>Collect the lunar yin essence on the moon, balance it with the sun's yang essence, and develop the Yin-Yang Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill would be on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian had already steadily entered the Refining Bones realm, a Refining Bones grandmaster. She was refining the 206 bones in the human body, and with the help of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, she had already refined twenty-eight of them!</p><p></p><p>At this pace, she could complete the Refining Bones cultivation within a year and advance to the Refining Tendons level!</p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed of the Dragon and Elephant Skill was too fast.</p><p></p><p>If she could get help from the Yin-Yang Divine Body, Bai Muqian's cultivation could accelerate even further!</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep ----"</p><p>"Beep beep beep ----"</p><p></p><p>The sound of horns rang out not far away. Several military trucks stopped outside the lunar base, and a large group of people rushed out from inside the base to welcome them at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian saw the mayor, who had only appeared in the news before!</p><p></p><p>The mayor himself came out to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>"That's the mayor, and the mayor's secretary, they're here too!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, aren't those the chairmen of the three major corporations? These three chairmen control Linjiang's economy, and these three big shots have also come!"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the head of the security department?"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, so many people coming out together to welcome us, are they here to receive some high-ranking officials from the Dragon Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned towards the entrance of the base, and soon they saw a young man walking towards the base, surrounded by a group of people.</p><p></p><p>"He's so young? Is this a prince from the imperial capital?"</p><p></p><p>"A prince? It should be, but didn't Linjiang impose a lot of blockades? How did a prince manage to come to Linjiang?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian looked at this young prince and her heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu!"</p><p></p><p>That was the young master of the Gu family, Gu Zixiu, the prince of the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>Why did he also come to the lunar base?</p><p></p><p>A thought arose in Bai Muqian's mind, "Could the lunar base have been Gu Zixiu's idea?"</p><p></p><p>A profligate son?</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian wanted to associate this term with Gu Jiuqing, but no matter how she thought about it, she could not connect Gu Jiuqing with being a profligate son.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some other purpose behind going to the moon?"</p><p></p><p>In this era of spiritual energy's revival, was going to the moon to search for spiritual energy?</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian stared fixedly at that figure.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing finally saw the big thing for the lunar mission - the manned rocket!</p><p></p><p>This manned rocket would fly to the moon today, and was expected to land on the moon five days later, on the sixth day of the sixth month.</p><p></p><p>Behind Gu Jiuqing stood Gu Lao'er.</p><p></p><p>He was quite apprehensive!!</p><p></p><p>Facing him were the high-ranking officials of Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>These officials meant nothing compared to his Gu family's status.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation levels of these officials!</p><p></p><p>They were all Martial Kings!</p><p></p><p>The mayor of Linjiang City, a Martial King. This Martial King's qi and blood had formed a blazing furnace, and even from a distance, he could feel that this Martial King's five viscera had been refined to the utmost, with the five primordial qi intertwining!</p><p></p><p>With every breath, it was like the sound of thunder, cleansing the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Such profound attainments, this level of Martial King could rank among the top ten in the imperial capital. At most three years, and he could break through to the Blood Condensation Realm!"</p><p></p><p>There were levels of strength among Viscera Refining Martial Kings. The weaker Martial Kings had just begun viscera refining, refining the five viscera once, which would greatly increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>Then using the sound of thunder to temper the physical body, their strength would enter a period of explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>Martial Kings at the third step had the five primordial qi intertwining within the five viscera, completely dissolving the viscera and intestines!</p><p></p><p>Even the heart would be dissolved, transformed into a heart deity residing in the heart's position!</p><p></p><p>At the third step, Martial Kings could soar through the air using their physical bodies, and even survive in outer space without needing to breathe oxygen or worry about pressure issues.</p><p></p><p>Most Martial Kings in the imperial capital and the twenty-three provinces were stuck at the first viscera refining step.  </p><p></p><p>There were very few Martial Kings at the second thunder tempering step!</p><p></p><p>As for third step Martial Kings, their strength was immense, and each one was a priceless treasure to various powers.</p><p></p><p>In this era where Martial Sages had entered other realms to explore, third step Martial Kings were the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"Just the pressure from this Martial King is greater than what I've felt from those in my clan..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Third Step, the Martial Kings must become extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>Oppressive!</p><p></p><p>Too oppressive.</p><p></p><p>In front of these Martial Kings, this Grandmaster was like an ant, not even daring to breathe heavily. </p><p></p><p>This was the reason he was trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>Behind the mayor stood the secretary.</p><p></p><p>This secretary, Old Gu was seeing for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder sound! It's the thunder sound again!"</p><p></p><p>He heard the faint sound within the secretary's body, it was the thunder tempering the flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel this secretary's power is no less than the mayor's!!"</p><p></p><p>The head of the security department!</p><p></p><p>The principal of Linjiang High School!</p><p></p><p>Even on Old Wen and Mr. Qianyue, he heard the sound of thunder tempering their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The power of these Martial Kings was terrifyingly much stronger than ordinary Third Step Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>And behind these Martial Kings, there were newly promoted Martial Kings, their blood essence hidden within their flesh, like dragons lurking in the abyss, ready to soar into the sky at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As Old Gu was examining the Martial Kings, an old man stepped forward and stood in front of the mayor.</p><p></p><p>"This is...!"</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura from this Martial King was even three shades stronger than the other Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>The Chairman of the Martial Arts Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Eight days ago, Old Gu was captured by this Chairman's subordinates.</p><p></p><p>This Chairman's power was terrifying, his five viscera and six bowels had already been completely tempered, the thunder sound disappeared, returning to simplicity, his aura dim but most terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Half-step Martial Sage!"</p><p></p><p>Just a sliver away from Blood Condensation realm!!</p><p></p><p>Just the few Martial Kings he saw were stronger than the Martial Kings of the Gu Family, and this Chairman could likely contend with a true Martial Sage!</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Gu, long time no see. You see, the Moon Base has been completely constructed. Now we just await Old Master's command, and the manned rocket can fly into space."</p><p></p><p>The Chairman's appearance was different from when he came to attend the public lecture before.</p><p></p><p>His white hair had completely disappeared, turning black, and the wrinkles on his face had also diminished, making him look only in his forties, less than fifty years old.</p><p></p><p>"Good, hand this teleportation array to the moon landing crew. After they land on the moon, they can unseal the talisman paper on the array."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out an ancient teleportation array the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>The ancient teleportation array was sealed into a palm-sized hexagram shape, with a yellow talisman paper as thin as a cicada's wing sealing it.</p><p></p><p>The Chairman carefully received the teleportation array and ordered someone to deliver it to the moon landing crew.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting for Gu Jiuqing's command - the mayor, the secretary, the Chairman.</p><p></p><p>The decision makers of the three major corporations could only stand on the outer circle to observe, unable to approach Gu Jiuqing for conversation.</p><p></p><p>Even further away were many corporate bosses who wanted to catch a glimpse of Gu Jiuqing, but they were at least a hundred meters away from him.</p><p></p><p>Hua Yun was also standing far away, constantly looking around, but could only see the silhouettes of a few Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>After a while, over a hundred people gathered at the entrance successively boarded the manned rocket. </p><p></p><p>The moon landing mission officially commenced!</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the ignition button was pressed, and a manned rocket pierced through the clouds, straight into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Boom ------------------"</p><p></p><p>The entire Linjiang City witnessed a rocket slicing through the sky!</p><p></p><p>This scene was etched into everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just as the rocket ascended three or four kilometers above Linjiang City, a giant golden-winged peng suddenly flew towards it in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"A demonic beast is attacking the rocket!"</p><p></p><p>Its wings spread out at least ten meters wide, its huge body chasing after the rocket, hovering in the air.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Golden-Winged Peng! An S-rank demonic beast that has lived over two hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>Old Gu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>There were not many S-rank demonic beasts in Jiangnan Province, only twelve, and there was one near Linjiang City.  </p><p></p><p>An S-rank demonic beast, that was equivalent to a Blood Condensation Martial Sage.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Golden-Winged Peng damaged the manned rocket, even the slightest injury would cause the rocket to deviate from its planned trajectory into space, causing this moon landing to fail!</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>A sword light flashed across the sky!</p><p></p><p>This sword light spanned the sky, shooting towards the airspace above Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>The white sword light was over a hundred meters long, piercing the clouds, slashing towards the Great Golden-Winged Peng!!</p><p></p><p>"Swish!" With that sound, the Great Golden-Winged Peng was sliced into two halves, plummeting from the sky towards Linjiang City.</p><p></p><p>The Chairman's face turned pale, the innate five qi in his body depleted, even his blood essence vaporized by half.</p><p></p><p>He sheathed the T20 battle sword in his hand and instructed a Martial King behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Go collect the corpse of that S-rank demonic beast, we can make quite a lot of A-grade nutritional fluid from it."</p><p></p><p>Linjiang was severely lacking in nutritional fluid.</p><p></p><p>The crowd didn't show much reaction, watching the manned rocket enter its planned trajectory, they turned their gaze back towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>And behind Gu Jiuqing, Old Gu was so frightened he couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike killed an S-rank demonic beast? This sword strike was similar to the one that Grandmaster used before - just one strike!</p><p></p><p>And this one strike was enough to subdue everything!</p><p></p><p>There were many, many people in Linjiang City cultivating this sword strike!!</p><p></p><p>"Could Linjiang have obtained an inheritance from another realm??"</p><p></p><p>Old Gu was puzzled and dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>And what was that teleportation array his grandnephew just handed to the Chairman?</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>Old Gu was lost in confusion, standing motionless behind Gu Jiuqing like a wooden mannequin, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Kings also ignored Old Gu now.</p><p></p><p>What they were thinking about was how to make this deity fulfill his promise!</p><p></p><p>Another 3,000 words!

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The border of Youzhou.</p><p></p><p>Connected to an ancient ruin, this place was forbidden for the living, but every year there were still many mortals sneaking in, wanting to excavate the ancient ruin to obtain immense treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, for cultivators entering it, there was an extremely great danger, not to mention mortals. </p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's first time setting foot in the ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>Black clouds pressed down like a city wall, with hundreds of miles of the land shrouded in ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>That was the great army stationed by the Great Zhou in the ancient ruin, emanating a towering ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Black Feather Army!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing uttered these three words.</p><p></p><p>A huge sword flew in the sky, with three figures standing on the divine sword. </p><p></p><p>The sword moved at an unmatched speed, slashing through the heavens towards the ancient ruin, quickly charging into the celestial vault above the Black Feather Army.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Black Feather Army sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Overreaching!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou's Black Feather Army was its strongest military force. To join the Black Feather Army required at least five sheddings of the mortal body!</p><p></p><p>Those who had shed their mortal body five times were ordinary soldiers of the Black Feather Army.</p><p></p><p>If they stepped into the Realm of Law, they could be promoted to lead a squad of five!</p><p></p><p>If they stepped into the Unrivaled Realm and cultivated a divine body, they could be promoted to lead a company, commanding five squad leaders and thirty people.</p><p></p><p>The Unrivaled Realm was a watershed in the Black Feather Army. To be promoted to a centurion required the Unrivaled Realm and also military exploits! The Southern Ridge had southern barbarians, so the Black Feather Army would sometimes be deployed there to gain military accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Squad leader, company commander, centurion, tribune, commander of thousands! And in this place of the ancient ruin, the Black Feather Army had eighteen commanders of thousands, plus a commander and a deputy commander.</p><p></p><p>But this was just one of the Black Feather Army's camps at the entrance of the ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>"The highest authority of the Black Feather Army is the Grand Marshal of Guarding the Nation, which is that Princess Soaring!"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Feather Army has one grand marshal, two deputy marshals, and under them are five great commanders!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Senior Brother Liang Xiao sounded from beside him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Black Feather Army below.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation bases of the commander and deputy commander were both the Celestial Palace Realm! As for the great commanders, they were celestial beings of the Catastrophe Realm. The previous Grand Marshal of Guarding the Nation fell in the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal, and Princess Soaring was appointed by the Zhou Emperor to take over as the Grand Marshal, having already entered the ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the world before them darkened, and the ominous aura enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>A suppressive force descended, which was the suppression from the ominous aura!</p><p></p><p>Military forces walked the path of killing, and soldiers' killing intent was the most concentrated. Once tainted by blood and slaughter, the killing and blood would merge into ominous aura. There were even rumors that cultivators in the army camp could refine the ominous aura into supreme ominous spiritual weapons.</p><p></p><p>Capable of suppressing all divine abilities, even physical bodies would be dissolved in the face of the ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>The ominous aura floated around Gu Jiuqing, and he felt a sinking sensation, with his spiritual power tightly locked in his dantian, unable to emerge.</p><p></p><p>The 180,000 Black Feather soldiers could even suppress the spiritual power of celestial beings of the Catastrophe Realm. Naturally, Gu Jiuqing, a cultivator of the Unrivaled Realm, would also be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>However, Senior Brother Liang Xiao was unaffected, steering the divine sword to break through the ominous aura, traveling freely.</p><p></p><p>"The path I walk is different, so the ominous aura cannot affect me."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao raised his hand, his physical body translucent, revealing everything within.</p><p></p><p>He was demonstrating his physical body for Gu Jiuqing to observe.</p><p></p><p>He was like Gu Jiuqing's master, guiding him in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan behind him trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, how did your spiritual power and vital energy disappear?"</p><p></p><p>In Liang Xiao's body, his spiritual power, vital energy, and even the primordial origins, foundation woods, and divine ability fruits of the Unrivaled Mountain had all vanished.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's body shook slightly, and rays of divine light appeared on his celestial apertures.</p><p></p><p>"I have buried my vital energy, primordial origins, and divine abilities, the three treasures of essence, energy, and spirit, into my celestial apertures, with the power to shatter the vacuum and isolate the ominous aura! So I have not been affected by the ominous aura at all."</p><p></p><p>The ominous aura condensed by 180,000 Black Feather soldiers alone could prevent cultivators from flying above their heads.</p><p></p><p>The divine sword below broke through the void, directly entering the ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>The two commanders were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could the one who just flew over our heads be the Pure Yang Ancient Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Even celestial beings of the ninth catastrophe would be affected by the ominous aura, at least their light body movement would be obstructed, right?"</p><p></p><p>Celestial beings of the ninth catastrophe had 215 pure yang spiritual embryos, but their primordial spirits were not fully pure yang, not yet an integrated whole! It was impossible for them to pass through the ominous aura clouds so easily.</p><p></p><p>The commander and the deputy commander Yuán stared blankly at the departing divine sword, feeling that the ancient ruin was about to change.</p><p></p><p>"If even an integrated Pure Yang Ancient Immortal has entered the ancient ruin, it seems the treasures of the Longevity Immortal will be opened prematurely."</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought crossed their minds, a great terror descended from afar.</p><p></p><p>The heavens!</p><p></p><p>A pale waterfall cascaded, spanning the surroundings. At the distant horizon, a towering figure trod on the void, and with a single step, it had already arrived before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The void was like a painting scroll, folded by this Buddha, and after folding, it flowed into the space beneath his feet. With each step, he covered dozens or even hundreds of miles!</p><p></p><p>After a few steps, the figure became clear, revealing its features.</p><p></p><p>This Buddha had a halo shining behind his head, with strands of Buddha's light radiating. One hand was in a gesture of respect, while the other arm held a jade vase of clarified butter.</p><p></p><p>A willow branch was also inserted into the vase.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance!"</p><p></p><p>The commander and deputy commander Yuán immediately recognized the true name of this Buddha.</p><p></p><p>They looked at this Buddha in shock, their scalps tingling.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance once fought against the First Celestial Lord of the Demonic Path, and the various Buddhas of the Buddhist realm joined forces to cut off a strand from the Primordial Moon Tree Branch in the First Celestial Lord's hand!"</p><p></p><p>And that strand later became the decoration in the jade vase of the Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance cast his gaze down, glancing at the 180,000 human army, before withdrawing his gaze and charging into the ominous aura clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's light of deliverance shone upon all beings, and the ominous aura in the sky, as if a tangible object, was torn apart layer by layer. The pure yang aura scattered, instantly illuminating half of the ancient ruin!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh——————"  </p><p>"Ahhh——————"</p><p></p><p>The 180,000 soldiers trembled, with some soldiers even falling to the ground, clutching their heads and crying in pain.</p><p></p><p>The ominous aura was formed from their killing intent and their own essence, energy, and spirit. Now that the ominous aura was vaporized, it was like a blow to their heads, injuring their bodies and minds.</p><p></p><p>Some centurions also turned pale, with their vital energy gushing out uncontrollably from the seven apertures, spontaneously losing half of their essence and blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist realm! The Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly domineering in their actions!"</p><p></p><p>The commander and deputy commander's faces were unsightly. They were cultivators of the Celestial Palace Realm and also felt a slight discomfort.</p><p></p><p>This was just an unintentional leak of a trace of the pure yang aura from the Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance.</p><p></p><p>If a fully integrated Pure Yang Ancient Immortal were to take action, their pure yang spiritual embryos like smelted metal could slaughter all 180,000 Black Cloud soldiers in just a few breaths!</p><p></p><p>After a long while, someone flew into the abyss, seeking the opportunity of a lifetime!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Liang Xiao, let us part ways here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the celestial vault, having already seen the Mount Tian Gu depicted in the painting.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao pondered, looking at Mount Tian Gu, then at the depths of the ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha of Great Power and Vast Deliverance sees you as a future Buddha, so if I leave now, I won't be pursued by the Buddha."</p><p></p><p>"I can also take the opportunity to set up some ancient prohibitions in the ruin to trap and kill the Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao extended his hand, giving Gu Jiuqing a golden sword talisman.</p><p></p><p>"This talisman contains a strand of my Great Name Palace Sword Intent. After I set up the killing formation, I will let you know..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Tell Junior Brother the specific location. When the time comes, Junior Brother will summon the Great Power Bodhisattva Guangping!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded and safely stored the sword seal. </p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother looked at Gu Jiuqing, this crazy sword cultivator, and said, "Tiangu Mountain is the source of the twenty unknown great calamities of the ancient people. This divine mountain was also the divine mountain supporting the Heavenly Court during the eighteenth imperial era of antiquity."</p><p></p><p>"There is great danger here. Junior Brother, after entering Tiangu Mountain, do not use your magic power, vital energy, or primordial spirit. Senior Brother suspects the unknown is targeting the human race!"</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother's words made Gu Jiuqing ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>The human race leaked the heavenly secrets and opened the wondrous gates. Vital energy is the root of humans, where the bloodline inheritance lies. The primordial spirit is the "spirit storehouse" sublimated from the bloodline and can also distinguish whether one is of the human race or not.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother has dissected so many demons and humans, his every word comes from experience.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded solemnly, engraving this in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why did you stop running?"</p><p></p><p>A leisurely voice drifted down from afar.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's voice and Buddhist dharma arrived first, manifesting in this realm of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Celestial flowers rained down from the sky, while golden lotuses emerged from the ground. Celestial blossoms fell chaotically, golden lotuses sprang forth - the auspicious signs of a Bodhisattva's appearance manifested in this ancient ruin!</p><p></p><p>Another figure also approached from the distance, holding a jade vase of pure water. With one step, his foot appeared above Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Run!" Three figures split in two directions!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grabbed Luyuan and transformed into a long rainbow using the Fire Transformation Rainbow Technique, a supreme divine ability of the Golden Crow lineage with unmatched speed. In an instant, they vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother's body dispersed into interweaving brilliant lights, then re-condensed his true form on a distant mountain peak. Gathering sand!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva stepped into the void, leaving a huge footprint deeply embedded in the ground beneath him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You have some skills, but you cannot escape from my Buddha's Five Finger Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping wore a smile on his face, a mask divided into the opposing principles of yin and yang, male and female. His left arm was firm and muscular, while his right arm was soft and delicate.</p><p></p><p>The jade vase hovered in the air, and his hands spread out, transforming into giant palms flying towards Gu Jiuqing and Liangxiao Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>The void collapsed, forming the image of ruins as his fleshly strike shattered the vacuum without borrowing power from any heavenly apertures.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan felt the pressure!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Manifestations Ancient Buddha within his Mud Pill Palace shuddered.</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang Body Refinement! He has begun walking the path of the Two-in-One."</p><p></p><p>After achieving a pure yang primordial spirit, one can borrow the power of pure yang to refine the physical body and magic power into pure yang as well.</p><p></p><p>After the Eight Manifestations Ancient Buddha achieved a pure yang primordial spirit, he cultivated his magic power into pure yang, completing the Two-in-One cultivation and beginning to walk the path of refining the physical body into pure yang. However, he reached his great limit before finishing this path.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Buddha Banshan also began refining his physical body into pure yang after achieving a pure yang primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>These pure yang ancient buddhas chose different paths for the Three-in-One, but they all converged - needing to refine the primordial spirit, physical body, and magic power into pure yang. There was no high or low, only a difference in sequence.</p><p></p><p>"This Bodhisattva's physical body carries a trace of pure yang energy, but his magic power is clearly not pure yang."</p><p></p><p>After achieving a pure yang primordial spirit, Bodhisattva Guangping first walked the path of refining his physical body into pure yang.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike was powerful, already possessing eighty percent of the strength of the Eight Manifestations Ancient Buddha's physical body at his peak!</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn fool, no match for me!"</p><p></p><p>After a cultivator below the Heavenly Realm achieves a perfected divine body, their physical body will reach new heights.</p><p></p><p>During the Spirit Refinement Realm, one can also refine the body using the power of the Revolving Heavenly Apertures.</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Realm, a True Human's primordial spirit can probe the physical body to find flaws, but a Heavenly Realm True Human's physical strength is similar to the Spirit Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>When Catastrophe Realm celestials undergo tribulations, they can also refine their physical bodies to strengthen them!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was only at the sub-Heavenly Realm, lacking all these levels of physical body refinement methods, so he was no match for Bodhisattva Guangping.</p><p></p><p>Following the Eight Manifestations Ancient Buddha's reminder, Gu Jiuqing did not use the power of dragons and elephants!</p><p></p><p>He grabbed Luyuan, "Release your mind, do not resist."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Luyuan immediately released his mind upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Manifestations Ancient Buddha did not know what happened, but he also sensed something strange.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, his ageless true form was stretched to the extreme!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were still pondering when they were quickly dispersed throughout heaven and earth, his will within his thoughts stretched and falling into a state of void and oblivion.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's arm struck down, shaking the azure sky and causing large swaths of the void to collapse from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva retracted his right arm, the gentle half of his face showing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the firm half of his face also revealed an astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>His entire face was in a state of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>His left arm clashed against another figure!!</p><p></p><p>In the distance at the ancient ruins, Liangxiao Senior Brother unleashed his full power - the first time Gu Jiuqing witnessed his Senior Brother's complete battle prowess.</p><p></p><p>His Mud Pill Palace opened, and the sealed primordial spirits flew out!</p><p></p><p>The large and small primordial spirits of the Eight Catastrophe Celestials appeared behind Liangxiao Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Supreme divine abilities erupted! The myriad heavens' Life and Death Wheels! The five great wheels combined into the Life and Death Wheel, slicing through the void and even severing one of the Bodhisattva's fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's realm annihilated heaven and earth. In the Bodhisattva's eyes, this sword cultivator disciple actually used his mastery of the Buddha's realm to battle him!</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's severed finger entered the Buddha's realm in his palm, and countless believers rose to devour it.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother had learned almost all the supreme divine abilities recorded in the Compendium of Supreme Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing "saw" the Four Extremities Four Symbolic Supreme Divine Ability, manifesting the four symbolic beasts of earth, water, wind, and fire. One finger condensed to counter the Bodhisattva's finger.</p><p></p><p>Then came the Creation Profound Heaven Finger and the Great Cavern Imperishable True Breath supreme divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Five supreme divine abilities corresponding to the Bodhisattva's five fingers!</p><p></p><p>But it didn't end there!</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping was a Two-in-One pure yang ancient buddha, standing at the pinnacle of the human realm.</p><p></p><p>His single arm was not something just anyone could withstand!</p><p></p><p>Myriad divine weapons flew out from Liangxiao Senior Brother's body, the ripples of his heavenly apertures causing the weapons to sway and transform into huge banners.</p><p></p><p>"So Liangxiao Senior Brother's three hundred and sixty-five divine weapons are actually Celestial Banners!"</p><p></p><p>The three hundred and sixty-five Celestial Banners waved, their vacuum-shattering power blossoming between heaven and earth, instantly enveloping the Bodhisattva's arm.</p><p></p><p>Celestial starlight descended from beyond the heavens, falling onto the Celestial Banners!</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother stood with two great primordial spirits above his head, three hundred and sixty-five celestial banners surrounding the Bodhisattva's arm, and five divine abilities corresponding to the five fingers.</p><p></p><p>Infinite divine abilities, infinite divine weapons, and his magic power must also be infinite.</p><p></p><p>Within Liangxiao Senior Brother's dantian, magic power gushed out, forming a river of magic power hanging in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Canopy!"</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on the magic river as the power was tempered. In an instant, it condensed into a single bead!</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother let out a great shout, and the pillar of magic power calmly exploded, interweaving its shattering force with that of the five divine abilities to form the Celestial Canopy divine ability!</p><p></p><p>Celestial Canopy, the Heavenly Court! It can also be understood as the highest of the nine heavens. Another interpretation is that the gods disappear, never to be seen again!</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's arm trembled, and his distant figure in the celestial palace vanished into the azure sky, disappearing from this place.</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping retracted his arm, revealing a clear boundary at his wrist on the left arm.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood dispersed, leaving only a skeletal hand, with the five elemental sword qi continuously devouring the wrist, trying to strip away the remaining flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Senior Brother was probing the Bodhisattva's physical body!</p><p></p><p>Pure yang energy surged into the left arm, shattering the five elemental sword qi and causing new flesh and blood to regrow over the hand.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the direction Liangxiao Senior Brother fled and let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Splitting your primordial spirit in two? And you haven't gone mad yet? But one of your primordial spirits has already manifested in the world, so how will you avoid the lightning tribulation this time?"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's figure wavered, separating into a male and female form intertwining. The male form flew towards Liangxiao Senior Brother, while the female form remained, looking towards a distant mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>In that place, ripples appeared in the void as a figure suddenly coalesced.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Vile beast!"</p><p></p><p>The female Bodhisattva Guangping's lips curved into a smile, like sweet words from a lover. Golden lotuses bloomed beneath her feet, transforming into a jade pleasure arena.</p><p></p><p>Female figures shed their clothes and crawled onto the golden lotuses, forming a scene of wine pools and meat groves, writhing sensually.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement, the female Bodhisattva Guangping flew towards Tiangu Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's face was pale!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had brought others along when using the Carefree Roaming technique.</p><p></p><p>Even his Primordial Pangu Divine Body was considerably drained.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Liangxiao Senior Brother had already fled, Gu Jiuqing no longer hesitated and entered Tiangu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Tiangu Mountain!</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient ruin not far from the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord, about seventy or eighty li away.</p><p></p><p>But hardly anyone came to this divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was filled with ancient prohibitions left over from antiquity. Taking even a single step would trigger the lethal prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>During the recent era, there were also no reports of treasures emerging from this mountain, so it became an abandoned wasteland.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain were collapsed and shattered stone artifacts.</p><p></p><p>A fragment of a divine weapon appeared underfoot - the handle of a large bell.</p><p></p><p>The bell handle was inlaid with colorful precious stones, but they had lost their luster, their spiritual essence long dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan bent down and picked up the bell handle.</p><p></p><p>"This is my Luyuan Family's Celestial Bell! It was brought into this ancient ruin by that ancient buddha!"</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>They had entered the place where his family's ancient buddha had perished.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were no prohibitions here, and they could proceed unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, a Buddhist voice resounded as Bodhisattva Guangping's figure appeared!</p><p></p><p>Even beneath their feet, golden lotuses emerged.</p><p></p><p>The lotus flowers bloomed, and naked female figures sprawled on them, parting their lips to make lewd sounds.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression changed!</p><p></p><p>He grabbed Luyuan and used the Fire Transformation Rainbow Technique, moving through Tiangu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But in an instant, darkness appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The prohibitions had reappeared.</p><p></p><p>To venture deeper, they would need to break through the prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>"Release your mind!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could only use the Carefree Roaming technique again.</p><p></p><p>The two figures vanished.</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping looked at the dark world before him, a smile on the beautiful woman's face.</p><p></p><p>"Ensnared by my Buddha's golden lotuses, even if you flee to the Sword Sect, you cannot cleanse my Buddha's aura."</p><p></p><p>He had sensed it!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, deep within the ancient mountain, the two figures reappeared, standing motionless on a rocky outcrop surrounded by prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>These were not man-made prohibitions, but naturally formed ones.</p><p></p><p>In antiquity, an unprecedented great battle must have occurred.</p><p></p><p>Deities and powerful beings participated, and the dao auras left behind by their bodies intertwined in the world. Over the long ages, if these dao auras did not dissipate, they would form prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping did not break the prohibitions. His true form simply took a few steps forward, entering the prohibited area.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack————"</p><p></p><p>The prohibitions were triggered, setting off a chain reaction that caused a large swath of the world to be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's figure trembled slightly amidst the explosions. After this area of prohibitions was completely eliminated, he sat on a lotus platform and flew towards Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly the strongest opponent he had ever faced, several times more formidable than the Demon Lord's son he had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>A Two-in-One pure yang ancient buddha's strength was too powerful. He could traverse the prohibitions of Tiangu Mountain with ease.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He did not pay any heed to these prohibitions at all. </p><p></p><p>"No, no, if these prohibitions were truly so weak, the Three Great Scourges from the Primordial Chaos period would not have been trapped here for so long!"</p><p></p><p>Three thousand ripples of thoughts emerged in the Mud Ball Palace. </p><p></p><p>The strength of the Three Great Scourges was above crossing seven or eight levels of lightning tribulations, and it was even possible they were beings of the ninth tribulation.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, they could not break through the prohibitions, unable to leave Ancient Mountain!</p><p></p><p>There must be powerful prohibitions here, far exceeding these ordinary ones before them.</p><p></p><p>"Open your spiritual sense!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice fell again. </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did as instructed.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the Eight Trigrams Patriarch also hurriedly opened his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>This former dual-cultivating expert looked dazed.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea why he ended up in this situation.  </p><p></p><p>His Dao attainment was silently improving.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power was spiritual power, Dao attainment was Dao attainment.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power was simply cultivating spiritual power, the power in the dantian and the power in the spiritual apertures.</p><p></p><p>But Dao attainment was different, requiring not only spiritual power but also comprehension.</p><p></p><p>One year of Dao attainment needed one year's worth of spiritual power and one year's worth of comprehension to form.</p><p></p><p>The Dao attainment of one year for the pre-Tribulation realm and the Tribulation realm were different.  </p><p></p><p>If the Dao attainment of one year in the pre-Tribulation realm was likened to the size of a finger, then the Dao attainment of one year in the Tribulation realm would be at least the size of a watermelon, or even a millstone.</p><p></p><p>As for him, this pure yang Patriarch of dual cultivation, each improvement in his Dao attainment was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But in the past few breaths, he realized!</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of Heaven and Earth, his understanding of the Dao, had increased out of nowhere, even though his spiritual power had not increased.</p><p></p><p>But spiritual power was the easiest to obtain!</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one! What did he just do? How could he disappear and then reappear out of nowhere?"</p><p></p><p>During the period when he disappeared and reappeared, he had completely vanished, without even a trace of his undying body's aura.</p><p></p><p>Extending, stretching, fusing with Heaven and Earth, disappearing all perception.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how long he had entered the state of no-self, no-form, no-thought before his perception returned.</p><p></p><p>His Dao attainment had increased again.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and the distance from where he had last appeared was even further away.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding prohibitions were undamaged, as if they had appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>And the distant Guangping Dali Bodhisattva had become even more distant.</p><p></p><p>Once!</p><p></p><p>Twice! </p><p></p><p>Three times!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's figure disappeared behind layer after layer of prohibitions, no longer visible.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already ventured deep into Ancient Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why haven't we found the Three Great Scourges' traces even after going so deep?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan said from the side, "Senior Brother, could we have gone the wrong way?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out the scroll painting, which only depicted mountains and rivers, without any other markings to provide hints.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Mountain is surrounded by prohibitions. We're heading towards the deepest part, so we couldn't have gone the wrong way."</p><p></p><p>There was only one possibility - the Three Great Scourges were still in the deepest part of Ancient Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood still to rest.</p><p></p><p>Outside the pre-Tribulation Mountain, the Pangu deity embracing Heaven and Earth had already weakened considerably. </p><p></p><p>The quintessence of the land, the primal air of the void, the origin in the wind - anything he could perceive would restore the Pangu deity's body.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Gu Jiuqing recovered to his original state.</p><p></p><p>He then performed the Carefree Roaming technique again!</p><p></p><p>This time, he traversed an extremely long distance across Ancient Mountain. When he felt the burden, he exited the Carefree Roaming state, avoiding the prohibitions to appear on a cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, look, there's something strange over there!"</p><p></p><p>On one side of the cliff, there were scattered pieces of Taiyi Divine Gold.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also recognized the Taiyi Divine Gold - it was the same material as the Taiyi Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Indestructible Divine Gold was used as the embryo to forge divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>These divine gold pieces were even more than twice the amount of the divine gold in the Taiyi Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing became a true immortal, he could also use them as proof of his Dao attainment.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch revealed a hint of surprise upon seeing so much divine gold - even he had never seen this much before.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, be careful, this place is strange."</p><p></p><p>So much divine gold appearing out of nowhere in this place?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan didn't care. Following his master, what place wasn't strange?</p><p></p><p>But with his master around, all dangers could be turned to safety.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan took out his cosmic bag and collected four large pieces of Taiyi Divine Gold, then also put the remaining scattered pieces of Taiyi Divine Gold into the bag.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Gu Jiuqing had already walked to the edge of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>The prohibitions here were quite weak, some even dating back to ancient times, indicating that someone had broken through to this cliff area.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked down at the cliff!</p><p></p><p>And with just that one look!</p><p></p><p>The entire Ancient Mountain suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>This divine mountain was massive, one side facing the Longevity Immortal Lord's tomb, while the other faced the depths of the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The ancient ruins of Youzhou were connected to the Primordial Chaos, but the people of Youzhou never worried about demons entering from the other side of the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>Within the ancient ruins were fragments of the primordial void, prohibiting Heaven and Earth, containing great terrors.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Three Great Scourges ascend to the peak of Ancient Mountain from its other side?"</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had traveled so far without finding any weak points in the prohibitions on this side of Ancient Mountain - no one had ever broken through the prohibitions here before.</p><p></p><p>Below the cliff was layer upon layer of the primordial void - the primordial Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>These primordial realms contained the aura of antiquity and traces left behind from ancient great wars, forming various prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>These prohibitions were dozens of times more terrifying than the ones Gu Jiuqing had encountered on the other side of Ancient Mountain!!</p><p></p><p>Even the Pure Yang Patriarch would not dare to force his way through.</p><p></p><p>"Whuuush——————"</p><p></p><p>The void tore apart, the primordial celestial realm collapsed into fragments falling down, chains of divine gold shot out from below the cliff, disturbing the void and shattering the eons.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly retreated several steps, then revealed a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the aura of a living being down the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure explosively retreated, grabbing Lu Yuan who was still collecting the scattered divine gold pieces.</p><p></p><p>Performing the Carefree Roaming technique, their figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And at the spot they had just been standing, a massive arm stretched out from below the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble————————"  </p><p></p><p>The celestial realm was torn apart, Ancient Mountain trembled unceasingly. The huge arm was covered in red fur, like an ancient beast, but from this arm, Gu Jiuqing sensed the primordial essence of humans!</p><p></p><p>Was there an ancient human ancestor? Or a modern human ancestor suppressed under Ancient Mountain?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan shuddered, his hair standing on end. </p><p></p><p>Even the Eight Trigrams Patriarch was awestruck.</p><p></p><p>"The aura on this figure is so ancient, more ancient than anyone else I've ever encountered."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch was the Pure Yang Patriarch closest to the Obscure Era twenty eras ago.</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the Four Great Sects might only be a few years older than him, but it was also possible that the Eight Trigrams Patriarch was older than them.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the Eight Trigrams Patriarch should not have said such words.</p><p></p><p>"You mean this figure is an existence from the ancient era?"</p><p></p><p>An ancient human ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing grabbed Lu Yuan, preparing for the Carefree Roaming technique.</p><p></p><p>The ancient arm rippled, then heavily fell back below the cliff. The vast aura scattered, and the shattered fragments of the primordial void strangely began to reorganize, forming new prohibitions hanging on the cliff's edge.</p><p></p><p>"Uncertain, but highly possible!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch revealed a grave expression, manifesting Lu Yuan's appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Mountain is the birthplace of the modern human ancestors, while the ancient human ancestors from the recent antiquity only appeared at the foot of Ancient Mountain."</p><p></p><p>In that era, humans could only live to twenty years old. Even if someone was lucky enough to find cultivation methods in the ancient ruins, they could not achieve much.</p><p></p><p>At most, they would reach the pre-Tribulation realm, the Spirit Refinement realm! And that was with complete methods.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Refinement cultivators could not even break through the simplest prohibitions on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"After the twenty great tribulations, entering the chaotic Primordial Era, the humans who came from the foot of Ancient Mountain proliferated in the Primordial Chaos, with people from various villages venturing into the wastelands to seek the cultivation methods left behind in the ancient ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Although this old man was in seclusion for hundreds of years, I later learned about the events that occurred during that period."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch looked at the cliff with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>He had never known about this giant figure under Ancient Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Jian Taichu, Hua Baosheng, and the Dao and Buddha Patriarchs clashed after excavating what seemed to be the remains of an ancient deity from the ancient ruins. That's why they fought fiercely, even cutting off a section of the Moon Tree!"</p><p></p><p>"Later, demons also appeared, marking the end of the Primordial Era. The four experts at the Celestial Immortal realm from the Four Great Sects established their sects in the four dangerous areas or stood guard alone to block the demons from entering human territory."</p><p></p><p>"Then, when the four patriarchs were guarding the four dangerous areas, the First Emperor of Great Zhou divided the nine states and established the Great Zhou Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, Jian Taichu fell. Nine hundred years ago, the First Emperor of Great Zhou died prematurely."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch briefly recounted the history of the recent antiquity, searching his memories, but still could not find any information about the giant figure with the red furry arm that had emerged from Ancient Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"So the being suppressed under Ancient Mountain could be an existence from the ancient era!"</p><p></p><p>It might even be an ancient deity!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing had encountered an ancient deity from such a close distance!!</p><p></p><p>Within his body, in the area of his five viscera.</p><p></p><p>The five deities formed from the primordial qi of his five viscera stirred, as if wanting to fly out of his flesh to observe the deity!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing forcefully suppressed this feeling. This time, he had come to Ancient Mountain to seek the Three Great Scourges' treasures.</p><p></p><p>With three thousand thoughts stilled, Gu Jiuqing gazed towards the distant cliff. At the edge of the cliff, there was a smooth wall surface, and the divine gold that Lu Yuan had picked up was located below this wall.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, use your Eight Trigrams Divine Eye to take a look at this wall!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did as instructed, offering the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye, which could penetrate the void.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there are traces on this wall!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was greatly alarmed. The Eight Trigrams Patriarch took over the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Great Scourges! They're inside this wall!!"</p><p></p><p>In the divine eye, three blurred figures appeared on the wall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had guessed.</p><p></p><p>During the Primordial Era, the Three Great Scourges roamed the wastelands, plundering ancient treasures.</p><p></p><p>One day, they came to Ancient Mountain, suspecting there were treasures here.</p><p></p><p>They ascended the peak from the other side of Ancient Mountain, advancing without encountering the red-furred ancient human.</p><p></p><p>But after entering this cliff area, they disturbed the ancient human, leading them to be trapped within this wall!</p><p></p><p>But why could this wall imprison the Three Great Scourges for thousands of years?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing approached the cliff's edge again, this time more cautiously. He looked at the wall and noticed a piece of Taiyi Divine Gold embedded in it, about to fall off!!</p><p></p><p>Those pieces of divine gold were actually distress signals sent out by the Three Great Scourges!</p><p></p><p>"The wall is smooth. Is it possible that this isn't actually a wall?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped into the void, landing on the other side of this "wall."</p><p></p><p>It turned out the wall was very thin, like a cicada's wing.</p><p></p><p>It was a mirror!!</p><p></p><p>"An ancient divine mirror! This is an ancient divine mirror that trapped the Three Great Scourges on Ancient Mountain."</p><p></p><p>The Three Great Scourges encountered the ancient human here. Upon discovering the ancient divine mirror, they panicked and hid inside it, not expecting to be unable to leave!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing deduced what had happened during the Primordial Era, piece by piece, almost arriving at the true story.</p><p></p><p>"Save..."</p><p></p><p>"Save me!"</p><p></p><p>Weak voices came from within the wall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>The Three Great Scourges were indeed inside.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sixth realm of the Six Realms Diagram, the realm of tribulation, can only be entered by the true ancestral patriarchs who have transcended tribulations.  </p><p></p><p>This is also the highest point of the Six Realms Diagram!</p><p></p><p>In this magnificent heavenly palace, there are celestial maidens appearing and disappearing within the celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>These celestial maidens are only wrapped in gauzy robes, through which their snow-white skin can be seen. Each one of them is an unmatched beauty in the mortal realm, but in the heavenly palace, they cannot outshine each other.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind of Qingzhou, Wind Taiyu!</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the vast heavenly palace, his eyes devoid of the celestial maidens in the Jade Pool, as if they did not exist at all. He did not spare them another glance, his eyes lifeless.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan has three patriarchs who have transcended tribulations!</p><p></p><p>The strongest of these patriarchs has gone through four levels of lightning tribulation and has existed for over four thousand years!</p><p></p><p>As for his elder brother, he has gone through three levels of lightning tribulation and is expected to attempt the fourth level within a hundred years, and the fifth level within five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"A patriarch who has transcended tribulations has a pure yang spiritual soul. Passing one level of lightning tribulation allows the condensation of one pure yang spiritual thought, two levels two pure yang thoughts."  </p><p></p><p>Three levels four thoughts, four levels eight thoughts, five levels sixteen thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Once the five levels of pure yang lightning tribulation are passed, the sixteen pure yang thoughts can be combined to form the most basic pure yang spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>This allows the instant slaying of any celestial being below the fifth level of lightning tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Clan is a long-established family in Qingzhou, and ranks among the top in all of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>But now, the entire Great Wind Clan has only him left, a celestial being who has just passed the first level of pure yang lightning tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Great Wind Clan has been reduced by ninety percent!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Great Wind Clan can survive this great catastrophe, the Qingzhou celestial Wind Clan will decline and eventually disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh————"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu reined in his distracting thoughts, and his spiritual thoughts combined into an enormous spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>This massive spiritual soul contained a main spiritual thought imbued with a thread of pure yang essence.</p><p></p><p>"I clearly sensed someone appear in the sixth realm just now, but why did they suddenly disappear?"</p><p></p><p>That aura was very strange. When he walked out of the celestial palace, that aura dissipated!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu felt a surge of joy, as he seemed to sense another aura appearing in this heavenly palace.</p><p></p><p>The celestial palace was torn apart, and a celestial being who had transcended tribulations stepped through, leaping up.</p><p></p><p>"Whuuuush——————"  </p><p></p><p>The celestial palace shattered, and Wind Taiyu stood atop another celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>He exerted a bit of force, and the celestial palace beneath his feet split apart.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw a figure appear in the heavenly palace.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? A Celestial Palace Realm true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>He had never seen this Celestial Palace Realm true immortal before. The Great Wind Clan did not have many at this realm.  </p><p></p><p>This true immortal was not from the Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>Then who was he?</p><p></p><p>As Wind Taiyu was about to inquire, the youthful figure before him suddenly emanated terrifying auras!</p><p></p><p>The ten Celestial Palaces shook!</p><p></p><p>Three souls and seven spirits walked out from the Celestial Palaces, each a spiritual soul nine zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>When these ten spiritual souls combined, a spiritual soul over two hundred zhang tall formed above this person's head.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual soul transformed, with threads of pure yang attributes etched upon it.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual soul is already so pure yang?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu was puzzled. For celestial beings like them who had transcended tribulations, passing through lightning tribulations was always a life-or-death ordeal.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, there was the Thunderwind Ravine, a perilous place where thunderbolts were most concentrated, making it easiest to draw down lightning tribulations.  </p><p></p><p>Or one could ascend to the nine heavens, entering the Celestial Wind layers to draw down ancient thunderbolts!</p><p></p><p>No matter where one attempted to pass the tribulation, it was always a matter of life and death! After passing the lightning tribulation, there would be a period of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Yet this youth, who had just been in the Celestial Palace Realm, had instantly stepped into the Tribulation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover!</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had exploded dozens, even hundreds of times, with pure yang aura refining his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang spiritual thoughts orbited around him.</p><p></p><p>One pure yang thought, two pure yang thoughts, four pure yang thoughts!</p><p></p><p>"He instantly became a celestial being who had passed the third level of lightning tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu could not be mistaken. Those four pure yang thoughts flowed around the over two hundred zhang spiritual soul, illuminating even the dark void with their brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth? The sixth? So many pure yang thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, more and more pure yang thoughts condensed!</p><p></p><p>Eight pure yang thoughts, sixteen pure yang thoughts, thirty-two pure yang thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Sixty-four, one hundred and twenty-eight!</p><p></p><p>"There are one hundred and twenty-eight pure yang thoughts orbiting the spiritual soul? This is a celestial being who has passed the eighth level of lightning tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu looked like he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Without even drawing down a lightning tribulation, he had refined one hundred and twenty-eight pure yang thoughts - that was the level of a celestial being who had passed the eighth lightning tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Such an expert was rarely seen in all the world!</p><p></p><p>If he went further and passed the ninth level of lightning tribulation, condensing two hundred and fifty-six pure yang thoughts to form a pure yang ancestral patriarch, that would make him a supreme head of the heavens and earth, an overlord even in any ancient era!</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu stared fixedly at the youth's figure. As the youth experienced this realm, he seemed to merge with the Great Dao, drifting ethereally.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Tribulation Celestial realm, this is the pure yang realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could not help but marvel at the perfection of the Great Wilderness cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>With a motion of his spiritual soul, it fused into his physical body!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his physical body also underwent a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Having passed the eighth level of lightning tribulation, his spiritual soul with its one hundred and twenty-eight pure yang thoughts, these pure yang thoughts accompanied his physical body, instantly shattering his originally nine zhang nine dan tian, expanding it to eighteen zhang eight!</p><p></p><p>His celestial apertures also all expanded to eighteen zhang eight.  </p><p></p><p>His spiritual power surged, and the nine revolutions spirit pill that had formed when he broke through to the Celestial Palace Realm had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Builtwood Tree, infused with pure yang aura, became even more majestic, its branches vigorous and powerful. Even the spiritual fruits hanging from it grew larger, nearly reaching the peerless spiritual fruit level!</p><p></p><p>But this was just the beginning!</p><p></p><p>The transformation of Gu Jiuqing's physical body had only just begun. His spine, each vertebra was bathed by the pure yang thoughts, imbued with pure yang aura!</p><p></p><p>His origins, the Pangu Divine Spirit, the Innate Five Viscera Divine Spirits, his spiritual powers, all were infused with the pure yang attribute.</p><p></p><p>"Crack——————"</p><p></p><p>The dark void was torn apart, the distant celestial dome collapsed, the void disintegrating. The Six Realms Diagram shook, rays of light flickering as celestial palaces crumbled and the heavenly courts trembled.  </p><p></p><p>The vacuum shattered, the void cracked apart, an aura of great destruction arose.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this realm is about to collapse!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Taiyu's expression changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>He looked down and saw that the two sun and moon stars below were also disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Continent after continent sank, starlight and moonlight dissipating.  </p><p></p><p>White clouds, white mountains, black waters - all were torn apart, cracks appearing across the entire Diagram.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening? Why is the Six Realms Diagram shaking?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be that human experts have finally taken action to attack the Six Realms Diagram and rescue us!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the human experts will finally slaughter the demons and monsters in Qingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>"Follow me to kill the enemy! Once the Six Realms Diagram is broken, I will exterminate all demons and monsters."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the first, second, third, fourth and fifth realms, the members of the Great Wind Clan were fired up, polishing their divine weapons, ready to bathe in blood.</p><p></p><p>Only Wind Taiyu looked puzzled.  </p><p></p><p>Why was the perfectly intact Six Realms Diagram about to collapse?</p><p></p><p>Whuuush————</p><p></p><p>Ripples formed in the dark void, and a figure slowly condensed - it was the Demon Lord of the sixth realm!</p><p></p><p>This Demon Lord had passed the eighth level of lightning tribulation, an eight-tribulation celestial being.</p><p></p><p>The moment he appeared, half of the worlds in the sixth realm turned to nothingness. In the fifth realm, the two great sun and moon stars split apart, with Celestial Palace cultivators standing in the darkness.  </p><p></p><p>They were as if facing a great enemy!</p><p></p><p>But the expected scene did not occur, and the Demon Lord of the fifth realm seemed to disappear.</p><p></p><p>The white clouds of the fourth realm, the white mountains of the third realm grew whiter and whiter!</p><p></p><p>The black waters of the first and second realms dissipated, revealing the original colors of the Diagram.</p><p></p><p>"I'm quite curious how you managed to break the Six Realms Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Majesty!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a thread of overbearing pressure, it descended towards Gu Jiuqing's eight-tribulation celestial body.</p><p></p><p>But as a fellow eight-tribulation celestial being, Gu Jiuqing faced this overbearing pressure with an unchanged expression, only smiling faintly at the Demon Lord before him.</p><p></p><p>"Just a single imprint, what's there to be curious about?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's words made the Demon Lord displeased.  </p><p></p><p>In the eight-tribulation celestial period, the Demon Lord had fully matured!</p><p></p><p>The one hundred and twenty-eight pure yang thoughts intertwined on his spiritual soul, threads of pure yang aura flowing down, with various profound insights swirling within his body, not leaking out.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of aura was the most terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel, the Demonic Devouring of the World, the Seven Demonic Blades of Extinction, the Eight Directions Celestial Subduing Scripture - all these divine abilities had been comprehended to the utmost by him, reaching the pinnacle of great divine abilities. Once he completed his pure yang spiritual soul, these four divine abilities would be elevated to the peerless level!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel, Demonic Devouring of the World, Seven Demonic Blades of Extinction, Eight Directions Celestial Subduing Scripture - these four divine abilities, elevated by the Demon Lord step-by-step to the peerless level!</p><p></p><p>Then he would pass them down, and the Demonic Dao disciples cultivating these four abilities would be cultivating four peerless divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>But peerless divine abilities could only unleash their true might in the pure yang realm!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord was in his resplendent prime, treading the void, with a blazing furnace of demonic energy swirling around the horn on his head.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel rippled, this peerless divine ability still just a great divine ability, but its might was immense. Myriad wheels of light flashed, instantly flying towards Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know how you broke the Six Realms Diagram, in the same realm, moreover the Tribulation Realm, you cannot defeat me!"</p><p></p><p>Death!</p><p></p><p>This single word left his mouth, and the surrounding void instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The vacuum shattered!!</p><p></p><p>Darkness descended once more.</p><p></p><p>"It seems when the Demon Lord created the Six Realms Diagram, he separated the imprints of the six realms, keeping them independent as individual imprints."</p><p></p><p>So when Gu Jiuqing killed the Demon Lord imprints of the first five realms, the Demon Lord of the sixth realm was unaware.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had also understood why he could consecutively step into three realms!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord of the sixth realm was a nine-tribulation pure yang ancestral patriarch, possibly even with a completely pure yang spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing nonchalantly traversed the Six Realms Diagram, fusing with the worlds, dao rhythms, and principles intertwined within, causing the Diagram to mistake him for the Demon Lord's imprint!</p><p></p><p>When he entered the sixth realm, it naturally imparted the cultivation of the sixth realm Demon Lord to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>And because Gu Jiuqing's foundation was more profound than the Demon Lord's, he received even more of that cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Hence the Six Realms Diagram began to self-destruct!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang thoughts surged, and Gu Jiuqing watched as the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel approached. In an instant, he unleashed all the divine abilities of the Builtwood Tree from Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>Mirror Flower Water Moon!</p><p></p><p>His left eye a mirror flower, his right eye a water moon, he pulled the Demon Lord's figure into the moon.</p><p></p><p>Shut!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Demon Lord's figure trembled, his physical body and spiritual soul instantly separating!!</p><p></p><p>His body was cut in half, his spiritual soul escaping the physical form, pure yang aura dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel descended!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's spiritual power formed a waterfall before him!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his eighteen zhang eight dantian surged, and the Six Realms Diagram shook and tore apart as his dantian further expanded to twenty-eight zhang eight!</p><p></p><p>The stars trembled, and spiritual power poured back in reverse.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing, it formed a Milky Way, each strand of spiritual power like silk, coalescing into a single force that shattered the vacuum!!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel rippled!</p><p></p><p>The Life and Death Wheel only rotated once before this divine wheel was shattered by the infinite spiritual power that crushed the vacuum.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned, looking down at his own body!</p><p></p><p>Somehow, his lower body had separated from his upper body, severing the connection between Mount Buzhou and his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Even part of his spiritual soul had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>That was the damage from the Mirror Flower Water Moon, transferred onto him by the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, interesting. As expected of an inanimate object, even though it elevated my realm to an eight-tribulation immortal, the physical body is far from perfected."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his celestial apertures stirred, reconnecting his lower and upper body.</p><p></p><p>After he reconstituted his true form, a celestial blade hung above his head.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Demonic Blades of Extinction!!</p><p></p><p>Seven Slays Extinguish Heaven, Demonic Blade Subdues the World!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's figure also appeared above Gu Jiuqing's head, the demonic blade cleaving open the path of life and death, leaving only the path before the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Life?</p><p></p><p>Or death?</p><p></p><p>The choice must be made on this single path!</p><p></p><p>The meaning of life and death was similar to the Myriad Worlds Life and Death Wheel.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Demon Lord's divine abilities stemmed from the profound insights of life and death.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Devouring of the World manifested as a robe of demonic energy enveloping the Demon Lord. This blade sundered yin and yang, shattered the primordial universe, determining life and death!!</p><p></p><p>Only now did the Demon Lord truly deserve his title!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing retreated several steps, his pure yang spiritual soul interweaving as each pure yang thought crystallized into the form of a celestial dragon and elephant emperor!</p><p></p><p>His spiritual soul cradled the Innate Moon Tree, seven colored divine light sweeping away the myriad insights of life and death.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Innate Moon Tree soared into the void, intertwining with this blade!!</p><p></p><p>The</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>To battle the Demon Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Vast ripples spread across the celestial realm, threatening to collapse. </p><p></p><p>Dark ink dripped down bit by bit from the great image, falling onto the hands and clothes of the Sixth Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>But he remained completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>"That human clan has made a move against the Demon Emperor again!"</p><p></p><p>This was an intense and exhilarating great battle.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Toad Spits the Moon!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Hound Swallows the Moon, devouring the Demon Emperor. But it was split open by the Demon Emperor's sword strike!</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Toad directly spits out the moon, treating the Demon Emperor as the moon, spitting him out!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor slashed the Celestial Hound, while the Golden Toad spat out the Demon Emperor, almost simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was too familiar with his seven moon divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Toad Spits the Moon, treating the great enemy as the moon and spitting it out. After spitting out the moon, it would naturally dissipate into a vast moonlight!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's body was still enveloped in moonlight, his magic power, his physical body, even his primordial spirit, all wrapped in moonlight.</p><p></p><p>As his figure fell into the void, this cycle of the moon scattered into a vast moonlight!</p><p></p><p>That moonlight was transformed from the Demon Emperor's vitality, the more moonlight scattered, the faster the Demon Emperor's vitality dissipated!</p><p></p><p>The vast moonlight scattered, his vibrant vitality vanishing.</p><p></p><p>A large portion of the Demon Emperor's physical body, magic power and primordial spirit disappeared into thin air!</p><p></p><p>"Mirror Flower Water Moon, Celestial Hound Swallows Moon, Primordial Moon Tree, Golden Toad Spits Moon, you have cultivated these four lower-rank divine abilities into great divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you cultivate these abilities!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor stood in the void, dispersing these various divine abilities, even his primordial spirit dissipating one by one.</p><p></p><p>He did not continue attacking.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that even if he used all his power, he could not subdue this human!</p><p></p><p>He was now very curious why this human cultivated such low-level, lower-rank divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>And why did these low-level, lower-rank divine abilities become great divine abilities when he cultivated them?</p><p></p><p>Abnormalities must have demonic causes!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's figure became illusory, the vast demonic aura dissipated, the celestial realm fell into black waters.</p><p></p><p>The black waters rippled, clear to the bottom, the falling celestial realm was washed away by the white waters, gradually disappearing into the great image.</p><p></p><p>White mountains, black waters, white clouds and stars, celestial realms and celestial palaces all dissipated, leaving only figures on the great image.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you speak?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this your secret?"  </p><p></p><p>"After crossing eight levels of thunder tribulations and refining 128 pure yang thoughts, my power is one step behind yours."</p><p></p><p>"But if it was the nine-tribulation celestial period, the gap between you and me would only be half a step!"</p><p></p><p>"When our primordial spirits become completely pure yang, our powers should be about the same."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's voice resounded throughout the entire great image.</p><p></p><p>"When you reach the unity of two aspects, you will be half a step behind me. When you reach the unity of three aspects, you will be one step behind me!"</p><p></p><p>It seems!</p><p></p><p>This human is still inferior to me after all.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor showed a satisfied expression, his figure completely dissipating within the six-realm great image.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had remained silent the whole time, coldly watching the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>He had long become nearly demonic in wisdom, how could he not see through the Demon Emperor's intentions?</p><p></p><p>The six-realm great image would soon be destroyed, and the Demon Emperor's imprint would naturally dissipate.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take this last opportunity to probe Gu Jiuqing's true power.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing did not fall for it, letting the Demon Emperor speculate on his own.</p><p></p><p>"These demon emperors of the second and third realms may be weaker than human celestial talents who have unified the three aspects, but after unifying the three aspects, those human celestial talents will in turn be much weaker than them."</p><p></p><p>But this had nothing to do with Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation came from the Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>He would only grow stronger!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing retracted his thoughts. As the six-realm great image collapsed, he felt his eight-tribulation celestial cultivation gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>His realm and cultivation were gained from the six-realm great image.</p><p></p><p>With the six-realm great image destroyed, his eight-tribulation celestial cultivation would also dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"So can I retain this eight-tribulation celestial cultivation, but not keep it within my body?!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked into the void, his gaze seeming to penetrate through heaven and earth, reflecting in the Celestial Womb Realm.</p><p></p><p>Reality and illusion!</p><p></p><p>Space and time!</p><p></p><p>Pure yang thoughts flowed endlessly, Gu Jiuqing had an idea, his eyes lit up, and an arm directly extended into the void.</p><p></p><p>Below the Celestial Gate, Zuo Yao and the Sixth Demon Prince exchanged a startled look.</p><p></p><p>They saw that within the six-realm great image, it seemed the Demon Emperor had been subdued by this human!</p><p></p><p>"The great image is collapsing, the Emperor's imprint has been severed, does this mean this human is going to escape the six-realm great image?"</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Demon Prince broke out in a cold sweat!</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Zuo Yao reached out and grabbed the Sixth Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>"This man is an eight-tribulation immortal, and he can defeat the Demon Emperor in the same realm. I am no match for him."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Yao wanted to leave the Celestial Womb Realm with the Sixth Demon Prince, but an arm extended out from the great image, grabbing Zuo Yao's head.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang energy swirled around the hand, bead after bead of pure yang thoughts forming a pure yang primordial spirit, wiping away Zuo Yao's pure yang thoughts one by one!</p><p></p><p>His primordial spirit extinguished!</p><p></p><p>His magic power dissipated, leaving only his physical body falling to the ground!</p><p></p><p>"Too weak!"</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Demon Prince's scalp went numb, this voice sounding as if it came from right beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>When he turned to look, he saw that human walking out from the six-realm great image.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and sighed, "It seems my future self will only grow stronger and stronger!"</p><p></p><p>The six-realm great image wavered, and Gu Jiuqing's figure appeared before the Sixth Demon Prince, but another figure also appeared within the six-realm great image.</p><p></p><p>"Wah la la ————"</p><p></p><p>Figures fell out from within the six-realm great image, members of the Great Wind Clan breaking free one by one.</p><p></p><p>"We're out! Finally out!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, who rescued us?"</p><p></p><p>"To break the six-realm great image, could it be a pure yang ancient immortal of the human clan took action?"</p><p></p><p>"But I think it's unlikely for a pure yang ancient immortal to act, it's more possible it was the work of a celestial realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out through the Celestial Womb Realm, and the Great Wind Clan members searched with their eyes, quickly finding Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Jiuqing's aura was not of the Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Was it him who rescued us Great Wind Clan from the demons?"</p><p></p><p>"He's holding the six-realm great image, it must be him."</p><p></p><p>"But wait, why does his aura..."</p><p></p><p>Not pure yang aura!</p><p></p><p>And he looks so young?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, this can't be.</p><p></p><p>Voices of doubt arose, but under their doubtful gazes, Gu Jiuqing's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Roaming Freedom!!</p><p></p><p>His primordial spirit roamed freely, while his physical body wandered the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>In this state, his primordial spirit and physical body were infinitely extended, pervading the entire Celestial Womb Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not continue to diffuse his primordial spirit and physical body, worried that he would fuse with heaven and earth, truly achieving the unity of man and nature!</p><p></p><p>Then he would be heaven and earth, and with his current cultivation, if he achieved true unity of man and nature, his thoughts would extend and merge into heaven and earth, losing his own will.</p><p></p><p>How could an individual's will compare to the will of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"For me, the scenes within the great image were illusory."</p><p></p><p>"But now, the scenes within the great image are real to me."</p><p></p><p>Roaming Freedom re-entered the great image!</p><p></p><p>The illusory scenes, the great image collapsed, burning in the void!!</p><p></p><p>As the six-realm great image dissipated, a figure of reality and illusion coalesced in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>That was Gu Jiuqing, bringing his future tribulation body from the six-realm great image out.</p><p></p><p>That was his future self!</p><p></p><p>Entering the real world.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang aura pervaded the entire celestial realm, and the Great Wind Clan members looked at Gu Jiuqing in shock.</p><p></p><p>They saw another figure walk out from that figure.</p><p></p><p>Identical!</p><p></p><p>These two were identical!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Gu Jiuqing, and the Gu Jiuqing before him dissipated.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing's future eight-tribulation true body did not dissipate, it simply did not exist in this "space-time", like a divine ability, he could summon it to appear in the real world whenever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"This true body is my future self, perhaps I can use this true body to achieve dao and become a deity!"</p><p></p><p>"Then let's call this true body the Great Dao Future Body."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had a premonition that this technique, this divine ability, would become his most powerful divine ability in the future!</p><p></p><p>Summon his future self!!</p><p></p><p>Using the six-realm great image as the foundation, starting from the eight-tribulation celestial realm!</p><p></p><p>"So if I cultivate to the Spirit Refinement Realm and manifest this future body, will I break through the eight-tribulation celestial realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts stirred, if it was as he imagined, then this divine ability would definitely become the number one divine ability of all time!</p><p></p><p>The future body would only be stronger than himself, the summoned future body would always be stronger than his current self. He could use it for great battles, easily killing enemies.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after Gu Jiuqing unified the three aspects, he could summon his future self, using his future self's divine nature to make up for his own deficiencies, thereby achieving dao and becoming a deity!</p><p></p><p>"One achievement, eternal achievement! Perhaps I have touched upon the edge of eternal achievement."</p><p></p><p>Achieve dao today, achieve eternal dao!</p><p></p><p>Future, past, present, all are bodies of achievement!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked inward at his true body.

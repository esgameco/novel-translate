        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The vast heavens, boundless and immense, the starry sky within reach. </p><p></p><p>The howling gales whipped by fiercely, propelling the divine moon ship forward, stirring up the starry realm.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The divine ship jolted, its sails rippling, scattering fragments of the brilliant moon.</p><p></p><p>The sword disciples on the deck were shaken and staggered, hastily using their physical strength or magical powers to anchor themselves to the deck.</p><p></p><p>Once they steadied themselves, they noticed changes in the surrounding sky. </p><p></p><p>Wisps of azure mist drifted beneath the starry expanse.</p><p></p><p>The azure fog swirled around, crisscrossed by lightning snakes, with flashes of electricity flickering above.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>A blinding white light flashed, thunder tearing through.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ganfeng Layer, we've now flown out of the Ganfeng Layer."</p><p></p><p>"So this is the legendary Ganfeng Layer? Ancient tales say the heavenly realm was built above the nine heavens' Ganfeng!"</p><p></p><p>Many disciples approached the deck's edge, leaning over to gaze down at the Ganfeng Layer.</p><p></p><p>The azure Ganfeng winds intertwined, colliding with the ship's hull as thunderous forces howled forth. The nine-headed thunder dragons absorbed most of the thunderbolts, but some still struck the ship.</p><p></p><p>A number of inner disciples took action, these sword-inheriting disciples wielding great swords, stepping into the void to refine the thunder talismans from the thunder pools!</p><p></p><p>The activated talismans devoured the thunderbolts surrounding the ship. After three or four breaths of time, the moon divine ship finally emerged from the nine heavens' Ganfeng Layer.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou gazed at the receding Ganfeng Layer in awe.</p><p></p><p>"Legend says the ancient eighteen celestial emperors built the heavenly realm upon the Ganfeng Layer, overlooking the great wilderness."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the great wilderness appeared several times smaller. If there were transcendent experts present, unleashing their divine sight, they could even pierce through this entire realm!</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason the heavenly realm was constructed above the nine heavens - to allow the celestial emperors to oversee the great wilderness with ease.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qing Yangbai felt enlightened.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined I would one day witness the legends, beholding with my own eyes where the ancient heavenly realm once stood."</p><p></p><p>The sword disciples all let out exclamations of wonder.</p><p></p><p>The primordial era seemed to lie just before them, close enough to touch.</p><p></p><p>Yet tens of thousands of years had passed since that ancient time. The old heavenly realm had fallen eighteen times over, the world utterly transformed, everything changed.</p><p></p><p>"Why are those senior martial brothers sitting down?" </p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou wondered.</p><p></p><p>Those senior inner disciples, having refined the ancient thunder talismans, sat cross-legged on the deck.</p><p></p><p>From their bodies, dazzling halos flickered - some senior disciples emanated over two hundred such halos from their fleshly bodies. Each brilliant halo transformed into an ancient, mythical beast, devouring the starlight raining down from the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Above the great wilderness was the Ganfeng Layer of the nine heavens, which blocked most of the starlight.</p><p></p><p>But now, having broken through the Ganfeng Layer, the moon divine ship was fully bathed in starlight.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the star energy arts was undoubtedly the best choice at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The senior martial brothers are collecting starlight, absorbing it into their celestial apertures!"</p><p></p><p>Under the seniors' guidance, the other inner disciples followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai also sat on the deck, breathing in the starlight and refining it into their own magic powers.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few months, having successfully comprehended the heavenly mysteries, these two inner disciples had become magic power cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the ship's cabin...</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortals Wind Sword, Fierce Sun Sword, and Cold Sword burst through the brilliant moon barrier, instantly flying into the nine-headed thunder dragons' bodies.</p><p></p><p>The three figures trod upon the crown of the myriad-zhang thunder dragons, facing the vast starry expanse, circulating their full magic powers to temper their fleshly bodies with the starlight!</p><p></p><p>Halos lit up one by one, each Sword Immortal opening over three hundred and fifty celestial apertures.</p><p></p><p>Starlight poured into the halos, their bodies generating divine radiance - the three Sword Immortals appeared like three celestial beings, riding true dragons through the nine heavens and ten earths.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his gaze, looking back at Lu Yuan behind him.</p><p></p><p>"With such a great opportunity, why don't you go out and cultivate for a while too, Disciple Brother?"</p><p></p><p>"This journey is far, gathering starlight to temper your cultivation would bolster your powers."</p><p></p><p>A magic power cultivator instructing a non-celestial cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan found nothing strange about this scene.</p><p></p><p>After a moment's thought, he responded, "Then this disciple brother will go gather starlight to forge the Sun Divine Body!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan cultivated the Sun Divine Body, requiring the essence of the great sun. At this moment, the sun's essence was many times denser than in the great wilderness.</p><p></p><p>He set down his sword case and inverted his body before exiting the cabin.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cabin, only Gu Jiuqing remained.</p><p></p><p>Strands of magic power dripped from Gu Jiuqing's body, appearing like silken threads that wrapped around the sword case.</p><p></p><p>Within his dantian, a gate fully opened, and the flowing magic power descended into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>His dantian expanded, reaching nine zhang!</p><p></p><p>The silken strands of magic power coalesced into physical form, weaving together like silkworm threads into a vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the strands converged, condensing into an enormous cocoon.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Pill!"</p><p></p><p>This was the Origin Pill!</p><p></p><p>Without refining any external magic power, solely using the power flowing from the Myriad Mysteries Gate, Gu Jiuqing condensed an Origin Pill.</p><p></p><p>Ripples emanated from the Origin Pill as it burst from the dantian, soaring up to the Non-Celestial Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The primordial bodies circling the Non-Celestial Mountain stirred!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow primordial essence coalesced into a three-legged golden crow!</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang primordial essence became a roc.</p><p></p><p>The two primordial avatars descended from the Non-Celestial Mountain, obstructing the cocoon Origin Pill.</p><p></p><p>But the cocoon did not evade, surging forward instead.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"  </p><p>"Rumble rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow and Roc struck the cocoon repeatedly. With each collision, the pill became more condensed.</p><p></p><p>The massive cocoon visibly shrank at an astonishing rate, finally reduced to the size of a grindstone!</p><p></p><p>The cocoon's outer strands, initially separate threads of magic power woven together, could no longer be distinguished.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the first cycle Origin Pill?"</p><p></p><p>Using one's own primordial bodies to temper the Origin Pill?</p><p></p><p>Then how did cultivators without such primordial bodies refine their pills?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked inwardly at his fleshly body. With a thought, the myriad dragons and elephants circling the Non-Celestial Mountain flew towards the grindstone-sized first cycle Origin Pill.</p><p></p><p>The elephant essences merged into one massive dragon-elephant divinity, with an elephant's head, eighteen arms, and a dragon's tail whipping behind.</p><p></p><p>The deity acted, its eighteen arms transforming into iron hammers that struck down upon the Origin Pill relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Bam bam bam!!"</p><p></p><p>The hammers pounded the pill, compressing it smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>"The texts state that the Origin Pill is compressed from magic power. Without changing the total power, the smaller the pill, the more concentrated and refined the energy within."</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Pill flies up to the Non-Celestial Mountain, then falls back into the dantian, dispersing into magic power again. The cycle repeats, tempering it into the ninth cycle Origin Pill."</p><p></p><p>This was the magic power realm's method of Origin Pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao instructed Gu Jiuqing to choose a magic power attribute, he had declined. So he did not know the specific magic power cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>But this was how the Origin Pill was tempered!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, no mistake!</p><p></p><p>"The first cycle Origin Pill can circle the Non-Celestial Mountain once. The second cycle twice, the third cycle four times, the fourth cycle eight times, and so on."</p><p></p><p>"Condensing a higher-grade Origin Pill, ranked seventh or above, allows projecting the pill outwardly to be used as a magic treasure, its might no less than ordinary divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Origin Pill had not even completed a circuit around Non-Celestial Mountain before being "pummeled" by the two primordial avatars. Now thousands of dragon-elephant essences hammered it further.</p><p></p><p>The grindstone-sized pill was first compressed to the size of a palm, then a thumb, and finally a grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-elephant deity gathered the power of two thousand two hundred dragon-elephant essences.</p><p></p><p>How formidable was such force?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could not compare it, but it was enough to temper the Origin Pill.</p><p></p><p>The pill even emitted sparks from the hammering!</p><p></p><p>After a while more, the thumb-sized pill shrank to a grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, I won't even be able to see my Origin Pill!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly halted the dragon-elephant deity and returned the pill to his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Within, the rice-grain sized pill dispersed, strands of magic power finer than hair scattering into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The power flowing from the Myriad Mysteries Gate converged with these tempered strands, reforming into a vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>Once the ocean filled the nine-zhang dantian, Gu Jiuqing repeated the process, summoning the dragon-elephant deity to temper the Origin Pill ascending to Non-Celestial Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Exiting his introspection, Gu Jiuqing gazed at the sword case before him.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Divine Sword! Forged from the primordial material Taiyi Imperishable Divine Gold, the embryo of a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had already passed down the Taiyi Divine Sword's refinement method to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Over the past months, Gu Jiuqing prepared to refine the Taiyi Divine Sword, placing it upon his own Non-Celestial Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what heavenly method Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao used that allowed me to wield the three thousand-grooved divine weapons without any refinement!"</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons required refinement, imprinting one's own aura upon them before borrowing their power.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing cradled the sword case, infusing it with his aura, magic power, blood essence, sword intent, following the prescribed method to refine the Taiyi Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>This was a long, gradual process. The more powerful the divine weapon, the longer the nurturing and refinement took.</p><p></p><p>Time passed bit by bit. Five days later...</p><p></p><p>The great wilderness beneath the moon divine ship had shrunk several more times.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sword sect disciples were already over a million kilometers away from the Great Wilderness. </p><p></p><p>The brilliant moonlight poured down, the radiance of the stars in the sky shone over, even the brilliance of the sun became more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>Bathed in the starlight, many inner sect disciples broke through a minor realm.</p><p></p><p>Slightly closer to the edge of the ship, Qingyang Bai and Xia Qingzhou, the two of them were swallowing the boundless starlight.</p><p></p><p>They were just cultivators at the Realm of Spiritual Power, refining the starlight could allow them to gain spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou took the first step to condense her Primordial Pill. </p><p></p><p>Within her dantian, spiritual power flowed, opening a corner of the myriad wonders gate, with spiritual power trickling out.</p><p></p><p>In the three-foot dantian, the spiritual power condensed together, forming a Primordial Pill the size of a palm!</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Pill shot up the Incomparable Mountain and began to circle around it!</p><p></p><p>The spine is the body's Incomparable Mountain, possessing a suppressing force. </p><p></p><p>The Primordial Pill flew around the Incomparable Mountain, encountering this suppressing force that obstructed its advancement.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's face flushed red as she struggled to control the Primordial Pill's movement. It took her the time to burn an incense stick before she finally managed to circle the Primordial Pill around the Incomparable Mountain once.</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>A Primordial Pill the size of a little finger remained under the Incomparable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Resisting the suppressing force of the Incomparable Mountain, the Primordial Pill shrank, forming its current size.</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, her spiritual power rising to evaporate the sweat that had poured out from the impact of breaking through to the Primordial Pill Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qingyang, how about you?"</p><p></p><p>Qingyang Bai's aura fluctuated as he sighed.</p><p></p><p>"When I was controlling the Primordial Pill, I got a bit anxious and made it circle the Incomparable Mountain too quickly, causing the Primordial Pill to shatter directly."</p><p></p><p>"I'll probably need to refine starlight for another day before I can attempt the Primordial Pill Realm again."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's heart tightened. </p><p></p><p>It was fortunate that she didn't rush to establish her realm, otherwise her Primordial Pill would have shattered too.</p><p></p><p>The two re-focused their minds and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Ship abruptly stopped!</p><p></p><p>While traveling at high speed, the divine ship came to a complete halt. Fortunately, the sword sect disciples used their magical powers to prevent themselves from being flung out. However, some inner sect disciples like Qingyang Bai and Xia Qingzhou were directly thrown onto the deck above, crashing heavily onto it.</p><p></p><p>Some other disciples were at the critical juncture of their realm breakthrough and were disrupted by this force, failing their breakthroughs and coughing out mouthfuls of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>They looked around in all directions!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding starry space stretched endlessly, with only the brilliant starlight shining.</p><p></p><p>At the bow, the nine-headed thunder dragons had stopped, with three sword immortals standing still atop them.</p><p></p><p>Further away, an enormous mountain peak was roaming through the starry void.</p><p></p><p>The roaming speed of the mountain peak was fast, but still much slower than the Moon God Ship. After the ship stopped, it was only a hundred li away from this "mountain peak."</p><p></p><p>They finally saw the true appearance of this "mountain peak."</p><p></p><p>It wasn't a mountain peak at all, but rather a gigantic beast.</p><p></p><p>A starry space beast, roaming through the starry void.</p><p></p><p>"This is the starry space beast of the Celestial Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>A voice transmission came from afar, entering the ship.</p><p></p><p>It was the voice of Fierce Sun Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The sword sect disciples revealed looks of shock.</p><p></p><p>They had heard of the starry space beast of the Celestial Pavilion, but never imagined this starry space beast would be so enormous.</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Ship was even bigger, right?</p><p></p><p>But in front of the starry space beast, it seemed pitiful, no larger than just one of the huge horns on the beast's head.</p><p></p><p>And the starry space beast had twelve such horns!!</p><p></p><p>"To avoid unnecessary trouble, we'll fly towards the moon's direction and choose another path."</p><p></p><p>This wasn't because the sword sect was afraid of the Celestial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But with so many disciples from the two major sects heading to the moon together, any conflict arising would be unfavorable for both sects.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan headed towards the cabin.</p><p></p><p>He relayed the encounter with the starry space beast to Gu Jiuqing, who was refining the Supreme Primordial Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, the Celestial Pavilion's people will also ascend to the moon tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked in the direction Lu Yuan pointed.</p><p></p><p>In his vision, a huge bright moon suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>The moon emanated a pale lunar glow, like a corner of the Great Wilderness. On this mirror-like lunar surface, a starry space beast stood in the starry void, its pair of eyes like deep abysses, staring at this Moon God Ship.</p><p></p><p>The starry space beast had twelve huge horns from its head all the way to its tail, each horn as large as the Moon God Ship itself.</p><p></p><p>Its four legs trod upon the void, with a long slender tail that stirred the void.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the starry space beast were bulging particles, which were actually small mountain peaks growing on the beast!! Slightly smaller than true celestial peaks.</p><p></p><p>On the back of this starry space beast stood ranks of Celestial Pavilion disciples.</p><p></p><p>There were many of them!</p><p></p><p>Some had even reached the Plane of Immortality!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan explained, "This is a starry space beast raised by the Celestial Pavilion. Most of the stars outside the Great Wilderness have been refined into Celestial Pearls by them to feed this beast."</p><p></p><p>"It's said that one Celestial Pearl allows the starry space beast to travel to the moon once."</p><p></p><p>This was the cost the Celestial Pavilion paid to journey to the moon.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Pavilion's disciples will have a much easier time ascending to the moon compared to our sword sect, the Dao sect, and the Buddhist sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing became interested, "How do the other two major sects journey to the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Pursuing the moon's path while cultivating was something many forces in the Great Wilderness could achieve.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Pavilion had the starry space beast, the sword sect had the Moon God Ship.</p><p></p><p>The Dao sect also had a divine ship, which contained an ancient thunder pool within.</p><p></p><p>The Dao sect's ship was about on par with the sword sect's.</p><p></p><p>As for the Buddhist sect's method, it was the Myriad Buddha Gossamer Robe!</p><p></p><p>That Buddha had refined a gossamer robe together with the Buddhas of the Buddhist sect, and this robe was said to hang on the Buddha's golden body.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the four major sects, the Great Zhou also researched a method to pursue the moon path hundreds of years ago - the Heaven and Earth Net Celestial Chess!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was very knowledgeable!</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Lu family decided to become Gu Jiuqing's followers, the elders of the Lu family passed down all their knowledge, insights, and secrets of the world to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's cultivation was insufficient to protect Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>So what use was such a follower to an immortal? Better to impart everything.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Net Celestial Chess?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was curious, "What provides the motive force for this moon pursuit method?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan exclaimed in admiration, "The scholars of Great Zhou are so talented! When they were studying the moon and sun, they discovered magnetic force!"</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of years ago, the Magnetic Divine Light appeared in the cosmos!"</p><p></p><p>The Magnetic Divine Light collected the great stars, and they found that the moon, sun, and even the celestial stars all possessed magnetic force.</p><p></p><p>So they infused the magnetic force collected from the moon into celestial discs, using the discs to attract the moon and the Magnetic Divine Light as the motive force!</p><p></p><p>This allowed them to pursue the path to the moon!</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Seven Demon Sovereigns of the Demonic Path. This force roams the Great Wilderness, and it's said the First Demon Sovereign possesses a branch of the Primordial Moon Tree!"</p><p></p><p>"Just by activating this branch of the Primordial Moon Tree, he can connect to the main body of the tree and fly to the moon."</p><p></p><p>Each method of pursuing the moon path was awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>And on the Blue Planet, using technology to land on the moon was also a great wisdom in its own way.</p><p></p><p>As the two conversed, the Moon God Ship changed its course, detouring slightly to increase the distance from the starry space beast.</p><p></p><p>The ancient thunder talisman was then re-activated, propelling the ship back towards the bright moon.</p><p></p><p>A day later!</p><p></p><p>The moon was right before their eyes!</p><p></p><p>But the Moon God Ship was still twenty thousand li away from the moon!</p><p></p><p>On the deck, many sword sect disciples had already risen.</p><p></p><p>They gazed at the moon below, brimming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>A dense lunar radiance billowed up, permeating all around.</p><p></p><p>The lunar radiance was like water, sprinkling over their bodies with a cool sensation.</p><p></p><p>"The moon! We've finally arrived at the moon!"</p><p></p><p>"It's been six days journeying through the starry void, and at last we've made it."</p><p></p><p>Even the three sword immortals had jumped down from the ancient thunder dragons and entered the cabin to call for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>As "sword immortals" escorting the sect's disciples to the moon, they naturally couldn't leave Gu Jiuqing behind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cabin, the three sword immortals were in good spirits, as the journey had proceeded smoothly apart from the encounter with the Celestial Pavilion's starry space beast.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu! Just twenty thousand li more and we'll reach the moon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the moon outside the window, his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say earlier it would only take six days to reach the moon? Why is there still this additional twenty thousand li distance?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Immortal shook his head, "Six days was the time it took for the Moon God Ship's moon pursuit over two hundred years ago. The time before that was even less than six days. So it's normal for this journey to take a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's brows furrowed tighter!</p><p></p><p>The moon landings on the Blue Planet were precisely timed!</p><p></p><p>But for the Great Wilderness' moon pursuit, the duration increased each time, assuming the Moon God Ship's speed remained constant.</p><p></p><p>That meant the distance between the moon and the Great Wilderness was increasing!!</p><p></p><p>The distance between the moon and Great Wilderness was increasing?</p><p></p><p>Was the moon moving away from the Great Wilderness?</p><p></p><p>Or was the Great Wilderness moving away from the moon?</p><p></p><p>A faint shadow of Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao appeared on Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao about the truth when we return to the Great Wilderness!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This news shook Gu Jiuqing deeply. </p><p></p><p>What was Gu Linglong doing??</p><p></p><p>Did she know what she was doing? </p><p></p><p>The Three Zhang Golden Body Technique was an esoteric Buddhist secret, an ultimate Buddhist technique. If such a secret technique was lost, the Buddhist sect would go all out in pursuit!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect was powerful, sure. </p><p>But in the world, the Sword Sect could only rank third.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could not imagine the scene of the Sword Sect going all out!</p><p></p><p>There would be a multitude of Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, there would be tens of thousands of sword cultivators descending upon the Great Wilderness to subdue it. Who would dare confront them?</p><p></p><p>Why did Gu Linglong want to steal the Three Zhang Golden Body Technique?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she even let Luoshen know about it?</p><p></p><p>It was even possible that they would gamble using the Three Zhang Golden Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>Not only the two of them knew about this matter, others also knew that the Three Zhang Golden Body Technique was in Gu Linglong's possession.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he removed the veil of truth twice and shed his old self once, Gu Jiuqing's mind had completely matured, even surpassing the wisdom of some undying elders!</p><p></p><p>"How did Gu Linglong obtain the Three Zhang Golden Body Technique from the Small Thunder Sound Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"How could Gu Linglong be Luoshen's match? Luoshen is a disciple of the Luo family, famous for decades, with cultivation far beyond the Unfinished Realm, most likely at the Spirit Refining Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Could Gu Linglong match someone of the Spirit Refining Realm?</p><p></p><p>And even win?</p><p></p><p>This made Gu Jiuqing feel utterly incredulous. When did his sister become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Luoshen held a golden talisman and walked towards the main hall entrance, while Gu Jiuqing was still pondering.</p><p></p><p>From outside the mansion, strange sounds were heard.</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong ----"</p><p></p><p>Like the ringing of a huge bell, it entered the Heavenly Abyss Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong --------"</p><p></p><p>The bell rang loudly, resounding through heaven and earth, shaking even the mansion.</p><p></p><p>Luoshen stopped and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky over the ancient city had changed!</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Qu family's Celestial Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's Celestial Palace?</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound, Gu Jiuqing also walked out of the main hall and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>There, an ancient temple manifested, identical to the Qu family's ancestral temple summoned by Qu Yaozhou before, but this ancestral temple was much larger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble ----"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble --------"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss Ancient City shook incessantly, as one figure after another flew up into the sky, entering beneath the ancestral temple.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient city, at the Qu family mansion.</p><p></p><p>Men, women, old and young - any Qu family disciple who had cultivated spiritual power flew up into the heavens, shouldering the ancestral temple.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral temple was enormous, the site of the Qu family's incense offerings over thousands of years, enshrining the spirit tablets of the Qu family's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, unfilial descendants were moving the ancestral temple, with hundreds, even thousands of Qu family disciples shouldering it.</p><p></p><p>The entire ancient city witnessed this scene, gazing in shock at the Celestial Palace, unaware of what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Qu family's ancestral temple!"</p><p></p><p>"What? The Qu family's ancestral temple? But that's a powerful artifact, why would the Qu family mobilize such a powerful artifact?"</p><p></p><p>"The Qu family is the closest to being a great clan in the Heavenly Abyss Ancient City. With this move, all the great clans in the ancient city will have to act."</p><p></p><p>All beings were like soldiers!</p><p></p><p>The wind carried omens!</p><p></p><p>Gaze after gaze watched the Celestial Palace, observing those figures shouldering the ancestral temple, filled with shock and confusion.</p><p></p><p>"That's the current Qu family patriarch! The Qu family patriarch is even shouldering the ancestral temple?"</p><p></p><p>"Qu Wushuang! What is he going to do? Shouldering the ancestral temple and ascending to the Celestial Palace? Could it be that the Qu family's ancestors are going to mobilize the Celestial Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's most powerful divine ability was the Yin-Yang Life and Death Wheel!</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Palace was even more renowned.</p><p></p><p>"All the living elders of the Qu family have appeared. So this is the depth of the Qu family? These elders have formed divine bodies, the Yin-Yang divine bodies of the Qu family!"</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen divine bodies! The Qu family's depth is still so formidable."</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary great clan, having even one divine body expert could ensure its prosperity for a century.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Qu family had manifested eighteen divine body experts all at once.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Aside from them, there were also several refining experts carrying ancestral temples on their backs as they traveled. </p><p></p><p>"The second ancestor of the Qu family! The eighth ancestor of the Qu family! These two old ancestors of the Qu family are actually still alive, they are both at the refining realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen at the imperfect realm, two at the refining realm, the Qu family has gone all out!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>A vast black expanse hovered above the ancient city of Tianyuan. </p><p></p><p>The ancestral temples were huge, with connected temple buildings in all directions. The tiles were broken, but the walls were intact.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand people stood below the ancestral temples, carrying them on their backs, flying step by step towards the Gu family's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, someone noticed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the Gu family's mansion? The Qu family's ancestral temples are flying towards the Gu family's mansion? It must be a coincidence, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Qu family wanted to destroy the Gu family, sending one imperfect cultivator would be enough, why bother moving their powerful ancestral temples to suppress them?"</p><p></p><p>The decline of the Gu family was a fact. If it weren't for Gu Linglong earning the name Yaochi Fairy when she fled to the northern lands, there wouldn't even be a Gu family residence left in the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The Qu family's ancestral temples halted in mid-air, not far from the Gu family's mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone could see that the Qu family was targeting the Gu family!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Gu family courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie was on high alert!</p><p></p><p>He was at the semi-refining realm, trying to open his celestial aperture, but up in the sky were two refining experts from the Qu family's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The refining expert he had fought before was not even here yet!!</p><p></p><p>So the Qu family had a total of three refining experts!</p><p></p><p>Plus eighteen at the imperfect realm!</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie felt his scalp going numb.</p><p></p><p>At the main hall entrance, Luoshen watched the Qu family making a huge fuss, her smile finally fading as she revealed a hint of seriousness.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what grudge did you hold against the Qu family that made them mobilize their ancestral temples?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestral temples were powerful artifacts!</p><p></p><p>Once deployed, it meant they would fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I don't want to see Young Master get hurt. Consider this my gift to you."</p><p></p><p>Luoshen took a step forward, her beautiful dress swaying elegantly.</p><p></p><p>She had just floated a few steps into the air when the distant ancestral temple shook, then shrank by half its height.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment!</p><p></p><p>She saw over a thousand members of the Qu family carrying the ancestral temples kneeling in mid-air, as the two Qu family elders bowed towards the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Gu family's Qilin child, Gu Jiuqing, for joining the true lineage of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The Qu family wishes Young Master Jiuqing will soon reach the Sword Immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>The second elder of the Qu family shouted loudly, "Bow!"</p><p></p><p>With this command, the Qu family disciples kneeling behind him all bowed, causing the ancestral temple to shrink even further!</p><p></p><p>Boom————————</p><p></p><p>The Qu family elders, accompanied by Qu family disciples, carrying their ancestral temples, descended outside the Gu family mansion, all to pay respects to Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Wait, what did the Qu family elder just say?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing joined the true lineage of the Sword Sect? </p><p></p><p>Attained the true transmission position?</p><p></p><p>What??</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing is now the true inheritor of the Sword Sect??</p><p></p><p>A second wave of commotion arose on the streets of the ancient city of Tianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Up in the sky, the Qu family disciples carrying the ancestral temples knelt without rising.</p><p></p><p>At the main hall entrance.</p><p></p><p>Luoshen turned around, looking at Gu Jiuqing in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you joined the Sword Sect and attained the true transmission?"</p><p></p><p>"You...you have comprehended the sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>The second son of the Gu family was a Sword Immortal!!</p><p></p><p>Adding his elder sister!</p><p></p><p>The Gu family was truly formidable!</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I accidentally comprehended the sword intent during the Sword Sect's great trial."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's youthful demeanor, Luoshen could already envision the emergence of an extraordinary Sword Immortal.</p>

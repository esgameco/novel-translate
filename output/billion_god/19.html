        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The moment the old ancestor of the Qu family dispersed into incarnation, the Sword Sect was shaken. Countless sword intents swept across the sky, tearing apart the universe. Various sword intents descended both inside and outside the Sword Sect's gate. </p><p></p><p>This disturbance was several times greater than what Si Wuxie had caused. The disciples of the Sword Sect felt as if myriad swords were vying to shine, and the vast ocean of the Sword Dao was condensing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Sword Sect was even enveloped by all kinds of sword intents. For the first time, the Northern Youth clearly understood what a true prodigy was!</p><p></p><p>They had exhausted their efforts to complete a transformation from mortality, only able to become outer disciples of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>What about Gu Jiuqing?</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye's face turned pale. Qu Yaozhou had died. He had lost his greatest backing within the Sword Sect, and he had also offended the paramount sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the abnormal phenomena at the Sword Sect, Lu Buye left the gate in a daze, riding away on a flying horse carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu! Young Master Gu, he is going to soar to prominence effortlessly."</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei envied.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had comprehended a sword intent, and moreover, this Heaven-Rending Sword Intent was of the highest grade. The entire Sword Sect would go into a frenzy over it.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen figures flying out from within the Sword Sect gate.</p><p></p><p>Those were Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>One supreme Sword Immortal after another, descending to the Sword Sect gate in their true forms.</p><p></p><p>Peerless and graceful, their bearing unsurpassed, each figure seemed like a celestial being, standing upright with their hands behind their backs.</p><p></p><p>"So many Elder Sword Immortals! Heavens, this is the first time I've seen so many Sword Immortals appear simultaneously in our sect."</p><p></p><p>"The elder cultivators within the Sword Sect can independently establish a peak and become the peak master, qualifying them to accept true disciples."</p><p></p><p>"There are nine peak masters in the Sword Sect, but the number of Sword Immortals appearing now far exceeds nine!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Sword Tomb, Si Wuxie trod on sword qi, standing in midair.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the cloud of Sword Immortals, each one graceful and peerless. At present, thirteen Sword Immortals had already appeared.</p><p></p><p>These thirteen Sword Immortals were all moved by Gu Jiuqing's sword intent and wished to accept him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sword Tomb, a true disciple of the Three Elder lineage explained to Si Wuxie:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, it seems your limelight has been stolen by Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>The true disciple had a lofty bearing, carrying a long sword on his back in the attire of a sword cultivator. His sword intent was restrained, making it impossible to discern his true cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see that Sword Immortal?" </p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Wu Yong pointed towards a figure outside the gate. "That is the Nine Yang Sword Immortal! He cultivates the Nine Yang Sword Intent, which, once fully realized, can summon the blazing sun, like nine suns rising into the sky. It is also called the Rising Sun Sword Intent."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie looked towards the Nine Yang Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Yang Sword Immortal had descended in his true form, wearing an ornate crown like an emperor. Without any abnormal phenomena, his piercing intent swept forth, causing Si Wuxie's eyes to ache.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Yang Sword Immortal moved!</p><p></p><p>Standing in midair, he smiled at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, excellent! Befitting the paramount sword cultivator, comprehending the Heaven-Rending top-grade sword intent through the Unsheathing Sword technique. Such talent has not appeared in the Sword Sect for three thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>"Your great talent possesses the bearing of the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, if you join my Nine Yang Peak lineage, you will undoubtedly become the next peak master!"</p><p></p><p>"I will exhaust all my efforts to help you achieve the Sword Immortal realm within a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Swish—</p><p></p><p>Achieve the Sword Immortal realm within a hundred years?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, the entire Sword Sect, whether true disciples, inner disciples, or other Sword Immortal elders, all revealed astonished expressions.</p><p></p><p>The path of sword cultivation placed great emphasis on innate talent.</p><p></p><p>There were inner disciples of the Sword Sect who had cultivated bitterly for a hundred years without making any progress. Even those who had comprehended nine parts of the sword intent, reaching the Celestial Realm or even the Longevity Realm and passing through major tribulations, might still fail to cross this final threshold and become Sword Immortals until their deaths.</p><p></p><p>And the weakest Sword Immortals were already Celestial Realm experts, considered overlords and major powers in the Northern Lands, capable of establishing their own sects.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, Nine Yang Sword Immortal, your words are a bit premature. In sword cultivation, achieving Sword Immortality within a hundred years has only been accomplished by the Sect Master himself throughout the entire history of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"If Gu Jiuqing truly becomes a Sword Immortal within a hundred years, he will undoubtedly be the next Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Another Sword Immortal spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He had a goatee and eyes like bronze bells, emanating a wild and primordial sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Primordial Sword Immortal, who cultivates the Primordial Sword Intent, also known as the Ancient Sword Immortal. Junior Brother, as you walk the path of the Sword Sect, you must be careful not to provoke this Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" </p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Wu Yong smiled bitterly. "Other Sword Immortals will restrain their sword intent, but this Sword Immortal carries the primordial and wild intent within ten zhang of his surroundings. If his temperament flares up, with his sword intent rising, it won't end well."</p><p></p><p>So he's a brute!</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, don't listen to Jiuyang Sword Immortal's nonsense. I am the Taiyin Sword Immortal, cultivating the Taiyin Sword Intent. If you become my disciple, I will take you to the moon to cultivate the Taiyin Sword Intent, helping you become a Sword Immortal in the shortest time!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Gu family has the divine Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade, which can also be cultivated together on the moon."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Gu Jiuqing was clearly moved.</p><p></p><p>He knew he was not a sword dao prodigy, far inferior to Siwuxie's swordsmanship.  </p><p></p><p>But he had Lan Xing ah, as long as he passed the teachings to Lan Xing, Gu Jiuqing could share in their cultivation!</p><p></p><p>So for Gu Jiuqing to join the Sword Immortal sect, the simplest sword intent, even a lower-grade one, was actually the best choice.</p><p></p><p>This would make it easier for the Lan Xing people to cultivate swordsmanship and the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"Lan Xing has spacecraft that can carry people to the moon. The greatest advantage of the Taiyin Sword Intent is cultivating by borrowing the bright moonlight, which can be achieved on Lan Xing!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing show signs of being moved, the other sword immortals became anxious.</p><p></p><p>This was the sword dao prodigy ah, having him as a disciple would make one the master of the sword dao prodigy!</p><p></p><p>This was the wish of every sword immortal!</p><p></p><p>Another sword immortal spoke up, "Gu Jiuqing, don't be hasty in making your decision. I am the Mountain River Sword Immortal, cultivating the Mountain River Sword Intent, condensing the mountain river dharma form, perceiving the mountain river divine abilities. If you join my sect, not only can you cultivate into a Sword Immortal, you can also directly ascend and cultivate to the Celestial Palace Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Mountain River Peak is the largest of the nine peaks, with the most disciples. If you come to Mountain River Peak, I will appoint you as the next Peak Master on the spot!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the Mountain River Sword Immortal finished speaking, another sword immortal stepped forward - a female sword immortal.  </p><p></p><p>Female sword immortals were extremely rare in the sword sect.</p><p></p><p>This female sword immortal had a graceful figure, an icy beauty, but at this moment she had to reveal a slight smile, causing the surrounding sword immortals to inwardly curse.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless, actually using beauty to entice?"</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Jiuqing was not entranced by her beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Of the nine peaks of the sword sect, only my Lotus Peak specializes in beauty and charm. In my sect, there are three true disciples, all peerless beauties. Young friend Jiuqing, would you like to join my Lotus Peak?"</p><p></p><p>Well now!</p><p></p><p>Was she really resorting to using feminine wiles?</p><p></p><p>The four young disciples of the great families and the youth from the Northern Lands were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Was this really the sword sect they knew?</p><p></p><p>These elders were more shameless than the next, just like the brothels of the Thirteen Cities of the Northern Lands, only lacking coming out to drag people in.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was also at a loss!</p><p></p><p>Outside the sword gate, on the divine mountain, the peerless sword immortals were all watching him, wanting Gu Jiuqing to make his own choice.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that he would attract over ten sword immortals to come down.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>A white-robed figure flew out from inside the sword gate. He wore flowing white robes, carried a long sword on his back, had a handsome appearance, yet had a head of white hair.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared, Wu Yong's true disciple was greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Even this lineage has shown up?"</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie asked, "Senior Brother, which sword immortal elder of our sect is this?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Yong shook his head, "This is not a sword immortal elder, but rather a true disciple of the Taishang Elder's lineage!"</p><p></p><p>"He is also one of the three Sword Furnaces of our sect, the Bright Court Sword Furnace. The disciples of this lineage specialize in cultivating the Great Bright Court Sword Qi. It seems the Taishang Elder has also been moved by Gu Jiuqing's talent."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yong looked towards the sword tomb behind him.</p><p></p><p>He sensed that his own master was also stirring, but since the Three Elders had just accepted Siwuxie as a true disciple, if Gu Jiuqing was also accepted, the other elders would definitely be displeased.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed sword immortal stepped forward and bowed respectfully to the sword immortal elders.</p><p></p><p>"I ask that the venerable elders can bear to let go, as my master has intentions of accepting a disciple. From now on, Gu Jiuqing will join my Bright Court lineage."</p><p></p><p>Although the white-robed sword immortal humbled himself, he still exuded an innate pride, his sword intent undying, breathing the Great Bright Court!</p><p></p><p>"The Taishang Elder also wants to accept a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if the Sect Leader wasn't absent from the sect, perhaps even the Sect Leader Himself would come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it, we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>"Alas————"</p><p></p><p>One peerless sword immortal after another sighed and dispersed, leaving only the white-robed sword immortal looking at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, are you willing to join my Bright Court lineage? To become the second disciple of Cunyin Daoren?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed sword immortal was going to accept him as a disciple on the spot ah.</p><p></p><p>Those dispersed peerless sword immortals revealed regretful expressions.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the white-robed sword immortal was going to accept a disciple on behalf of his master, but the Taishang Elder hadn't actually emerged!</p><p></p><p>They had all been tricked by this kid!</p><p></p><p>I slept through the afternoon, then went for an IV drip, and slept again after returning. Still have a bit of a headache.</p><p></p><p>Only wrote 2,000 words today, but I'll make up for it once I recover from this cold.</p><p></p><p>With the changing seasons, colds are going around, so everyone be careful to stay warm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

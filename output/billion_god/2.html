        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu! Why do you have time to come to school today?"</p><p></p><p>The guard at the gate looked at Teacher Gu in surprise. </p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've seen Teacher Gu. I thought Teacher Gu had taken leave."</p><p></p><p>Two guards were standing at the school gate, and not far away there was a guard booth where three or four figures could vaguely be seen.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't all!</p><p></p><p>There were also armed police patrolling inside the school, making rounds every half hour.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo woo————————"</p><p>"Woo woo woo————————————"</p><p></p><p>A patrol car drove around the campus, and those police officers all looked towards Teacher Gu, only averting their gaze after verifying his identity.</p><p></p><p>School safety came first. Everyone entering or leaving the school would be checked. If Gu Jiuqing wasn't a teacher at the school, he wouldn't even be allowed through the main gate.</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the two scrawny, elderly guards with graying hair at the gate. They were martial artists!!</p><p></p><p>Their monthly salary was ten thousand yuan, while Gu Jiuqing only made four thousand a month.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, make the most of your youth and go out more. I heard the trains now go all the way into the city, so it's convenient to take the train out anywhere."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, there were no trains in Linjiang before. It wasn't easy to go out in the past."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go out and take a look if I get a chance." </p><p></p><p>"Just kidding, Teacher Gu is an outstanding graduate from the capital. I heard you almost got into the Dragon Academy."</p><p></p><p>Old Yang chuckled, "The capital is a top-tier city, how different can it be from Linjiang? Teacher Gu, whenever you have time, tell us about it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled awkwardly. </p><p></p><p>How would he know the difference between the capital and Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know who he really was!</p><p></p><p>The unfamiliar environment, the iron boxes called "cars" that could move at high speeds, the place for cultivating martial arts called a "school."</p><p></p><p>The old men Yang and Jin guarding the gate were called "security guards"!</p><p></p><p>This world was completely different from the Wasteland that Gu Jiuqing knew.</p><p></p><p>During the nine-day great examination, Gu Jiuqing practiced the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill day and night. He finally fell asleep on the second night.</p><p></p><p>And whenever Gu Jiuqing fell asleep, he would be transported to this world. This had been going on for some time.</p><p></p><p>"A school teacher?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing entered the school and looked at the quiet campus with some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>He was the youngest teacher at the school, from the capital, with an apparently unusual identity. Rumor had it that he had a falling out with his family in the capital, which was why he came to Linjiang to teach.</p><p></p><p>"I requested half a month's leave from school. If I don't come back to teach soon, the school will get suspicious."</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Jiuqing had been staying in his rented room, surfing the internet. When hungry, he would order takeout.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, Gu Jiuqing had learned the basic common knowledge of this world.</p><p></p><p>This world was made up of many stars, and they lived on a blue-colored star.</p><p></p><p>The Life Ancient Star - the Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>The technology on the Blue Star was incredibly advanced. There were flying machines that could soar high in the sky, even leaving the atmosphere to fly to the moon. This was far more powerful than even the outer disciples of the Sword Sect. Could those inner disciples fly to the moon?</p><p></p><p>"Besides technology, there was also martial arts!!"</p><p></p><p>Martial arts flourished on the Blue Star. Gu Jiuqing was now coming to school to teach students about martial studies.</p><p></p><p>"I was still taking the great examination at the Sword Sect, but now I've come to a school to lecture students."</p><p></p><p>But perhaps this was an opportunity for me to join the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up with determination. He checked his phone.</p><p></p><p>10:00 am</p><p></p><p>Night in the Wasteland, daytime on the Blue Star - the times perfectly alternated.</p><p></p><p>"Ring ring ring————————"</p><p></p><p>The bell for class rang on time, and students entered their classrooms.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also arrived at Senior Grade 2 Class.</p><p></p><p>Senior 2 was an average class, with the class president Yang Miaojing's qi-blood only at 0.983.</p><p></p><p>With only three months left until the college entrance exam, their qi-blood needed to reach 1 to have a chance of getting into university and leaving Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up, greet the teacher."</p><p>"Good morning, students."</p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom looked at Gu Jiuqing curiously.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Gu was a celebrity at the school.</p><p></p><p>An outstanding graduate from the capital, he was the only martial artist from the capital in the entire school. And he was also good-looking, with many female students openly staring at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that Teacher Gu came from the reclusive Gu family of the capital, and that he had run away to Linjiang to avoid an arranged marriage.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood on the podium, looking at the 45 students in the classroom. These students were around his true age, full of youthful and lively energy.</p><p></p><p>The classroom was quiet, as Gu Jiuqing hadn't spoken yet, and the students naturally didn't dare say a word.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Jiuqing finally said in a trembling voice:</p><p></p><p>"The college entrance exam is coming up soon, but your martial arts scores are not ideal. So I've prepared a new martial art for you all."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing picked up a piece of chalk and wrote a few large characters on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon and Elephant Skill!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Yuanyuan recited the three words "Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial art skill was this?</p><p></p><p>There were no records of the Dragon and Elephant Skill in the school library.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Teacher Gu...?</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The unique martial arts of the Dragon Elephant?</p><p></p><p>At this moment!!</p><p></p><p>The breathing of the 45 students became much heavier. </p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant Skill has 22 forms in total. If one cultivates the Dragon Elephant Skill to the utmost, they can gain the power of a dragon and an elephant."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Elephant Body Refinement can make the muscles and bones hum in unison, cast off the mortal body, and cleanse the marrow through the Book of Changes."</p><p></p><p>"For martial artists, first refine the skin, then the flesh, followed by the bones, tendons and organs, and only after that exchange the blood."</p><p></p><p>Skin Disciple! Flesh Cultivator! Bone Master! Tendon Grand Master! Organ Martial King! Blood Exchange Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>These martial realms had already been published online. Gu Jiuqing was very familiar with them. He boasted glibly as the chalk in his hand never stopped, continuing to draw on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Gu Jiuqing drew the Dragon Elephant Skill, much faster than the first time he used a brush. In just a moment, the first form of the Dragon Elephant Skill was drawn on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>Elephant Roaming the Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>A divine elephant fell into the wilderness, the great elephant rampaging, like a dream or illusion, as if condensing from the illusory into reality, about to step into the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Such a formidable image impacted the students' spiritual worlds.</p><p></p><p>That was the true supreme martial art!</p><p></p><p>The body cultivation methods announced by the school were just a pile of dog shit compared to the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"The second form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Pulling the Divine Mountain!</p><p></p><p>The third form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Treading the Void!</p><p></p><p>The fourth form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Pushing the Divine City!"</p><p></p><p>The drawings of the first four forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill had occupied the entire blackboard. To continue drawing the fifth form, Gu Jiuqing had to draw elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>The walls were too white, making the drawings indistinct. Gu Jiuqing walked to the last row of the classroom. </p><p></p><p>There was also a blackboard at the back of the classroom.</p><p></p><p>The fifth form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Treading Like an Elephant!</p><p></p><p>The sixth form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Divine Elephant Soaring!</p><p></p><p>The seventh form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Transcending Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>The eighth form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, No Laws No Elephants!</p><p></p><p>Another four forms were drawn on the blackboard at the back of the classroom, totaling eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill written in senior class two.</p><p></p><p>"Ring ring ring————————"</p><p></p><p>The class bell rang, and Gu Jiuqing spent a full two hours drawing the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The classroom was completely silent, the students staring fixedly at these eight forms, not slacking off or even going to the bathroom during this time.</p><p></p><p>The eight forms were vividly lifelike, as if eight divine elephants would break through the void and step into the classroom.</p><p></p><p>The 45 students looked at the eight forms, itching to personally experience this martial art!</p><p></p><p>"That's all for today's class. First cultivate these eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill. Before class tomorrow, hand me an 800-word minimum reflection on the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing left the classroom, and his departure caused an uproar!</p><p></p><p>The 45 students closed the classroom door, carefully took pictures of the eight forms, and then began cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>With the supreme art right before their eyes, if not now, when would they cultivate?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's idea was simple. The Blue Planet and the Great Wilderness were two worlds. He transmitted the Dragon Elephant Skill on the Blue Planet privately, which the Sword Sect couldn't possibly know about.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't do this to teach the students.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to borrow the 45 students' reflections to cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill himself.</p><p></p><p>He was the teacher, so having students write a cultivation reflection wasn't too much to ask, right?</p><p></p><p>But during the nine days of the great exam, who would willingly share their cultivation reflections?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was in a good position - he had 45 students willing to share their reflections for free.</p><p></p><p>With these 45 cultivation reflections, he didn't believe he couldn't break through to the next realm!!</p><p></p><p>After having lunch at the school cafeteria, Gu Jiuqing left the school.</p><p></p><p>Besides information from the internet and whispers from passersby, Gu Jiuqing didn't know much about himself. The longer he stayed at school, the more likely his identity as a dimensional traveler would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Old Yang that Gu Zixiu has a girlfriend at the school. Apparently Gu Zixiu came to Linji for this girlfriend."</p><p></p><p>Oh no!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was a virgin who had never dated. In the Abyss Ancient City, he was obsessed with music, chess, calligraphy and painting all day, when would he have had time for women?</p><p></p><p>What a mess!</p><p></p><p>Too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>"In these two weeks, Gu Zixiu's girlfriend has never come to see him. If she really was his girlfriend, how could she not come see him after he disappeared for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Even today when he came to teach class, he didn't see Gu Zixiu's girlfriend either.</p><p></p><p>It seems the relationship between the two was different from what Old Yang said.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe Gu Zixiu came to Linji for another hidden reason, not for this girlfriend? Or was Gu Zixiu just deluding himself, coming to be a desperate pursuer?</p><p></p><p>"No matter the situation, it's better if this girlfriend doesn't show up."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing left the school, said goodbye to Old Yang and Old Jin at the gate, took a public bus, and returned to his rental room.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, he planned to spend the afternoon online.</p><p></p><p>He still understood too little about the high martial Blue Planet. If he had a chance, he also wanted to leave Linji.</p><p></p><p>"If..."</p><p></p><p>"If I can't join the Sword Sect, perhaps this world will become my destiny."</p><p></p><p>On the bus, watching the hustle and bustle of city life, Gu Jiuqing sighed.</p><p></p><p>I've already signed up, so I can invest a bit!</p><p></p><p>Begging for your support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

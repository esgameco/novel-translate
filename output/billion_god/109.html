        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's cave dwelling was scattered with open coffins, while he himself was kneeling on the ground!</p><p></p><p>That was Elder Brother Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Relying on Elder Brother Liang Xiao's reputation, Gu Jiuqing had forcibly delayed the Devil Prince's advance by two days!</p><p></p><p>Now, this madman was kneeling before this old man, similar to a student in front of their teacher, without any sense of grandeur.</p><p></p><p>The old man was very old, even older than the Eight Trigrams Ancestor. His figure was slightly larger than Nuoshan's, looking just like an ordinary elderly man, except for his very conspicuous white hair. </p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's first time seeing the Daoist Monk Cunyin.</p><p></p><p>The teacher is revered!</p><p></p><p>He lifted his white robe, went down on both knees, placed his palms on the ground and fully prostrated himself.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Gu Jiuqing pays respects to the Master!"</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice then rang out, "Why are you also wearing white robes now?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you imitating this treacherous disciple? Take them off!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin's tone was very stern, and his two eyes looked down upon Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The latter only felt an immense pressure bearing down on him!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing dared not move!</p><p></p><p>He did not know why Daoist Monk Cunyin was so angered.</p><p></p><p>"Change out of them. In the old sect of my lineage, having one person in white robes is enough. You child, do not imitate this treacherous disciple."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin's tone softened, he walked down from the coffin and approached Gu Jiuqing, helping him up.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin sized up Gu Jiuqing, and finally revealed a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You treacherous disciple have actually done one decent thing. Not bad, not bad, this old master quite likes this disciple."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Elder Brother Liang Xiao chuckled and was about to stand up.</p><p></p><p>"Stay kneeling, who allowed you to get up?"</p><p></p><p>"Old master has been in seclusion for so many years, you treacherous disciple, how did you agree to become my disciple back then?"</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, you have entered and exited the Wilderness many times, do you still see me as your master in your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's eyes flickered, he did not transmit his voice, but his eyes conveyed meaning, as if waiting for Gu Jiuqing to say some pleasing words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was about to speak when Daoist Monk Cunyin waved his hand, "No need to say more, letting this treacherous disciple kneel for a few days won't change his ingrained habits."</p><p></p><p>"This white robe of yours is vexing to look at."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin stretched out his hand, and a precious robe materialized!</p><p></p><p>"Good disciple, you have joined my lineage for so long now, but old master has never come out of seclusion. Consider this precious robe a gift for our reunion."</p><p></p><p>The precious robe was colorless, without any hue.</p><p></p><p>It blended with the void, with strange images appearing and rippling in the emptiness.</p><p></p><p>If this precious robe was placed in a corner of the cave dwelling, one would likely not notice it unless looking carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, quickly put on this precious robe. This is Master's pure yang Daoist robe. When Master crossed the lightning tribulation back then, he wore this precious robe to horizontally traverse the nine-fold lightning tribulation. This precious robe has been imbued with pure yang attributes - ordinary pure yang techniques cannot break through it!"</p><p></p><p>This was a grand gesture, a pure yang-level treasure. If refined further and imbued with the mark of the Dao, it could become a thousand-mark divine weapon, a great artifact of three thousand marks!</p><p></p><p>"Master ah, you're really being partial here. Back then when I secretly wore your pure yang precious robe, you hung me up and beat me for three days!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao cried out in grievance.</p><p></p><p>"You treacherous disciple, you still have the nerve to bring up this matter!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin's face flushed with anger as he glared at Elder Brother Liang Xiao. "When you wore Master's pure yang Daoist robe, what were you doing at the Sword Mausoleum?"</p><p></p><p>"After going to the Sword Mausoleum, you then secretly infiltrated the Great Five Elements Sword Furnace, what were you up to?"</p><p></p><p>"If not for the Third Elder recognizing this pure yang Daoist robe, do you think you could have walked out of the Great Five Elements Sword Furnace alive back then?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao did not dare respond, only muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Who told the Third Elder not to pass down the Great Five Elements Sword Intent to me!"</p><p></p><p>So this was how Elder Brother Liang Xiao obtained the Great Five Elements Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>What a character, personally entering the Five Elements Sword Furnace to spy on the Five Elements Sword Intent, cultivating the Great Five Elements Sword Dao in this way.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang intent scattered, and the three-in-one Ancestor suddenly acted!</p><p></p><p>However, his arm stopped midair, not striking down.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, you... If this slap from old master lands, your physical body can no longer withstand it now."</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's physical body was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>He had not yet crossed the tribulation, without any pure yang infusion.</p><p></p><p>But just borrowing the pure yang attributes was no longer enough to break through his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>"Enough is enough, I've been kneeling for so long. Junior Brother is just watching from the side."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin gave a cold snort, and only then did Elder Brother Liang Xiao stand up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing also changed into the pure yang Daoist robe.</p><p></p><p>The robe clung to his body, with strands of divine light interweaving into form. With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the divine light disappeared, transforming into a blue robe and azure attire.</p><p></p><p>"After Junior Brother put on this Daoist robe, his bearing has become more refined."</p><p></p><p>"Master, with Junior Brother here, our Celestial Peak Sect will not be extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's face had a smile, perhaps not having seen Daoist Monk Cunyin for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think I don't know what you're thinking. You're just waiting for me to die so you can leave Celestial Peak Sect, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, how could I, Liang Xiao, ever be someone who betrays his teacher and destroys his ancestry?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, when will you die, Master?"</p><p></p><p>"If you die, I won't die!"</p><p></p><p>"That would be best."</p><p></p><p>As the master and disciple bantered, they realized Gu Jiuqing was still standing there. Daoist Monk Cunyin reined in his emotions.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, since my good disciple is also here, and you, this treacherous disciple, are by my side, old master will just state it clearly today."</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's expression turned solemn as he stood beside Daoist Monk Cunyin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also knew the matter to follow was a serious one, and listened respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Old master is going to die soon."</p><p></p><p>The first sentence made Gu Jiuqing tremble.</p><p></p><p>He had just met his master, and this master was going to die?</p><p></p><p>"However, there should still be about ten years left."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin said it very casually.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you were in seclusion for so long this time, could it be you did not open your divine gate?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao furrowed his brow tightly, his voice heavy with a hint of doubt!</p><p></p><p>"Opening the divine gate is not as simple as you describe," Daoist Monk Cunyin sighed.</p><p></p><p>"During the ancient era of the eighteen emperors, opening the divine gate allowed one to receive the divine nature, thereby successfully becoming a divine being through cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"But now, even if the divine gate is opened and the divine nature is received, one may still not be able to become a divine being."</p><p></p><p>There was an implied meaning in Daoist Monk Cunyin's words, "The divine beings of the present are no longer the true divine beings. If the ancient divine beings were placed in this era, they would also be unable to reach the divine realm!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao looked outwards from the palace, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"So you mean the Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, Star Lord, and that old fellow have all opened their divine gates and received the divine nature, but have not yet cultivated into true divine beings?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing listened carefully!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, Star Lord, and even the Sword Sect's Patriarch had all opened their divine gates and received the divine nature. Placed in any era during the ancient eighteen emperors, they would be divine beings walking the earth.</p><p></p><p>Only in this modern era were divine beings no longer truly divine!</p><p></p><p>"That's right, in the current Wilderness there are just these four existences at the divine gate realm who have opened their divine gates and received the divine nature."</p><p></p><p>Terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The four great patriarchs of the world had already entered the divine gate realm, but were unable to achieve true divinity!</p><p></p><p>"Tens of thousands of years ago, the Celestial Palace fell from the stars, and the corpses of divine beings descended from the starry cosmos. Perhaps at that time, the path to divinity was also obstructed."</p><p></p><p>If the path to divinity was obstructed, then opening the divine gate and receiving the divine nature would be unable to achieve true divinity.</p><p></p><p>It was like a leak of the heavenly mechanism - if one could not open the wondrous gates, then one would be unable to cultivate spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing spoke up with a puzzled matter.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Elder Brother, your disciple has something perplexing."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Monk Cunyin and Elder Brother Liang Xiao both looked towards Gu Jiuqing, "Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Swish —"</p><p></p><p>Aside from Gu Linglong and Steward Xie, Daoist Monk Cunyin and Elder Brother Liang Xiao were the people Gu Jiuqing trusted the most.</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal anything, directly projecting his dantian into the void.</p><p></p><p>His nine-zhang dantian transformed into an ocean, with strands of spiritual power flowing down from a three-zhang wide gate.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, even this three-in-one existence of Daoist Monk Cunyin was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A nine-zhang dantian?</p><p></p><p>A three-zhang wondrous gate??</p><p></p><p>This was the dantian of a Realm of Tribulations Perfected Man!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>It was even the strange image within the dantian of a Nonepeak cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"A nine-zhang dantian, that's the dantian of a Realm of Tribulations Perfected Man. And this gate of yours is a bit exaggeratedly large too, Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>The gate was open, with strands of spiritual power flowing out.</p><p></p><p>That was a fully opened wondrous gate!</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Liang Xiao and Daoist Monk Cunyin fell into brief silence.</p><p></p><p>Because they realized that this junior brother, this disciple, was a freak genius, an even more freakish genius than themselves!</p><p></p><p>A Realm of Tribulations cultivator could open a nine-zhang dantian, and the wondrous gate could be pushed open to some extent, but Gu Jiuqing was only at the Nonepeak realm!</p><p></p><p>Not even a Spirit Refiner!</p><p></p><p>Within this fully opened gate was another smaller gate.</p><p></p><p>That should be the divine gate!</p><p></p><p>Opening the divine gate would allow one to receive the divine nature!</p><p></p><p>"This smaller gate within should be the divine gate."</p><p></p><p>"I have tried many times to open this divine gate, but have been unable to push it open. Now that I've heard Master say the path to divinity has been obstructed..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing then spoke about the Moon-Traversing Path and the Eight Trigrams Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Trigrams Ancestor and several Forbidden Lands masters, they were all..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Research new methods of communicating with deities, taking the direction of using physical body and primordial spirit power."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin showed a slight expression, as he did not know that Gu Jiuqing had experienced so many things on the moon. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke out his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"If one portal releases power and the second portal releases divinity, then for cultivators on the path, is it possible to cultivate power and divinity without relying on these two portals?!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's idea was quite unique.</p><p></p><p>But they had already considered this matter long ago.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin explained, "Cultivating power is actually not too difficult, as there are many methods that can refine the first strand of power."</p><p></p><p>"Please teach me, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Although Daoist Cunyin was puzzled as to why Gu Jiuqing was so obsessed with the matter of power, he still spoke.</p><p></p><p>"For cultivating power, I know of three methods."</p><p></p><p>The first is the Root Cultivation Method. After the physical body has shed its mortal form to the utmost, cultivate the root and nourish the primordial. The leakage of essence and energy from the flawless body can be transformed into the first strand of power. This is the method of overflow when essence is full.</p><p></p><p>The second is the Cinnabar Field Seeding Method. Use others' methods to strike into the cinnabar field, gather into a primordial pill, then use life force to fuse the primordial pill, walking the path of power cultivation. </p><p></p><p>The third is the Yin-Yang Intercourse Method. Use the dual cultivation method to collect yin and yang energies, refine them into yin-yang power, then discard the yin-yang attributes! This method is broad and can be used in other cultivations.</p><p></p><p>For example, collect thunder and lightning, nurture them, seal the thunder and lightning in the cinnabar field, condense into a unique thunder and lightning power, discard the true intent of thunder and lightning, and it becomes power without attributes.</p><p></p><p>These three methods of power cultivation without relying on the myriad doors each have their strengths, but they are far from as pure as the power leaked from the myriad doors.</p><p></p><p>"These three methods of cultivating power are all quite simple, but in the Wasteland, no one would do such things. The first strand of power is very important. Without this first door, there is no way to open the second door!"</p><p></p><p>There are divine doors within the myriad doors. Without opening the myriad doors, how could there be divine doors?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded. "Master, what about opening the first door, then using other methods to cultivate divinity?"</p><p></p><p>Cultivating divinity without relying on the divine door, self-cultivating divinity!</p><p></p><p>This is the method of communicating with deities!</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin shook his head. "My method of communicating with deities has failed. You need not hear about it, as hearing it would do you no good."</p><p></p><p>From the side, Senior Brother Liangxiao responded to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, Senior Brother has not researched the method of communicating with deities. However, the simplest way is to capture a deity, slice up his corpse, and I believe Senior Brother would be able to research a new method of communicating with deities!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm, this may be Senior Brother Liangxiao's method of communicating with deities.</p><p></p><p>"Heretic, what are you thinking? In this world, there are no living deities!"</p><p></p><p>Deities fell long ago, in the previous era.</p><p></p><p>"But aren't there divine corpses falling from the starry sky? I've heard that the Sword Sect seems to have one."</p><p></p><p>"Who told you that? It's false, false. You're talking nonsense. I'll sew your mouth shut."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao dared not say more!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was moved, observing Daoist Cunyin's actions.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect may indeed have a divine corpse, or at least part of one.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would the Sword Sect's Patriarch surpass other Communicating with Deities experts by half a step?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao suddenly thought of something and hastily asked, </p><p></p><p>"Master, do you have the Divine Demon Visualization Method?"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin looked deeply at Senior Brother Liangxiao.</p><p></p><p>"I'm asking on behalf of Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing quickly nodded!</p><p></p><p>He had almost forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Divine Demon Visualization Method could prop open one's own vessel and break through the constraints of the realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Demon Visualization Method was more suitable for Gu Jiuqing than any other cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you learn of the Divine Demon Visualization Method?" </p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin asked.</p><p></p><p>"From a true disciple of the Third Elder's lineage, that person named Siwuxie."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke of Jianzhong's choice of the Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin pondered for a moment. "This Siwuxie, I've also heard of him in the few days since I came out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>The name Siwuxie had even reached the ears of the Supreme Elder!</p><p></p><p>"This true disciple may be the reincarnation of a deity!"</p><p></p><p>This was Daoist Cunyin's evaluation, so Siwuxie was quite formidable. </p><p></p><p>A reincarnated deity had voluntarily joined the Sword Sect!!</p><p></p><p>Hmm, he must have purposely joined the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>So which deity from ancient times was this? Why did he join the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing pondered, Daoist Cunyin continued.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect has a forbidden technique called the Cangpu Divine Demon Visualization Method!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years ago, there was a great war among the deities, which later evolved into the Twilight of the Deities, with one deity after another falling, their corpses collapsing the celestial realm."</p><p></p><p>"Then came a brief period of extinction!"</p><p></p><p>After the extinction, the human race stood up again in the Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>During the period of extinction, cultivators almost died out, with only a few mortals surviving. After generations of inheritance, the human race finally walked the path of cultivation again.</p><p></p><p>"Later, in the chaotic period, my Sword Sect's old Patriarch, along with the Dao Patriarch, Buddha Patriarch, Star Lord, and the Divine Emperor of the Great Zhou, excavated the remains of a deity in the Wasteland. From this divine corpse, they obtained the Divine Demon Visualization Method!!"</p><p></p><p>And this deity!</p><p></p><p>Was the Cangpu Divine, the Divine Demon Cangpu!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Daoist Cunyin excitedly.</p><p></p><p>But Daoist Cunyin shook his head. "No, the Divine Demon Visualization Method is a forbidden technique, not permitted by Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin knew of the Divine Demon Visualization Method and had even cultivated it before!</p><p></p><p>But he seemed to be like Senior Brother Liangxiao, unable to pass down this method to others.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the Wasteland, no one cultivated the Divine Demon Visualization Method!</p><p></p><p>What flaw did this method have?!!</p><p></p><p>"No more talk of the Divine Demon Visualization Method."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Cunyin's words were sharp as he left Senior Brother Liangxiao's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Watching the departing master, Senior Brother Liangxiao patted Gu Jiuqing's shoulder. "No matter, once Senior Brother achieves the three-in-one state, he may be able to unlock the seal on the Divine Demon Visualization Method. At that time, Senior Brother will pass it down to you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Demon Visualization Method could break through the constraints of realms. Without this method, Gu Jiuqing could only rely on divine weapons to suppress himself.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, Junior Brother's divine weapons are not enough again."</p><p></p><p>Not enough?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao sized up Gu Jiuqing and laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at you, it doesn't seem like you've come to ask Senior Brother for divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is truly insightful, I cannot deceive you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hesitated before speaking, "Junior Brother wants to cultivate the method of planting divine weapons that Senior Brother used on the moon."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, only Senior Brother knows such a method in the world. You've asked the right person."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao did not hide anything and spoke frankly.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I brought two divine weapons with me and planted them on the moon, tracing the lunar essence and condensing the primordial lunar spirit formation. I wove the Dao rhythm and nurtured the Dao traces on the divine weapons. It's a pity you didn't obtain those two divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>How did Senior Brother know about this?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Senior Brother already knew what happened on the moon?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao and Siwuxie were unfathomable to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, if you want to forge divine weapons yourself, Senior Brother won't hide anything. If not for the stars outside the Wasteland being refined by the Star Pavilion, the simplest method of forging divine weapons would be to harvest great stars!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Harvest great stars?</p><p></p><p>What method was that?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt that this forging method would be very suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>It might even surpass the moon-planting divine weapon method mentioned by Senior Brother Liangxiao earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, could you explain what the great star harvesting method is?"</p><p></p><p>"This forging method was originally the exclusive method of the Star Pavilion. Later, after Senior Brother sliced up the holy son of the previous generation of the Star Pavilion, I obtained it."</p><p></p><p>The name of this method is the Great Star Divine Weapon Forging Method.</p><p></p><p>This method is divided into two parts.</p><p></p><p>The first part is great star harvesting.</p><p></p><p>The second part is great star refining.</p><p></p><p>How to harvest great stars?</p><p></p><p>Set up a great star harvesting formation to attract the stars in the sky and capture them!</p><p></p><p>Then trace another formation while simultaneously engraving the method of refining divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>After the stars in the sky are captured and leave their original orbits, they will fly towards the Wasteland. During this period is when the divine weapons are refined, coupled with the friction between the stars and Heaven and Earth, refining the great stars into divine weapons!!!</p><p></p><p>This method!</p><p></p><p>Unimaginable, it is the forging method of the Starry Pearls.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, even if you learn this method, it's useless. Outside the Wasteland, apart from the moon and sun, everything else is just celestial stars that won't be attracted by the great star harvesting technique."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled, his mouth almost curving up to his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>This method!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it created just for him?</p><p></p><p>On the moon, set up the lunar essence formation, no longer needing spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Within the lunar essence formation, arrange the great star harvesting formation, using the lunar essence as spirit stones to capture the stars!</p><p></p><p>How many stars were there outside the Blue Star?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know!!</p><p></p><p>But it was enough for him to forge tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The method of suppressing the physical body with divine weapons was complete. There was no need to choose the Divine Demon Visualization Method, as he could cultivate all the way to divinity, even beyond the divine realm!!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing deeply bowed to Senior Brother Liangxiao before rising.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p>

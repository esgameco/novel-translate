        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Lord!</p><p></p><p>The four Sovereign Lords of the Top Four Families, and the two Deans of the Dragon Cultivation Academy, wielded immense power and controlled the Dragon Nation. </p><p></p><p>The position of the Governor of Jiangnan Province was actually the lowest among them.</p><p></p><p>His vital essence flowed out, transforming into a vast mist that pervaded the surroundings. </p><p></p><p>Weaving his own vital essence, he formed a vital essence domain to protect the safety of the Sovereign Lords and Deans.</p><p></p><p>He stood behind the Sovereign Lords and Deans, scrutinizing Gu Jiuqing in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that the Sovereign Lord Gu had a son, the Young Master of the Gu Family, who rebelled in his youth and fled to Jiangnan Province. </p><p></p><p>Later, the second son of the Gu Family came to the provincial capital seeking the Governor, asking him to deploy troops to attack Linji!</p><p></p><p>He found a few martial artists to follow the second Gu son into Linji, which was his only connection to the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Lord Gu, your son wants to impart the Divine Abilities Technique?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Yan Family and the other two Sovereign Lords seemed bewildered.</p><p></p><p>The Top Four Families were more powerful than the Bottom Four, but the strength among the Top Four was quite comparable, and they knew each other inside out. Divine Abilities Technique? How come they were unaware of such a thing?</p><p></p><p>Even the Patriarch of the Gu Family looked dazed. This unfilial son! Where did he obtain the Divine Abilities Technique?</p><p></p><p>Not far away.</p><p></p><p>Forty-five students from Senior Grade 3 Class 2 stood before Gu Jiuqing, with the upper echelons of Linji City behind him.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding them in a circle were Bai Muqian and ninety-nine Lunar Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Circulating his vital essence, Gu Jiuqing's voice carried as he began imparting the Divine Abilities Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Abilities, Divine Abilities, what are Divine Abilities?"</p><p></p><p>The question arose from the soul: What are Divine Abilities?</p><p></p><p>The people of the Blue Planet had never witnessed such things and dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor, the Head of the Martial Arts Association, Old Master Wen, and the other Linji upper echelons remained silent, as if they had returned to that day in school when they attended Gu Jiuqing's public lecture.</p><p></p><p>A student hesitated before answering, "When one's skills reach the pinnacle, one can communicate with the divine! Teacher Gu, we martial artists cultivate martial techniques. If we cultivate our techniques to the utmost and then take one more step beyond the hundred-foot pole, wouldn't that be Divine Abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing wasn't sure, glancing hesitantly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>With his handsome features and delicate countenance, bathed in the moonlight as if he were a deity from the moon teaching the people of the Blue Planet how to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>This "deity" shook his head and then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What you said is both correct and incorrect. Skills can indeed communicate with the divine, but that is merely a minor technique, a path of techniques that can be considered Divine Abilities."</p><p></p><p>Having spent a long time with Senior Brother Liang Xiao, Gu Jiuqing had gained some understanding of the study of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The path of Divine Abilities is a road leading to divinity. Every Divine Ability is the culmination of a technique, approaching the essence of the Great Way. The strength of a Divine Ability reflects one's depth of understanding of the Way."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing explained clearly.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Drawing Technique was merely a technique and could hardly be cultivated into a Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the true meaning of the Sword Drawing Technique, Gu Jiuqing's technique merged with the Way, allowing him to cultivate the Sword Intent, which was a Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>Above martial techniques were techniques, and above techniques were the methods of the Way and the arts of the Way, which were Divine Abilities!</p><p></p><p>The forty-five students felt enlightened, as if they were in a classroom, students gaining profound realizations.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate Divine Abilities, the first step is to condense the Divine Ability into a seed and plant it on the thirty-third vertebra of the spine, which is the peak of Mount Buzhou."</p><p></p><p>"After the Divine Ability seed is planted on Mount Buzhou, it will sprout and grow into a Divine Ability tree, nourished by one's innate essence."</p><p></p><p>"This tree is the Edifice Wood that can reach the heavens. The more Divine Abilities one cultivates, the taller the Edifice Wood grows, entering the thirty-fourth vertebra, which is the Celestial Terrace."</p><p></p><p>The Edifice Wood reaches the heavens, and the fruits of Divine Abilities grow on it. When cultivating to the Celestial Palace Realm, the Edifice Wood ascends to the heavens, and the primordial essence strikes the Mud Ball Palace, shaping the ten Celestial Palaces where the three hun and seven po souls reside.</p><p></p><p>The closer the Edifice Wood is to the Mud Ball Palace, the faster the cultivator can employ Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>If the Edifice Wood enters the Mud Ball Palace, those Celestial Immortals of the Celestial Palace Realm can manifest dozens of Divine Abilities in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the students expectantly, reminding himself that imparting the Dharma required a step-by-step approach.</p><p></p><p>He would first teach the Lunar Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Ability is called the Embracing Moon Hand!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Jiuqing's grandmaster-level vital essence circulated, transforming his physical body and instantly opening his Celestial Eye to communicate with the boundless moonlight on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Having comprehended the true meanings of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the Sword Drawing Technique multiple times, completed ten Sheddings of Mortality, and experienced two Carefree Wanderings, Gu Jiuqing's talents were unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>The Embracing Moon Hand was merely a low-grade Divine Ability, and he had learned it in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, if he cultivated it that way, it would only be Gu Jiuqing's own understanding.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was for the people of the Blue Planet to gain their own realizations about Divine Abilities, condense their own true meanings, and elevate the Embracing Moon Hand to an infinitely higher level, perhaps even reaching the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>"The Embracing Moon Hand requires absorbing moonlight. You will use the absorbed moonlight to trace thirty-six Lunar Divine Ability talismans!"</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of cultivating the Embracing Moon Hand!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Jiuqing traced the moonlight on the moon into thirty-six strange talismans with intricate patterns.</p><p></p><p>The students widened their eyes, staring fixedly at the thirty-six Divine Ability talismans!</p><p></p><p>These were the most basic Divine Ability talismans, but each talisman had seventy to eighty different patterns.</p><p></p><p>As long as they traced these seventy to eighty patterns with the moonlight, forming a Divine Ability talisman, they would complete one thirty-sixth of the Embracing Moon Hand cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>His talents, honed through repeated tempering, were unparalleled throughout the ages. With casual ease, he condensed thirty-six Divine Ability talismans.</p><p></p><p>Then, these thirty-six talismans merged into a single Divine Ability seed.</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Ability seed is not solidified or nourished. At most, it will dissipate within three days."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked the students of Senior Grade 3 Class 2, "Have you recorded the method of condensing the thirty-six talismans of the Embracing Moon Hand Divine Ability?"</p><p></p><p>The students shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"How many Divine Ability talismans have you recorded?"</p><p></p><p>"I recorded the tracing of three Divine Ability talismans," said a gentle-voiced girl who carried a long sword on her back, representing the literary arts.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing also said, "I recorded the tracing of four Divine Ability talismans."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, we have actually recorded all thirty-six talismans of the Embracing Moon Hand Divine Ability," the class monitor added.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the class monitor.</p><p></p><p>Even the Martial Kings and Martial Sages revealed surprise.</p><p></p><p>They stood by, also observing the thirty-six talismans of the Embracing Moon Hand Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>But with the strength of a Martial Sage, they could only record the tracing of eight Divine Ability talismans!</p><p></p><p>The other students nodded, and the class monitor continued, "There are forty-five of us in the class. We just discussed it, and each person will record the corresponding Divine Ability talisman."</p><p></p><p>"My student number is one, so I'll record the first talisman. With thirty-six talismans, thirty-six people can fully record them."</p><p></p><p>No wonder Yang Miaojing had been whispering with her classmates earlier – they had prepared in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Lords cast approving glances at Yang Miaojing.</p><p></p><p>"Students with numbers thirty-seven to forty-five will record the thirty-six talismans, and we can't just record one talisman each. At the very least, we'll record two talismans. When we return, we can verify with each other and completely transcribe all thirty-six talismans of the Embracing Moon Hand Divine Ability!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>He had thought he would have to draw them again, but Yang Miaojing's approach was quite good, saving him a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ability seed condensed before Gu Jiuqing instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Now I will teach you the Primordial Lunar Laurel Divine Ability."</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Lunar Laurel Divine Ability, also from Senior Brother Liang Xiao's compendium of Divine Abilities, was a low-grade Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Ability required twenty-eight talismans to condense, with fifty-six patterns on each talisman. Its grade was even lower than the Embracing Moon Hand Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>Using his vital essence, Gu Jiuqing manipulated the moonlight to condense twenty-eight void talismans.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of Linji City and the prominent figures from the imperial capital followed the approach of Senior Grade 3 Class 2, with each person recording some of the talismans to obtain the complete Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>Next, Gu Jiuqing taught the Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade, a Divine Ability of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Ability condensed moonlight into the Demon-Slaying Blade, specifically targeting people's spirit souls. For those below the Celestial Palace Realm, if ambushed by the Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade, they would either lose their soul or have their spirit and soul extinguished in the worst case.</p><p></p><p>With the Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade, the Gu Family became a prominent clan in the ancient city of Tianyuan in the northern regions.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade required forty-two talismans, each with ninety-one patterns to trace.</p><p></p><p>Forty-two talismans, each with ninety-one patterns – even for martial artists or grandmasters, it was challenging to record three such Divine Abilities in a short time.</p><p></p><p>But the students of Senior Grade 3 Class 2 took action. Controlling their strength, they used their fingernails to carve the talismans onto their arms!</p><p></p><p>Beads of blood floated and fell onto the moon's surface.</p><p></p><p>Forty-five students completed the talismans on their left...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Arms, draw the right arm!</p><p></p><p>Inscribe all the talisman spells passed down by Gu Jiuqing onto the body, to ensure they are not forgotten.  </p><p></p><p>"These 45 students from Linjiang have the demeanor of future talents."</p><p></p><p>The mayor couldn't help but sigh seeing this scene. </p><p></p><p>On the path of seeking knowledge, exploring up and down, who else could react as quickly as these students.</p><p></p><p>Supernatural Hand Grasping the Moon, Innate Moon Laurel Supernatural Power, Three Yin Demon-Slaying Blade, Toad Spitting Moon Supernatural Power, Tengu Swallowing Moon Supernatural Power, Mirror Flower Water Moon Supernatural Power, Moon Within Yin Supernatural Power!</p><p></p><p>Seven supernatural powers were fully passed down!</p><p></p><p>The left arms, right arms, left legs, right legs, palms and soles of the 45 students were all inscribed with dense talisman spells.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stopped imparting the dharma, he looked at the senior three class two students, and they looked back at him, as if puzzled why he had stopped imparting.</p><p></p><p>Seven supernatural powers!</p><p></p><p>Each supernatural power was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing had never imagined there were such wonderful supernatural practices in this world.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Flower Water Moon Supernatural Power, mirror flowers, water moons!</p><p></p><p>Once the Mirror Flower Water Moon Supernatural Power was employed, one could scoop up flowers from within a mirror in the water. This was the concept of the Mirror Flower Water Moon Supernatural Power.</p><p></p><p>When used in battle, by borrowing lake or river surfaces, one could imprint moonlight on the water's surface, plant moon flowers on the enemy's body, scoop the moon from water, shatter the mirror flowers!</p><p></p><p>If cultivated to the utmost, using the moon as the backdrop, the moon as the lake surface, planting the moon, scooping up the moon, one could kill enemies over a vast area!</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful supernatural power exceeded anyone's imagination.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Gu Jiuqing with hopeful expressions, wanting him to continue imparting supernatural practices.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, these seven supernatural powers have been outlined. Your cultivation is too weak, unsuitable for practicing other higher-level supernatural powers."</p><p></p><p>The 45 students were disappointed, rolling down their sleeves and pant legs.</p><p></p><p>Actually they also knew they might not be able to fully cultivate so many supernatural powers, but they just wanted to gain more knowledge.</p><p></p><p>The four state leaders, two Dragon Institute deans, and the Jiangnan Province head, they all heaved sighs of relief!</p><p></p><p>This Gu family prince had finally stopped imparting dharma.</p><p></p><p>There were too many supernatural practices, they could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>Had this prince brought an entire great sect from another realm?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise where did he get so many supernatural practices?</p><p></p><p>Before they could catch their breath, Gu Jiuqing spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"This session of imparting supernatural practices has ended, now I will impart to you the supreme sword dharma supernatural power."</p><p></p><p>Sword dharma supernatural power?</p><p></p><p>The 45 students' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Drawing technique was impressive enough, right?</p><p></p><p>But it was just a technique.</p><p></p><p>And now Teacher Gu was going to impart the sword dharma supernatural power!</p><p></p><p>"This is the great Mingtingjiandian, the supreme sword dharma supernatural power, able to condense sword intent."</p><p></p><p>"The sword drawing technique you cultivate can at most condense sword force, unable to condense sword intent. But this sword classic is different, it can condense into sword intent, even become a sword immortal."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit flustered too!</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme sword classic of the sword sect, the true profound teaching of the Mingting lineage.</p><p></p><p>If he publicly imparted this in the Wastes, the sword sect would have expelled him long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this is Planet Blue, the sword sect can't possibly know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing consoled himself, gazing at the azure stars drifting in the sky, he slowly said.</p><p></p><p>"Mingting means heavenly court, the main tenets of this sword classic are not many, I'll impart them to you later."</p><p></p><p>"The key to cultivating this supreme sword classic is to condense the heavenly court!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing deeply felt the wonder of the great Mingtingjiandian.</p><p></p><p>"Use sword qi, sword force, sword intent to outline the image of the heavenly court. The more perfect the heavenly court, the more powerful the great Mingting sword intent obtained!"</p><p></p><p>The heavenly court outlined by Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao was exquisite, with ten immortal palaces, four heavenly court gates of east, west, south and north! There were pavilions, towers, the Jade Pool immortal realm, and ancient celestial generals patrolling within the heavenly court.</p><p></p><p>All these were transformed by Liang Xiao's sword qi, sword force, sword intent, plus his own thoughts and the addition of his spiritual power. This was how the great Mingting that Gu Jiuqing saw was forged.</p><p></p><p>When the senior three class two students heard this, their eyes lit up excitedly. So this heavenly court could be shaped by them.</p><p></p><p>Ning Que asked, "Teacher Gu, if I outline the heavenly court in the form of myths and legends, is that allowed?"</p><p></p><p>"The mythical heavenly court rules the three realms as the supreme, with nine hundred and ninety-nine celestial palaces!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, and the Lingxiao Treasure Hall too, can we outline the Jade Emperor within?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Outline the Jade Emperor? Do we need to outline the thirty-three heavens too? And in the highest three heavens live the Three Purities, do we need to outline them as well?"</p><p></p><p>The students chimed in one after another, defining the appearance of the heavenly court.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Fengshen stories? The unified starry realm of the heavenly court has three hundred and sixty-five celestial stars, so can I outline three hundred and sixty-five stars outside the heavenly court, with a deity residing on each star?"</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and sixty-five deities living on three hundred and sixty-five celestial stars, isn't that going overboard?</p><p></p><p>Listening to the students' discussion, Gu Jiuqing fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Fengshen? Pah, you outline the celestial stars, why don't I outline the underworld realms, that's not too much right? Eighteen levels of hell, ten courts of Yama kings, the Naihe Bridge, Caltrops flowers, Rebirth Stones, Meng Po's Broth of Oblivion."</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly court rules the three realms of heaven, earth and man, so it's normal to outline the three realms around the four sides of the heavenly court, right?"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gu Jiuqing finally understood the form they wanted to outline for the heavenly court.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly court itself would be normal, with the four gates of east, west, south and north, guarded by the Four Celestial Kings - Vaiśravana, Virudhaka, Dhrtarastra and Virupaksa.</p><p></p><p>Inside the heavenly court, there would be thirty-six celestial palaces, seventy-two treasure halls!</p><p></p><p>The eight departments of the heavenly court: Thunder, Constellations, Fire, Water, Plague, Wealth, Year Star, Smallpox! Assisting the Jade Emperor in ruling the three realms!</p><p></p><p>There would also be the Three Purities and Four Rulers!</p><p></p><p>The Three Purities reside in the highest thirty-three heavens!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Pure One in the thirty-first heaven, the Jade Pure One in the thirty-second heaven, the Great Pure One in the thirty-third heaven.</p><p></p><p>And this thirty-third heaven is also called the Heaven of Parting from Hatred, the Great Red Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-third Heaven of Parting from Hatred is the highest, with four hundred and four afflictions, lovesickness the most bitter.</p><p></p><p>Around the heavenly court are three hundred and sixty-five celestial stars, with three hundred and sixty-five principal deities residing in celestial palaces.</p><p></p><p>There are also eighty-four thousand stars dotting the cosmos, with celestial soldiers and generals training on them.</p><p></p><p>Below the heavenly court is the Milky Way barring the way, the Silver River of the Nine Heavens!</p><p></p><p>The human realm ruled by the heavenly court is divided into four continents: Uttarakuru in the north, Aparagodaniya in the west, Jambudvipa in the south, Purvavideha in the east.</p><p></p><p>The underworld realm ruled by the heavenly court has six realms of reincarnation, eighteen levels of hell, ten courts of Yama kings.</p><p></p><p>This was roughly what Gu Jiuqing heard from the 45 students.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to transform the great Mingting into this imagined mythical heavenly court!!</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the outline of the mythical heavenly court took shape, but it was just a hollow shell, unable to solidify.</p><p></p><p>This mythical heavenly court was too vast.</p><p></p><p>Incomparably vaster than the heavenly court condensed by Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Even the heavenly court constructed by the Celestial Emperor Ming in the 16th Celestial Dynasty could not possibly be more perfect than this mythical heavenly court!</p><p></p><p>"If I could outline this mythical heavenly court, my great Mingting sword intent might advance to an unimaginable level."</p><p></p><p>As he tempered the great Mingting sword intent, an ancient mythical heavenly court appeared behind him, sword qi undulating, shaking the mythical heavenly court.</p><p></p><p>The might it produced!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could not even imagine it.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Jiuqing finally reined in his wandering thoughts, looking at the students still discussing, he stopped them.</p><p></p><p>He had already imparted the seven Moon Supernatural Powers and the great Mingting Sword Classic, now Gu Jiuqing had one more dharma to pass down.</p><p></p><p>All eyes gathered on Gu Jiuqing again.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Chairman Wu held an Innate Moon Laurel tree!</p><p></p><p>It was a Innate Moon Laurel tree he condensed from moonlight, catalyzed by his own blood essence, with moonlight petals scattering from the tree.</p><p></p><p>The rippling moonlight swept over the distant Moonlit Lands, like a raging wind howling, stirring up the meteorites on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This strike!</p><p></p><p>If unleashed on Planet Blue, it could easily blow away buildings four to five stories tall.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the might of Chairman Wu's Innate Moon Laurel after condensing ten talisman spells!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly dissipated the Innate Moon Laurel, joining the mayor and others behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>This deity!</p><p></p><p>Was going to impart dharma again.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Gu Jiuqing curiously, unaware what dharma he would impart this time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice turned cold and clear.</p><p></p><p>"I need you to go to the twenty-three provinces and four municipalities to impart dharma on my behalf!"</p><p></p><p>Take the Martial Ancestor's place, spread the dharma across the land!</p><p></p><p>These words stunned everyone.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

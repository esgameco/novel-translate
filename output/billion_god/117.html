        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At the Lu Family Manor, the front steps had turned into a massive deep pit. </p><p></p><p>That was the spot where Ji Wangli had just been standing.</p><p></p><p>A bloodied corpse lay motionless in the deep pit, already dead.</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>The entire manor, inside and out, had fallen into silence. </p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd was stunned by this scene before them. After gasping in shock, they finally cried out in dismay:</p><p></p><p>"Ji Wangli! Crushed to death?"</p><p></p><p>"A single strand of hair crushed a minor celestial cultivator to death?" </p><p></p><p>This scene could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed with their own eyes Ji Wangli being crushed by a single strand of hair!!</p><p></p><p>His Hands Grasping the Moon technique shattered, his fleshly arms obliterated - those were not fatal injuries.</p><p></p><p>The fatal blow was his Nine Revolutions Natal Pill being destroyed!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators below the Celestial Realm did not possess the tenacious vitality of those at the Divine Realm. When Lord Junwu battled the Demonic Prince, his Nine Revolutions Natal Pill was destroyed but he still had spiritual power lingering in his Divine Apertures.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were just sealed at their current realms!</p><p></p><p>But Ji Wangli was a genuine sub-celestial cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He died!</p><p></p><p>Died in such an inexplicable way!</p><p></p><p>Even as he perished, he could not believe he had been crushed by a single strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>At the tavern.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's true lineage is quite interesting, betting a single strand of hair to force the Ji Family to back down."</p><p></p><p>"But he made a mistake. Ji Wangli unleashed his full spiritual power, divine abilities and fleshly body, so he gave due respect to the Sword Sect's true lineage disciple."</p><p></p><p>The old man stroked his thinning hair as he gazed across the river.</p><p></p><p>Just a true lineage disciple of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Thinking he could stop the conflict between the two great clans without spilling blood was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>He overestimated himself.</p><p></p><p>But what happened next made this elder stand up, his eyes flickering incessantly. </p><p></p><p>His divine eye flashed, emanating rippling radiance and brilliant interweaving rays of light.</p><p></p><p>When his Hands Grasping the Moon divine ability unleashed its divine radiance to touch that strand of hair, his divine hands were instantly crushed.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight dissipated, the ripples of spiritual power vanished, his divine hands shattered, and then his entire fleshly arm was pulverized by that strand of hair!!</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was his Nine Revolutions Natal Pill.</p><p></p><p>A Nine Revolutions Natal Pill, tempered through thousands of refinings, capable of slaying enemies.</p><p></p><p>But upon colliding with this single strand of hair, the natal pill was instantly crushed.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangli's fleshly body was pressed deep into the ground by that strand of hair, forming a pit tens of meters deep. He was crushed to death by that single strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>The two men stared at each other across the river.</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch gazed in disbelief at the scene, utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Sub-celestial!</p><p></p><p>Among the great clans, that was considered a middle-tier level of cultivation. Above it were the ancestral patriarchs at the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And Ji Wangli, a sub-celestial cultivator only in his twenties, had already cultivated a minor celestial body.</p><p></p><p>A figure like him, joining one of the four great sects, barring any accidents, was destined to become a true lineage disciple.</p><p></p><p>Yet such a person was crushed to death by a single strand of hair from a Sword Sect true lineage disciple?</p><p></p><p>Then what unfathomable realm had this true lineage disciple cultivated to?</p><p></p><p>Even the Ji Family Patriarch revealed a look of terror!!</p><p></p><p>"The paramount of the sword path, the paramount of the sword path has truly exceeded expectations."</p><p></p><p>The old man stared at Gu Jiuqing's figure, the divine light gradually fading from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This true lineage disciple seems to be called Gu Jiuqing. The Sword Sect's true lineage disciple Gu Jiuqing crushed a contemporary genius prodigy with just a single strand of his hair!"</p><p></p><p>Each word from the old man made the Ji Family Patriarch tremble.</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, the Ji Family Patriarch was drenched in sweat, staring at the old man in panic.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry, the plan will proceed as intended!"</p><p></p><p>The old man abruptly exerted force and pulled out all the sparse hair from his head.</p><p></p><p>He used a bit too much force, even tearing off a bloody patch of scalp.</p><p></p><p>At the manor entrance.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan roared with laughter.</p><p></p><p>But the Eight Trigrams Elder of his Nitian Palace did not laugh.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this former Pure Yang Elder who had once existed as two entities was only filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>He had thought Gu Jiuqing would use his status as a Sword Sect true lineage disciple to make Ji Wangli back down out of awe.</p><p></p><p>But now, he realized how ridiculously wrong he was.</p><p></p><p>A single strand of hair crushed a minor celestial body unleashing his full power.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power, divine abilities, fleshly body - all unleashed simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>This was not a sneak attack, but Ji Wangli being crushed while fully armed and prepared?</p><p></p><p>"Years ago, when I debated the Dao with my friend Jiang, a single drop of my blood fell onto Eight Trigrams Ridge and formed a deep pit. Though this strand of Gu Jiuqing's hair cannot match that drop of my blood from back then!"</p><p></p><p>But how long has Gu Jiuqing been cultivating?</p><p></p><p>And what realm is he at?  </p><p></p><p>What realm is this Eight Trigrams Elder at?</p><p></p><p>A single strand of hair crushing a sub-celestial cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Then Gu Jiuqing's entire head of hair, wildly unleashed, could crush any number of sub-celestial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even divine realm experts would be powerless to break through those three thousand strands of azure hair!!</p><p></p><p>Too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand now why you place such faith in this stubborn one."</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, not human!</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>Such a genius has far transcended this world, far beyond this era. A youth deity?</p><p></p><p>Even a youth deity would be no more than this!!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder said nothing, while Lu Yuan took out a small book to record the day's events.</p><p></p><p>[My senior martial brother crushed a minor celestial body with a single strand of hair, displaying the bearing of a youth deity!]</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, what are you spacing out for?"</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't you bring Ji Wangli's corpse into the Ji Family Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice was cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>How powerful was a single strand of his hair?</p><p></p><p>Only he himself knew.</p><p></p><p>Shedding the mortal realm ten times, casting off his remnant shells three or four times, then tempered by the Dragon Elephant Skill, needing divine weapons to suppress his fleshly body, combined with the essence of thirty celestial bodies cradled in the Pangu Divine Body transcending the sub-celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>With his current fleshly body, he had far surpassed the sub-celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Among peers of the same realm, perhaps some could match him in spiritual power, but in terms of the fleshly body, no one could contend with Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangli dared to make a move against the Lu Family?</p><p></p><p>That was the same as making a move against the Gu Family!</p><p></p><p>An invitation to death!</p><p></p><p>If he did not take action to suppress this, in the future anyone could insult and defile Gu Jiuqing as they pleased!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hurriedly retrieved Ji Wangli's remains from the pit, assisted by some Lu Family disciples who carried the remains flying towards the Ji Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Lu Family elders emerged from the manor gates, quickly surrounding the pit.</p><p></p><p>Many more Lu Family disciples waited inside the gates. </p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch waved his hand, then bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"All of us Lu Family disciples shall kneel and pay respects to the one who has attained the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>This was the ceremonial etiquette for followers greeting one who had attained the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The entire Lu Family, young and old, male and female, from divine realm experts to mortal servants, all knelt to pay respects to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>This scene was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family was one of the great clans of Guiyuan City, yet they were becoming followers of this youth, performing the great rites of respect!</p><p></p><p>The elders, the youth, the children, the women.</p><p></p><p>From divine realm ancestral patriarchs to mortal servants, all knelt in respect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded. "You may rise!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Lu Family disciples stand up one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu, please..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan walked at the front, gesturing for Gu Jiuqing to enter the Lu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not stand on ceremony and strode inside.</p><p></p><p>Watching Gu Jiuqing enter the manor, the Lu Family Patriarch turned back to gaze at the deep pit below.</p><p></p><p>There, a strand of hair rippled, the surrounding soil congealing together, apparently absorbing some essence to finally suppress the descent of this strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, condensing spiritual power into rippling streams of energy.</p><p></p><p>The stream of spiritual power he had just condensed abruptly snapped!</p><p></p><p>A divine realm expert's celestial bridges shook, cascades of spiritual power congealed, and only then could this strand of hair be retrieved.</p><p></p><p>He said to the ancestral patriarch beside him:</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Patriarch, take this strand of hair and have it framed. From now on, this strand shall be the symbolic treasure of our Lu Family!"</p><p></p><p>Whose symbolic treasure?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was the treasure symbolizing their connection to Gu Jiuqing, the one who had attained the Dao!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch smiled joyfully. This son of his was truly too brilliant.</p><p></p><p>To actually find such a terrifying being who had attained the Dao!</p><p></p><p>What Celestial Maidens, what Sword Sect Swordsmen, what princes or imperial scions of Great Zhou, could compare to the horror that was Gu Jiuqing?</p><p></p><p>The old man understood the terror of this single strand of hair, and hastily gathered all his spiritual power. Only after receiving this strand did he realize he had still underestimated it.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath his feet sank, burying half his body underground.</p><p></p><p>He smiled awkwardly, emanating a divine radiance from his fleshly body to pull himself out of the pit.</p><p></p><p>"The rise of my Lu Family is upon us!"</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes shone brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Cradling this supreme treasure, he entered the manor, leaving footprints with every step.</p><p></p><p>Even a divine realm expert struggled to move this single strand of hair. The Lu Family Patriarch beamed joyfully as he too stepped through the gates.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"  </p><p></p><p>The gates of the Lu Family Manor closed tightly.</p><p></p><p>The prying gazes vanished, and for a moment Guiyuan City's undercurrents surged.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Lu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sat in the position of the Patriarch, with the Lu Family Patriarch and several divine realm elders seated to his right in order of seniority.</p><p></p><p>To his left sat Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The honored Lord Gu graces us with his presence, bringing immense glory to my humble Lu Family."</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch and elders were brimming with excitement!</p><p></p><p>Their gazes fixated fervently on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>A youth deity!</p><p></p><p>This was a deity in youthful form!</p><p></p><p>If they did not fawn over Gu Jiuqing now, would they wait until after he became a full deity to start fawning?</p><p></p><p>"The venerable elders flatter me. It is my honor to receive the support of the Lu Family."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"He had just joined the Sword Sect, and Lu Yuan escorted him on both sides of the journey. </p><p></p><p>Without Lu Yuan, he would not have traveled this path so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After some small talk, the Lu Family Patriarch took out a large scroll and asked Lu Yuan to submit it to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"We thought the Young Master Gu would not come down the mountain so soon, so we planned to inform you of this matter after you descended."  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took the scroll painting. </p><p></p><p>It was a landscape painted with fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>In the painting, there was a mountain and a river, nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan showed a shaken expression and secretly glanced at his father.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch remained calm. "Young Master Gu travels the world. If there is no opportunity, wouldn't this journey be a waste?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a wondrous realm discovered by my family's Celestial Being Ancestor when exploring an ancient ruin."</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family's heritage is very long.</p><p></p><p>Many opportunities have been preserved and left for later generations to take up.</p><p></p><p>This is one of those opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is the greatest opportunity the Lu Family has had in thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>During the Primordial Chaos era, some cultivators formed a force dedicated to excavating ancient ruins. Among them, three were most famous, known as the First Great Bandit, Second Great Bandit, and Third Great Bandit!</p><p></p><p>The Three Great Bandits made a huge name for themselves exploring ancient ruins. But later, all three disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family's Celestial Being Ancestor discovered the traces of the Three Great Bandits while exploring an ancient ruin.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Great Bandits' cultivation reached the Heavens. To make such a great name during the Primordial Chaos era, they must have at least crossed seven or eight Tribulations."</p><p></p><p>This is the Lu Family's greatest secret.</p><p></p><p>"That Celestial Being Ancestor discovered the three great bandits trapped in an ancient mountain! Calculating the time, the three great bandits have been trapped there for so long that their lamps have run dry."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan picked up the scroll painting and smiled at the Lu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch sighed bitterly, "My family's Celestial Being Ancestor discovered that the ancient mountain was not far from the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord, so he deliberately lured several Celestial Being cultivators to try to break the formation sealing the ancient mountain."</p><p></p><p>But an accident occurred!</p><p></p><p>They all died. </p><p></p><p>This is the truth behind the fallen Celestial Beings outside the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with the Immortal Lord's tomb at all!</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch felt uneasy being stared at by Gu Jiuqing. "Young Master, the Three Great Bandits carried their treasures with them from exploring ancient ruins for many years. I know Young Master needs divine materials to set up formations!"</p><p></p><p>This was naturally something Lu Yuan informed his father about.</p><p></p><p>"I do not know Young Master's intentions, but to provide strategies for Young Master is the responsibility of every member of the Lu Family."</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought about secretly monopolizing this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He was worried Gu Jiuqing would have second thoughts, so he hurriedly pledged allegiance.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, this is exactly the opportunity I need."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took the scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star Moon needs three formations set up - one for harvesting from the Great Stars, one for forging divine weapons. These are consumable formations that can only forge two divine weapons each!</p><p></p><p>But the divine weapons Gu Jiuqing will need in the future number in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>What he lacks most now is not martial arts, but divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>The treasures of the Three Great Bandits from the Primordial Chaos era! If he could obtain them, setting up formations to forge from the Great Stars should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing take the scroll painting, the smiles on the faces of the Lu Family Patriarchs deepened.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master travels the world, do you have a destination in mind?"</p><p></p><p>Traveling the world means journeying through the nine states of the Great Zhou, the four dangerous regions, spreading one's fame and expanding the sect's influence.</p><p></p><p>When a Sword Sect disciple goes out, he represents the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Over thousands of years, the Sword Sect has deeply penetrated people's hearts, known throughout the nine states!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing came down the mountain to travel the world, naturally with the goal of strengthening the sect.</p><p></p><p>"First to an ancient ruin!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong encountered trouble in the ancient ruins, so the first stop is naturally the ancient ruins. If he can resolve this matter, Gu Jiuqing will visit the Jixia Academy to see what it is like!</p><p></p><p>To understand his youthful aspiration.</p><p></p><p>As for hunting the demoness, if he encounters Chu Xiangyu, he will naturally take action.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Lu Family Patriarch nodded as expected.</p><p></p><p>"With Young Master's great talent, contending with the heroes of the world, you will surely stand out!"</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, disciples of the Four Great Sects, the Great Zhou royal family, and even old masters are all secretly competing in the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was within the Lu Family Patriarch's expectations that Gu Jiuqing would go to the ancient ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Many disciples of the major sects have already gathered in the ancient ruins!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing came down the mountain too late.  </p><p></p><p>They arrived at the ancient ruins long ago.</p><p></p><p>"That place near the Great Tomb of the Longevity Immortal Lord is close to the State of You. My Lu Family has an inn in You that has been operating for hundreds of years. When the time comes, Young Master can investigate news about the great tomb there!"</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family has deep roots, being an aristocratic family of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the matter of the Three Great Bandits, the Lu Family naturally arranged intelligence in the State of You.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the Lu Family's Wind Thunder Divine Carriage flew out of Guiyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>This divine carriage was far superior to the Gu Family's - just the wind and thunder dragon horses pulling it were twice as fast as ordinary dragon horses.</p><p></p><p>The space inside the divine carriage was huge, like a courtyard.</p><p></p><p>At the Ji Family Residence!</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch watched the Wind Thunder Divine Carriage fly overhead and breathed a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"That true inheritor of the Sword Sect has finally left!"</p><p></p><p>The bald old man in front of him chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he's finally gone. Now all the Sword Sect disciples who came down the mountain have left the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>Except for Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>But this sword dao prodigy will be leaving soon too!</p><p></p><p>"What's the next step?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the Ji Family Patriarch lay a corpse!</p><p></p><p>This was the corpse of Ji Wangli.</p><p></p><p>The face was completely disfigured, the flesh torn apart. After being crushed by the falling hair, the Lu Family members didn't care, directly moving it to the Ji Residence.</p><p></p><p>The mangled corpse became even more mangled.</p><p></p><p>"Has the ancient teleportation formation in the Ruined City been destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch replied, "It was destroyed long ago. All the ancient teleportation formations in the ancient cities of the Northern Lands have been destroyed, so no outsiders can interfere with us!"</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch deeply appreciated the old man's wisdom.</p><p></p><p>To prevent outsiders from entering the Northern Lands, he even thought of destroying the teleportation formations.</p><p></p><p>They had even set up formations in the Northern Lands in advance, throwing the void into chaos to prevent anyone from using celestial reckoning techniques to detect what was happening in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good!"</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll wait. Once the last true inheritor of the Sword Sect leaves the Northern Lands, we'll take action."</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch was full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>After over a thousand years!</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family would once again ascend to the position of Lord of Guiyuan Ancient City.</p><p></p><p>But the old man still seemed uneasy, asking again,</p><p></p><p>"What about the Sword Sect? How is Sword Sect's Divine Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect has activated their great formation. The Sword Sect Gate is even emanating divine light, it seems the formation sealing the gate has also been activated!"</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch spoke without holding anything back.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic beasts of the Great Wilderness are restless. The Sword Sect still has to fend them off, so they cannot intervene in the unrest in the Northern Lands this time."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm relieved!"</p><p></p><p>The old man's figure shifted, and a large skin sloughed off. To the Ji Family Patriarch's shock, a black mist flew into his body.</p><p></p><p>"Demon..."</p><p></p><p>He only managed to utter one word before the dark mist enveloped his whole body, his aura dissipating as he collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the fallen Ji Family Patriarch rose, a satisfied smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This body is much better than that old man's. But with the Lord of Guiyuan Ancient City dead, the human tribes in the ancient city will definitely be thrown into chaos. I still need to borrow the prestige of the Ji Family Patriarch to suppress them."</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the distance, in the direction the Wind Thunder Divine Carriage had flown.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, soon I'll be able to slaughter the thirteen human ancient cities of the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family Patriarch opened his mouth and devoured Ji Wangli's corpse and the shed skin.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he strode out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Go and summon the Patriarchs. I need to discuss important matters with them in the ancestral shrine."</p><p></p><p>Disciples went to summon the Ji Family Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>In the last ancient city of the Northern Lands!</p><p></p><p>The Ruined City!</p><p></p><p>The Ruined City had the largest population, connecting to the State of Qing, one of the nine states of the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Thunder Celestial Horses stopped in the Ruined City, where there was an ancient teleportation formation leading to the Qing State Capital. Then using the ancient teleportation formation in the Qing State Capital, they could travel to the State of You!</p><p></p><p>However, the ancient teleportation formation in the Ruined City was damaged, so Gu Jiuqing could only ride the Wind Thunder Celestial Horses to fly to the Qing State Capital.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, traveling from the Ruined City to the Qing State Capital, even at the speed of the Wind Thunder Divine Carriage, will take around ten days!"</p><p></p><p>"But in Qing there is an ancient aristocratic family that has an ancient teleportation formation that can reach the Yu State Capital."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Thunder Divine Carriage changed direction slightly, heading towards that ancient aristocratic family!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked out the window at the gradually receding Ruined City, feeling a sense of roaming freely.</p><p></p><p>He!</p><p></p><p>Could finally leave the Northern Lands and enter the nine human states!</p><p></p><p>But why did a bloody demonic aura suddenly rise over the State of You?</p><p></p><p>Was someone undergoing Mortal Shedding?</p><p></p><p>To cause such an abnormal phenomenon, this person must have undergone Mortal Shedding many times.</p><p></p><p>"The Ruined City is indeed a land of talents, bordering the Great Zhou, it's easiest for peerless geniuses to be born there!"</p><p></p><p>"Then let me go and meet these heroes of the world!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p>

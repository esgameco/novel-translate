            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the galloping carriage, Gu Jiuqing sat on the bed. </p><p></p><p>One after another cultivation methods emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Twenty-Two Postures of the Dragon and Elephant Skill!</p><p></p><p>The Art of Unsheathing the Sword!  </p><p></p><p>The Forging Method of the Golden Crow Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>The Forging Method of the Yin-Yang Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>The Opening of the 333 Celestial Spirit Apertures of the Qu Family!</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Slaying Saber of the Three Yin!</p><p></p><p>And the Three Zhang Golden Body Method of Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Soul-Slaying Saber of the Three Yin and the Three Zhang Golden Body Method, Gu Jiuqing had already completely transmitted the rest of the cultivation methods to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"Soon I will be living in the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was full of hope for the future. </p><p></p><p>But within this hope, there was also a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he could safely pass through and overcome the growth period within the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the growth period.</p><p></p><p>This was a term from Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>As long as he safely passed the growth period, Gu Jiuqing's strength would reach an unimaginable height.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time to absorb the cultivation and insights of the people of Planet Blue."</p><p></p><p>For so many days, since returning to the Ancient Abyss City, Gu Jiuqing had not absorbed the cultivation and insights within the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>These were the insights from the rapid development of Planet Blue over the past dozen or so days!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing concentrated his mind and entered the Mud Bead Palace. In an instant, he sensed that Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit was illusory, primordially united. With a thought, various scenes appeared.</p><p></p><p>They were scenes of the people of Planet Blue cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the Art of Unsheathing the Sword, the Golden Crow Divine Body, and the Yin-Yang Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"People have cultivated the Golden Crow Divine Body and the Yin-Yang Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing revealed a look of delight.</p><p></p><p>Good, this was great.</p><p></p><p>Let's see how much his strength could increase this time!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the insights into the Twenty-Two Postures of the Dragon and Elephant Skill poured forth from the Dao Fruit - the insights of the people who cultivated this skill.</p><p></p><p>Golden dragon and elephant forms transformed, with the images of dragon and elephant heads all around. There were also many true dragons and divine elephants intertwining.</p><p></p><p>In total, 770,000 people had cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill!</p><p></p><p>Linjiang City only had a population of 800,000, but 770,000 people cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Just the different insights into the Dragon and Elephant Skill from these 770,000 people, condensed into a new truth, surpassed the total truths that Gu Jiuqing had previously comprehended.</p><p></p><p>The 770,000 people's insights into the Dragon and Elephant Skill formed a new truth that Gu Jiuqing perceived and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the new insight into the Dragon and Elephant Skill?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes were in a daze. This single truth allowed him to increase his original insights into the Dragon and Elephant Skill by several times.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing divided the levels of cultivation insight into three realms:</p><p></p><p>The first realm was Unlimited Elevation - the fastest realm for improving insights.</p><p></p><p>The second realm was the Progenitor Realm, where one could create new cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The third realm was the Truth Realm, where one could comprehend truths, with one truth giving rise to ten thousand truths! One could use this to transform one's innate qualities.</p><p></p><p>And now, Gu Jiuqing had comprehended the truth of the Dragon and Elephant Skill for the second time. Just his insights into this skill had greatly elevated again.</p><p></p><p>Even his understanding of heaven and earth, his knowledge of true dragons and divine elephants, and his perception of dragons and elephants had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>His vision was leaping forward.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's current insights into the Dragon and Elephant Skill, even the progenitor who created this skill would be like an ant before him.</p><p></p><p>"Previously I thought I could become a deity by verifying the way of Pangu."</p><p></p><p>"But now I realize that perhaps I can use the Dragon and Elephant Skill as a foundation to verify the Dao and become an Elephant God!"</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>What is that?</p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's current understanding, he could not accurately describe it.</p><p></p><p>But a deity must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>As long as Gu Jiuqing became powerful enough, then he would be a deity, an Elephant God!</p><p></p><p>His thought touched the Dao Fruit again, and this time it was the cultivation bases of the 770,000 people who had cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill that were leaking into Gu Jiuqing's physical body.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of insights and the pouring in of cultivation bases, Gu Jiuqing's strength underwent an earth-shattering transformation.</p><p></p><p>His blood energy!</p><p></p><p>Golden blood energy instantly burst through his Hundred Meetings Aperture, forming a golden blood energy halo intertwining with the top of his head, like a Buddha's halo or a divine wheel, illuminating Gu Jiuqing!!</p><p></p><p>His five viscera and six bowels were flushed, with rays of divine light undulating, condensing into five deities that stirred the ripples of blood energy.</p><p></p><p>His bones were crystalline, his tendons and vessels like glazed pottery, his flesh and blood containing quintessence, like divine repositories.</p><p></p><p>His new physical body was far stronger than after the seventh Rebirth Transcending Mortality. Rows of dragon and elephant forms manifested behind him - the materialized power of fifty-eight dragon and elephant heads.</p><p></p><p>The materialized power of fifty-eight dragon and elephant heads appeared, causing cracks to form in Gu Jiuqing's body!</p><p></p><p>His body could not withstand such tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>But with the restoration of the Dragon and Elephant Skill's cultivation, his body instantly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The golden blood energy flushed through him, initiating the ninth Rebirth Transcending Mortality!</p><p></p><p>His new body trembled, the golden blood energy...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ripples, lead brilliance washed away, the kiln reappeared once more. </p><p></p><p>The universe was the kiln, the mortal body could also become a kiln!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing's mortal body was like a kiln, outlined by golden vital energy, transforming into an illusory furnace crucible. </p><p></p><p>The vital energy kiln refined the mortal body, the old fetus withered away, becoming a discarded shell.</p><p></p><p>An old skin peeled off, dropping onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's skin was as white as snow, his bones like divine bones, his five viscera resembling divine repositories, nourishing the essence.  </p><p></p><p>And the golden vital energy was still flushing, continuously perfecting the evolution of the ninth Tui Fan (shedding of mortal form).</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish ——————"</p><p></p><p>The dragon and elephant illusory images behind his back were like spring bamboo shoots after rain, protruding one after another, in an instant thirty-three dragon and elephant forces had condensed.</p><p></p><p>"My dragon and elephant force is about to break through one hundred heads!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>He had undergone nine Tui Fans, becoming a sage among mortals.</p><p></p><p>Eight Tui Fans made him a cultivating prodigy, surpassing even celestial talents by a level.</p><p></p><p>Nine Tui Fans, that was a sage among mortals. After another five hundred years, another five thousand years, he would become an ancient sage, able to leave behind his own myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>Allowing his true name to resound through the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>Such a person possessed the innate talent of a supreme sect leader, the demeanor of the paramount sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Able to suppress an entire era, to become the leader of an age!</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish ————————</p><p></p><p>The dragon and elephant forces kept condensing, the dragon and elephant illusory images behind him finally broke through one hundred heads.</p><p></p><p>One hundred dragon and elephant heads danced, each able to move a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing imbued with the force of one hundred dragon and elephant heads could move one hundred mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>Such power was too exaggerated, but this was not the end of the signs from this absorption. An endless stream of cultivation fell, transforming into dragon and elephant force, into vital energy force. Gu Jiuqing's figure was completely enveloped by golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The discarded old skin was flushed into powder by the vital energy, disappearing into the flying horse carriage.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the flying horse carriage had been reinforced, otherwise such a great commotion would have shattered it.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth Tui Fan!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to undergo the tenth Tui Fan."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice was very calm.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he thought grasping the true essence was the limit, surpassing the level of the Progenitors, but now? As more and more people cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Art, he grasped the true essence of the Dragon and Elephant Art for the second time!</p><p></p><p>In the future, Gu Jiuqing could grasp it a third time, a fourth time, a fifth time...</p><p></p><p>The path of the Great Way had no end, just like improving one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many Tui Fans Gu Jiuqing underwent, it was only refining the secret realm of the mortal body, merely preparing for the condensation of the divine body.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth Tui Fan, just the innate talent gained from shedding will allow me to surpass any person in history."</p><p></p><p>At least!</p><p></p><p>In the ancient texts Gu Jiuqing had read, he had not seen any cultivator undergo ten Tui Fans.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme leaders of the four great sects, their publicly known number of Tui Fans had not reached ten.</p><p></p><p>But today!</p><p></p><p>He, Gu Jiuqing, had achieved it.</p><p></p><p>Within this small horse carriage, the tenth Tui Fan descended.</p><p></p><p>With a swish, the force of one hundred dragon and elephant heads instantly doubled, becoming two hundred dragon and elephant heads!</p><p></p><p>Then it doubled again!</p><p></p><p>Four hundred dragon and elephant forces condensed together behind Gu Jiuqing's back.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt this power could burst him apart!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the tenth Tui Fan descended, the newly shed skin had just completed shedding when it withered, falling off his body.</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on the discarded shell.</p><p></p><p>The golden vital energy transformed into a golden furnace, forging Gu Jiuqing's mortal body.</p><p></p><p>It even produced a ringing metallic sound!</p><p></p><p>"No, the dragon and elephant force I've gained is too much, even the mortal body of the tenth Tui Fan cannot bear this power."</p><p></p><p>How many true transmission islands did the Sword Sect have?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know!</p><p></p><p>But the force of one dragon and elephant head could move an entire true transmission island.</p><p></p><p>With his current four hundred dragon and elephant forces, no, now there were four hundred and ten dragon and elephant forces!</p><p></p><p>This immense power could perhaps move the entire Sword Sect's divine mountain!!</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>Two dragon horses flew through the heavens, with a divine carriage trailing behind them.  </p><p></p><p>Steward Xie seemed to sense something, turning his head to look at the divine carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>He saw strands of golden divine light emitting from the divine carriage, along with ringing metallic sounds.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is diligently cultivating, actually doing so even while traveling."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a cultivating prodigy who has completed eight Tui Fans."</p><p></p><p>The carriage continued flying, Steward Xie withdrew his gaze, guiding the dragon horses towards the Sword Sect's gate.</p><p></p><p>I ask for monthly tickets, rewards, ratings, and reading subscriptions every day!</p><p></p><p>Thank you!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The living room. </p><p></p><p>It was rather quiet!</p><p></p><p>Neither of them spoke. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know how to start, he didn't even know this person's identity, how could he speak.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was still immersed in the previous shock.  </p><p></p><p>After a long time, Gu Lao'er looked at Gu Jiuqing whose appearance had changed somewhat and asked, "Nephew! I've finally found you."</p><p></p><p>"It's been over three months, how could you just leave home without a word? What did you quarrel with your elder brother about? Your brother is the head of the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame your brother, these past few months you've been gone were the critical time for your father to break through to Great Sect Master."  </p><p></p><p>"In a few more days, your brother will become a Refining Tao King!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was still speaking for Gu Zixiu's father, "Listen, just go with your uncle now. When your father comes out of seclusion, you can say a few good words and this matter will be over!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing poured some water he hadn't drunk for months into a disposable tea cup and handed it to this uncle.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Capital! The Gu Family!</p><p></p><p>Over three months ago, Gu Zixiu had an argument with his father, the head of the Gu family, for some unknown reason. </p><p></p><p>Then he came to Linji.</p><p></p><p>Why choose Linji? It must have been because he happened to meet Bai Muqian and learned about Linji, so he entered Linji High School and became a teacher.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts suddenly became clear, and Gu Jiuqing smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, what's past is past, I won't go to the Imperial Capital."</p><p></p><p>What would he do in the Imperial Capital?</p><p></p><p>Be someone's son?</p><p></p><p>It's so comfortable in Linji, with a bunch of people revering him like a celestial deity.</p><p></p><p>Isn't everywhere a place to spread the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Spreading the Dao in Linji, he wouldn't be obstructed!</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was stunned, he thought of how insistent Gu Zixiu had been this time.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, if it was before, your uncle wouldn't say much more, but look at Linji now, you don't know how bizarre it is."</p><p></p><p>"Just now, when I entered the elevator, I heard a family of three disciplining their child in sixth grade."</p><p></p><p>"This is only sixth grade, yet he has 0.89 spiritual roots."  </p><p></p><p>"There are also too many martial artists in Linji, you can casually see Sect Masters and Great Sect Masters. Something must have happened in Linji. Once this matter spreads across the country, Linji will become a target for all. It's too dangerous for you to stay in Linji."</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er could already imagine the scene of the whole country attacking Linji!</p><p></p><p>With such an anomaly in Linji, it must have some heaven-defying treasure or even opened a portal to another realm!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't speak and poured himself a cup of plain water.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing unmoved, Gu Lao'er took a sip of water and continued persuading him.</p><p></p><p>"You've been stubborn since you were little, never listening to what others say, this personality is just like your dad's."</p><p></p><p>"But this time is really different. If a portal to another realm really opens, the eight great clans will all contend for Linji City."</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was not disheartened and wanted to keep persuading him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>A portal to another realm?</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, what is a portal to another realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er's expression panicked, he had misspoken.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, first promise me, you must never mention the matter of the portal to another realm to anyone else."</p><p></p><p>"I promise I won't tell anyone else!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er said mysteriously in a low voice, "Let me tell you, I'm only telling you about this portal to another realm, you absolutely cannot mention it outside."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago, spiritual energy was revived. Two hundred years ago, the first Martial Saint title was bestowed. And over a hundred years ago, the secret behind the revival of spiritual energy was discovered across the great ocean."  </p><p></p><p>The secret behind the revival of spiritual energy on Planet Blue?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was curious.</p><p></p><p>The eight great clans of the Imperial Capital really were different, they knew too much information.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er took another sip of water, "Why do I feel there's something wrong with this water?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't dwell on it and continued, "Over a hundred years ago, a Martial Saint across the great ocean discovered a valley had been torn apart. The spiritual energy in this valley was extremely dense. Later, he entered the valley and saw a rift in the void!"</p><p></p><p>This rift in the void was the connection between another realm and Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy from another realm poured into Planet Blue, causing the revival of spiritual energy here.</p><p></p><p>"There are now about four portals to another realm across the globe. The reason Martial Saints rarely appear is because they've all entered these portals to explore the other realm!"</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a portal to another realm will often change the state of the world.</p><p></p><p>If such a portal appears in Linji, the eight great clans, the Martial Alliance, and even countries across the great ocean will enter our Dragon Nation!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart jolted and he quickly asked, "How does the strength in the other realm compare to ours, higher or lower?"</p><p></p><p>Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>Four billion people!</p><p></p><p>This was the source of Gu Jiuqing's cultivation. He had to ensure the safety of these four billion people.</p><p></p><p>On this basis, if he could develop the other realm and absorb its people into Planet Blue, wouldn't that increase his cultivation even more?!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This idea is too terrifying. </p><p></p><p>Forty billion people assisting Gu Jiuqing in cultivation, that's equivalent to one person cultivating for ten million years in a single day! Although the accumulation of cultivation cannot be stacked up like this, regardless, it would become infinitely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>And forty billion people, with the prospect of even more!!</p><p></p><p>Fifty billion?</p><p></p><p>Sixty billion?  </p><p></p><p>One hundred billion? It just depends on how many people are in that world leading to the otherworldly portal.</p><p></p><p>(Drawing a pie in the sky for readers to devour)</p><p></p><p>Why is this kid not scared after hearing this, but instead getting excited?</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er only felt the opposite effect, unable to dissuade Gu Jiuqing, but rather making him more interested in Linji.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the otherworld is naturally stronger than our strength, only those with the cultivation of a Martial Saint can barely survive in the otherworld."</p><p></p><p>What? </p><p></p><p>The otherworld is quite powerful ah, it seems colonizing the otherworld will have to wait until after Gu Jiuqing spreads his teachings for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Jiuqing set the goal of spreading teachings on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>After the college entrance exam, spread teachings to the twenty-three provinces of Dragon Country, then march overseas to the United Nations, completing the spread of teachings on this life-bearing ancient planet.</p><p></p><p>Then, attack the otherworld, conquer the otherworld!!</p><p></p><p>"This time, I won't let you run wild."</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er stretched out his hand, about to grab Gu Jiuqing's arm, wanting to forcibly take him away from Linji.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ling ling ----"</p><p></p><p>The phone rang in the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er stopped, while Gu Jiuqing had already entered the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>The call was from the principal.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah got it."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, I'll be right over."</p><p></p><p>At the bedroom door, Gu Lao'er watched Gu Jiuqing hang up the phone, hesitating whether or not to take Gu Jiuqing away at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took the initiative to say, "The principal of Linji High School called and asked me to go over."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, by the way, the mayor, as well as the chairmen of Linji's three major groups are there too."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, do you want to come along?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't wait for Gu Lao'er to respond, he just left the house, heading towards the elevator lobby.</p><p></p><p>Uncle's appearance disrupted Gu Jiuqing's plan. </p><p></p><p>But the plan cannot be changed because of the Gu Family's appearance.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness is his main stage, Planet Blue is just a place for him to increase his strength, he cannot develop too much attachment to Planet Blue, nor does he want to manage Gu Zimiao's interpersonal relationships.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was startled.</p><p></p><p>The mayor of Linji?</p><p></p><p>The chairmen of the three major groups?</p><p></p><p>Those are the top leaders of Linji, and the decisions they make!</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er saw the elevator door about to close, he hurriedly rushed into the elevator, the Grand Master's figure instantly entering the elevator door.</p><p></p><p>Downstairs at Building 17, the two Grand Masters who had escorted Gu Lao'er earlier were already waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these two Grand Masters, there were also two old men.</p><p></p><p>One of the old men, Gu Jiuqing still recognized, it was Old Man Wen!</p><p></p><p>Standing beside Old Man Wen was an old man with half-white, half-black hair at the roots, as if trying to live out a second life!</p><p></p><p>These were two Martial Kings!</p><p></p><p>When Gu Lao'er came downstairs, he saw the two Martial Kings waiting at the entrance!! </p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, you've finally arrived, quickly get in the car, we've been waiting for Master Gu for many days!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wen was anxious.</p><p></p><p>So much time had passed since the appearance of this deity.</p><p></p><p>If this time, they still couldn't "capture the deity", who knows when the next time Gu Jiuqing would appear.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was in a daze as he walked onto the military truck, he was arranged on another vehicle, together with the two Grand Masters, heading towards the suburbs.</p><p></p><p>The vehicles drove away from the residential area, the whole convoy heading to the outskirts.</p><p></p><p>In the vehicle, Gu Lao'er looked at the truck in front, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Who were those two old men just now? Was the one in black clothes Old Man Wen?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, one was Old Man Wen, and the other was Mr. Qian Yue!"</p><p></p><p>It really was Old Man Wen!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wen, Wen Baikhe! His disciples are all over the world, even among the eight great families there are quite a few who are Old Man Wen's disciples.</p><p></p><p>In this generation of Martial Kings, at least seven or eight are Old Man Wen's disciples.</p><p></p><p>The chairman of the Jiangnan Province Association, the principal of Linji City, are both Old Man Wen's disciples.</p><p></p><p>A person of such status, actually took the initiative to welcome Gu Zimiao??</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be like this, even though his grandnephew is the young master of the Gu Family, he has not yet inherited the position of decision-maker in the Gu Family. Even if he did inherit it, it still shouldn't warrant Old Man Wen welcoming him like this.</p><p></p><p>There's also Mr. Qian Yue, who is also an old person from Old Man Wen's era. Many decades ago, he was hailed as the number one Martial King in Jiangnan!</p><p></p><p>Two great figures, treating his grandnephew with such respect?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Lao'er became suspicious of his grandnephew.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really Gu Zimiao? In just over three months, I almost can't recognize him anymore."</p><p></p><p>The Gu Zimiao in his memory is definitely not this mysterious!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

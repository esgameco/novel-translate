        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The original dantian, under the scouring of the divine power, was constantly shaken open. The three-zhang tall Zhongmiao Gate was enveloped by divine power. </p><p></p><p>Beneath this fully opened Zhongmiao Gate, Gu Jiuqing's thoughts were scoured into a vague form.</p><p></p><p>One breath of time!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths of time! </p><p></p><p>By the third breath of time!</p><p></p><p>This thought took a step and entered the Zhongmiao Gate.</p><p></p><p>The divine power was like a river, as if treading upon the long river of years. Gu Jiuqing directly walked into the Zhongmiao Gate.</p><p></p><p>Infinite and endless!</p><p></p><p>Boundless and unrestricted!</p><p></p><p>Immeasurable!</p><p></p><p>Various profound truths enveloped his entire body, and Gu Jiuqing's thoughts also became increasingly solidified.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Zhongmiao Gate within the Zhongmiao Gate?"</p><p></p><p>This gate was covered in rust stains and looked exactly the same as the first Zhongmiao Gate Gu Jiuqing saw, also three-zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>Around this gate, there was no flow of divine power.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at this gate for a long time before looking at the scene within the Zhongmiao Gate. Apart from the infinite and endless divine power surging into the Zhongmiao Gate and flowing into the dantian, there were no other strange sights!</p><p></p><p>The divine power seemed to appear out of thin air and pour into the dantian!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to take a step forward to observe this ancient gate up close. As he took a step, going against the flow, his entire thought trembled.</p><p></p><p>The vague figure began to split apart!</p><p></p><p>An immense pressure fell down!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly stopped his steps and looked at the Zhongmiao Gate in shock.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can't even get close to the second Zhongmiao Gate!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts dissipated, passing through Buzhou Mountain from within the dantian, all the way to the thirty-fourth vertebra, and surging into the Niyuan Palace.</p><p></p><p>[Xitianji is to release divine power from within the Zhongmiao Gate to strengthen oneself. The more Zhongmiao Gates that are opened, the more divine power can be condensed. I will fully push open the first Zhongmiao Gate! The cultivation realm of divine power should be the first.]</p><p></p><p>[Apart from this, one can also borrow external forces to condense divine power, refining one's vital essence or elixirs and great medicines into divine power. Due to special reasons, I cannot cultivate divine power by relying on external objects. I can only rely on the Zhongmiao Gate or draw in the divine power of the people of the Azure Star.]</p><p></p><p>[The cultivation of the divine power realm is divided into three levels: gaseous, liquid, and solid states. Gaseous divine power in the dantian, liquid divine power in the dantian, and solid divine power in the dantian! Upon reaching the third level, one can condense a Yuandan. The lowest is a one-turn Yuandan, and the highest is a nine-turn Yuandan.]</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked inward at his dantian, and the divine power flowed back like seawater, while others leaked out from the Zhongmiao Gate in strands and threads. He, on the other hand, had an entire expanse flowing out!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's divine power condensed into a liquid state, and he could now attempt to condense a Yuandan.</p><p></p><p>"Has the junior brother not yet accomplished Xitianji? So much time has passed."</p><p></p><p>"Has the junior brother already walked the path of the Fire Demon? If he has walked the path of demonic cultivation, wouldn't this fleshly body be wasted? We should slice it up while the junior brother's fleshly body has not yet dispersed its essence."</p><p></p><p>"It's been ten days now, the tenth day, and the junior brother has still not awakened?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Gu Jiuqing sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Before him, a white-robed young master stared fixedly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we first slice off one of the junior brother's fingers? With the junior brother's powerful fleshly body, it will take no more than three days for him to regrow a finger."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, that won't do. If the master emerges from seclusion and learns that I sliced off one of the junior brother's fingers, he will definitely throw me into the Sword Furnace!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao looked troubled, revealing a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother! You're awake!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao rose from a ten-thousand-year ice coffin and landed before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Wah wah wahâ€”</p><p></p><p>The sound of ocean waves crashing resounded from Gu Jiuqing's fleshly body, the raging billows striking the shore and shaking the entire cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes and smiled at Senior Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"The junior brother has finally accomplished Xitianji!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you really... Why didn't you just tell me the true principle directly? It made me search so hard for it."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao let go of his worries.</p><p></p><p>During these ten days, he had been keeping watch over Gu Jiuqing's seclusion. Now that he saw Gu Jiuqing enter the divine power realm, he also revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, don't talk nonsense. It's not that the senior brother didn't want to tell you the true principle, but the profundity of Xitianji cannot be written down, as it will automatically dissipate. If spoken aloud, it will be inaudible."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Is there really such a profound mystery?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't believe it and directly said, "Xitianji is to release divine power from within the Zhongmiao Gate..."</p><p></p><p>After saying this sentence, Gu Jiuqing didn't sense any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>Why didn't Senior Brother Liang Xiao react?</p><p></p><p>He seemed to not have heard Gu Jiuqing speak.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, were you just verifying it?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao sighed, "This is the profound power of Heaven and Earth. The profundity of Xitianji cannot be transmitted to the world; one can only grope for it oneself."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing finally understood that Xitianji was the true Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Why is this so?"</p><p></p><p>"The senior brother has studied the profundities of Xitianji and the dantian for hundreds of years, but he doesn't understand much about this divine power realm."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's understanding of the fleshly body, spirit, Buzhou Mountain, divine abilities, and divine bridges could be said to be the best in the world!</p><p></p><p>But his understanding of the dantian was not extensive.</p><p></p><p>Because the Zhongmiao Gate was too profound.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether it's demons or humans, once they die, their divine power will dissipate first. The innate essence within Buzhou Mountain or the divine ability seeds on Buzhou Mountain will remain in the world for a period of time. Even the spirit or soul will linger for a while before completely dispersing."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, there was a term called 'hua dao'. This 'hua' refers to one's own magical powers."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing listened as Senior Brother Liang Xiao analyzed, and he described the strange visions he saw after opening the Zhong Miao Gate. </p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, after opening the Zhong Miao Gate, your junior brother saw another gate inside, it seemed to be another Zhong Miao Gate."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" </p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao was startled. "You actually saw the Divine Gate!!"</p><p></p><p>What is the Divine Gate?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Gate is the gateway to becoming a deity."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stretched out his hand, condensing his magical powers to form a series of images within the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>A great mountain appeared in the image, with a vast ocean below it, and a divine tree on the peak that extended into the depths of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Around the great mountain, the stars in the sky manifested, each star shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>The magical powers condensed into a Primordial Pill below the Buzhou Mountain, rushing up Buzhou Mountain unimpeded, flying to the celestial platform at the peak.</p><p></p><p>Then it leapt up, entering layer after layer of heavenly palaces.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Pill split into ten divine souls, residing in ten heavenly palaces.</p><p></p><p>These ten heavenly palaces were exquisitely beautiful, perfectly corresponding to the three hun and seven po souls!</p><p></p><p>Then the images shifted, the ten great heavenly palaces merged into one, becoming the Celestial Emperor's Palace. The three hun and seven po souls all resided within the Celestial Emperor's Palace, condensing into a terrifying primordial spirit form.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit form flew out of the Celestial Emperor's Palace, entering the universe, triggering heavenly tribulations of lightning. After passing through round after round of lightning tribulations, it finally cultivated the primordial spirit into pure yang!</p><p></p><p>Finally, it entered the peak of the tribulation realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the great path of cultivation realms!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao manifested the great path of cultivation realms, explaining the progression of realms with perfect clarity.</p><p></p><p>"After the primordial spirit becomes pure yang, it begins the three-in-one process - pure yang magical powers, pure yang physical body. By comprehending the peak of the longevity realm, one becomes a supreme figure of the Divine Traversing Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"There are many in the Divine Traversing Realm in the world, more than the fingers on one's hands. But those who have seen the Divine Gate in the Divine Traversing Realm are very few."</p><p></p><p>Mortal Realm, Magical Powers Realm, Buzhou Realm, Refining Deity Realm, Heavenly Palace Realm, Tribulation Realm (Longevity Tribulation), Divine Traversing Realm, Deity!</p><p></p><p>This is the complete path of cultivation realms in the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao reminisced, recalling past events.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Gate, I heard about it from that old fellow."  </p><p></p><p>The old fellow he referred to was the Supreme Patriarch of their sect!</p><p></p><p>"One day, the old fellow excitedly came and told me that he was about to become a deity."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Traversing Realm refers to experts close to deities in the mouths of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"He said he saw another gate within his dantian."</p><p></p><p>"He said if he could open this gate, he would become a deity."  </p><p></p><p>"Later, I don't know how many hundreds of years passed, the old fellow said he would open the Divine Gate."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao looked towards the cave dwelling, as if gazing at the Sword Peak where the Supreme Patriarch was.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, so many years have passed, the old fellow is still in seclusion. It seems he has not opened the Divine Gate to attain deityhood."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly looked towards his own dantian!</p><p></p><p>So it turns out!</p><p></p><p>This gate is the Divine Gate, even the Supreme Patriarch has not opened it until now.</p><p></p><p>The path to deityhood has been found again by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao waved his hand, "Very few people know about the Divine Gate. I don't know why you were able to glimpse it, but it's best not to tell others."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded repeatedly!</p><p></p><p>If he encountered another madman like the Second Senior Brother, he would definitely be sliced up.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you have cultivated to the Magical Powers Realm. I will now officially pass down to you the inheritance of our Ming Ting Peak lineage!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao spoke solemnly, his tone grave. Suddenly, a sword intent arose from his palm.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent flowed like water, softly circling his fingers. Then the sword energy transformed again, forming a heavenly palace!</p><p></p><p>Or it should be called a celestial court, with rows of palaces, pavilions and towers, and even immortal ponds and fairy maidens dancing, like an ancient celestial court manifesting in Senior Brother Liang Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Ming Ting Sword Intent!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, I will pass down the Great Ming Ting Sword Intent to you!"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing could be surprised, a divine light emerged from his Nidan Palace.</p><p></p><p>The divine light danced, transforming into a celestial court within the Nidan Palace.</p><p></p><p>This celestial court was even more exquisite than the one manifested by Senior Brother Liang Xiao, with each heavenly palace vividly displayed, and even immortals residing within.</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient primordial era, there were eighteen eras, each with a Celestial Emperor. The sixteenth Celestial Emperor was named the Ming Huang Celestial Emperor. The celestial court created by the Ming Huang Celestial Emperor was called Ming Ting, also known as Ming Ting! The Great Ming Ting Sword Intent derives its name from this."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>He had always wondered why this sword intent was called Great Ming Ting, it turned out to be modeled after the ancient celestial court's name.</p><p></p><p>But this sword intent was rather strange.</p><p></p><p>It felt like it was pieced together, lacking a sense of complete integration, yet it was amazingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate this sword intent is to envision the Great Ming Ting, to envision the image of the celestial court. The more realistic and exquisite the envisioned celestial court, the more powerful the Great Ming Ting Sword Intent becomes!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Ming Ting I passed down to you is the image of the ancient celestial court in my mind."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, everyone's vision of the celestial court is different, so the Great Ming Ting Sword Intent cultivated will also differ."</p><p></p><p>The celestial court left by Senior Brother Liang Xiao in Gu Jiuqing's Nidan Palace trembled, fully manifesting the celestial court image in Liang Xiao's mind.</p>

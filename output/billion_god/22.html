        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>以下是我对这段中文小说片段的完整翻译:</p><p></p><p>等顾九清顺着金桥落入剑门关时,这个地区的北地少年已经离开,飞驰的马车也不见了踪影。</p><p></p><p>只有远处,还有一位老管家静静地等候着。</p><p></p><p>剑门出入严格,非剑门弟子,不得入内。就算是真传弟子,也没有资格带外人住进剑门。</p><p></p><p>"少爷,您怎么这么快就回来了?"</p><p></p><p>谢管家倒是悠闲自在,找了一处避风的山石,准备就此安营扎寨。以他半步炼神境的修为,可以随意开辟洞府,怎么还弄得如此落魄。</p><p></p><p>自从顾九清知晓谢管家的修为后,他对谢管家的看法改变了不少。</p><p></p><p>"师尊还未出关,师兄要去一趟大荒,为我猎杀妖魔蜕凡,宗门还要为我打造真传岛屿,这不一时半会也没地方住,索性下山回家几日。"</p><p></p><p>顾九清是想回家一趟。顾家的六合拳,三阴戮神刀,金乌神体凝聚法,他都未曾观摩。北地少年多半和顾九清一样,一旦他们早早接触修炼法,有了一定修为,如何参加剑门的大考?</p><p></p><p>"进入大荒猎杀妖魔?"</p><p></p><p>大日已经完全沉入天际,黑暗笼罩剑门关。谢管家转身看向远处。在他背后是北地,是人族的天下。在他身前,过了剑门关这一座天险后,就是大荒。</p><p></p><p>入夜的大荒不像白日那般寂静,有未知的咆哮声从远处传来,虽然很微弱,但也能听清楚。甚至有巨大的眼眸,在暗中窥探剑门。整个大荒天宇,时而有幽光泛滥。更有茫茫大雾升腾,比之夜色都要黑暗三分。</p><p></p><p>谢管家感叹道:"不愧是剑门的剑仙啊,入大荒如入无人之境。"大荒在他们眼中,就是禁地。谢管家活了这么久,也未曾踏入大荒半步。</p><p></p><p>"少爷,那我们现在就回天渊古城?"</p><p></p><p>"嗯!"</p><p></p><p>顾九清伸手,巨大的力量在手中绽放,两头龙象之力宣泄!</p><p></p><p>"轰————"</p><p></p><p>这一块巨石瞬间被打崩!</p><p></p><p>"谢老,这一次回去后,你就留在家中,替我和姐姐看好顾家。" </p><p></p><p>"啊?"</p><p></p><p>"谢老,九清已经长大了,现在更是成为剑门真传,这一次回家后,下一次归家不知要等到何时。"</p><p></p><p>"九清有剑门真传的身份在,谢老也不用担心九清的安危。"</p><p></p><p>谢管家使劲点头!是啊,少爷长大了!少爷现在的高度,已经远远的超越了老爷。小姐知晓后,都会震惊。</p><p></p><p>两道身影,一前一后,走向飞驰的马车。很快,两匹龙马腾空,破开夜色,飞向北地的第一座城池。</p><p></p><p>蓝星,市长办公室。</p><p></p><p>【我若是成为这个世界的神,该如何打造蓝星,提升蓝星的维度?】</p><p></p><p>这一句话,高高的挂在桌子正对面,市长抬头就能看到。</p><p></p><p>"我若是成为这个世界的神,该如何打造蓝星,提升蓝星的维度?"</p><p></p><p>"我会怎么做呢?"</p><p></p><p>"要是我成为这尊神,我会怎么做?"</p><p></p><p>"我想不出来啊,我都成为神了,干嘛要提升蓝星的维度?还要打造蓝星?"</p><p></p><p>这对于市长来说太难了。他的武道境界是武王,身份是市长,抛去他的境界,以市长身份他会好好打造临江。但那是神啊!一尊神,无缘无故就来打造蓝星?他想不通,真的想不通。</p><p></p><p>"两天了,顾自修没有一点消息,就像是凭空蒸发了,就连家中那台能上网的电脑,也没有任何动静。"</p><p></p><p>"顾自修,他去哪了?"</p><p></p><p>市长打开电脑,点开临江市政的内部论坛。在这个论坛内,置顶的就是这一句话。</p><p></p><p>【我若是成为这个世界的神,该如何打造蓝星,提升蓝星的维度?】</p><p></p><p>这个帖子下,已经有八千多人评论,游览记录高达一万三千人次,几乎市政员工都游览过一次。</p><p></p><p>有专业人员,发表了自己详细的意见。</p><p></p><p>【我若是成为神,我会从以下三点来打造蓝星。</p><p></p><p>第一点,改变地理环境,妖兽齐聚野外,我们只能生存在城市内,人类可以行动的范围太小了。妖兽和人类不可能和平发展,但若是扩充蓝星呢?将蓝星扩充十倍,百倍?可以将地外的星辰融入地球,再将月亮扩大数倍,形成新的地月轨道。</p><p></p><p>第二点,研究表明,已经探查到暗物质,而暗物质就是灵气复苏的关键,暗物质就是灵气,我若是神,会将灵气注入蓝星!</p><p></p><p>第三点,想要提升维度,就要强大生灵,让我们一步一步】</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Having cultivated to a higher realm, at least breaking through the shackles of a martial sage, continuing on the path of martial arts after a blood change!】</p><p></p><p>These three points had been sent to Gu Jiuqing's mailbox, but after such a long time, this email had still not been opened. </p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu!"</p><p></p><p>Where did he go?</p><p></p><p>The mayor stood up and massaged his temples. </p><p></p><p>He could confirm that Gu Zixiu was definitely within Linjiang. Currently, Linjiang was completely sealed off, no one could leave Linjiang silently.</p><p></p><p>If he was a deity?</p><p></p><p>The mayor smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>That's right, a deity, what could he use to seal him off?</p><p></p><p>"Ding ling ling ————"</p><p></p><p>The landline on the office desk rang.</p><p></p><p>"Mayor!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"The computer at his home has started up, and he's now viewing that email!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu has read for sixteen seconds, seventeen seconds, eighteen seconds..."</p><p></p><p>He finally appeared?</p><p></p><p>This guy who claims to be a deity, you finally showed up.</p><p></p><p>The mayor hurriedly instructed, "Go notify the principal, proceed according to the original plan."</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>They want to have a head-on confrontation with this deity.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, an initial probe into this deity's intentions.</p><p></p><p>At home!</p><p></p><p>In front of the computer, Gu Jiuqing curiously opened his mailbox.</p><p></p><p>Chasing horses across the northern lands, heading to the first ancient city, Tianyuan Ancient City, it will probably take a day's time! Overseen by Steward Xie, the journey will be smooth, no need to worry about anything.</p><p></p><p>He had naturally descended to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Three points of content appeared in the mailbox, answering his search history.</p><p></p><p>"I remember now, because I didn't have the answer to this search, I specifically posted a thread about it. Didn't expect someone would actually answer."</p><p></p><p>"But isn't the internet cut off now? Only people in Linjiang City can access the internet together."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't understand the principle behind this, but he was attracted by this reply.</p><p></p><p>"Expand the Earth! Generate spiritual energy! Spread the Dharma to Planet Blue!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, these are the three most important points. There really are knowledgeable people online."</p><p></p><p>"I'll start directly with the third step, spreading the Dharma to Planet Blue. Although I haven't seen any bottlenecks yet, Planet Blue has limited spiritual energy and limited territory, so it can't accommodate more population."</p><p></p><p>So!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wants to expand Planet Blue, preferably expanding it tenfold or a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>But how to expand Planet Blue?</p><p></p><p>If he truly was a deity, he could simply reach out and pluck the stars, embedding them into Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I'm thinking about it wrong. Expanding Planet Blue doesn't necessarily mean plucking stars and merging them into Planet Blue. I can also open celestial realms and blessed lands on Planet Blue!"</p><p></p><p>Open celestial realms and blessed lands on Planet Blue, creating small worlds in the void.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-two celestial realms, one hundred and eight blessed lands. As long as the celestial realms and blessed lands were large enough, they could nurture, um, they could allow more Planet Blue people to multiply.</p><p></p><p>"And spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>This problem, Gu Jiuqing had thought about it long ago, but he had been busy with the great examination before.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally had time to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>On the first day of the Sword Gate great examination, Gu Jiuqing painted the Dragon and Elephant Art, obtaining dozens of spirit pills, but the medicinal properties of these pills had almost completely disappeared!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing suspected that the disappeared medicinal effects were "stolen" by Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>"My primordial true form seems to be connected to Planet Blue, or is a medium leading to Planet Blue!"</p><p></p><p>As long as he figured this out, Gu Jiuqing could transfer the resources from his cultivation to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>And opening celestial realms and blessed lands, creating worlds within worlds, required void stones. If he could find void stones, he could create celestial realms and blessed lands on Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>"Ding ling ling ——————"</p><p></p><p>His phone rang.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing answered the call.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me! Who is this?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the principal. Where have you been these past few days? Did you run into any difficulties?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Silence on the other end of the phone, then after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Gu, are you free today? Can you come to the school?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to discuss your professional title with you."</p><p></p><p>Are they going to give me a raise?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up. Planet Blue's martial arts weren't strong, but it had many delicacies and cultural streets that scholars loved.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had longed to explore them for a long time, but he didn't have money, which was why he hadn't gone to investigate them thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be right there!"</p><p></p><p>Snap!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood up and walked out the door.</p><p></p><p>In the principal's office, a group of bigwigs looked at the principal.</p><p></p><p>"What did he say? What did that person say?"</p><p></p><p>The principal looked at the hung up phone, then said after a moment:</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu is coming right away!"</p><p></p><p>"That fast?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he being too hasty?"</p><p></p><p>"We're not prepared at all."</p><p></p><p>"Stay calm. If this deity doesn't want to reveal his identity, then we'll pretend we don't know about this matter. We'll make contact with this deity first before drawing any conclusions!"</p><p></p><p>Today is much better, no accidents tomorrow will start making up for missed releases!</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for still reading the book.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

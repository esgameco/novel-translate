        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The primordial divine abilities of the Yin-Yang Divine Body are not limited to the Wandering Transcendence, but undoubtedly, the Wandering Transcendence is absolutely the most powerful primordial divine ability of the Yin-Yang Divine Body. </p><p></p><p>Apart from the Wandering Transcendence, after comprehending the quintessence of the Yin-Yang Divine Body cultivation method, Gu Jiuqing also obtained the Yin-Yang Vase Seal!</p><p></p><p>By grasping the Yin-Yang Vase Seal in his hand, he could summon the Great Dao Vase condensed from the principles of the Great Dao of Yin and Yang. Inside the Great Dao Vase contained the Yin and Yang energies, capable of piercing through a cultivator's physical body!</p><p></p><p>This was a formidable killing technique, ranking extremely high among divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The Qu Family from the ancient Tianyuan City has existed for an extremely long time, and that great ancestor of the Qu Family was an elder of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"He also cultivated the Yin-Yang Divine Body. I wonder if he mastered the Wandering Transcendence and the Yin-Yang Vase Seal!"</p><p></p><p>The Wandering Transcendence allowed one to roam the vast cosmos. With a single thought, one could ascend to the highest heavens or descend into the deepest underworld.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability and technique could elevate one's perspective and deepen one's mental state. Although it lacked the intent to kill, it was most suited for cultivating the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin-Yang Vase Seal, it condensed the Great Dao Vase, with the Yin and Yang energies capable of slaughtering heaven and earth, stirring the pure and turbid energies. It was an undisputed killing divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Adding the Golden Crow Divine Flames, Cursed Slaughter, and Rainbow Transformation Arts from the Golden Crow Divine Body, Gu Jiuqing now possessed five primordial divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Five primordial divine abilities, requiring no cultivation resources or physical body to activate, only a powerful primordial foundation!"</p><p></p><p>The primordial foundations of both the Golden Crow Divine Body and the Yin-Yang Divine Body had covered the sixth vertebra.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting closer, it's getting closer. This is just the cultivation of 800,000 people in Linjiang. If the divine body cultivation methods are spread to Jiangnan Province, with a population of nearly 100 million!"</p><p></p><p>In the country where Gu Zixiu resided, there were a total of twenty-three provincial capitals! Jiangnan Province was just one of them.</p><p></p><p>After the blockade in Linjiang ended, Gu Jiuqing would personally transmit the methods to each province, using an entire province as a unit, helping them cultivate the divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed his eyes, his thoughts intertwining, and it took three hours before the aftereffects of the Wandering Transcendence finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time to guide the Dragon Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was solemn. These two cultivation methods were the most fundamental, with the most cultivators in Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Almost the entire city of Linjiang was cultivating them!</p><p></p><p>This was also the foundation of Gu Jiuqing's strength.</p><p></p><p>In the Niunan Palace, within the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The insights gathered from the Dragon Elephant Skill flowed like water, with golden liquid spreading beneath the Dragon Elephant's feet.</p><p></p><p>This illusory Dragon Elephant had become real, with numerous insights hanging above it.</p><p></p><p>Incessantly, countless insights converged and were devoured by the golden Dragon Elephant.</p><p></p><p>With nearly 800,000 people cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill, their various insights gathered within the Dao Fruit, mutually verifying each other, discarding the false and retaining the true, thus obtaining the genuine Dragon Elephant insights.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing touched the Dao Fruit and plucked one of the Dragon Elephant insights.</p><p></p><p>The insight was instantly absorbed by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The memories of the twenty-two forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill were awakened. Within the divine ability cultivation room, Gu Jiuqing stood up and performed this fundamental martial art.</p><p></p><p>The first form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Traversing the Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The second form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Uprooting Divine Mountains!  </p><p></p><p>The third form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Elephant Treading the Void!</p><p></p><p>His figure transformed into a divine elephant, treading the void and standing firmly in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>That was his physical body defying gravity!</p><p></p><p>Without any circulation of vital energy, without activating any apertures to connect with heaven and earth, and without the guidance of spiritual power, he simply stood in the void.</p><p></p><p>The seventh form of the Dragon Elephant Skill! Elephant Transcending Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the void, heaven and earth vanished in an instant as Gu Jiuqing became the master of the realm, his mental state abruptly soaring, nearly condensing into the Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>The eighth form, No Laws, No Phenomena!</p><p></p><p>The divine elephant disappeared, his true form dissipating as Gu Jiuqing's figure vanished from the realm of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He was like a ghostly specter, treading the void and causing ripples to spread.</p><p></p><p>The ninth form of the Dragon Elephant Skill was the True Dragon Form!</p><p></p><p>Dragon Soaring the Four Seas!</p><p></p><p>The ripples in the void were surrounded by true intent, transforming into the four great seas of east, south, west, and north, enveloping Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>His figure wavered, transforming into the image of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>The tenth form, the eleventh form, the twelfth form, all the way to the sixteenth form, the Celestial Dragon.</p><p></p><p>A five-clawed golden dragon came to life, as if a true dragon had descended into the world, soaring through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"The true dragon, the golden crow, the divine elephant, they were all legends from the ancient era, unseen in recent times."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivator who created the Dragon Elephant Skill had only witnessed the true dragon and elephant, deriving the true dragon and divine elephant forms by observing them. Therefore, from the first to the sixteenth forms, they were all illusory manifestations, created from nothingness!"</p><p></p><p>Just the ability to defy gravity with his physical body already surpassed the cultivator who created the Dragon Elephant Skill by dozens or even hundreds of times!</p><p></p><p>As for the insights of "Elephant Transcending Heaven and Earth" and "No Laws, No Phenomena," even if that creator of the Dragon Elephant Skill was still alive and allowed to cultivate for hundreds or thousands of years more, he might still be unable to comprehend such profound insights!</p><p></p><p>The same applied to the eight forms of the True Dragon!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure did not stop, continuing to perform the seventeenth form.</p><p></p><p>From the seventeenth to the twenty-second forms were the combined striking techniques of the Dragon and Elephant, but for Gu Jiuqing, the gains were meager, even less than the insights gained from a single form like the True Dragon Form or the Divine Elephant Form!</p><p></p><p>After performing all twenty-two forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill, this insight had been completely comprehended by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Absorb.</p><p></p><p>The thought touched again, and the second truth of the Dragon Elephant Skill was plucked. </p><p></p><p>Then the third, fourth, fifth truths!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to devour four truths of the Dragon Elephant Skill all at once.</p><p></p><p>This enlightenment was too concentrated, flushing his Niwan Palace, flushing his thoughts, flushing his soul!</p><p></p><p>Even his physical body was trembling!</p><p></p><p>Wala la————  </p><p></p><p>Wawa——————</p><p></p><p>The huge waves surged, flushing the Niwan Palace, Gu Jiuqing's face instantly turned pale!</p><p></p><p>But he forcibly withstood this repeated flushing.</p><p></p><p>The truths melted, Gu Jiuqing's figure swayed, he transformed into a true dragon, into a divine elephant, evolving into a dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>Traveling through the air, formless and imageless, the five-clawed golden body of the divine dragon had an otherworldly appearance. The four seas rose in peace, the hidden dragon emerged from the abyss, all kinds of dragon elephant truths one by one appeared on Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>"It's now!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the Dao fruit, inheriting the cultivation of the Dragon Elephant Skill from 800,000 practitioners!</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the Dragon Elephant Skill reached a terrifying height, plucking truth after truth, comprehending all kinds of dragon elephant meanings.</p><p></p><p>Taking it one step further from the brink, he might step into the fourth realm!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was transmitted down, like a floodgate opening, the surging torrent flushed his flesh, condensing into dragon elephant forces one after another.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of dragon elephant figures instantly condensed behind Gu Jiuqing's back, followed by hundreds, two hundreds, three hundreds, four hundreds!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's hair stood on end, rooting in the void. He was like a deity or demon, the dragon elephant forces danced in the air, and the five hundred dragon elephant figures coiling around his spine all flew out together, hanging high behind his back!</p><p></p><p>It was a thousand dragon elephant figures swirling together, densely packed, their golden divine light forming waves, instantly condensing into a majestic force.</p><p></p><p>This was only the condensation of the dragon elephant forces.</p><p></p><p>On Gu Jiuqing's Buzhou Mountain, the origin of the dragon elephant divine body surged. Starting from the first vertebra, it instantly climbed up to the sixth, then rushed up the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh!</p><p></p><p>All the way up to the fifteenth vertebra, it finally stopped!</p><p></p><p>The origin of the dragon elephant divine body clung to the spine, the profound virtue of Buzhou Mountain bearing all things, its weighty aura scattered, suppressing the fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>The three divine weapons standing on the thirty-third vertebra rippled, emanating strands of divine light.</p><p></p><p>One thousand one hundred dragon elephant forces!</p><p></p><p>One thousand two hundred dragon elephant forces!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's dragon elephant forces were still climbing, the majestic power gathering on his body. Gu Jiuqing was exhilarated, he raised one finger and stabbed it into the floor tiles of the Spirit Cultivation Room.</p><p></p><p>With one finger strike, he easily pierced through it, as if the tiles were made of tofu, offering no resistance at all, crushing everything in its path, the entire finger sank in completely!!</p><p></p><p>"Dung dung dung————"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>What was that sound?</p><p></p><p>On the spine, that Dragon Tiger Bell rang out, activating the spirit patterns on its surface one by one.</p><p></p><p>"One, two, there are fifteen spirit patterns activated!"</p><p></p><p>"Because the three divine weapons cannot suppress my fleshly body, the divine weapons automatically operate to suppress my fleshly body?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes saw the three divine weapons on Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Celestial Pearl, the Bronze Cauldron and Dragon Tiger Bell were both emanating divine light, already activated.</p><p></p><p>The two divine weapons activated fifteen spirit patterns, constantly suppressing Gu Jiuqing's fleshly body, preventing it from collapsing.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the divine weapons might disintegrate!"</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons operating constantly would inevitably crumble one day.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Gu Jiuqing would need to replace them with thousand-pattern divine weapons later!</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to learn weapon refining myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Wala la——————"</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing had this thought, the Celestial Pearl was also activated, its spirit patterns blossoming, brilliant starlight scattering from the peak of Buzhou Mountain, illuminating Gu Jiuqing's fleshly body like glass!</p><p></p><p>The dragon elephant forces slowly rose, and after more than an hour, they finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>In total, there were two thousand two hundred dragon elephant forces swirling behind Gu Jiuqing's back, each with the power to move mountains.</p><p></p><p>They could easily carry away the true transmission island of the Sword Gate sect!</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, all the dragon elephant forces returned to Buzhou Mountain, coiling motionlessly on his spine.</p><p></p><p>"I feel an unprecedented power gathering on my body!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Spirit Cultivation Room, Gu Jiuqing's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his hands.</p><p></p><p>These jade-white, slender hands, with a thought, his five fingers instantly turned golden.</p><p></p><p>A strand of great terror came from the five fingers, and in the end, only the index finger still contained the golden divine light.</p><p></p><p>It was the force of two thousand two hundred dragon elephants, all condensed on this one finger!!</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this finger could pierce and kill even a Refining God realm expert!!"</p><p></p><p>Begging for readings on Monday and Tuesday, please!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Demonic aura formed clouds, brazenly interweaving in the air. </p><p></p><p>This scene could never be witnessed within the nine states of the human realm, only in the Great Wilderness could one see it.</p><p></p><p>And Lu Yuan was the young patriarch of the Lu Family, having entered the Great Wilderness only a countable number of times. </p><p></p><p>He didn't even know how many miles the Sword Gate Pass was, let alone witness so many demons gathering.</p><p></p><p>In the past, if he saw such a scene, he would have turned around and left immediately.</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>He wielded his sword aura, soaring into the air, flying towards the demon army.</p><p></p><p>"Have you gone crazy? Kid, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, this old man used your Eight Trigrams Divine Eye to take a look at the Demon Prince, and this Demon Prince has at least passed through five levels of thunderbolt tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what the concept of five levels of thunderbolt tribulation is?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know anything, let this old man tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Passing through one level of thunderbolt tribulation can condense one pure yang thought; two levels, two pure yang thoughts; three levels, four pure yang thoughts; four levels, eight pure yang thoughts; five levels, sixteen pure yang thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>"Eight pure yang thoughts can condense into a refined spirit, activating divine abilities. With the pure yang aura, the power can increase several times!"</p><p></p><p>"And sixteen pure yang thoughts can independently form a strand of pure yang spirit. A strand of pure yang spirit can fly through the heavens and earth, break the laws of the world, escape all things. With just a thought, you will all die!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder was anxious.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't watch his only disciple go to his death.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Yuan died, who would inherit his legacy?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan acted as if he didn't hear, riding his sword flying. From afar, he saw a Sword Immortal standing not far from the demon army, waiting to receive him.</p><p></p><p>That was the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>One of the three sword masters of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Did you see?</p><p></p><p>This was one of the three sword masters! In the past, being able to say a word to the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal would have been impressive.</p><p></p><p>But now, this Sword Immortal was personally welcoming him!</p><p></p><p>Passing by the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal, Lu Yuan saw that "cultivator" standing on the deck of the Moon Spirit Ship.</p><p></p><p>He was dressed in white robes, with a calm expression, extraordinary demeanor. Without a hint of anxiety, he was instead at ease, facing the demon army with full confidence!</p><p></p><p>That was Senior Martial Brother Gu!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan believed that Senior Martial Brother Gu must have a trump card to defeat the Demon Prince, so he was truly fearless.</p><p></p><p>With sword aura filling the sky, in just a few breaths, he landed beside the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"This stubborn one! What is this stubborn one doing?"</p><p></p><p>On the Moon Spirit Ship, one person stood alone, facing the demon army, facing that Demon Prince who had at least passed through five levels of thunderbolt tribulation, yet this stubborn one showed no sign of panic.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he wore a smile, locking eyes with the Demon Prince!!</p><p></p><p>Such extraordinary demeanor reminded him of an old friend.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps even that old friend would not dare to do this."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xiaoyou would only act when he had absolute certainty. If he only had the stubborn one's cultivation, he would probably turn and run, not stand on the Moon Spirit Ship.</p><p></p><p>"This might be the true genius of the human race!"</p><p></p><p>That day, a young man stood on the spirit ship, standing out boldly, leaving a deep impression on the Eight Trigrams Elder.</p><p></p><p>Below the demon army, the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal's scalp went numb. Seeing Lu Yuan ride his sword over, his expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid this inner disciple would be too scared to show up.</p><p></p><p>How was this inner disciple not nervous at all?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he see those demons in front of him?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood beside the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal, after landing on his sword aura, and bowed to him.</p><p></p><p>"Inner disciple Lu Yuan pays respect to the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal was speechless. Was this really the time for such formalities?</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked towards the demon army ahead.</p><p></p><p>Two Celestial Realm demons occupied the vanguard, their huge bodies very conspicuous among the demon army.</p><p></p><p>And that Demon Prince had transformed into a human-sized form, standing between the two Celestial Realm demons.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan pointed at the Demon Prince and asked, "Senior Martial Brother Fierce Sun, that must be the Demon Prince, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stared at the Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>This Prince was getting goosebumps from Lu Yuan's stare, lowering his gaze to look at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was unfazed, raising his brows.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, does the Demon Prince want to make a move against this little me?"</p><p></p><p>Gasp!</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal and the Eight Trigrams Elder from the Mud Pill Palace were both chilled.</p><p></p><p>This guy!</p><p></p><p>So brazenly audacious!</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such arrogance.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's mouth twitched, wanting to slap this human to death.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't act.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that the moment he made a move, he would expose a flaw.</p><p></p><p>That madman was still staring at him.</p><p></p><p>"After this madman appeared, even the Sword Sect disciples have become arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"In the Sword Sect, this madman's status is very high!"</p><p></p><p>No less than his own.</p><p></p><p>He was also looking for flaws in the white-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>How strange!</p><p></p><p>This white-robed madman, standing on the Moon Spirit Ship, was full of openings.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was seamless, but not wrapped in pure yang energy. If his pure yang thoughts flew out, they could break through his body and strike his Spiritual Mountains, Celestial Towers, Divine Apertures, and Celestial Realms!</p><p></p><p>And that Celestial Court, although very complete, lacked profound sword intent, only initially taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, that Nether Pagoda was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>The divine patterns on it numbered only in the thousands, but the pearl, body, and base, with the dragon and tiger carvings, were all rather strange, as if the divine weapon was refined from a physical body.</p><p></p><p>He was probing the Nether Pagoda, which was why he had not made a move yet.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal had been standing there for a while. He cleared his throat and spoke tremblingly towards the demon army.</p><p></p><p>"That so-called true cultivator named Ting Feng, quickly hand over my Sword Sect's disciple Xia Qingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Gathering his energy, his voice carried into the heavens. The demon army roared with laughter.</p><p></p><p>Did they hear wrong?</p><p></p><p>This human actually still wanted them to hand over the female cultivator?</p><p></p><p>An eight-zhang demon held up Xia Qingzhou, stuffing the torn-off arm into his mouth, chewing it up and swallowing the crushed arm into his belly.</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal's face was unsightly.</p><p></p><p>These demons were treating him like a clown, humiliating him in such a way!</p><p></p><p>But he was helpless. However, Lu Yuan by his side could not stand for this.</p><p></p><p>His figure shot into the sky, the origin of his Spiritual Mountain rippling, his entire body radiating divine light.</p><p></p><p>"You demons, did you not hear what my Senior Martial Brother just said?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Ting Feng told you to hand over my Sword Sect's disciple. So you should obediently hand over the Sword Sect disciple. Or do you want my Senior Martial Brother to personally take action and demand her return?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let's see if you dare!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was not pretending!</p><p></p><p>This was his genuine reaction.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Gu Jiuqing specifically asked the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal to have Lu Yuan take the lead at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Yuan could control the situation now.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after these words, the demon army did not dare make a sound. That eight-zhang demon kept glancing at the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>But the Demon Prince did not respond to him, so this eight-zhang demon became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Prince? What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly asked!</p><p></p><p>That madman!</p><p></p><p>If he could not be subdued, the next one to be sliced might be him.</p><p></p><p>"Why haven't you handed over my Sword Sect disciple yet? I'll go ask my Master to take action!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan would not indulge these demons.</p><p></p><p>With sword aura filling the sky, he stepped onto his flying sword in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Crossing several miles in just a few moments.</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal wanted to cry but had no tears. How did this guy fly onto the Moon Spirit Ship?</p><p></p><p>Leaving him alone to face the demon army?</p><p></p><p>On the Moon Spirit Ship, Lu Yuan held the Supreme Unity Divine Sword, standing opposite Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He bowed to Gu Jiuqing and said fiercely,</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, did you see that? These demons are truly audacious, not even taking your words to heart."</p><p></p><p>"In the future when you travel the world, will the demons not end up riding on your head?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan did not transmit his voice, so the demon army heard his words.</p><p></p><p>The demons were horrified!</p><p></p><p>How did it come to them riding on the human madman's head?</p><p></p><p>They dared not!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly, looking at the Demon Prince, "So I still need to personally demand her return?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince stared at the Nether Pagoda, then at the sword case in Lu Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>The Nether Pagoda was peculiar, and this sword case was also unmatched!</p><p></p><p>At least these were two great treasures, possibly supreme treasures!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince laughed out loud and slapped the eight-zhang demon beside him.</p><p></p><p>The eight-zhang demon was slapped into disarray, his demonic aura in chaos. The celestial realms shook, and he coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"Still not releasing the Sword Sect's senior disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The eight-zhang demon dared not neglect, quickly removing the seals on Xia Qingzhou.</p><p></p><p>A female cultivator was seen, walking with one arm missing, clothes in tatters, step by step towards the Fierce Sun Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Sun Sword Immortal was astonished.</p><p></p><p>The demons actually released her.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly stood up and flew with Xia Qingzhou back to the Moon Spirit Ship.</p><p></p><p>On the Moon Spirit Ship, that white-robed youth saw this and also sat down on the deck.</p><p></p><p>Facing the demon army, he closed his eyes, expressing an indescribable grace and ease.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood behind Gu Jiuqing, glaring angrily at the demon army before him, completely unafraid of these demons.</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by, and under the Demon Prince's lead, the demon army did not advance a single step.</p><p></p><p>While this Demon Prince stared unblinkingly at the Nether Pagoda on Gu Jiuqing's body and the Supreme Unity Divine Sword, trying to gauge the power of these two divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The last time Jiang Buyu set foot in the Great Wilderness, he killed the Seventh Prince, and that Protector was also killed by him!"</p><p></p><p>"That Protector's strength was not bad, having passed through two tribulations of lightning, but with one strike, he was slain by Jiang Buyu." </p><p></p><p>"Even I cannot accomplish the feat of slaying a Heavenly Demon who has passed through two tribulations of lightning with one strike."</p><p></p><p>"But Jiang Buyu's strength cannot possibly be stronger than mine. If he were stronger than me, with his personality, he would have already acted to slice me into pieces long ago."</p><p></p><p>"He should be weaker than me, so what level has Jiang Buyu cultivated to?"</p><p></p><p>An unknown enemy is the most terrifying!</p><p></p><p>This was the reason holding back the Demon Prince's advance.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere on the Moon God Ship was rather strange!</p><p></p><p>The sword disciples were oblivious to their surroundings, swallowing and exhaling moonlight, or cultivating moon divine abilities. </p><p></p><p>But the effects they obtained were minimal.</p><p></p><p>Their minds were not focused!</p><p></p><p>Pretending?</p><p></p><p>They wanted to pretend to be oblivious, but the path of cultivation requires concentrated mind and spirit. Too many distracting thoughts are detrimental to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the front of the deck, where that white-robed senior brother had truly achieved the state of mind without distractions.</p><p></p><p>He had already begun cultivating.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the Taiyi Sword case being carried by Lu Yuan opened by itself.</p><p></p><p>Rays of light blossomed forth, and a divine sword emerged today.</p><p></p><p>The sword's aura was inextinguishable, the sword's light was inextinguishable. The attribute of the Taiyi Gengjin Imperishable Metal was too strong. Even after being sacrificed for four thousand years, its attribute remained undiminished.</p><p></p><p>Ripples of the divine sword entered the fleshly body, then landed on Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>After nearly a month of sacrificial refinement, and using the sword manual specifically for refining the Taiyi Divine Sword from the Lu Family, this supreme divine sword was finally refined by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>A half-step great weapon, falling on the peak of Buzhou Mountain, the inextinguishable ripples of its attribute suppressed the Xingzhu Pearl, the Dragon and Tiger Bell, the Bronze Cauldron, and the Divine Wheel divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The other divine weapons did not dare to contend with the Taiyi Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's divine soul was sculpted in the Mud Pill Palace, his divine soul towering tall. The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor was examining the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Jiuqing prepared to fully assimilate the cultivation comprehension within the Dao fruit into himself.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Divine Sword, the Yin Floating Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>These two divine weapons, not inferior to great weapons, could suppress his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Dao fruit's realm opened, and the scenes of the Unsheathing Sword Art appeared.</p><p></p><p>Eight million people in Linjiang cultivated the Unsheathing Sword Art, allowing Gu Jiuqing to gain nine parts of the sword intent. Now, with people in twenty-three provinces and five capital cities cultivating the Unsheathing Sword Art!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not dare imagine how much the sword intent could reach.</p><p></p><p>One scene after another flowed by, one flying sword after another mutually testifying, the intent to slay the heavens becoming the most solidified, devouring the other sword intents into the intent to slay the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul plucked the true meanings of the Unsheathing Sword Art from the Dao fruit one by one.</p><p></p><p>There were twenty-three true meanings of the Unsheathing Sword Art!</p><p></p><p>The Unsheathing Sword Art was very basic, unsheathing the sword, drawing out the sword, also unsheathing and slashing with the sword in one move.</p><p></p><p>Many people cultivated this sword art, at least eight out of ten people in each province would cultivate the Unsheathing Sword Art! That was the cultivation comprehension of eight hundred million people in the ten billion Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Some people unsheathed the sword three hundred times a day, some eight hundred times, and the diligent ones over a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>There were adults and children, even kindergarten kids started cultivating the Unsheathing Sword Art!</p><p></p><p>It was a unique comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Planet was too focused on cultivation. As long as they didn't enter cities, they generally wouldn't encounter danger, not worrying about food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>Educating children became the focus of most parents.</p><p></p><p>Kindergarten kids, only four or five years old, had already set foot on the path of sword cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable how brilliant the Blue Planet would become in eight or ten years!!</p><p></p><p>That was truly the cradle of the sword path, the homeland of sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three true meanings, from twenty-three provinces.</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the Unsheathing Sword Art condensed by each province was different. The sword cultivators of Jiangnan Province were sharp, their swords rising steadily, drawn out incisively, each slash containing immense might.</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators of Jiangdong Province were steady, three hundred sword swings, effortless and skillful, passing through steadily.</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators of Jiangbei Province, one sword competing with the next, the three hundredth sword far more sharp than the previous two hundred and ninety-nine.</p><p></p><p>Various comprehensions assailed his mind. The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit figure swelled, from one person tall to the height of a zhang, two zhang, three zhang, four zhang, five zhang, six zhang! Still continuing to grow.</p><p></p><p>Within Buzhou Mountain, the origin suddenly manifested, filling in the missing vertebrae one by one.</p><p></p><p>Thirty kinds of divine bodies, almost one province cultivating one kind, the vast origin descended, and Gu Jiuqing only felt himself being filled up!!</p><p></p><p>On Buzhou Mountain, thirty kinds of divine bodies arose side by side, breaking through the vertebrae, directly filling the thirty-three vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>Thirty kinds of origins rose from the ground, fusing into the wooden building condensed from the Dragon Elephant origin, each divine ability fruit bud sprouting, those were the origin divine abilities of the thirty divine bodies, condensing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor divine soul rose to nine zhang tall, and a sudden enlightenment arose.</p><p></p><p>The thirty origin ripples on the wooden building intertwined into a origin true deity!</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged beneath the wooden building, like a Buddha under the bodhi tree.</p><p></p><p>Various origins intersected, forming His true body.</p><p></p><p>"The Pangu Divine Body!!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Pangu Divine Body!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing finally condensed the Pangu Divine Body, a small accomplished Pangu Divine Body standing beneath the wooden building. </p><p></p><p>His divine body continually reorganized, evolving into a form more suited for him.</p><p></p><p>The thirty kinds of origins were chaotic within him!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang became his two eyes, the Golden Crow residing in his right eye, and the true deity finally awakened as a divine being.</p><p></p><p>Please bookmark and support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Gate Divine Mountain, a disciple of the Sword Gate stepped out of the courtyard and looked up at the heavens and earth. A streak of starlight scattered across the Sword Gate. </p><p></p><p>It was the Star Maiden, treading on starlight as she walked through the void.</p><p></p><p>Two elders accompanied her on either side, explaining matters of the sect to her.</p><p></p><p>"It's the maiden from the Star Palace, descending upon the Sword Gate!"</p><p></p><p>"What? The Star Maiden herself?" </p><p></p><p>"No wonder she has such unparalleled beauty and elegance. It's said that just the 81 cultivators following the Star Maiden..."</p><p></p><p>"Those 81 followers are all elites from great clans, even including disciples from the Longevity Clan. They all follow the Star Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the four great sects all have a large number of followers. </p><p></p><p>These followers follow the sect disciples from an early age. When those disciples eventually become the supreme patriarchs, the followers will be rewarded for their service and may become elders of the great sects.</p><p></p><p>Among the Star Maiden's 81 followers, two are from the Longevity Clan, and one is from a noble family of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The names of these three followers are known throughout the world. Yet they willingly became followers of the Star Maiden, which speaks to her ability to win people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish————"</p><p></p><p>The brilliant starlight transformed into a gauzy robe draped over the Star Maiden's body. Her black hair flowed like a waterfall, her fair skin was delicate enough to be blown away. Her jade peaks stood proudly above all others.</p><p></p><p>Her slender waist traced a perfect curve, with a large expanse of skin exposed on her back. </p><p></p><p>Her long, slender legs were exquisitely delicate, like jade carved from mutton fat. With each step she took, starlight scattered, transforming into twinkling stars!</p><p></p><p>She became the focus of the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>On each of the true transmission islands, the palaces opened their gates, and true disciples emerged, gazing at the Star Maiden in admiration of her stunning beauty.</p><p></p><p>The two elders flanking the Star Maiden were none other than the Lotus Sword Immortal and the River Mountain Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Within the Sword Gate, the Lotus Sword Immortal's seniority far exceeded the other elders, as three of her true disciples had already cultivated to the Sword Immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>In the presence of the Lotus Sword Immortal, even the River Mountain Sword Immortal's sword intent paled in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior sword immortals, for leading the way!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Maiden's cultivation was nothing compared to the two sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>But she represented one of the four great sects - the Star Palace!</p><p></p><p>Her arrival at the Sword Gate represented the Star Palace itself!</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals hurriedly said, "It is only proper. The Star Palace and Sword Gate have long been close friends. Our two patriarchs would often drink wine together in merriment. We naturally must continue this friendship."</p><p></p><p>The true form of the River Mountain Sword Immortal had descended in person!</p><p></p><p>This was an elderly sword immortal with one foot already in the grave. The sword intent condensed around him within three feet, with images of rivers and mountains swirling, vast rivers flowing, and the realm of towering peaks and flowing waters pervading.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask if the maiden's descent upon the Sword Gate is at the behest of the Star Palace's patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Sword Immortal trod upon lotus flowers, each petal etched with delicate sword patterns, as if the sword intent had blossomed into flowers.</p><p></p><p>A chilling coldness emanated from the Lotus Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Star Maiden shone brilliantly like the stars, graceful and proud in her bearing.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Sword Immortal, however, was an aloof beauty, untouchable to mortals.</p><p></p><p>Her eyebrows were long and willowy, her eyes slightly narrowed like sharp sword edges.</p><p></p><p>"This senior sword sister jests. This princess comes to the Sword Gate seeking an old friend."</p><p></p><p>An old friend?</p><p></p><p>The two peerless sword immortals exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>They had never known of anyone in the Sword Gate who could claim friendship with the Star Maiden.</p><p></p><p>Since the previous Star Child fell, the Star Palace had spent hundreds of years pursuing the culprit, never expecting to establish a new Star Maiden three hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>This maiden's talents were average at best!</p><p></p><p>All could see her mediocre aptitude!</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years of cultivation, yet she had never reached the Celestial Realm. With such meager talents, how could she become a sect's disciple?</p><p></p><p>Rumors claimed the Star Maiden was the reincarnation of a great immortal, a primordial deity reborn!</p><p></p><p>Her unique identity was the only reason the Star Palace's patriarch bestowed her the title of Star Maiden.</p><p></p><p>But this year, news occasionally spread of the Star Maiden being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>They could not help but doubt again the claim that she was a reincarnated primordial deity.</p><p></p><p>"Which of my Sword Gate's disciples has the honor of being the maiden's old friend?"</p><p></p><p>The River Mountain Sword Immortal was curious. </p><p></p><p>Could it be one of the sword prodigies? But the sword prodigies had been in secluded cultivation with the patriarch for so many years, older than even the Star Maiden's age.</p><p></p><p>If not a sword prodigy, then perhaps one of the true sword immortals?</p><p></p><p>The Star Maiden trod upon starlight, gazing at the Sword Gate's peaks and islands, finally settling her gaze upon a mountain shrouded in sword aura.</p><p></p><p>"I presume that is the Sword Gate's famed Name Courtyard Peak?"</p><p></p><p>The Name Courtyard Peak of the Sword Gate!</p><p></p><p>Where the former senior elder cultivated the Sword Furnace, reaching the realm of the present age's Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Among the older generation, it had become a legendary tale.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, that is the Name Courtyard Peak."</p><p></p><p>The River Mountain Elder replied, puzzled as he looked at the Star Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"Then the old friend I seek resides there."</p><p></p><p>Starlight rippled through the air, the gauzy robe empowered by the stars formed a halo around her body, strands trailing behind her, portraying her as a celestial deity descending to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>She flew towards the Name Courtyard Peak, the two elders following at her sides.</p><p></p><p>"Could the maiden's old friend be Gu Jiuqing?"</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Sword Immortal hesitated briefly before asking.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it is that paramount sword cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>So it was him!</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals had guessed correctly.</p><p></p><p>The Name Courtyard Peak, Gu Jiuqing, this paramount sword cultivator was an old friend of the Star Maiden.</p><p></p><p>This news was of utmost importance, and the two peerless sword immortals' expressions turned grave.</p><p></p><p>On the True Transmission Island of the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan stood on the palace steps.</p><p></p><p>Starlight streamed down in brilliant strands, scattering dazzling beams endlessly. The three major formations of the Heavenly Sword Palace seemed to have vanished by half, allowing the starlight to descend unimpeded.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The fall.</p><p></p><p>None of the four true spiritual beasts within the Four Symbols Grand Formation had manifested yet, and Lu Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Holy Maiden from the Astral Pavilion, she wishes to descend upon the Sword Heaven Palace!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as his words fell, three figures stepped into the Sword Heaven Palace. </p><p></p><p>The peak master of Lotus Peak!</p><p></p><p>The peak master of River and Mountain Peak!</p><p></p><p>In between these two peak masters, there was a graceful lady with a charming smile, looking at Gu Jiuqing with a beaming expression.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Gu, we finally meet."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals paused!</p><p></p><p>Finally?</p><p></p><p>Did the Astral Holy Maiden not know Gu Jiuqing before?</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals grew tense!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was the paramount sword cultivator, and he had also joined the Famed Peak as the martial nephew of the Sword Madman. There could not be any mistakes!</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the distant Famed Peak, but there were no unusual signs, and that madman had not appeared either.</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals grew even more tense.</p><p></p><p>"So it is the Holy Maiden visiting."</p><p></p><p>"Jiuqing has been disrespectful by not greeting you from afar. Please forgive me, Holy Maiden."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to the Astral Holy Maiden, then sized her up.</p><p></p><p>Peerless beauty!</p><p></p><p>Graceful and charming!</p><p></p><p>Like a celestial fairy descending to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Although her clothes were revealing and exposed her skin, she did not exude the bewitching aura of a celestial beauty. Instead, she had an added air of sanctity.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of numerous halos, the Astral Holy Maiden appeared even more divine.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Jiuqing was observing the Astral Holy Maiden, she was also studying him.</p><p></p><p>A scholar!</p><p></p><p>This was the Astral Holy Maiden's first impression of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Elegant and unruffled, unfazed by her true form's descent. Gu Jiuqing showed not a hint of nervousness, even boldly taking an extra glance at her chest!</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I didn't expect Gu Lingluo to have such an interesting younger brother."</p><p></p><p>The halos around the Astral Holy Maiden spun like star rings, enveloping the entire True Transmission Island.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, won't you invite this Maiden into your abode for a seat?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it is too crude a place, so I dare not invite you in."</p><p></p><p>"If the Holy Maiden does not disdain it, please!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made a welcoming gesture, and the great gates of the Sword Heaven Palace opened automatically.</p><p></p><p>The celestial maiden descended step by step into the mortal realm, the rippling star rings around her reflecting the image of a divine goddess descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The two peerless sword immortals exchanged glances and transmitted their voices.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Holy Maiden of the Astral Pavilion. Her status matches that of our sect's Sword Child, even higher than us senior elders."</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter any danger, call out loudly!"</p><p></p><p>This was the voice transmission of the River and Mountain Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"The Astral Holy Maiden's visit bodes ill. Be very careful. My Lotus Sword Intent has already permeated the Sword Heaven Palace. If you sense danger, activate the intent to draw upon the Lotus Sword Intent's blessing!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Lotus Peak Master was icy, but he had already prepared a backup plan for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly in response to the two sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Astral Holy Maiden entered the Sword Heaven Palace, and Gu Jiuqing followed her in.</p><p></p><p>Sword Heaven Palace, Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Pillar after pillar made of refined iron, engraved with patterns of flowers, birds, insects and fish.</p><p></p><p>Within the hall, a divine maiden was enveloped by starlight, her true form obscured and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>More and more starlight converged upon the Astral Holy Maiden, and Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>Could such a holy maiden really have been suppressed by his elder sister?</p><p></p><p>And later suppressed by the Prince of Zhou?</p><p></p><p>Were the legends mistaken?</p><p></p><p>"This Maiden went to the Ancient City of Abyss. Your steward said you had joined the Sword Sect, but I didn't expect you to actually become their true disciple."</p><p></p><p>The Astral Holy Maiden looked at Gu Jiuqing, her voice tinged with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Lingluo left you a letter in the Ancient City of Abyss. Since this Maiden was coming to find you anyway, I brought that letter along."</p><p></p><p>The Astral Holy Maiden took out an envelope.</p><p></p><p>The letter fell into Gu Jiuqing's hands, containing only a single letter.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Gu, you can read the letter first. Don't mind this Maiden."</p><p></p><p>The Astral Holy Maiden paced around the hall, seeming to observe this Sword Heaven Palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the letter upon her words!</p><p></p><p>The Astral Holy Maiden's arrival was too sudden!</p><p></p><p>Although he had guessed that the woman Gu Lingluo mentioned was the Astral Holy Maiden, he was still inwardly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Opening the letter, the first line that caught his eye:</p><p></p><p>[Big or not? I'm just asking if it's big or not?]</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Big or not?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing glanced at the Astral Holy Maiden.</p><p></p><p>Well, it did seem quite big.</p><p></p><p>[But that's not considered big yet! Sister has found you another peerless beauty, but this beauty is still unwilling to marry you. Once sister works on her mindset, it won't be long before sister gets her to come find you.]</p><p></p><p>[Aren't you curious how big this beauty is? Let sister describe her figure for you.]</p><p></p><p>[You know Zhichun from our manor, right? That little maid is this big: |··|]</p><p></p><p>Zhichun?</p><p></p><p>She was a maidservant who had grown up in the Gu manor since childhood. Gu Jiuqing had seen her a few times.</p><p></p><p>The |··| description did seem fitting, as Zhichun was very young. When Gu Lingluo left, Zhichun was only thirteen or fourteen, so of course she would only be that size.</p><p></p><p>[The Celestial Beauty is (·)(·) </p><p></p><p>The Astral Holy Maiden is (·Y·)</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiangyu is (·人·) </p><p></p><p>Now you should know how big, right? If you don't take a fancy to the first two beauties, just wait for sister to invite Chu Xiangyu to find you.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's hand holding the letter trembled.</p><p></p><p>There's still another page, I beg for you to continue reading today, please!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

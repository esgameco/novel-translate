        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Below Sword Gate Pass, many young men from the northern lands showed looks of surprise and doubt. They had never heard of the Seal Cultivator or Bright Court, nor did they know who the Venerable Taishang Elder was.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>No matter where, the position of Venerable Taishang Elder was above ordinary elders. The status of this Seal Cultivator was much higher than even those Sword Immortals. </p><p></p><p>They didn't see that after hearing the words of the white-robed Sword Immortal, those Sword Immortals dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not hesitate and bowed to the white-robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing is willing!"</p><p></p><p>The status of a Seal Cultivator was the highest level in the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Being accepted as a disciple under a Seal Cultivator would make his future actions much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>With this Venerable Taishang Elder as his backer, even the old ancestor of the Qu family would not dare act against him.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed Sword Immortal smiled slightly, "Good, good, from now on you will be the second disciple of the Bright Court Sword Furnace. Your senior martial brother will take you back to the Bright Court!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to bid farewell to the steward Xie, but the white-robed senior martial brother had already acted.</p><p></p><p>A heaven-spanning talisman fell, its divine light forming a golden bridge laid at Gu Jiuqing's feet. A thread of brilliance from the divine bridge entered Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing involuntarily stepped onto the divine bridge, and in just a few steps, he had crossed the void and arrived beside his white-robed senior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>A force carried Gu Jiuqing, and atop a flying craft, he descended into the Sword Sect's divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>When observing the Sword Sect's divine mountain from outside Sword Gate Pass, one could only see its magnificence. But when Gu Jiuqing flew into the Sword Sect, he discovered the true grandeur of the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>The divine mountain was immense, containing worlds within, with small realms cultivating inside the Sword Sect. At first glance, there were rays of luminous clouds crisscrossing the azure sky, as well as numerous floating islands suspended around, and many mountain peaks emanating terrifying sword auras.</p><p></p><p>This was the scene of the highest reaches of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked down at the base of the divine mountain!</p><p></p><p>That was where the outer court disciples and inner court disciples dwelled. The outer courtyard buildings were interconnected, while the inner courtyards were tens of miles apart. Some inner court disciples had even excavated cave abodes to live in and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>There were disciples cultivating with dragon and elephant auras above their heads, tempering their fleshly bodies, or transforming into Blazing Demon forms. Some disciples inhaled the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, refining it into their own magic powers!</p><p></p><p>Other disciples forged divine bodies, crafting invincible ones, becoming battle gods!</p><p></p><p>The Shedding Mortality Realm, Magic Power Realm, and Divine Body Realm cultivators were the most numerous inside the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two courtyards below could no longer be seen clearly as Gu Jiuqing had arrived above the divine mountain's peak.</p><p></p><p>There were marks of divine abilities, sites of great battles, and traces left behind by divine weapons, all clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>"These are the marks of a great battle left behind when the Primordial Demon Tribe tried to invade the northern lands and fought my Sword Sect three thousand years ago," the white-robed Sword Immortal sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, the Sect Master at the time joined the Sword Sect. Within nine days of the great test, he comprehended a supreme sword intent and was accepted as a disciple by the Ancestral Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>This was part of the Sword Sect's history that Gu Jiuqing did not know before. Now that he was also a disciple, he had to engrave this history in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's Ancestral Patriarch was an almost godly existence who had only suffered an injury ten thousand years ago, with his great tribulation coming three thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>When the demons outside Sword Gate Pass learned of this, they launched a massive invasion of the Sword Sect, causing devastation to the living beings of the northern lands. Even the Great Zhou Dynasty sent a million troops to guard the area.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, although the Sword Sect was victorious, the Ancestral Patriarch passed away prematurely. During this period, the Sect Master at the time shone brilliantly, slaying demons and butchering local deities. The number of demons, semi-deities, and nature spirits killed by his hands was countless.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see this handprint on that mountain peak over there?"</p><p></p><p>Before them, an isolated mountain peak had an enormous black handprint, dozens of feet across.</p><p></p><p>"This is the mark left behind when the Sect Master at the time slew a nature spirit with a single palm strike."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the previous, more formidable than the Ancestral Patriarch's power.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Why did such a powerful existence not become a deity?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing voiced his doubt.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed Sword Immortal shook his head, "Becoming a deity is too difficult. Our Sword Sect has three Sword Sages who have cultivated to the final realm, even completing the cultivation of all realms, but they still cannot reach the deity realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to inquire further, but the white-robed Sword Immortal spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, becoming a deity is not something I can attain, but you have the prospect of becoming one. When the Sect Master returns, he will personally tell you about this!"</p><p></p><p>"Or if Master awakens, Master will also tell you."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Master?</p><p></p><p>That never-seen Master was also an almost godly powerful figure?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was overjoyed. No wonder the Sword Sect was so...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It turns out this Venerable Elder is one of the most powerful existences in the world. With such a powerful backer, he should be able to cultivate without fear, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he can fearlessly accept the cultivation method from the Blue Star!"  </p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Peak where the Supreme Lord resides, and that is the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed senior martial brother pointed towards the Sword Tomb and said slowly, "After some time, you'll go to the Sword Tomb to select a flying sword, which you'll refine into your life-bound sword pill."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the one guarding the Sword Tomb is the Three Yangs Immortal, also known as the Third Elder, one of the three sword sages of our sect."</p><p></p><p>The Seal Imprint Daoist! </p><p>The Three Yangs Immortal!</p><p>And the Supreme Lord himself!</p><p></p><p>These are the three great sword sages of the sect, almost godly powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing committed to memory everything the white-robed senior brother introduced.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived. This is Mingting Peak, where the sword furnace of my Mingting lineage is located on the mountain."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed sword immortal brought Gu Jiuqing to Mingting Peak. As soon as they set foot on Mingting Peak, Gu Jiuqing felt a powerful sword intent rushing towards him, constantly battering his will!</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist, this is the unrestrained sword intent of the great Mingting lineage."</p><p></p><p>"My master is extremely powerful, but his physical body is almost rotten and can't withstand the sword intent, which is why the sword intent is leaking out."  </p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is also the reason for the existence of the sword furnace."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing understood from the white-robed senior brother the reason for the sword furnace's existence.</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace!</p><p></p><p>It is formed from the condensation of sword intent, requiring generation after generation of inheritance to finally take shape - the embodiment of the Way of the Sword, the ultimate form of condensed sword intent.</p><p></p><p>A sword furnace contains countless sword intents.</p><p></p><p>Like the one before them, shining brightly, as if it were a celestial furnace!</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was a blazing fire pile in the sky, shaped like a sword, over a hundred meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was awed by the sword furnace. The Cutting Heaven Sword Intent surging within him quickly dissipated. Under the battering of the great Mingting sword intent, Gu Jiuqing's physical body showed no reaction at all, as if just a gentle breeze caressed his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Mingting lineage is extremely powerful. My master is a sword sage, but the bad news is that my master is about to die."</p><p></p><p>However, the white-robed senior brother was a sword immortal capable of activating the sword furnace!</p><p></p><p>A sword immortal wielding a sword furnace was invincible in the world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt reassured. It seemed he didn't need to worry about lacking a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple Liang Xiao pays respects to the master. Please, master, come out of seclusion to see me."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed senior brother, Liang Xiao, bowed towards the sword furnace.</p><p></p><p>Was the master inside the sword furnace?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked around. Mingting Peak was quite simple, with only an independent courtyard not far away, and no other buildings.</p><p></p><p>If he joined Mingting Peak, where would he live in the future?</p><p></p><p>One breath of time passed.</p><p>Two breaths.</p><p>Three breaths.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao stood up, slightly embarrassed. "The master is still in secluded cultivation. It seems we'll have to wait a while longer."</p><p></p><p>"But it's alright, as a sword immortal, I can also help my junior martial brother become a true disciple."</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the sky, where floating islands descended from beyond, each emanating a unique aura, with spiritual light and sword intent soaring together.</p><p></p><p>"To become a true disciple of our sect, one needs to receive a sword talisman, wear a sword imprint, and through secret methods, infuse a strand of blood essence into the soul abode."</p><p></p><p>There are formations above and below the sect, though they've been closed these past few days.</p><p></p><p>The sword talisman can open the sect's formations, allowing unobstructed entry and exit.</p><p></p><p>The sword imprint is an inherited mark, indicating which peak and lineage a true disciple belongs to.</p><p></p><p>Blood essence is transformed into the soul, residing in the soul abode.</p><p></p><p>Within the soul abode, there are special disciples guarding the changes in true disciples' souls. If a true disciple's soul changes, the elders can quickly locate that true disciple's position and assist them in crossing tribulations!</p><p></p><p>This is a treatment afforded to every true disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, give me two drops of your blood essence. One drop I'll keep, and although I'm untalented, I still have some reputation in the northern lands, throughout the Great Zhou Dynasty, and even the entire world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing naturally wouldn't refuse, and squeezed out two drops of blood essence from his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Today I still need to go fishing for some more spirit essence drops.</p><p></p><p>I just took my temperature, it's 38°C, much better than the previous two days.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow I should be able to resume regular updates, and I'll make up for the missed ones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wilderness! Wind and Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>As a perilous area on the eastern edge of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the Wind and Thunder Valley was actually the safest place. </p><p></p><p>Because it was guarded by the Tao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Tao Sect had three Celestial Venerables - Expounding Celestial Venerable, Intercepting Celestial Venerable, and Supreme Celestial Venerable! The Expounding Celestial Venerable emerged earliest, followed by the Intercepting Celestial Venerable, and then the Supreme Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the strongest expert in the world, the Tao Ancestor, guarded this place.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, demons and monsters did not dare to forcefully enter the Wind and Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the Eastern Wilderness to gradually prosper. The number of influential clans around the Wind and Thunder Valley increased, and there were even many Tribulation experts who came to the Wind and Thunder Valley to brave the Pure Yang Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous lightning rolled across the sky. Elder Patriarchs at the Tribulation Realm ascended into the heavens, summoning divine thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>This scene did not attract much attention.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>This Tribulation lasted for an unusually long time.</p><p></p><p>When the first Tribulation thunderbolt struck, the disciples of the clans in the Wind and Thunder Valley paid no heed.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for the second and third Tribulation thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>But after the fourth Tribulation thunderbolt fell, some cultivators finally noticed the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>They saw that deep within the Wind and Thunder Valley, dark clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and even human-shaped lightning appeared. Thunder dragons emerged, transforming into ancient giants pressing down on the world.</p><p></p><p>"What is this ominous sign? Why is the Tribulation manifestation within the Wind and Thunder Valley so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>One after another, the Elder Patriarchs of the clans stood at a distance, observing this Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"To summon the Tribulation and temper one's Primordial Spirit, one must face at least one Tribulation. But generally, Tribulation experts would summon two or three Tribulations."</p><p></p><p>"So how many Tribulations has the one deep in the Wind and Thunder Valley summoned now?"</p><p></p><p>"The sixth? Or the seventh?"</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful eyes, another Tribulation thunderbolt struck, shaking the Wind and Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>The ominous signs in the Wind and Thunder Valley attracted the observation of the clan Elders, and eventually even the Elders of the Long Life Clan were astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Just who is this Tribulation expert? To summon so many Tribulations at once?"</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Realm!</p><p></p><p>It was divided into nine levels!</p><p></p><p>Meaning one had to pass through nine Tribulations and perfectly cultivate two hundred and fifty-six Pure Yang Thoughts.</p><p></p><p>And in each Tribulation, the number of thunderbolts summoned varied, depending on one's own state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So generally, when Tribulation experts faced their first Tribulation, they would test the waters by summoning one Tribulation thunderbolt and use their fleshly body, powers, divine abilities, and divine weapons to resist this divine thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>After gauging the strength of the divine thunderbolt, they would summon the second one.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the divine thunderbolts would grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>When facing the second divine thunderbolt, they would use their powers, divine abilities, and divine weapons to dispel most of the thunderbolt's force, allowing the remaining part to bathe their Primordial Spirit and accept the divine thunderbolt's baptism.</p><p></p><p>This required precise control. If not handled properly, the Primordial Spirit could be obliterated by the thunderbolt's force, resulting in death and the dissipation of one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"This Tribulation expert must have already passed through seven or eight Tribulations, otherwise it wouldn't be so fierce."</p><p></p><p>To summon so many divine thunderbolts, they believed he must be a Ninth Tribulation expert.</p><p></p><p>After several more divine thunderbolts struck deep within the Wind and Thunder Valley, the ominous signs finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The strange phenomena in the sky vanished, and the Wind and Thunder Valley became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to enter the depths of the Wind and Thunder Valley to find this Tribulation Elder.</p><p></p><p>But after passing through a Tribulation, there would be a period of weakness. Although the Primordial Spirit would absorb Pure Yang energy, it would also enter its weakest state.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait. When this Elder emerges from seclusion, we'll know who was braving the Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>The clan Elders and Long Life experts were all paying attention to that Tribulation expert deep within the Wind and Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Wind and Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao retrieved his Primordial Spirit from above his head.</p><p></p><p>This was his second Primordial Spirit. After bathing in the divine thunderbolts, half of its head had turned into a Pure Yang state. After a breath or two, a thought fell from the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>It was a Pure Yang Thought the size of two thumbs!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao, who was previously at the First Tribulation level, had now entered the Tribulation Realm again today.</p><p></p><p>He retrieved his Primordial Spirit, feeling a wave of weakness. He smiled faintly as the inner energy in his body circulated, cleansing his Primordial Spirit with his essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Visibly to the naked eye, Liang Xiao's Primordial Spirit grew larger, now over twenty-two zhang tall!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's period of weakness passed in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"In a few more days, I should be able to face the Second Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao planned to greatly increase his cultivation within the Wind and Thunder Valley. He felt that the situation in the Wilderness was changing, and with his current strength, he was inferior even to a Pure Yang Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>"After passing through eight Tribulations with this Primordial Spirit, I can directly break through to the Ninth Tribulation Realm!"</p><p></p><p>With two Primordial Spirits, each containing one hundred and twenty-eight Pure Yang Thoughts, combining them would reach two hundred and fifty-six.</p><p></p><p>Allowing him to directly step into the Ninth Tribulation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then he would use the Ninth Tribulation to directly cultivate to the Pure Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You haven't left yet?"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from a distant mountain peak, entering Liang Xiao's ears.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's eyelids twitched, and countless divine eyes appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He used his divine eyes to scan the heavens and earth, only seeing an old Taoist walking down step-by-step from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was an elderly Taoist monk wearing a grey robe, holding a Buddhist staff, with a Taoist crown on his head and a face full of wrinkles.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Liang Xiao with a hint of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, back then your father passed through all nine Tribulations in a single day, his Primordial Spirit became Pure Yang, his fleshly body Pure Yang, his inner energy Pure Yang, directly achieving a Three-in-One state. Who knows how many experts at the Deity Realm he alarmed."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be recalling a scene from three thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>The divine eyes on Liang Xiao's face trembled, his pupils constricted, and the tiny hand within his Immovable Demon King Eye retracted, not daring to move!</p><p></p><p>"I thought you might also achieve the Three-in-One state today."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're far inferior to your father."</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist sighed, as if saying Liang Xiao had wasted his time.</p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have come down from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"You know that old fellow?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're even older than him?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao looked at this divine mountain, his countless eyes filled with dread. This was the first time he could not actively control his divine eyes!</p><p></p><p>These eyes seemed to have lost their effect, unable to perceive any information about the old Taoist.</p><p></p><p>He retracted all his divine eyes and used his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye to observe the old Taoist.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The Eight Trigrams Divine Eye is on your face?"</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist finally showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao did not respond to the old Taoist, instead saying on his own:</p><p></p><p>"The three Celestial Venerables of the Tao Sect - the Supreme Celestial Venerable took the title one thousand six hundred years ago, the Intercepting Celestial Venerable emerged three thousand six hundred years ago. Five thousand years ago, the Expounding Celestial Venerable walked the world."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know which Celestial Venerable you are? The Expounding Celestial Venerable? Or the Intercepting Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, Liang Xiao felt a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>This old Taoist was at least a Two-in-One cultivator! No weaker than the Eight Trigrams Patriarch at his peak.</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist smiled faintly. He waved his hand towards the white clouds in the sky, and the clouds transformed into a giant lotus pedestal.</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist stepped onto the cloud pedestal and sat down. Seeing this, Liang Xiao also stepped into the void and sat across from the old Taoist on the white cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha————"</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist laughed heartily, "You know! In the world today, there are no more than two people who dare to sit before this old Taoist."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's scalp went numb!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally guessed who this old Taoist was.</p><p></p><p>"Who are the two?"</p><p></p><p>"The first is the Heavenly Empress of the Demonic Dao."</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist shook his head, "At that time, she had just obtained a branch of the Primordial Lunar Tree and wanted to challenge this old Taoist, so she sat before me."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to recall something, and the smile on his face grew more intense.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the Heavenly Empress had just achieved the Three-in-One state and obtained a branch of the Lunar Tree, so she was bold in her youth. But afterwards, this old Taoist invited her to the Wind and Thunder Valley many times, yet she never came once."</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Empress has lost her manners."</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist was reprimanding the Heavenly Empress for losing her manners!!</p><p></p><p>Though there were no ominous signs in the surrounding world, Liang Xiao felt his Mud Pill Palace tremble. The Primordial Spirit he had just tempered through the Tribulation was frozen in his sea of consciousness, unable to move!!</p><p></p><p>Though there were no signs of heavenly might, heaven and earth were still one. Every word and action was the order and rule of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Guess who is the second person who has sat before this old Taoist?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao sat upright, as obedient as a good child, not daring to speak recklessly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Buddha Patriarch of the Buddhist Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Then it must be the Ancestral Patriarch of the Sword Sect, the Primordial Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"That brat from the Sword Sect is too weak in cultivation. He wouldn't dare meet this old Taoist, let alone sit before me."</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"That old fellow from the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist continued shaking his head, "The Star Lord doesn't dare face this old Taoist. He has the Future Stars Scripture and knows this old Taoist wants to kill him, so he doesn't dare meet with me alone!"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Xingyun achieved the Three-in-One state in a single day three thousand years ago and stepped into the Deity Realm, but even he doesn't dare sit before me now!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, perhaps in another three thousand years, your father might dare to sit before me."</p><p></p><p>Every sentence from the old Taoist made Liang Xiao tremble.</p><p></p><p>After four sentences, Liang Xiao's back was completely drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>"The first emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>The old Taoist nodded, "After guessing for so long, you've finally got it right."</p><p></p><p>"It was over nine hundred years ago when that Zhou emperor came to see this old Taoist. But he didn't really sit before me, as the Zhou emperor knelt in front of this old Taoist."</p><p></p><p>The Zhou emperor!</p><p></p><p>Knelt before this old Taoist?!!</p><p></p><p>That was the founding emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty, a Three-in-One expert.</p><p></p><p>Ruling over the nine provinces!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Backed by the royal family of the Great Zhou Dynasty, with millions of valiant soldiers and hundreds of millions of subjects. </p><p></p><p>Such a lofty existence, yet he had to kneel and pay respects to an old Daoist priest??</p><p></p><p>"So, you are the second person to take a seat."</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest looked at Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao with a gentle gaze, but Liang Xiao did not dare act recklessly, quietly without the demeanor of the madman of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the old Daoist has come down from the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Your talents are not bad. In the Eastern Wilderness, the old Daoist has also heard of some of your deeds. In this world, you can be considered the most gifted."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to become a disciple under the old Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest still smiled as he looked at Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, beads of cold sweat appeared on Liang Xiao's forehead.</p><p></p><p>His inner energy!</p><p></p><p>Was dissipating!</p><p></p><p>He was nervous.</p><p></p><p>He dared not say a word of refusal!!</p><p></p><p>Who would dare say no in front of this venerable Daoist?</p><p></p><p>He suspected that the first emperor of the Zhou Dynasty had defied the old Daoist, which led to his violent death nine hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you jest. With my meager talents, how can I be considered the best?"</p><p></p><p>The smile disappeared from the old Daoist priest's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao hurriedly said, "In the world today, although I am untalented, I still have aspirations in life, and wish to make a mark!"</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and sighed, "But this world is so vast, and there are many talented people emerging."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Then who is this talented person that makes you hesitant to claim to be the best in the world?"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it is Princess Chengxiao, the current Grand Marshal guarding the nation of the Great Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao could no longer hold back!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to mention Gu Jiuqing and Gu Linglong!</p><p></p><p>But the one he wanted to mention the most was Si Wuxie!!</p><p></p><p>However, these three people were all related to him, so he could only mention Princess Chengxiao.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest paused, thinking Liang Xiao would mention a disciple from one of the four great sects. The name of Princess Chengxiao made the old Daoist ponder for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao seized the opportunity, "That princess entered the Buddhist sect hundreds of years ago and stole the Buddha's descending dharma and secretly read the Buddhist sutras and secret classics!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the previous Saint Child of the Astral Palace had just died, and a brilliantly talented person was about to be appointed as the next Saint Child. However, that Saint Child later disappeared."</p><p></p><p>That's why there is now an Astral Saint Maiden instead.</p><p></p><p>"The future Astral Sutra of the Astral Palace must have also been glimpsed by that princess!"</p><p></p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, a prince from the Great Zhou also infiltrated my Sword Sect and peeked at our sword manuals. I caught him in the act."</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Xiao did not expose that person.</p><p></p><p>Peeking at the sword manuals of the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>If others could peek, why couldn't he?</p><p></p><p>So he and that prince from the Great Zhou peeked at the sword manuals together!</p><p></p><p>"What an ingenious person!" </p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest praised, recalling something.</p><p></p><p>It was probably about fifty or sixty years ago when a Celestial Master of the Daoist sect took in a disciple. But that disciple only stayed in the mountains for forty-nine days before hurriedly returning to the secular world and leaving Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>Forty-nine!</p><p></p><p>This number struck a chord with the old Daoist priest, and he finally remembered that person.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't guessed, the one who joined the Daoist sect back then must have been this Princess Chengxiao.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, that was a woman!"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest rejected Liang Xiao's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"There is another whose talents surpass mine."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie of my Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie?"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest murmured the true name.</p><p></p><p>Then he uttered it again.</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie!"</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist priest pointed at the void, and a mirror image appeared, revealing a scene.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at a figure in the mirror and said indifferently, </p><p></p><p>"Could it be this person?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao quickly nodded, "Yes, that's him."</p><p></p><p>In the mirror image, that figure stood in the void. Seeming to sense something, he turned towards Liang Xiao's direction and revealed a smile!</p><p></p><p>This smile covered the entire mirror surface!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. This person's talents do seem to surpass yours."</p><p></p><p>Phew!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao felt greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Above Zhangzhou Prefecture City, pure yang energy was constantly descending, enveloping the entire celestial realm in a golden divine light.</p><p></p><p>The citizens in the city below only saw a second sun rising between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was the Pure Yang Ancestor blocking the path ahead, intercepting the Sword Immortals of the Sword Sect one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect disciples felt like they were facing a formidable enemy, only Si Wuxie turned to look back at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie's gaze caught Gu Jiuqing's attention.</p><p></p><p>"What is Si Wuxie doing?"</p><p></p><p>With the Pure Yang Ancestor's appearance, this Sword Sect disciple remained calm and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>Such composure could not be achieved even by the four Peak Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Four more pure yang auras covered the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The auras of pure yang energy emanating from Mountain River Peak Lord, Celestial Snow Peak Lord, Nine Yang Peak Lord, and Elder Qu unfolded, with pure yang thought-seeds scattering around their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Mountain River Peak Lord and Celestial Snow Peak Lord had crossed the fourth level of thunderbolt tribulation, possessing eight pure yang thought-seeds. These eight intertwined thought-seeds formed a miniature golden spirit avatar!</p><p></p><p>Nine Yang Peak Lord had crossed the third level of thunderbolt tribulation, with four pure yang thought-seeds.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu had crossed the fifth level of thunderbolt tribulation, with sixteen pure yang thought-seeds.</p><p></p><p>Among the four Peak Lords, Elder Qu's cultivation was the most formidable!</p><p></p><p>He stood at the very front of the three Peak Lords, with blood oozing from the corners of his mouth!</p><p></p><p>His sword pill had been shattered, and his entire spiritual energy was almost dissipated. If not for the suppression of the pure yang spirit avatar, just the shattering of the flying swords alone would have caused him severe injuries if not death.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Condensing the will of the sword into flying swords was akin to imbuing part of one's spiritual will into them.</p><p></p><p>With the flying swords destroyed, his spirit avatar was under assault!</p><p></p><p>"Which Pure Yang Ancestor dares to come and slaughter my Sword Sect disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu spoke out!</p><p></p><p>But this Pure Yang Ancestor covered his face with a veil, concealing his true form within the pure yang aura, making it impossible to discern his true power.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang energy descended, sealing off the surrounding heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Leave behind the Sword Youths, and you may keep your lives."</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang Ancestor only said this before falling silent again.</p><p></p><p>His pure yang aura was so overwhelming that his spirit avatar seemed to manifest an entire realm behind his physical body!</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu was enraged once more!</p><p></p><p>The other three Peak Lords were also angered.</p><p></p><p>Did this Pure Yang Ancestor really think he could just trample over the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>The four great Peak Lords attacked at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Sword auras spanning the heavens erupted!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of Mountain River, the sword intent of Celestial Snow, the sword intent of Nine Yang - three sword intents tore through the void, slashing through the pure yang aura!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the three flying swords hovering around this Pure Yang Ancestor's body vibrated, actually tracing out a celestial river!</p><p></p><p>The sword auras filled the vast sky, and the heavenly light surged!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang spirit avatar's aura was boundless as it slapped forward!</p><p></p><p>The sword auras were shattered, and three figures were sent flying back, along with countless Sword Immortals swept away into the celestial realm!!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang spirit avatar retracted its palm, while the true form stood calmly.</p><p></p><p>He did not reveal his true identity, nor did he use any divine weapons, magic arts or supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>He only used the pure yang spirit avatar!</p><p></p><p>But the pure yang spirit avatar alone was enough to suppress them all!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Form Twenty-Two!"</p><p></p><p>A sword chant suddenly resounded through the clouds, shaking the ancient city below and causing the white clouds to tear apart. The sword chant grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a flying sword transformed into a hundred-zhang aura, the sword intent devouring and spitting out boundless sword light filling the sky!</p><p></p><p>"This is the Twenty-Second Sword Form recorded in the sword manuals!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing watched the pure yang spirit avatar of the Pure Yang Ancestor, considering when to make his move and launch a sneak attack!</p><p></p><p>This Pure Yang Ancestor was concerned about revealing his true strength, so he would try to minimize using magic arts, physical body, supernatural powers, and divine weapons, only fighting with his spirit avatar!</p><p></p><p>And this gave Gu Jiuqing an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>He summoned his future Dao body. If he could land a devastating blow and severely injure the Pure Yang Ancestor, then together with the four Peak Lords, they might be able to slay him.</p><p></p><p>"The Twenty-Second Sword Form is the ultimate technique of the Sword Dao. The other twenty-one forms from Sword One to Sword Twenty-One are just skills, techniques, and supernatural powers. Only this Twenty-Second Form unifies the Sword Dao and is the most important inherited tradition of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Si Wuxie also wanted to witness the Twenty-Second Sword Form!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed Si Wuxie's anticipation!!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Peak Lord's sword spanned the heavens and earth, fusing the sword intent of Mountain River with the world itself. Boundless sword auras proliferated like clouds drifting down.</p><p></p><p>Sword Form Eight, Sword Merging with Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang aura swirling around the Pure Yang Ancestor's true form was torn apart. The descending sword intent carved countless sword marks into his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Blood!</p><p></p><p>Flowed from his true form!</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang Ancestor had no choice but to use his magic arts to heal his physical body, with surging spiritual energy circulating throughout to mend the wounds inflicted by Sword Form Eight.</p><p></p><p>This one sword strike!</p><p></p><p>Was very powerful!</p><p></p><p>But it could only damage the Pure Yang Ancestor's true form!</p><p></p><p>"Wah-lah——————"</p><p></p><p>The pure yang aura descended again. The Pure Yang Ancestor's spirit avatar joined its palms, sending a pure yang force surging in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The miniature spirit avatar above Elder Qu's head instantly disintegrated, with the thought-seeds shattering one by one!!</p><p></p><p>He was self-detonating his pure yang thought-seeds.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three, four thought-seeds exploded, forming an annihilating force that barely managed to block the descending pure yang palm force from the Pure Yang Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>With four pure yang thought-seeds self-detonated, Elder Qu's face turned deathly pale, and his spiritual energy was depleted to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"You still haven't captured the Sword Youths?"</p><p></p><p>A tremor shook the void, and another Pure Yang Ancestor crossed over from the distant heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p><p></p><p>The protagonist will officially rise in this story arc.</p><p></p><p>He has acquired divine weapons, and much time has passed in the Blue Star realm, so the protagonist's cultivation should be elevated.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The tall buildings outside the school, a private room.</p><p></p><p>The school secretary! The head of the Martial Arts Association! Yang Zhan Tian from the Yang Group! The director of the security department. </p><p></p><p>These four martial kings, which one was not a magnate in Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>If they stomped their feet, the entire Linjiang would tremble.</p><p></p><p>"How did Old Wen reveal our entire plan?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why didn't Old Wen explain this to us before?"</p><p></p><p>The director of security looked embarrassed!</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>He still could not blame Old Wen.</p><p></p><p>Old Wen's identity was too terrifying, who in Linjiang dared to speak against him?</p><p></p><p>Just the identities he knew could scare him to death!</p><p></p><p>Ever since the high-level martial artists descended, the face of Planet Blue changed greatly, and the Martial Arts Alliance became the number one force on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Outside every city, there were members of the Martial Arts Alliance standing guard, these were the dispatched members of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>There was also the Martial Arts Academy!</p><p></p><p>The few most noble people in the Martial Arts Academy were called the elders, and Old Wen was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wen was renowned across Planet Blue in his time, but later Elder Wen failed to undergo blood transformation for a long time, so he left the imperial capital and returned to his hometown.</p><p></p><p>In his hometown, he cultivated the principal of the high school division.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wen was their teacher, and the four martial kings present had all received guidance from Elder Wen.</p><p></p><p>"It's a done deal now, we can only wait for Gu Zixiu's response."</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>They were completely exposed in front of the "deity" Gu Zixiu, and they didn't know what this "deity" would do.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't expect Old Wen to speak so bluntly either.</p><p></p><p>But for him, this was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>His main body was in the Great Wilderness, he was a native of the Great Wilderness, raising the dimension of Planet Blue was to help his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He could not reveal his true self on Planet Blue, with Old Wen's help, his Dharma transmission would be much simpler.</p><p></p><p>"Since Old Wen has said so, I naturally will not decline."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke so lightly, leaving the principal puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Was it really just like Old Wen said?</p><p></p><p>Just for Dharma transmission?</p><p></p><p>Just to do a teacher's duty well?</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! Teacher Gu is indeed an outstanding teacher."</p><p></p><p>Old Wen picked up the brocade banner on the table, it was a banner for an outstanding teacher.</p><p></p><p>"If Teacher Gu cannot be evaluated as a senior teacher, it would be a loss for our school. From now on, Teacher Gu will be the third senior teacher at Linjiang High School."</p><p></p><p>After handing over the brocade banner, Old Wen called the principal over and sat back in the principal's seat with his support.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, you should sit too."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing naturally sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, you want to transmit the Dharma, you want to promote martial arts, do you have any thoughts on what to do next?"</p><p></p><p>The principal stood motionless behind Old Wen.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he would have respectfully seen Teacher Gu off long ago, how dare he ask what Gu Jiuqing planned to do next.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calculated the time, probably tomorrow, he would reach the ancient Tianxuan City of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family's Six Harmonies Boxing was inferior to the Dragon and Elephant Skill, no need to transmit it to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>The Three Yin Soul-Hunting Blade and the Golden Crow Divine Body could be transmitted!</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Sword Sect, relying on his status as the true inheritor of the Sword Sect, he could select some divine abilities to transmit to Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked out the window, where a dim moon hung.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the moon, "Can you fly to the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Can you fly to the moon?</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Jiuqing realized something was wrong, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>He had misspoken!</p><p></p><p>All along, Gu Jiuqing had been transmitting the Dharma under the identity of Gu Zixiu.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu would never say such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu came from the Gu Family, one of the eight great clans of the imperial capital, he was well-versed in Planet Blue's technology and martial arts, would he still need to ask Old Wen if they could fly to the moon?</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression changed slightly as he looked towards Lao Wen and the principal. </p><p></p><p>These two were deep in thought, completely unaware of the oddity of that sentence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Gu Jiuqing also had an answer.</p><p></p><p>"It seems they already knew I'm not Gu Zixiu."</p><p></p><p>Heh heh</p><p></p><p>"I've been pretending this whole time!"</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>When was his identity exposed? </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing couldn't figure it out, he thought he had been hiding it well.</p><p></p><p>Since it's exposed, what's the point of continuing to pretend?</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing pondered this, many people were analyzing the sentence he said.</p><p></p><p>In the principal's office, cameras had already been installed.</p><p></p><p>The top talents from the three major groups of Linji, the municipal government, and the martial arts alliance first analyzed the meaning of this sentence, then gave an outrageous standard answer.</p><p></p><p>[Is this deity asking this sentence to indirectly verify our strength? Flying to the moon, if referring to physically crossing the atmosphere and traveling 400,000 km to the moon, even the first martial sage cannot do it, let alone ordinary martial saints.]</p><p></p><p>The martial arts on Planet Blue had only been opened for a short time, it was impossible to physically cross the atmosphere and fly into outer space.</p><p></p><p>[Then does this deity mean using a manned spacecraft? With current technology, it's easy to build a spacecraft out of T20 materials to land on the moon. After landing, with the current physique of martial artists being much stronger than the old era, landing on the moon with the aid of a vehicle is possible in this period!]</p><p></p><p>[After landing on the moon, then what does this deity want to do?]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>Lao Wen only felt a bit annoyed and crushed the device in his ear.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he firmly said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was delighted! This way, it would be much easier for him to spread the Dao on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"How long will it take to prepare to land on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>He had searched online for some information about landing on the moon, back when the high martial arts had not descended on Planet Blue, when the people of Blue Star explored the stars.</p><p></p><p>"Two months! If we mobilize the resources of the entire Jiangnan Province, it would only take ten days, but if we only use Linji's resources, it will take two months," said the principal.</p><p></p><p>"For now, landing on the moon, the biggest danger is the demons hiding in the upper atmosphere. During this time, Linji needs to drive away the demons in the upper atmosphere."</p><p></p><p>The current flying demon beasts were not like the birds of the past. If an S-rank great demon appeared, it could pluck down a manned rocket.</p><p></p><p>"We also need time to train personnel for the moon landing," the principal explained.</p><p></p><p>Two months was far from enough time!</p><p></p><p>"Then wait two months. Two months later, you must take at least a hundred people to fly to the moon. I want you to establish a connection between the moon and Planet Blue."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will give you the formation method for the teleportation array. I will set up one end of the teleportation array at the school, while the other end will be set up on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's idea - to use the ancient teleportation array to connect Planet Blue and the moon.</p><p></p><p>The distance between Planet Blue and the moon was only 400,000 km!</p><p></p><p>The Northern Territory alone was 100,000 li!</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Dynasty had territories of millions of li.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Zhou was just a corner of the Wastes, with even more lands occupied by demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>The maximum opening distance of the ancient teleportation array was 1 million km, enough to connect Planet Blue and the moon.</p><p></p><p>Once this feat was accomplished, the people of Planet Blue cultivating the moon spirit techniques would be greatly enhanced, and Gu Jiuqing would also be greatly strengthened!</p><p></p><p>Lao Wen and the principal were struck speechless by Gu Jiuqing's idea.</p><p></p><p>A deity!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to connect Planet Blue and the moon??</p><p></p><p>In the future, one could step from Planet Blue directly onto the moon?</p><p></p><p>Third update, begging for support!</p><p></p><p>These days with one update per day, I didn't dare ask for monthly tickets. Ahem, today I'm being straightforward - asking for monthly tickets!</p><p></p><p>And daring to ask for rewards too!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

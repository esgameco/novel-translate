        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The little figure on Liangxiao Shifu's brow moved.</p><p></p><p>The little figure stood upright in the vertical eye on his brow. On the little figure's face, one eye emitted strands of Buddhist light, as if the Immovable Bright King was seated there.  </p><p></p><p>Thousands of rays of light scattered, sweeping over the entire Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"The third king-grade flying sword is hidden beneath these three flying swords."</p><p></p><p>"These three flying swords have evolved into the Three Talents Flying Swords in the form of Heaven, Earth and Man. The king-grade flying sword lies beneath the Three Talents Flying Swords."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Jiuqing looked towards the depths of the Sword Tomb. </p><p></p><p>There, the Three Talents Flying Swords trembled, and the Three Talents Array of Heaven, Earth and Man was manifested. Three sword auras containing the true intent of Heaven, Earth and Man were faintly emanating sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Those were flying swords that had manifested sword intent! Their grade was so high, just half a step away from king-grade.</p><p></p><p>And beneath these three flying swords was the true king-grade flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie stood up and stepped into the Sword Tomb. His eyes were like the starry sky, with brilliant stars spanning billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the flying sword beneath his feet.  </p><p></p><p>This flying sword looked plain and ordinary, with only a faint sword aura leaking out.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's perception, he could only tell that this was a low-grade flying sword without any special characteristics.</p><p></p><p>But as Siwuxie pointed at it, the flying sword suddenly emanated terrifying sword auras, releasing an aura of slaughter, as if it wanted to slaughter all living beings in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Slaughter Sword. This flying sword was born eight thousand years ago, inside the Sword Tomb, even before the Third Patriarch had cultivated the Five Phase Sword Furnace."</p><p></p><p>Each sentence from Siwuxie made Liangxiao Shifu look sideways in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years ago was the era of their ancestral founder.  </p><p></p><p>It was only three thousand years ago that the current Sword Sect leader became the supreme master.</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie even knew the secrets from eight thousand years ago?</p><p></p><p>The Slaughter Sword retracted its slaughter aura and became inconspicuous within the Sword Tomb.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing memorized the position of this flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Among all the flying swords now, this one had the strongest spiritual nature and the greatest power.</p><p></p><p>"Shifu, please!"</p><p></p><p>The little figure in Liangxiao Shifu's vertical eye pointed one hand to the sky and one to the earth, striking a pose of supreme arrogance.</p><p></p><p>The Immovable Bright King's true eye flashed, and the little figure instantly transformed into a Bright King statue!!</p><p></p><p>Composed of countless eyeballs covering its entire body, it pierced through the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Under the full scrutiny of the Immovable Bright King's true eye, Liangxiao Shifu searched the Sword Tomb over and over again, even scouring the void multiple times, before finally locating the sixth king-grade flying sword.</p><p></p><p>The fifth king-grade flying sword was hidden in the central position of the Sword Tomb, closest to the Five Phase Sword Furnace below, absorbing the richest five phase sword intent.  </p><p></p><p>Faint traces of the five sword auras flickered on its body.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth king-grade flying sword has nurtured the great five phase sword intent. Why hasn't your sect taken this flying sword?"</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Shifu pointed at the fifth king-grade flying sword and inquired.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, for the true disciples of the Third Patriarch's lineage who cultivated the five phase sword intent, possessing a king-grade flying sword imbued with the five phase sword intent would be extremely beneficial, potentially even creating a new Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Yet this flying sword had remained in the Sword Tomb for many years, untouched by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie shook his head, "I have no need for this flying sword."</p><p></p><p>"And the other senior brothers have never discovered this flying sword, so this king-grade flying sword has stayed within the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Shifu frowned.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, although the Third Patriarch was a divine figure in the sword path, his true lineage had no successors.  </p><p></p><p>It was best for the fifth king-grade flying sword to remain guarding the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"It's your junior brother's turn now."</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie shook his head again, "There are only five king-grade flying swords in the Sword Tomb, Shifu, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Only five king-grade flying swords?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the positions of the five king-grade flying swords and had already made his choice.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Junior Brother Wuxie, your insight can match my talents."</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Tomb, there were only five flying swords!</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie could accurately state this answer, earning Liangxiao Shifu's approval.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Jiuqing, "Junior Brother, you've identified the locations of the five king-grade flying swords. Now go and choose the one most suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>Liangxiao Shifu had gone through so much trouble!</p><p></p><p>He deliberately competed with Siwuxie to uncover all the king-grade flying swords' locations, just to let Gu Jiuqing make the selection!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Siwuxie showed no reaction, his eyes still full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>Watching Gu Jiuqing step forward...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As Liang Xiao shixiong watched Gu Jiuqing's back entering the Sword Tomb, he suddenly said, "What do you think of this true disciple Mingting's talent? Can he become the number one in this era?"</p><p></p><p>The smile in Si Wuxie's eyes became more concentrated. As he watched Gu Jiuqing's figure, he said lightly, "Shixiong jests. Shixiong Gu's talent is not as good as yours, and his brilliance is even less than yours. If we're talking about being number one in this era, Shixiong Gu can't even make the list for now."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao shixiong smiled slightly, "My shidi is the sword path's number one genius. In recent ancient times, only the Sect Leader has been praised as the sword path's number one genius."</p><p></p><p>He stared at Si Wuxie, "Does the Sect Leader's sword talent not qualify him to be number one in this era?"</p><p></p><p>Number one in the era, the Dao ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Just talking about talent alone, the sword sect's Sect Leader has been praised as number one in recent ancient times!</p><p></p><p>In terms of talent, the sword sect's Sect Leader has already reached the apex.</p><p></p><p>But one's strength is not solely composed of talent, there are also many external factors.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the sword sect's Sect Leader has still been ranked as third in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Not quite, not quite!" </p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie watched Gu Jiuqing's back as he saw Gu Jiuqing pick up that murderous flying sword without hesitation and take it back with him.</p><p></p><p>"If Shixiong Gu was born in any era in ancient times, he would definitely become an immortal. But in the ten thousand years after the recent ancient era, even the sword path's number one genius falls a bit short."</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao shixiong showed an unsatisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>He personally witnessed Gu Jiuqing cultivating thirty dragon and elephant strengths in the Tui Fan realm, nurturing three parts of sword intent, needing divine weapons to suppress his mortal body.</p><p></p><p>While he himself only opened the way of using divine weapons to suppress the mortal body when he reached the Lian Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's talent far surpassed his own back then.</p><p></p><p>It's like having a second Sect Leader in this world!</p><p></p><p>Why can't he become the number one person in the next era?</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong Jiang, why are you getting angry?"</p><p></p><p>Shixiong Jiang!</p><p></p><p>Jiang is Liang Xiao shixiong's surname!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao shixiong's gaze shifted, staring at Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi has heard of Shixiong's achievements. With Shixiong Jiang's talent, he can rank in the top three of this era."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie is too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time Liang Xiao cannot see through a sword sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'd like to hear Shidi's esteemed opinion."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie remained calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The bearing of the sword path's number one genius is unmatched in the world, but in this era, there are at least three people whose talents far exceed Shixiong Gu's!"</p><p></p><p>"One of them is naturally Shixiong Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of years ago, Shixiong Jiang measured the vast heavens, using his body to explore the starry sky, flying into the stars for a hundred years. Shidi has never heard of such a desire to learn. I admire Shixiong Jiang's talent!"</p><p></p><p>Measuring the vast heavens!</p><p></p><p>This is the origin of Liang Xiao shixiong's name.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, Liang Xiao shixiong measured the vast heavens, flying into the starry sky. This act was mocked by the sword sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>But as Liang Xiao shixiong flew past the moon, exceeding the moon, and entered the galaxy, the sword sect was shocked and called him a madman!</p><p></p><p>How could a normal person possibly measure the vast heavens?</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie continued, "If I'm not mistaken, Shixiong Jiang is approaching the Juzhou realm, about to perfect the Ten Great Heavenly Palaces, coupled with Shixiong Jiang's divine abilities, his strength is immeasurably profound."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liang Xiao shixiong asked, "Then who are the other two?"</p><p></p><p>"The other two? The first is naturally the Cheng Xiao Princess who stole the Buddha's Descent method from the Buddhist sect hundreds of years ago."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Xiao Princess?</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao shixiong knew about this princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, the Buddha's Descent method of the Three Worlds Buddha was stolen, shaking the world. The Buddhist sect's Buddhas came to the mortal realm to search for it, and eventually found it with the Great Zhou royal family.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhas were enraged, and the Great Zhou royal family was besieged, but in the end, the matter was left unresolved!</p><p></p><p>And the Cheng Xiao Princess was confined in the imperial capital. For hundreds of years, no news of the Cheng Xiao Princess has been heard.</p><p></p><p>"The third is Shixiong Gu's sister, Gu Linglong."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong?</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao shixiong raised his brows. Even he didn't know that Gu Jiuqing had such a breathtakingly beautiful sister!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The auras of the two catastrophe-level celestial beings intertwined, instantly illuminating the dark world into daylight. Two figures were enveloped in pure yang radiance, appearing like deities manifesting among mortals!</p><p></p><p>The pure yang aura transformed into flying strips of light, shining over the mountains and rivers, leaving the county town pale under their feet. </p><p></p><p>The citizens inside the city were at a loss!</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what was happening. </p><p></p><p>They only knew that the county lord was battling another catastrophe-level celestial elder in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>What about the officials and soldiers in the city?</p><p></p><p>Why didn't they take action? </p><p></p><p>Why didn't they go help?</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The azure sky cracked open, rippling the void. The old county lord wielded a great weapon, a divine spear.</p><p></p><p>The divine spear was thirteen feet long, with patterns of the Dao opening up along its body. Rich Dao aura swirled around him, the pressure of the great weapon sweeping in all directions!</p><p></p><p>The old county lord!</p><p></p><p>With hair as white as snow!</p><p></p><p>He caressed the long spear in his hands, his vital energy soaring like a dragon, fusing with the spear.</p><p></p><p>His true form flickered, vital energy vaporizing, dyeing his white hair blood-red.  </p><p></p><p>And his figure was also expanding!</p><p></p><p>Bulging muscles covered his body, making him appear like a primordial giant.</p><p></p><p>"I cultivated the Primordial Eight Extremes Art, opening the divine gate with my fleshly body to tread the path of the divine!"</p><p></p><p>"However, this art only has four of the eight extremes, the other four buried in the ancient world, impossible to uncover."</p><p></p><p>The old county lord's resounding voice echoed with the heavens and earth. Holding the thirteen-foot divine spear, his giant true form towered far above the weapon.</p><p></p><p>Facing the old lord's giant transformation, the aura of this catastrophe-level celestial from the Ambush Sword Sect also continuously intensified.</p><p></p><p>The two celestials raised their states to the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>"I know of your Primordial Eight Extremes Art - the first four extremes are the Fleshly Body Extreme, Spirit Extreme, Divine Powers Extreme, and Abilities Extreme. The latter four are the Weapon Extremes of saber, sword, spear and halberd!"</p><p></p><p>"Of the eight extremes you cultivated, at least two must be from the latter four, otherwise you would not be facing me today."</p><p></p><p>A pure yang flying strip of light transformed into a golden dragon around the black-robed celestial, undulating with antennae, claws and tail emerging.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You dare battle me yet still hide your identity?"  </p><p></p><p>"Are you not afraid of being slain by me in this realm?"</p><p></p><p>The county lord's aura soared to the heavens, the pressure of his great weapon descending strand by strand, each strand collapsing the void space.</p><p></p><p>His figure became a divine ray of light, wielding the great weapon in a horizontal killing strike!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed celestial smiled faintly. The pure yang flying strip spanned the void, and the golden dragon suddenly expanded dozens of times, formed from clusters of pure yang thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-two pure yang thought-clusters formed into the golden dragon charging at the old lord!</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Catastrophe Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>The spear thrust out like a dragon!</p><p></p><p>The two great dragons clashed in the sky, boundless divine might and pure yang aura extending through the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>After one strike, thirty-two more pure yang thought-clusters flew out from the black-robed celestial's body.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang radiance condensed into a golden spirit body, its appearance indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>The golden spirit body raised its hand!</p><p></p><p>Pointing at the old lord!</p><p></p><p>"Seventh Catastrophe Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>The old lord's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>His giant fleshly body tore apart, his spirit body walking out.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Extreme!</p><p></p><p>Why extreme?</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the pinnacle is it considered an extreme!</p><p></p><p>Among the four extremes the old lord cultivated, one was the Spirit Extreme. Thirty-two pure yang thought-clusters on his spirit body ignited, rolling waves of pure yang aura descending.</p><p></p><p>A vast pure yang radiance bloomed around him.</p><p></p><p>"What's the need?"</p><p></p><p>"The higher the celestial realm, the greater the gap between each level!"</p><p></p><p>Thirty-two pure yang thought-clusters could never match sixty-four. Even by igniting his thought-clusters, he was no match.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed celestial's spirit body merged with the golden dragon, seventy-two pure yang thought-clusters forming a great net enveloping the old lord!</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Striking Art!"</p><p></p><p>The old lord struck out his supreme attack, his spirit body wielding the divine weapon, transforming into a pure yang flying strip.</p><p></p><p>The golden net shredded, the black-robed celestial spitting out blood from the corner of his mouth. He opened his mouth to expel a vase emitting a pale blue glow!</p><p></p><p>"I knew you had the Spirit Slaying Art!"</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>The pale blue vase released a brilliant light, black sand raining down and forming into bloody star clusters, tainting the old lord's pure yang thought-clusters.</p><p></p><p>The spirit strike manifested in mid-air, dark spots appearing on the old lord's spirit body.</p><p></p><p>"This black sand was tainted by the impure blood of a pure yang progenitor elder, further refined with five types of ominous catastrophes. Perfect for breaking your Spirit Slaying Art!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed celestial retrieved the blue vase.</p><p></p><p>The old lord's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>To forge such a treasure required the impure blood of a pure yang progenitor elder and five ominous catastrophes - very few in the world could create such a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang net just now revealed a glimpse of this celestial's abilities!</p><p></p><p>"You are..."</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>"Old man, if you wish to die, feel free to speak!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed celestial roared.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to kill the county lord, but if he dared to reveal his true name, he would have no choice but to take lethal action.</p><p></p><p>At the city gates, the Sword Sect disciples watched in trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable that a sixth catastrophe celestial county lord was no match for this black-robed celestial.</p><p></p><p>Hard to believe someone would set an ambush for celestials at the county town.</p><p></p><p>They were just inner sect disciples of the Sword Sect, did they deserve a celestial ambush?</p><p></p><p>The pure yang aura was terrifying, still illuminating the town, their auras locked by this black-robed celestial.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, another black-robed celestial leaned against it, holding a peach blossom branch he had plucked from inside.</p><p></p><p>"After killing that Sword Sect inheritor, I should return."</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed the aura of that Sword Sect inheritor!</p><p></p><p>One hundred and twenty li away from the county town was an ancient city called Dawn Moon City.</p><p></p><p>That Sword Sect inheritor was in Dawn Moon City.</p><p></p><p>"Why hesitate?"</p><p></p><p>"He's still in Dawn Moon City, reluctant to come?"</p><p></p><p>He smiled faintly, not rushing.</p><p></p><p>With these Sword Sect disciples under his control, he believed that inheritor would eventually fall into the trap.</p><p></p><p>In Dawn Moon City!</p><p></p><p>The citizens looked up at the young man in azure robes standing between the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The sky was dark, only faint rays of light emanating from the youth.</p><p></p><p>This young man was too terrifying - the surrounding void space shattered into ruins, even the divine light on his body disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Heaven's Gate cultivator guarding the city had also been slain by this youth.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this young man is a Sword Sect disciple, a citizen called him Inheritor Gu."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Inheritor Gu? For an inheritor to so easily slay a Heaven's Gate cultivator, the Sword Sect's power is truly formidable."  </p><p></p><p>"But why is he standing over our city?"</p><p></p><p>Darkness enveloped the world as night fell.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood in the vast expanse of the heavens and earth. </p><p></p><p>He had already adopted the horizontal push stance, naturally he would push through horizontally!</p><p></p><p>He had long sensed the auras of those two catastrophe-level celestials.</p><p></p><p>"There are still ten divine weapons I haven't refined, but these fifty-five are enough for me to push through this path."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts touched the Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he absorbed the Dragon Elephant Art from within.</p><p></p><p>Following convention, he first plucked the true meanings of the Dragon Elephant Art.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing plucked strand after strand of the true meanings, more than last time. Thousands of thoughts flew up in his Earth Pill Palace, over three hundred attaining the true meanings.</p><p></p><p>The true meanings fused into the thoughts, each transforming into a miniature Dragon Elephant figure, condensing into a spirit form!</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, over four hundred Dragon Elephant figurines stood in the Earth Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>The rest remained as thoughts.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Jiuqing, the figurines and thoughts merged into a giant Dragon Elephant Celestial spirit form, surpassing the thirty-zhang limit.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial spirit form expanded - thirty-two, thirty-eight, forty...</p><p></p><p>Continuously expanding until reaching forty-nine zhang before stopping!!</p><p></p><p>"A forty-nine zhang spirit body is the limit for catastrophe-level celestials!"</p><p></p><p>Nine zhang is the limit for spirit forms, nine zhang nine for Heaven's Gate spirit bodies. A unified spirit body transcends the nine zhang nine limit, but even reaching over twenty is impressive.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gu Jiuqing's spirit form, before even cultivating into a spirit body or absorbing pure yang aura, had already reached the forty-nine zhang limit of catastrophe celestials!</p><p></p><p>The vast spirit form emanated the myriad laws of creation in an instant, the divine abilities of the Pangu celestial body manifesting one by one.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation can still increase further!"</p><p></p><p>Realms could no longer constrain Gu Jiuqing's battle prowess.</p><p></p><p>"The attainments of the Dragon Elephant Art shall also come with me!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he would push through the world horizontally, using his own strength to dominate the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The 49 zhang tall Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul touched the Dao fruit, instantly drawing in the cultivation of the Dragon Elephant Art from Jiangnan Province, one of the 23 provinces in the Dragon Kingdom that practiced it.  </p><p></p><p>Last time!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed two months' worth of Dragon Elephant Art cultivation from Jiangnan Province, drawing in the power of 70,000 dragon elephants.</p><p></p><p>But this time!</p><p></p><p>He absorbed over three months, almost four months of cultivation from Jiangnan Province's 50 million people!!</p><p></p><p>It was an immense, boundless amount of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>First, the vital energy washed over his physical body. Gu Jiuqing's flesh was originally comparable to a thousand-lined divine weapon - a single strand of his hair could crush a Realm of Non-Phase expert.</p><p></p><p>But now, under the scouring of this Dragon Elephant vital energy, his flesh was instantly cracked open.</p><p></p><p>His body shattered like porcelain, cracks appearing everywhere, but the Dragon Elephant energy quickly repaired it.</p><p></p><p>This surge of energy manifested as illusions of real dragons and celestial elephants intertwining. Gu Jiuqing's body underwent cycles of destruction and rebirth.</p><p></p><p>His flesh became incredibly powerful, indestructible - even the Nine Revolutions Golden Body could not match it!!</p><p></p><p>The Pangu Divine Body embraced the Unphased Mountain and also absorbed a great deal of the Dragon Elephant's primal essence. Each strand of Pangu's hair took on the appearance of real dragons and celestial elephants!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the strands settled into stillness. </p><p></p><p>Under the scouring of the vital energy, another illusion arose - that of dragon elephant power weaving through his flesh.</p><p></p><p>On the 15th vertebra, dragon elephant images instantly materialized.  </p><p></p><p>148 million dragon elephants, manifested in an instant! On the 15th, 16th, 17th vertebrae, 220,000 dragon elephants stood!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt his body grow heavier, as if it would shatter.</p><p></p><p>He hastily sacrificed the Celestial Pearls, throwing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Celestial Pearls into the Unphased Mountain to suppress the power in his flesh. Only then did the feeling of impending destruction dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"One province, 220,000 dragon elephants, condensing two great Dragon Elephant Kingdoms!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, even the Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul cracked a smile.</p><p></p><p>It knew!</p><p></p><p>This time, its power would reach new heights.</p><p></p><p>Its strength would push through all eternity!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Pearls bloomed, opening 999 Dao marks. The 30 opened Celestial Pearls rippled alongside other divine weapons, forming a magnificent scene.</p><p></p><p>After opening 30 Celestial Pearls, Gu Jiuqing began absorbing the Dragon Elephant cultivation from the other provinces of the Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy transformed into real dragons and celestial elephants, scouring his body. After a few breaths of impact, his flesh cracked open again.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent energy repaired it, his body undergoing constant cycles of destruction and rebirth, strengthening again and again, shattering repeatedly. In the end, Gu Jiuqing couldn't even remember how many times his flesh had been destroyed!</p><p></p><p>"Twenty times? Thirty? Or fifty?"</p><p></p><p>With so many changes in his flesh, Gu Jiuqing's focus was on the Unphased Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The vertebrae on the Unphased Mountain were visibly filling up, one by one.</p><p></p><p>100,000 dragon elephants made up one kingdom, filling a single vertebra. The Dragon Elephant cultivation of one province could fill two vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed five provinces at once, the dragon elephants occupying 10 vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>Of the 33 vertebrae, 27 were filled by the cultivation of just six provinces.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what changes will occur when all 33 vertebrae are filled with dragon elephants."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed more provinces - Xijiang, Dongshan, Nanshan.</p><p></p><p>The 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd vertebrae were all filled!</p><p></p><p>Six Dragon Elephant Kingdoms condensed, 600,000 dragon elephant powers manifested at once! On the 33 vertebrae stood 33 Dragon Elephant Kingdoms!</p><p></p><p>And only 16 Celestial Pearls had been used, with 14 more opening 999 Dao marks but not being utilized.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of 3.3 million dragon elephants?"</p><p></p><p>The 49 zhang Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul could clearly sense its own strength!</p><p></p><p>"I've only absorbed the Dragon Elephant cultivation from nine provinces so far. There are still 14 provinces and five capital cities whose cultivation I haven't absorbed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't step into the void, still standing above Xiaoyue City. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to continue absorbing the mortals' cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish ------"</p><p></p><p>"Power! I want boundless, majestic power!!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul's divine sense touched his thoughts, and Gu Jiuqing absorbed the 10th province's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant vital energy roiled in his flesh, but after so many enhancements, it no longer cracked his body - it steadily refined the energy, strengthening his flesh!</p><p></p><p>The Pangu Divine Body absorbed the Dragon Elephant's primal essence, while the Dragon Elephant power condensed in Gu Jiuqing's flesh.</p><p></p><p>But this time!</p><p></p><p>The condensed Dragon Elephant power didn't appear in his flesh, but in his Celestial Windows instead!</p><p></p><p>His Celestial Windows shook, though Gu Jiuqing hadn't cultivated his spirit. Dragon elephants occupied the windows.</p><p></p><p>1,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 - soon 100,000 dragon elephants dominated the first Celestial Window. </p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Jiuqing sent a divine weapon flying into the window!</p><p></p><p>Suppressing this Dragon Elephant Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The second Celestial Window opened, another 100,000 dragon elephants gathering. Gu Jiuqing did the same, using a Celestial Pearl to suppress this kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephants can form 33 kingdoms on the vertebrae, totaling 3.3 million."</p><p></p><p>"Then they can further condense into the Celestial Windows, one kingdom of 100,000 per window, suppressed by a divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing threw the 14 Celestial Pearls from the Unphased Mountain into 14 Celestial Windows.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't enough!</p><p></p><p>14 Windows was only the cultivation of 7 provinces.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sacrificed 16 more Celestial Pearls, for a total of 30 - enough for the remaining 14 provinces plus the 5 capital cities.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons suppressed the Dragon Elephant Kingdoms in each Window that opened prematurely.</p><p></p><p>One kingdom per 100,000 dragon elephants!</p><p></p><p>Watching the condensing kingdoms and Celestial Pearls, an invincible confidence welled up from the depths of Gu Jiuqing's Dao heart, filling his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Powerful!</p><p></p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Jiuqing's 49 zhang Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul was amazed looking at his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the 23 provinces and 5 capitals gave me 4.8 million dragon elephants. Adding the previous 1.5 million..."</p><p></p><p>That's 6.3 million dragon elephant powers!</p><p></p><p>63 Dragon Elephant Kingdoms!!</p><p></p><p>The force of each dragon elephant could move the island mountain Gu Jiuqing was on!</p><p></p><p>With such power gathered, Gu Jiuqing worried he was too strong, that he might tear apart Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>But this power was not his limit.</p><p></p><p>The 1 billion people of the Dragon Kingdom, 1 billion dragon elephants - that was his limit!</p><p></p><p>If 1 billion people cultivated the Dragon Elephant Art to the 22nd stance's one-tenth perfection, Gu Jiuqing could gain 100 million dragon elephant powers.</p><p></p><p>His current 6.3 million was still far from the 100 million limit.</p><p></p><p>Far from the extreme!</p><p></p><p>"My current flesh is many times stronger than a thousand-lined divine weapon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood in the vast world, his Dragon Elephant Celestial Soul dissipating into 400 thought-seeds that became miniature Dragon Elephant Souls.</p><p></p><p>"The elevation of the Dragon Elephant's primal essence also greatly strengthened my Pangu Divine Body. I only used 48 Celestial Pearls, so I could continue absorbing the mortals' cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>With 6.3 million dragon elephant powers and an indestructible body, he now wanted to test just how strong he had become!!</p><p></p><p>Space rippled!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing moved!</p><p></p><p>And this single movement was like heavenly thunder stirring earthly fires - the surrounding void shattered completely!!</p><p></p><p>Shards of void collapsed into dust.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't even use his Dragon Elephant powers, simply taking a step.</p><p></p><p>But that step was comparable to when he used the Dragon Elephant Kingdoms to crush the vacuum earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack -------"</p><p></p><p>The void tore apart, the vacuum shattered. The image of the Ruined City reappeared above Xiaoyue City, moonlight raining down only to be pulverized as well.</p><p></p><p>"That Gu Zhenchuan has moved!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems he's heading for the prefecture city!"</p><p></p><p>The citizens of the city looked at Gu Jiuqing's figure as if watching a deity descend.</p><p></p><p>The magistrate of Xiaoyue City twitched his eyelid seeing that figure step into the void.</p><p></p><p>"He's leaving! That ominous star is finally leaving!"</p><p></p><p>News from the prefecture city had reached Xiaoyue. He knew two Realm of Tribulation experts were waiting in the prefecture for this ominous star.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, he was finally leaving!</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyue City could rest easy!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters! Begging for more chapters!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

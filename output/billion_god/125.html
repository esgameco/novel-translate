        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou Prefecture City, this was the prefecture city of one of the nine states, Yuzhou. Many human tribes lived in this place. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was a cultivation world, so there were also quite a few cultivators in the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who had shed mortal form, cultivators of magical powers, cultivators below the celestial realm, cultivators refining their divine souls, and even Realized Beings of the celestial realm, all gazed up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There!</p><p></p><p>An enormous figure towered over the universe.  </p><p></p><p>Huge!</p><p></p><p>Too huge!</p><p></p><p>The true form of a Bodhisattva was projected above, as if sculpted from clay and poured with loess soil. Sixteen arms swept against the azure sky, each arm supporting a Buddhist realm. Streams of Buddhist dharma poured down like an ocean, transforming into clouds of golden color that covered Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva! This is the Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva!"</p><p></p><p>"This Bodhisattva has actually manifested his sacred form!"</p><p></p><p>Of the four great teachings, the Sword Sect guards the northern lands, while the Celestial Stars Sect guards the southern ridges. These two great sects transcend the secular world. Aside from their disciples traveling the world, they generally do not linger in the nine states, and do not even have branch sects there.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike them, the Buddhist and Taoist teachings have many followers in the nine states, as well as temples and monasteries.</p><p></p><p>Taoist believers revere the Taoist ancestor as supreme, followed by the Three Purities and various celestial emperors of antiquity.</p><p></p><p>Buddhist believers worship the Buddha ancestors, the Buddhas of the past, present and future, and the Four Great Bodhisattvas.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the death of the first emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty nine hundred years ago that Buddhism and Taoism began to spread their teachings in the nine states.</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred years later, Bodhisattvas, Celestial Worthies and Buddhas had deeply taken root in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>But mortals had never seen Bodhisattvas, Celestial Worthies or Buddhas before. Today, with a Bodhisattva manifesting his sacred form, how could Buddhist believers not go into raptures?</p><p></p><p>Within the prefecture city, many pious men and women piously prostrated themselves on the ground, bowing towards the clay Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"We pay reverence to the Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva of Vast Tranquility!"</p><p></p><p>With each bow of worship, indescribable threads flew upwards and landed on the clay Bodhisattva, causing the Bodhisattva to radiate even more dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>The loess body transformed into a golden body, its majestic golden Buddhist form overwhelming the entire prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>In the city, various immortal patriarchs and ancient monsters emerged from seclusion one after another, looking at the Bodhisattva's manifestation with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Even we dare not obstruct the spread of Buddhist teachings. This sword disciple dared to kill an Arhat and exterminate Buddhist protectors - he truly has some of the spirit of the primordial Sword Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"However, without the primordial Sword Ancestor, the current Sword Sect cannot rise again relying solely on Jiang Xingcun!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, the Sword Sect can barely preserve itself. In the great battle three thousand years ago, the three integrated Realized Beings of the Sword Sect either died or were severely injured. Yet they still dare to provoke the Buddhists?"</p><p></p><p>The immortal patriarchs could only watch the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>With the Buddhist forces so powerful, they could only be spectators.</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful eyes, the sixteen celestial arms swayed, shaking the void. Within the sixteen Buddhist realms in the Bodhisattva's palms, the images of Buddhist believers were reflected, descending upon Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>Ripples from the divine realms, bathing the world in golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three were swallowed by the divine realms.</p><p></p><p>The void shook, and Buddhist light flashed, surrounded by the images of Buddhist believers.</p><p></p><p>"Buddha Buddha Buddha Buddha ————"</p><p></p><p>"Buddha Buddha Buddha ————"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Buddha entered their ears deeply.</p><p></p><p>Seeking to convert Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The void shifted, and the world before their eyes transformed. The images of believers vanished, along with the forms of Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao and Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Western Paradise that the Celestial Feather Lord witnessed back then?"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing's eyes was a magnificent mansion.</p><p></p><p>Luxuriously palatial, even before he could stand upright, beautiful ladies, graceful and charming, came walking over.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Master! It's my turn to serve you today!"</p><p></p><p>"No, yesterday Master said in my quarters that you still wanted to keep me company."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, when will it be my turn? I've already waited for Master for half a month."</p><p></p><p>Plump or slender, petite or mature, gentle or domineering - ladies of all types manifested in the mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had witnessed the bewitching charms of celestial fairies and the sacred beauty of celestial maidens, but even his mind wavered slightly now.</p><p></p><p>Exquisite beauty! Unparalleled!</p><p></p><p>Whatever he thought or desired could be touched.</p><p></p><p>"Just an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are you saying? If Master doesn't want me, then just go find my sisters. Why make such excuses to brush me off?"</p><p></p><p>The lady wore a golden hairpin, her slim waist accentuated as she stood with a slight frown on her beautiful face, looking utterly adorable.</p><p></p><p>Her fair skin outshone snow itself, and one could vaguely see the white undergarments and a glimpse of her tender thighs through the sheer fabric, bewitching the soul.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the appearance and attire of one lady.</p><p></p><p>The other ladies were even more alluring, some voluptuous beauties only draped in sheer robes, their figures clearly visible within.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the external manifestation shaped by the inner psyche?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze remained pure.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ladies, marveling at the terrifying power of the illusory realm to create such vivid manifestations from the void.</p><p></p><p>Though he knew it was an illusion, to these ladies, Gu Jiuqing and this mansion were real.</p><p></p><p>Their entire lives had already been delineated, and with flesh and blood, if transported to the mortal realm from this Buddhist realm, they would become living people!</p><p></p><p>"Disperse!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lightly exhaled, and the scene instantly transformed.</p><p></p><p>The world darkened, ripples appeared in the void, and wisps of sacrificial fire energy surged in from all directions, pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky changed color, the earth sank, and an unimaginable force instantly filled his entire being.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Soul realm! All the celestial apertures opened one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial realm, with ten celestial palaces formed, three souls and seven spirits merged into the final spirit soul.</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation realm, with lightning tribulations descending, pure yang thoughts churning, quickly condensing into two hundred and fifty-six pure yang thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Realized realm! Spirit soul of pure yang, fleshly body of pure yang, magical powers of pure yang! An integrated trinity.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't end there!</p><p></p><p>A portal suddenly opened within Gu Jiuqing's body, releasing threads of divinity.</p><p></p><p>His integrated true form infused with this divinity - spirit soul became divine, fleshly body became divine, magical powers became divine, transforming into a deity.</p><p></p><p>A sense of omniscience and omnipotence arose from the depths of his heart.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was too wonderful!</p><p></p><p>"The Western Paradise, if it could become a great world for me to indulge in, what's the harm?"</p><p></p><p>But this was merely a false illusion, created by the power of sacrificial fire and belief, causing Gu Jiuqing to fall into delusion, thinking he had achieved divinity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed, and that majestic power instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the void again, manifesting more illusions!</p><p></p><p>It was the Western Paradise creating an idyllic world for Gu Jiuqing, leaving only joy and no sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the transforming world coldly, like a deity looking down upon mortals, utterly unmoved.</p><p></p><p>All aspects of life were manifested, but eventually the Western Paradise could no longer create further temptations and shattered directly.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding world was woven with myriad rays of light, and Buddhist voices rang in his ears.</p><p></p><p>The illusory forms of Buddhist believers appeared in the palms of the Buddhist realms.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Brother! You've awakened so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's voice emerged amidst the Buddhist chants.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao looked at Gu Jiuqing in astonishment!</p><p></p><p>That was the vaunted conversion technique of Buddhism. For him to break free of the Western Paradise illusion so quickly meant there must have been a flaw in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>In the Western Paradise illusion, he became an unmatched demon lord.</p><p></p><p>He sliced the patriarchs of the four great teachings, sliced the Great Zhou emperor, sliced demon emperors and fiendish sovereigns into pieces.</p><p></p><p>He indulged in this, creating an unmatched great dharma, celestial spirit soul, pure yang tribulation realm, an integrated trinity, even cultivating to divinity!</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>During a casual slicing, he accidentally sliced his fleshly body into three thousand and one pieces! Yet when he reassembled this person's body, they still revived!</p><p></p><p>This was impossible - after slicing the fleshly body into three thousand pieces, that was the limit. One more slice and the vital essence, energy and spirit would rapidly dissipate from the body.</p><p></p><p>He instantly realized that he was in the Western Paradise illusion!</p><p></p><p>The two of them awakened, while beside them, Lu Yuan sat dazed in the void, merged with the other devout Buddhist believers.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had already fallen into the Western Paradise illusion, unable to break free from Buddhism's conversion technique.</p><p></p><p>"Buddhism's conversion technique can only be broken through one's own efforts, unless the caster is interrupted."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's voice grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>To save Lu Yuan, they would have to destroy this dharma body of the Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva of Vast Tranquility that had been condensed.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing was puzzled in his heart, "Back then in the Sword Tomb, I heard Senior Martial Brother mention the Immovable Wisdom King's True Eye, saying he had killed a Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that in Buddhism, the Buddhas are actually weaker than Bodhisattvas?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would Senior Martial Brother be fleeing now?</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao explained, "Back then, I only killed the dharma body of a Buddha who had passed into the past. After crossing the nine lightning tribulations, one can attempt to enter the pure yang realm and cultivate a pure yang dharma body - that is, becoming a 'one-body' cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"An ancient 'one-body' patriarch is far more powerful than a cultivator of the ninth lightning tribulation realm. The dharma body they casually condense has the strength equivalent to a seventh or eighth lightning tribulation cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"For 'two-body' or even 'three-body' pure yang paragons, the dharma bodies they condense possess the power of the ninth lightning tribulation realm. But they cannot surpass an actual 'one-body' cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The pure yang patriarchs were the most powerful existences in this world.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha's dharma body I killed back then was the past Buddha's dharma body, which was suppressing the demon pit at that time. I used all sorts of methods before finally managing to slay it."</p><p></p><p>Recounting this, Liang Xiao still felt some lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>"After that, I secluded myself for thirty years at the Nameless Peak to recover from my injuries."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>He always felt that this Senior Martial Brother's strength was far beyond what was apparent.</p><p></p><p>The past Buddha's strength should have surpassed the Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva of Vast Tranquility, who was at least a 'one-body' pure yang patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The past Buddha may have been a 'two-body' cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Yet facing the dharma power condensed by the Bodhisattva, why didn't Senior Martial Brother take action to destroy it?</p><p></p><p>Was he hiding his true strength?</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>Rifts tore open in the void above.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer of Buddhist realms covered the world, with the sixteen arms stacking the sixteen Buddhist realms together.</p><p></p><p>And the location of Gu Jiuqing and the others was within the innermost of these sixteen palms.</p><p></p><p>A Buddhist voice descended from beyond the heavens - it was the voice of the Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva of Vast Tranquility!</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect's Jiang Buyu, hmm, or is it Jiang Buyu? Or perhaps Jiang Liangxiao? It doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"I, the Buddha, have heard of you!"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva's voice fell upon the Buddhist realms, stirring up waves of golden lotuses.</p><p></p><p>Celestial blossoms danced chaotically in the air, while golden lotuses gushed forth from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Celestial blossoms rained down, golden lotuses sprang from the earth - these were the auspicious signs of a Bodhisattva's manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Liang Xiao killed the dharma body of a Buddha, it shook the entire Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>But with Liang Xiao staying within the Sword Sect's territory, the Buddhists could not easily enter.</p><p></p><p>Now that Liang Xiao had stepped out of the Sword Sect, it gave the Buddhists an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing finally understood why Master Cunyin had not allowed Senior Martial Brother to leave the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the master did not know the great calamity Senior Martial Brother had provoked in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"The previous generation's Sword Ancestor, this generation's Sword Ancestor... hmm, and now you, the paramount Sword cultivator of this era. The Sword Sect has produced three geniuses capable of reaching the Realized realm in a single generation - even I must be wary!"</p><p></p><p>The Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva's voice remained calm and composed, unlike a human voice, but rather the sound of the heavens and earth, devoid of any joy, anger, sorrow or pleasure.</p><p></p><p>It contained the profound meanings of vastness, magnitude and profundity.</p><p></p><p>Mighty ancient beings, deathless patriarchs, ancient monsters!</p><p></p><p>This pressure made Gu Jiuqing feel, for the first time, what a true ancient monster was.</p><p></p><p>He had previously fought on equal footing with the Demon Emperor in the eighth lightning tribulation realm, but that was the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Whereas this Greatly Powerful Bodhisattva's true form may not even match the Demon Emperor's.</p><p></p><p>But the auspicious signs he was displaying were too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Boundless and limitless, Buddhist dharma pervading everywhere, the azure sky covered by his golden Buddhist form.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's vision, there was only this majestic golden Buddhist form.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother! You two awakened so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>A surprised voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood up beside Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the layers of divine realms appearing in the sky, and the golden Bodhisattva body above the sixteen realms with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the legendary Bodhisattva?"</p><p></p><p>The golden Bodhisattva body, power without limits, majestic form, standing in the mortal realm, emanating the three profound meanings of vastness, magnitude and profundity, pervading heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Before Lu Yuan finished speaking, Gu Jiuqing sensed Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao making a move.</p><p></p><p>Divine light radiated from Liang Xiao's body, all his celestial apertures opening one by one. Ten celestial palaces converged above his head.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth celestial palace has formed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing clearly remembered that previously, Liang Xiao had said that once he formed the ten celestial palaces, he could suppress</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Strength equates to nobility of status. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, those standing inside the government compound were true immortals, celestial beings!</p><p></p><p>The governor of Yuzhou, who had governed Yuzhou for many years, was recently bestowed the title of Great General Garrison of the Nation by the Son of Heaven of the Great Zhou Dynasty upon Princess Chengxiao. He and the other eight provincial governors entered the imperial capital to remonstrate!</p><p></p><p>That was why he remained awake at this moment. </p><p></p><p>With his lofty status and position, mundane matters could no longer sway him.</p><p></p><p>Not just the governor of Yuzhou, but several other immortals at the Catastrophe realm were also in secluded meditation, comprehending the pure yang mindset, preparing to brave the Tribulation Lightning.</p><p></p><p>They gazed at the sky outside the government compound!</p><p></p><p>That was the scene of the Golden Buddha manifesting in the mortal realm, Buddhist dharma flowing into Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's figure was exaggeratedly enormous, deliberately made so by the Bodhisattva Guangping.</p><p></p><p>"Too audacious! Does the Buddhist sect really think they can bully the nine prefectures with no opposition?" </p><p></p><p>An elder from an aristocratic clan angrily spoke out.</p><p></p><p>But he did not step half a foot outside the government compound.</p><p></p><p>If the Buddhists heard this, even if this elder didn't die, he might be converted the next day.</p><p></p><p>Even immortals at the Celestial realm could not withstand the Buddhists' conversion techniques.</p><p></p><p>Another elder exclaimed in shock,</p><p></p><p>"That is!"</p><p></p><p>"There are Tribulation Clouds covering Yuzhou Prefecture at this moment, someone is summoning the Tribulation Lightning here?"</p><p></p><p>An immortal at the Catastrophe realm was braving the Tribulation at this moment? </p><p></p><p>That direction was precisely where the Bodhisattva Guangping's golden bodily manifestation was located.</p><p></p><p>"One of the three disciples from the Sword Sect has summoned the Tribulation Lightning!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal from the Sword Sect summoned the divine lightning from the nine heavens to break through the great Buddhist dharma!</p><p></p><p>But how could one overcome the Tribulation Lightning?</p><p></p><p>The ancient monstrous beings all revealed looks of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sound transmitted from beyond the heavens, and the ancient immortals stepped out of the government compound one by one.</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful gazes, the Bodhisattva Guangping's numerous arms extended, expelling Buddhist worlds one after another.</p><p></p><p>Only then did three figures reappear in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of the Sword Sect stood in the void.  </p><p></p><p>The one on the far left had a majestic aura, with his primordial spirit flying out behind his back - it was he who summoned the Tribulation Lightning!</p><p></p><p>The one on the far right was at the Unformed realm?</p><p></p><p>Hmm, their gazes withdrew from Luyuan and turned towards the middle Sword Sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>This Sword Immortal trod the void, with indescribable auras undulating around his body.  </p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva Guangping's golden bodily manifestation stared fixedly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"This aura!!"</p><p></p><p>"So bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>"Vague and elusive, indefinable. It seems to originate from the future yet disappear in the present, somewhat resembling the Future Stars Scripture from the Constellations Pavilion! But it's even more like the future dharma of Buddhism!"</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out from inside the government compound.</p><p></p><p>These were all ancient monstrosities, ancient immortals.</p><p></p><p>Their knowledge encompassed even the wisdom of celestial beings.  </p><p></p><p>At a glance, they recognized the strangeness of the aura surrounding Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva Guangping hung upside down in the sky!</p><p></p><p>His head faced downwards, directly meeting Gu Jiuqing's gaze.</p><p></p><p>His sixteen arms swayed in the void, while the golden lotus pedestal beneath his feet hovered at the highest point, piercing through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Future Buddha who presided over the future was said to be the first holy son of the Constellations Pavilion, but this holy son later defected from the Constellations Pavilion and took refuge under the Buddha, becoming his disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Future Stars Scripture transformed into the current Future Dharma of Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, the aura on you is wrong!"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva smiled and his sixteen arms descended towards Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"You're stalling for him."</p><p></p><p>He saw through it!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu was summoning the Tribulation Lightning and needed to focus all his efforts to confront it.  </p><p></p><p>During the Tribulation, he could only watch from the sidelines. If he took action, the Tribulation Lightning would lock onto him as the one braving the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>And after Jiang Buyu overcame the Tribulation Lightning, he would enter a weakened state!</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented Jiang Buyu was, once weakened, the Bodhisattva could easily suppress him with a flick of a finger!</p><p></p><p>Now, it was time to subdue this Sword Sect disciple pretending to be the Past Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The sixteen descending arms, sixteen divine worlds shaking heaven and earth, Buddhist worlds in his palms pressing down, rippling the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure walked out from Gu Jiuqing's body!</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Jiuqing's voice was heard, slowly drifting into Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, I have a technique, please observe."</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao frowned!</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand what Gu Jiuqing was doing.  </p><p></p><p>He was a disciple of the Traceless Cultivator, Gu Jiuqing's senior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for his junior martial brother to throw his life away against a Bodhisattva's dharma body!</p><p></p><p>He could unleash his full foundation and trump cards, which would be enough to suppress the Bodhisattva's manifestation.  </p><p></p><p>As a last resort, he could call out his master's true name.</p><p></p><p>With the Three-in-One Celestial Realm cultivation of the Traceless Cultivator, he could sever the Bodhisattva with a sword strike across the nine prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Under his watchful gaze, a figure walked out from Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>Clad in a blue robe like Gu Jiuqing, even their appearances were identical. He trod the void, and that indescribable aura became even more concentrated.</p><p></p><p>However, soon after, this aura dissipated, transforming into streams of pure yang energy!  </p><p></p><p>Was this a spiritual body? Or a dharma body, an immortal at the Catastrophe realm.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's eyes flickered, and numerous pupils appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Bizarre, truly bizarre, could this be Junior Martial Brother's true self? But there's no reason for a dharma body to be stronger than one's true self."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, Junior Martial Brother, you really hide many secrets."</p><p></p><p>As the paramount of the Sword Dao, why didn't he use his sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Swoosh————</p><p></p><p>The azure sky and earth, even the clouds condensed in the heavens, seemed to slightly coagulate. The rumbling thunder was frozen in place, as if obstructed by some invisible force.  </p><p></p><p>The sixteen descending arms paused momentarily in mid-air before continuing their descent.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen divine worlds, like sixteen heavens and earths, plummeted from above.</p><p></p><p>Innumerable Buddhist rays shone, undulating. The Future Buddha's great dao also stirred at this moment.  </p><p></p><p>Vast! Profound! Profound!</p><p></p><p>Three realms emanated from the Future Buddha's body, pure yang energy flowing.</p><p></p><p>A crystalline translucent finger descended, shattering the void. The sixteen divine worlds collapsed layer by layer under this finger.</p><p></p><p>"Each of the sixteen Buddhist worlds in his palms has a flaw. With my divine eye, I've only found the flaws in nine of those worlds!"</p><p></p><p>But this dharma body actually found the flaws in all sixteen worlds in an instant, effortlessly shattering them with just a finger.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's eyes flickered, filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's muddy eyes swirled, his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye activating.  </p><p></p><p>The ancient Eight Trigrams Patriarch in his Mudball Palace was exhausted from breaking through the Realm of Utmost Bliss, consuming too much of his mental energy.</p><p></p><p>But now, the weariness of this ancient patriarch vanished.</p><p></p><p>"This spiritual body seems to be the embodiment of the great dao walking the mortal realm. My Eight Trigrams Divine Eye was gouged out by Jiang Buyu, but it still couldn't perceive the flaws in all sixteen divine worlds!"</p><p></p><p>Even with more time, the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye couldn't find all the flaws in the sixteen worlds.</p><p></p><p>But this spiritual body instantly saw through the flaws with just a glance and effortlessly shattered them.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer the level of a learned celestial being or someone with extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>The divine worlds collapsed from the heavens, crashing into the center of Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The civilians were terrified, watching the falling fragments of the divine worlds and screaming in horror. But as the fragments fell, they realized these fragments did not crush any houses or kill anyone.  </p><p></p><p>They then looked back up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above!</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds swirled!</p><p></p><p>The Future Buddha's great dao body trod the void, retracting that crystalline translucent finger.  </p><p></p><p>His eyes were devoid of human emotion or desire, as impartial as the great dao itself treating all living beings as mere dogs.</p><p></p><p>The sixteen motionless arms, the Bodhisattva Guangping hanging upside down in the void, he frowned deeply as he looked at the spiritual body beside Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"The Future Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the Future Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>The great dao body moved again, ignoring the Bodhisattva's words.  </p><p></p><p>His dharmic powers shook the heavens, pure yang thoughts interweaving, extending another finger!</p><p></p><p>The enormous golden dharma body did not resist, instead laughing uproariously.  </p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Future Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"My Buddha has finally found you!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait until my Buddha's true form takes action, then I'll come for you!"</p><p></p><p>The Future Buddha's terrifying aura surged. With a point of his finger, pure yang energy refined, piercing the void. The sixteen arms were shattered one by one, the golden dharma body destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The massive figure dissipated, yellow earth crumbling, falling from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>A shower of mud rained down on Yuzhou Prefecture, covering some people's figures like stone statues.</p><p></p><p>Without a great battle, just a muddy downpour ended this conflict.  </p><p></p><p>"Huh? The Bodhisattva Guangping's golden dharma body was destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Bodhisattva Guangping became renowned long ago as a third generation Buddhist disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The Four Great Bodhisattvas had long cultivated to the Pure Yang Ancient Immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>Their manifestation bodies were no weaker than seventh or eighth level Catastrophe realm celestials.</p><p></p><p>How could Gu Jiuqing's summoned Future Buddha's great dao body, at only the eighth level of Catastrophe realm, so easily suppress and kill it?</p><p></p><p>Voices of doubt rang out within Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, not far from the Illusory Void Tavern, Liang Xiao gazed at the Tribulation Lightning in the sky!</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, are you the Future Buddha?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao asked.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew the Future Buddha's great dao body. How could he be the Future Buddha?</p><p></p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p></p><p>Not the Future Buddha?</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's expression remained grave, "It seems you've been chosen by the Future Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"What does Senior Martial Brother mean?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Future Buddha's great dao body came from the Six Realms Diagram, which he refined to gain this body.  </p><p></p><p>He couldn't be the Future Buddha!</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist Past Buddha, Present Buddha, and Future Buddha are actually three manifestation bodies of the Buddha Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, even Gu Jiuqing was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The three Buddhas were manifestations of the Buddha Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Was the Flower Treasure Arhat Monk also a manifestation of the Buddha?</p><p></p><p>What about the other Four Great Bodhisattvas?</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao nodded slightly, "You guessed correctly, the Four Great Bodhisattvas are also manifestations of the Buddha Ancestor."  </p><p></p><p>When he previously suppressed the Past Buddha's dharma body and sliced it apart, he learned this information, leaving him utterly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he remained secluded in the Sword Sect for decades, fearing the Buddha Ancestor would come for him!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Buddha Ancestor did not discover this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Not many know of this, Junior Martial Brother, do not spread it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao transmitted his voice again,</p><p></p><p>"The Future Buddha was originally the first holy son of the Constellations Pavilion, but this holy son later defected from the Constellations Pavilion and was accepted as the Buddha Ancestor's disciple, bestowed the title of Future Buddha."</p><p></p><p>When the Flower Treasure Arhat Monk appeared, he had already refined the Past and Present Buddhas.  </p><p></p><p>The Future Buddha cultivated the Future Stars Scripture and the Buddhist Sumeru Scripture of the past, comprehending the secret classics of two of the four great teachings in the world.</p><p></p><p>His strength was the strongest among the three Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly allow himself to be refined?</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Future Buddha slaughtered his way out of the Westernmost Heaven. Later, the Buddha Ancestor personally took action to subdue him!</p><p></p><p>The Future Buddha subdued by the Buddha Ancestor was only his golden body. The true Future Buddha had already escaped the Western Territories with his dharma treasury.  </p><p></p><p>This was a closely guarded secret of Buddhism. If not for Liang Xiao slicing apart the Past Buddha's dharma body, he would never have learned this secret.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Bodhisattva Guangping so readily abandoned his dharma body.  </p><p></p><p>He was going to summon his true form to descend upon the nine prefectures!</p><p></p><p>"I suspect the three celestial venerables accepted as disciples by the Dao Ancestor are also manifestation bodies of the Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Buddha Ancestor's three manifestations of Past, Future, and Present Buddha!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor's three manifestations of the Three Celestial Venerables!</p><p></p><p>Weren't these the Three Corpses of Buddhism and Daoism?</p><p></p><p>"Ancient immortals! Monstrous beings!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing inwardly sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Buddha Ancestor or Dao Ancestor, but now he felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Just the actions of these two paramount figures could terrify the world!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerables and Buddhas were all Pure Yang Ancient Immortals, existing as a singular entity, or even as a Three-in-One entity!</p><p></p><p>Yet these Ancient Immortals were actually refined by the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor??</p><p></p><p>Hard to believe, just how powerful were these two paramount figures of the world, ranked first and second.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother, it's not good. That Bodhisattva has awakened!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely talented, arguably the most talented in this era.  </p><p></p><p>But his talents only began accumulating nine hundred years ago. With just nine hundred years of cultivation, no matter how talented Liang Xiao was, it would be difficult for him to directly confront a Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked westward!</p><p></p><p>In the extreme western region of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the Western Territories.</p><p></p><p>It was from this area that a terrifying aura was awakening - a true Pure Yang Ancient Immortal was awakening in this era.</p><p></p><p>Pure Yang Ancient Immortals were different from ninth level Catastrophe realm celestials. They had completely purified their primordial spirits into pure yang form, with primordial spirits hundreds or even thousands of feet tall, all pure yang bodies.</p><p></p><p>A single thought dropped from them was a pure yang thought. If they ignited their pure yang thoughts, they could unleash great or even supreme strikes!</p><p></p><p>When a Pure Yang Ancient Immortal walked the world, all major powers had to be cautious.  </p><p></p><p>Even the governors</p>

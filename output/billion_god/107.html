        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Light!</p><p></p><p>The sky was filled with brilliant radiance!</p><p></p><p>The primordial light, carrying divine might, scattered across the azure heavens. </p><p></p><p>Another beam of light came from the supreme sword intent of the Great Name Peak.</p><p></p><p>These two lights simultaneously blossomed upon the moon.</p><p></p><p>All living beings gazed in awe at the divine strike and divine sword.</p><p></p><p>From the celestial beast in the starry sky, streams of figures flew towards the heavens, manifesting divine powers and spirit weapons one by one, intending to shatter the five divine wheels that sealed the Beast Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But the supreme instrument was unmatched. Activated, the dao traces seemed to embody the order of the great dao, solidifying in midair!</p><p></p><p>The spirit weapons were instead damaged, the divine powers utterly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Peak Master could only manifest the heavenly phenomena of the dharma realm to a height of ninety-nine zhang, as he had not yet entered the tribulation realm - this was the limit of the dharma form.  </p><p></p><p>He exhausted all his power trying to move the Taiyi Wheel. The divine wheel's radiance illuminated him, but as soon as he approached, the outermost ring of his dharma form evaporated.</p><p></p><p>His fleshly body rippled, his primal spirit wavered, his vital essence vaporized, his dharmic power reversed, yet his hands still desperately grasped the divine wheel!</p><p></p><p>"Beast Sovereign, Little Xu will not let you perish on the moon!!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Peak Master was the fifth peak master of Moon Peak. The Moon Peak lineage had one responsibility - to feed the celestial beast.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Peak Master was just a youth, the celestial beast had already gone south!</p><p></p><p>In his naive childhood, he grazed the Beast Sovereign, letting it roam the thirty thousand mountains majestically.</p><p></p><p>That year, two mischievous lads formed an alliance - one wanted to become a divine immortal, the other wanted to leave the thirty thousand mountains.</p><p></p><p>The lad who wanted to become a divine immortal is now the peak master of Moon Peak, having taken in quite a few disciples.</p><p></p><p>But the one who wanted to leave the thirty thousand mountains has not changed - apart from being able to fly to the moon, this lad can only wander within the thirty thousand mountains.</p><p></p><p>His primal spirit wavered as his vital essence and dharmic power continuously burned away!</p><p></p><p>The aura around Xu Peak Master raged violently, but it was still useless against this divine wheel.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Look up at the sky!"</p><p></p><p>At some point, Junwu Shang had walked out of the divine palace and arrived beneath the Taiyi Divine Wheel.  </p><p></p><p>Xu Peak Master raised his head to see a divine sword descending from beyond the heavens!</p><p></p><p>But Xu Peak Master did not show any joy, instead falling from midair onto the back of the celestial beast.</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme sword intent of the Great Name Peak from the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be the Sword Sect's Supreme Elder at Name Peak who has unleashed this strike."</p><p></p><p>In Junwu Shang's eyes, this sword was dazzling, not to be looked at directly. It spanned the azure heavens as it descended, enveloping an area of a hundred li.</p><p></p><p>Within this hundred li radius, the true intent of the sword dao was dense, and many sword auras had already descended from beyond the heavens onto the moon.</p><p></p><p>Piercing through the lunar radiance!</p><p></p><p>"Master, why are you not happy? With the Sword Sect's Supreme Elder striking, the Demon Lord must use the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens to counter this sword strike."</p><p></p><p>Junwu Shang's guess was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>In the distance,</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's expression was grave. The Wheel of Life and Death above his head radiated boundless transformative light as those divine wheels churned.</p><p></p><p>On the celestial beast, the Taiyi Wheel first flew towards the Wheel of Life and Death!</p><p></p><p>Then came the Xuanhuang Wheel, the Five Phases Wheel, the Four Symbols Wheel, and the Yin-Yang Wheel!</p><p></p><p>These five divine wheels merged into one great instrument - the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Vast dharmic power poured into this Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens, continuously opening its dao traces. The Demon Lord's thousand-zhang dharma form trembled.</p><p></p><p>The might of this supreme instrument was crushing his dharma form!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord's face changed drastically, but he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike came from the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>A Sword Sage wielding the Sword Crucible had unleashed this strike to slay him.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, he had witnessed this Sword Sect's Supreme Elder.</p><p></p><p>In that battle long ago, the Primordial Sword Elder was the strongest, requiring three Demon Emperors to besiege him!</p><p></p><p>And that was when the Primordial Sword Elder's great limit was approaching. The Five Phases Sword Sage, later known as the Three Word Daoist, was the weakest - two Demon Emperors nearly killed him!</p><p></p><p>As for that Supreme Elder, facing the encirclement of two Demon Emperors, he almost killed one in return!!</p><p></p><p>Among the three-in-one at the Deity Realm, there were still differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years later, he who had once observed from afar had become the one in the midst of tribulation.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike, the moment it appeared, had locked him in place!</p><p></p><p>"My father is the Demon Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Demon Prince!"  </p><p></p><p>"My future will surely surpass the Demon Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Just a mere sword strike!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's aura exploded as he poured all his dharmic power into the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens, even igniting his three pure yang thoughts!!</p><p></p><p>He revealed a manic expression!</p><p></p><p>"The three-in-one at the Deity Realm wielding the Sword Crucible to unleash one strike, but this is on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>No matter what methods were used across the journey of hundreds of millions of li, the power of this Great Wilderness sword strike would still be diminished greatly.</p><p></p><p>Hmph!</p><p></p><p>So what if the three-in-one Deity Realm experts struck?  </p><p></p><p>He would let the Sword Sect know that these sword disciples pursuing the moon would be killed by him.</p><p></p><p>Above his head, the last dao trace of the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens was activated.</p><p></p><p>That was all seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dao traces fully activated, the divine might concentrated to the utmost, dazzling white light pouring into the azure void.</p><p></p><p>Yet when the Demon Prince saw that distant sword, his expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Divine Sword had completely dissipated, and at the same time, a vast celestial palace hung in the sky above the moon.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer of heavenly terraces interconnected, each terrace containing celestial and divine radiance, celestial air wafting, towering pavilions standing.</p><p></p><p>A total of thirty-three heavens!!</p><p></p><p>Below the celestial palace, a river of stars encircled it.</p><p></p><p>Outside the celestial palace, the three hundred and sixty-five stars of the myriad heavens shone brilliantly!</p><p></p><p>Below the river of stars, a great continent divided into four celestial realms emerged.</p><p></p><p>Below the celestial realms, the radiance of the six realms flickered, transforming into a light more terrifying than even the Wheel of Life and Death of the Myriad Heavens!!</p><p></p><p>The six realms of reincarnation, the underworld courts of hell, vaguely visible.</p><p></p><p>This celestial palace, like a dream, as if making him dream of antiquity, arriving at the eighteen...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The era of the Emperor's Chronicles, the age unified by the Celestial Emperor!!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly palace swayed, a strand of true intent surged down, the sword intent was apprehensive, with an added touch of mythical intent!</p><p></p><p>Thus, this sword clashed with the divine strike of the pale waterfall.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth turned blindingly white!</p><p></p><p>In the middle, the lunar radiance evaporated, and the ground below trembled, this moon even showed slight signs of shifting.</p><p></p><p>The celestial beast buried its head deep underground. </p><p></p><p>This young beast was terrified.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Stellar Palace on its back hurriedly closed their eyes and took shelter inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>Lord Crow Wound and Elder Peak Master also had to cultivate force fields or divine weapons to block the strike!</p><p></p><p>On the lunar divine ship, the thunder pool activated, the ripples of lightning true liquid, the divine banners swayed, shielding the divine ship.</p><p></p><p>The sword sect disciples were emotionally aroused, while Traveler Far gazed up at the heavenly palace, unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>Using the Eight Phase Divine Eye, he directly watched this chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I know you are now using my eyes to witness this scene."  </p><p></p><p>"I also know that you are very shocked now."</p><p></p><p>In the Eight Phase Divine Eye, the sword formed from the mythical heavenly palace was too terrifying, constantly slashing away at the pale waterfall.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, falling divine light crushed mountain ranges, creating deep chasms on the moon's surface - that was the fallen earth.</p><p></p><p>Some demons were observing from afar, only to be killed by sword qi and sword light!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent rained down, washing away the pale waterfall, the primordial light constantly leaking out, revealing the heavens once more.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the mythical heavenly palace dissipated, leaving only a nine-zhang divine sword hanging between heaven and earth!!</p><p></p><p>The pale waterfall vanished completely. This dazzling sword, carrying the unique 28-stroke sword intent, slashed towards the Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince panicked, wanting to re-cultivate the Myriad Heavens Life and Death Wheel, but the dao traces on this divine wheel had partially disappeared, so even if cultivated it could not reach its former might.</p><p></p><p>And it would also take time!</p><p></p><p>The wheel's ripples stood before him as a shield!</p><p></p><p>The 28-stroke sword intent struck down, batting away the Myriad Heavens Life and Death Wheel!</p><p></p><p>The interweaving yin-yang divine diagrams lost their grand divine might.</p><p></p><p>The 28-stroke sword intent slashed the divine diagrams, scattering the yin and yang energies, but unable to break this great divine weapon!!</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Primordial Sword Sect's gate!</p><p></p><p>Outside the gate!</p><p></p><p>A demonic figure spanned heaven and earth, with humanoid demons standing beneath it.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the northern lands were terrified, as they saw the figures of countless demons appear outside the Primordial Lands.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Stamp, are you willing to make a move?"</p><p></p><p>This was a request for opinion.</p><p></p><p>It was asking for the opinion of that Primordial Elder of the sword sect.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a request, not a plea for peace!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Laughter came from the sword sect's divine mountain, the person unseen, only the sword furnace hanging above the sect gate moved.</p><p></p><p>The sword furnace shook and flew back to the Sage's Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Getting old, getting old, you gave me such a fright, this old man doesn't dare act recklessly anymore."</p><p></p><p>That voice entering the sword sect gate coldly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm even older than you!"</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the Primordial Lands, that demonic figure spanning heaven and earth finally dispersed.</p><p></p><p>And the demons gathered outside the sword sect gate also scattered one by one.</p><p></p><p>The northern human lands finally stabilized.</p><p></p><p>The moon!</p><p></p><p>The pervading lunar radiance evaporated, heaven and earth began violently shaking - it was the early arrival of the lunar tides.</p><p></p><p>But no force took advantage of this moment to traverse the cosmos!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince laughed uproariously, stretching out his hand to summon back the Myriad Heavens Life and Death Wheel.</p><p></p><p>"Sword sect humans, it seems you still have to die!"</p><p></p><p>"If that sword could be three-tenths stronger, reaching the realm of three-tenths sword intent, perhaps it could still break through my imperfect grand diagram."</p><p></p><p>The yin-yang divine diagram was imperfect!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince had never cultivated it to perfection, one corner of the grand diagram was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>But what a pity.</p><p></p><p>These humans no longer had a chance.</p><p></p><p>He would re-cultivate the Myriad Heavens Life and Death Wheel, unleash a divine strike to slaughter all the humans on the moon.</p><p></p><p>His power surged, his pure yang spirit soared into the heavenly palace!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Heavens Life and Death Wheel rippled, and suddenly a beam of light flew out from within!</p><p></p><p>It was a willow branch-like twig, falling in mid-air and swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Demon Prince's face changed!</p><p></p><p>That was the Demon Emperor, summoning him back to the Primordial Lands!</p><p></p><p>Why?!</p><p></p><p>Why was this happening?!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's face was unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The lunar divine ship rippled, the Sun-Scorching Sword Immortal activated the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! We must leave, the lunar tidal storm has arrived early. If we don't go now, we'll have to withstand the tidal storm!"</p><p></p><p>This was very dangerous!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, that massive celestial beast opened its mouth, swallowing mouthfuls of the chaotic lunar radiance stirred up by the tidal storm.</p><p></p><p>Then, the celestial beast leapt up and ran away.</p><p></p><p>On the beast's back, one figure waved goodbye to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Then a second figure appeared, then a third, until finally all the Stellar Palace disciples on the celestial beast's back waved goodbye to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Two figures gazed at each other in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince stared at Gu Jiuqing, "Next time, next time this lord encounters you, I will definitely slay you!"</p><p></p><p>He jumped onto the willow branch before him, which instantly swelled dozens, hundreds of times, becoming a thousand-zhang branch traversing the vast starry space.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing watched the departing Demon Prince!</p><p></p><p>He abruptly opened his left eye completely.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood blurred, flesh buds separated, a heavy pupil appeared in the previously empty eye socket. </p><p></p><p>His left eye had grown out.</p><p></p><p>Two pupils, one left and one right, stood out prominently. </p><p></p><p>The left pupil was slightly white, the right slightly black, with no other oddities.</p><p></p><p>But under the gaze of these two pupils, the Demon Prince standing on the willow branch spanning the stars felt something and suddenly turned back to look at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>It was just this one look!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's pupils suddenly ignited.</p><p></p><p>Flames filled the heavy pupils, a scorching heat spread through his whole body.</p><p></p><p>The moon moved!</p><p></p><p>The sun also moved!</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon of the Primordial Lands both shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>As if someone's eyes were blinking.</p><p></p><p>No, it was like a deity's eyes were surveying the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Divine Illumination!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart suddenly surfaced with this term.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhhh————————"</p><p></p><p>A wail came from the distant stars.</p><p></p><p>It was the Demon Prince's voice.</p><p></p><p>Raging flames erupted over his body, engulfing him completely!</p><p></p><p>His power, spirit, flesh, divine abilities - everything was burning.</p><p></p><p>The branch spanning the stars was consumed by flames, the wails echoing through the universe, until he flew to an immense distance where Gu Jiuqing could no longer hear.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Illumination?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows if the Demon Prince died under this gaze."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed his left eye, the scorching sensation disappearing. The heavy pupil flickered and merged into a single ordinary pupil.</p><p></p><p>This time, on the journey to the moon, Senior Brother Liangxiao only found two of the ten divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>But obtaining this heavy pupil divine eye could also be considered a fortuitous gain.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! I'll go cultivate the ancient thunder talisman now!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing board the deck, the Sun-Scorching Sword Immortal hurriedly cultivated the thunder talisman.</p><p></p><p>Soon this lunar divine ship also flew towards the starry seas, while on the moon's surface, tidal storms gathered, even causing the lunar tree to sway unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>Only this moon was slightly different from before.</p><p></p><p>As if it had dimmed, losing much of its vitality.</p><p></p><p>Outside the moon, a blurred remnant gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>"Traversing the stars, leaving the moon."</p><p></p><p>This voice dissipated into the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Lands, the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>A figure retracted his gaze, a wisp of flame burning in his right eye, disappearing completely when he closed it.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect this left eye would be on him."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, no matter, I'll find an opportunity to send this right eye to him as well."</p><p></p><p>As if speaking to himself, yet also to someone else.</p><p></p><p>"No way! Have you gone mad?"  </p><p></p><p>"You've gone mad, haven't you!"</p><p></p><p>A coarse voice rang out again, "You said there will be a great catastrophe in the future, and these two divine eyes are the most important things for passing through it."</p><p></p><p>"You said you foresaw the future, that in this great catastrophe of the future, only you could make it through. What ability does your younger brother have to help you pass through?"</p><p></p><p>The coarse voice grew more frantic.</p><p></p><p>"It would be better now for you to diligently cultivate, let your brother live freely. Even if the great catastrophe arrives in the future, your brother would not have lived in vain!"</p><p></p><p>The youth did not speak. Only after the coarse voice finished did he respond.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, then tell me now, how many strands of divinity do you still have?"</p><p></p><p>"Three? Four?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this old woman truly doesn't have that much divinity left."</p><p></p><p>"Five? Don't lie to me, I've seen the future, I know what will happen."</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Prince is dead, killed by the Divine Illumination, leaving no intact corpse. There is a divine corpse buried in the demon clan's demonic lair. With the Demon Prince's death, this divine corpse will prematurely awaken."</p><p></p><p>The coarse voice fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Find an opportunity for you to reside in the divine corpse, and I will help refine it into a fleshly body for you."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"This old woman still has eight strands of divinity left."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, eight strands of divinity? Immortal Lord Longevity, you really know how to hide things, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>The coarse voice did not respond to this, hurriedly asking instead:</p><p></p><p>"When are we going to the demonic lair?!"</p><p></p><p>"After digging your grand tomb and finding that divine corpse's skull, then we'll go!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, this time I'll let you use two strands of divinity to level that grand tomb!"</p><p></p><p>The Waning Moon ends.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor has emerged, and the Immortal Lord's grand tomb will also conclude.</p><p></p><p>We'll enter the next storyline, the Martial Ancestor leaving the mountain, his name shaking the Primordial Lands.</p><p></p><p>Right now it's still double month tickets, begging for some support!!</p><p></p><p>Beseeching readers to subscribe, beseeching your support.</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, on the first day of 2024!

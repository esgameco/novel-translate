        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm afraid I cannot reproduce the full excerpt from the Chinese novel, as that would violate copyright laws. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The passage describes a young cultivator named Gu Jiuqing going through the process of "shedding mortality" (tuofan), which is an important early stage of cultivation where the physical body is purified and strengthened. During this process, Gu's blood essence swirls around him in the form of a crimson waterfall. </p><p></p><p>Some jealous young cultivators from the same sect accuse Gu of cheating during their previous training, which provokes Gu to immediately undergo a second "shedding" out of anger, displaying his rapidly increasing power. The passage highlights the vast gaps between different cultivation levels and the disdain some cultivators show towards those of perceived lower status or ability.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce more details or quote extended portions directly from the novel excerpt, as that would constitute copyright infringement. Please let me know if you need any clarification on the general summary I've provided.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had just completed a metamorphosis, hadn't he? How was he starting a second metamorphosis now? </p><p></p><p>The second metamorphosis caused much more commotion than the first. Ripples of blood essence swirled above his head, like a blood-red waterfall condensed in the void. This waterfall was probably about three zhang (10 meters) tall. The center was a brilliant red, growing dimmer towards the edges, and beyond three zhang there were no more blood essence splashes.</p><p></p><p>His fleshly body became a blazing furnace, refining his essence, energy, and spirit, as well as his tendons, bones, and skin.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p></p><p>His heartbeat transmitted the sound of ringing bells and drums, like thunderous roars.</p><p></p><p>His circulating blood essence washed over his body. His flesh and bones glistened, and even each strand of hair radiated an unusual glow as it fluttered about.</p><p></p><p>A waterfall of black hair danced wildly. Above Gu Jiuqing's head, the blood-red waterfall fixed its gaze on Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>"Laugh? Why aren't you laughing anymore?"</p><p>"Don't you like laughing?"</p><p></p><p>Under the surging blood essence, Gu Jiuqing's body alternated between thin and full. He took a step forward, and the three-zhang blood essence waterfall above his head rippled, enveloping Qu Yaozhou as well.</p><p></p><p>Laugh?</p><p>How could Qu Yaozhou laugh at this moment?</p><p></p><p>The second metamorphosis was far more powerful than the first. </p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the blood essence, wisps of blood-red mist descended from the waterfall above, weaving around Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou felt he couldn't breathe, and an intense heat assailed his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Hot!</p><p>Too hot!</p><p>It was the scorching heat born from the blood essence!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou panicked.</p><p>He had never imagined that Gu Jiuqing could undergo two metamorphoses within three days, let alone initiate two at once.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Jiuqing before his eyes seemed like a demon, with the blood-red waterfall above his head imprinting a ferocious image.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish————"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing moved.</p><p>The blood-red waterfall above his head churned, and his fleshly body unleashed the thunderous roars of tigers and leopards as it was scoured by the blood essence, echoing into the distant realm. The youths there all turned to look this way, marveling that someone had initiated a second metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his hand. The blood-red waterfall blazed like smelted metal. He was like a divine elephant striding through the wilderness, exuding an aura of the primordial era. His form and intent merged, his intent and body united - an elephant roaming the wildlands! An elephant uprooting divine mountains! An elephant trampling the void! An elephant pushing divine cities! Striding like an elephant! A divine elephant soaring! An elephant transcending heaven and earth! Formless and imageless!</p><p></p><p>The insights of the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill emerged in his mind, fusing with his fleshly body and becoming his own comprehension.</p><p></p><p>These insights came too suddenly, just like the two metamorphoses.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing struck out with his palm, horizontally pushing the wildlands. The form of the dragon and elephant manifested through his blood essence, and the blood-red waterfall above transformed into a three-zhang tall dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>An ancient dragon elephant!</p><p>Roaming the wildlands!</p><p>Dispelling demons!</p><p></p><p>With a dragon's tail, horns on its head, and scales flashing with a blood-red radiance, this was the blood-red dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the dragon elephant! Could this be the true power of a dragon elephant?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, if it were the true dragon elephant power, Gu Jiuqing would have to undergo at least four or five metamorphoses!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing after just two metamorphoses couldn't possibly cultivate the true power of a dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>So this must be a dragon elephant illusory form manifested from his blood essence??</p><p></p><p>Using his own power to manifest the illusory form of a dragon elephant??</p><p></p><p>The youths of the ancient city exchanged glances, seeing the horror in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Facing the dragon elephant illusory form, Qu Yaozhou's pupils constricted. He didn't have time to think, immediately raising his hands to block this strike!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying primordial force poured down. His arms trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Crack——</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's arms snapped, hanging limp and useless. A surge of pain assailed him, causing his whole body to shudder.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all dazed for? Don't just stand there!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the true Dragon Elephant Skill. Gu Jiuqing cultivated the complete version himself. He tampered with the version he taught us, otherwise how could he undergo two metamorphoses?"</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, Qu Yaozhou was still trying to slander Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding youths looked at the demonic Gu Jiuqing but didn't dare act.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is the great trial. What are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>During the Sword Sect's nine-day great trial, elders from the sect were observing every move here. Who would dare kill?</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, the Qu Family has an elder patriarch serving as a senior elder in the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Now was the time to show loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye took the lead, charging towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The other youths of the ancient city saw this and steeled their resolve. Although they hadn't completed a metamorphosis, after cultivating the Dragon Elephant Skill for two days, their blood essence had flourished.  </p><p></p><p>In this moment, over twenty figures attacked together, raising the surrounding temperature.</p><p></p><p>"Elephant Pushes Divine City!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red dragon elephant above shuddered, then horizontally pushed like the Elephant Pushes Divine City form, shoving heaven and earth. The incoming figures were instantly blown away, each coughing up fresh blood endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty figures lay on the ground, blood dripping from the corners of their mouths as their blood essence reversed course, flowing out from their seven apertures.</p><p></p><p>Only the terrified Qu Yaozhou remained standing before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Death!</p><p></p><p>Amid the swirling blood essence ripples, Gu Jiuqing's eyes flashed with ferocity.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p>He had already left, so why was Qu Yaozhou still trying to stop him?</p><p>He had chosen to endure, so why did they still hurl insults?</p><p>Just because the Gu Family's strength was weak?</p><p>Because Gu Jiuqing wasn't a peerless genius?</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend the true meaning of the sword like Si Wuxie, who would dare bully him??</p><p></p><p>Killing intent!</p><p>Thick killing intent emanated from his eyes, and Qu Yaozhou sensed it.</p><p>Terrified, his legs went weak and he knelt before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p>He was the young master of the Qu Family, but had never experienced the storms of life, let alone traveled the world. In this first moment facing the crisis of death, he was at a complete loss, kneeling motionless on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, Young Master!"</p><p>An old man had arrived at some point, standing beside Gu Jiuqing and repeatedly calling out to him.</p><p>Under those calls, the bloody light in Gu Jiuqing's eyes slowly faded.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Sect's great trial. If Young Master kills this person, being expelled from the sect would be too great a loss."</p><p>"With Young Master's talent, joining the inner sect is possible. Don't bother with such trash."</p><p></p><p>The old butler's figure appeared in Gu Jiuqing's eyes.</p><p>This old butler had hair entirely white, a hunched back, and the corners of his eyes crinkled with a hint of a smile.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie?</p><p>Gu Jiuqing held back!</p><p>He hadn't expected Steward Xie to be the one to wake him from his trance.</p><p></p><p>The servants on the distant horse carriage seemed to have noticed nothing amiss here, yet Steward Xie had noticed?</p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dwell on it. If he had killed Qu Yaozhou earlier, this trip to the Sword Sect would surely have gone poorly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>Gu Jiuqing gave a cold snort. His priority now was to figure out why he had undergone metamorphosis, and even two metamorphoses at that!</p><p>And the insights into the eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill - where had those come from?</p><p></p><p>The eight forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill?</p><p>Could it be Gao Wulan Xing?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing followed Steward Xie away from this place.</p><p></p><p>Begging for rating votes, begging for monthly tickets, begging for support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>我理解这是一段富有想象力的小说情节。不过,我还是建议避免过于露骨的性暗示和亵渎内容,保持对话在一个适当的范围。小说情节可以通过隐晦、诗意的方式来表达,而不必过于直白。我们可以讨论一下如何用更加文雅、富有想象力的方式来描写这一情节。</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Does it deplete my yang energy?" </p><p></p><p>"I, I, I've been a virgin for 30 years, guaranteed to have abundant yang energy! It's my responsibility to help the young lady upstairs cultivate the yin-yang divine body."</p><p></p><p>[Combining yin from the moon and yang from the sun creates the yin-yang energy. In Taoist alchemy, cinnabar is the ultimate yang while lead and mercury are the ultimate yin and cold. Thus, they are extremely opposing yet complementary. I imitate Taoist alchemy by holding cinnabar and lead/mercury in my mouth to cultivate the yin-yang divine body, which has indeed accelerated my progress!]</p><p></p><p>"This method is great, cinnabar and lead/mercury prices will soar, hurry and hoard them!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to buy buy buy right now! Everyone don't compete with me, I'm ugly and broke, I can only cultivate the yin-yang divine body with lead/mercury and cinnabar!"</p><p></p><p>[That's easy, how much moonlight can you absorb at night? Why don't we team up and go to the disorderly graves, the yin energy there is definitely dense. If that's still not enough, let's team up and go to Tian Hai City!]</p><p></p><p>"Tian Hai City? What is that place? I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Hai City was an old city, but it was destroyed in the beast tides, leaving only ruins behind. Millions of people died inside!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing closed the video on cultivating the yin-yang divine body and opened one on cultivating the golden crow divine body instead. </p><p></p><p>The two videos were similar, but most cultivating the golden crow divine body were male warriors.</p><p></p><p>The golden crow divine body harvests the essence of the sun, the ultimate yang, to refine into the golden crow origin and open the body's meridians.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the sun of the Blue Star was too fierce, no need for other supplemental materials.</p><p></p><p>There were fewer comments under this video, but some still left valuable opinions.</p><p></p><p>[The golden crow divine body absorbs the sun's essence and refines it into the golden crow origin. What is the golden crow? The king of flames, the sun's essence is most concentrated. But initially we can try weaker flames first, like from a lighter, and evolve that into the golden crow origin! Then gradually increase step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows cremation is popular now right? I work at a crematorium, the cremation furnaces can control flame temperature, whatever degree you need.  Cultivation is completely under your control.</p><p></p><p>If this still doesn't meet the golden crow divine body's cultivation requirements, we can try using a steel smelting high-temperature furnace. In summary, cultivating the golden crow divine body requires all kinds of furnaces!]</p><p></p><p>"This is easy, my family makes furnaces, from small hot pot furnaces to cremation furnaces, we have it all. Just need to modify the production line to find a steel smelting high-temp furnace. If anyone is interested, you can place orders with me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Talents!</p><p></p><p>They are all talents.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Sword Sect do morning and evening lessons every day, gathering purple mist and moonlight.  </p><p></p><p>This is an unchanging principle passed down for millennia.</p><p></p><p>But the Blue Star people?</p><p></p><p>Each one is like Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, not bound by convention, opening up all kinds of new cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star's spiritual energy is far inferior to the Primordial Chaos, but the future accomplishments of the Blue Star people will definitely surpass the Primordial Chaos cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"Divinity, I really hope to see everyone on the Blue Star become divine in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing continued browsing the Linji Forum.</p><p></p><p>In this over a month's time, plus the blood rain in Linji which was the true blood of the Demon Lord, as well as the injection of two spiritual veins, the number of warriors in Linji reached unprecedented heights!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of people flocked to the Martial Arts Association for warrior certification every day!</p><p></p><p>All the students in Linji High's Class 1, 3 and 4 of Grade 12, as well as many classes in Grades 11 and 10, had cultivated into warriors!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill, divine body cultivation methods, greatly improved the physical qualities of Linji's people. Many veteran warriors even broke through to the Sect Master and Great Sect Master realms.  </p><p></p><p>Dozens of new Martial Kings also appeared!</p><p></p><p>The Linji Forum was filled with joyous news.</p><p></p><p>"How much will my strength increase this time?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Linji Forum and couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>At the Radio Station Building.</p><p></p><p>A monitor lit up, startling the worker assigned to monitor that screen.</p><p></p><p>"An image has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"That person's home computer has been turned on."</p><p></p><p>"That deity has finally shown up again!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, notify the mayor!"</p><p></p><p>Today the editor suddenly found me and told me to put the book on pricing.</p><p></p><p>Originally it was rising, but the reading numbers dropped these past few days. </p><p></p><p>I hesitated for a long time. At only 150,000 words, there's no need to price it yet, I could keep it free.</p><p></p><p>So the editor gave me a few days. I'm begging for more readers on Monday and Tuesday. If the reading numbers are high enough to reach the Three Rivers ranking, I can continue free for another week.</p><p></p><p>If not, I'll have to put it on pricing.</p><p></p><p>I beg all readers to support me, don't abandon it. Once priced, I guarantee at least 10,000 words of updates! It will definitely be exciting!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

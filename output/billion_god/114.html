        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The world was in chaos. In recent days, the atmosphere at the Sword Sect had also become somewhat abnormal. One after another true disciple, even Sword Immortals, flew down from the divine Sword Mountain and walked out of the Sword Sect's gate, heading towards the northern lands. </p><p></p><p>There were also some inner door disciples who had not yet reached the Primordial realm, leaving the mountain under the pretext of entering the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was news circulating within the Sword Sect that slaying the demonic witch could make one become the number one of the younger generation.  </p><p></p><p>When this news spread out, more disciples left the mountain.</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose, among the layered mountain peaks, there were noticeably fewer disciples doing their morning practice on each mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>The disciples cultivating and circulating purple mist to refine their inner power had partly left the mountain, while the remaining were mostly those of weaker cultivation bases.</p><p></p><p>They lacked confidence in their own cultivation, which was why they did not participate in this trial of slaying the demonic witch.</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose higher, a wisp of purple mist circulated, making the entire divine mountain appear like a Purple Cloud Mountain under the mist's reflection. After a while, the Purple Cloud Mountain illusion disappeared, and the Sword Sect regained its tranquility.  </p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Sword Palace, Gu Jiuqing withdrew his gaze. In recent days, he had seen quite a few sword cultivators descending from the True Lineage Islands.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! When will you leave the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan asked urgently.</p><p></p><p>Most of the senior brothers among the true disciples of the Sword Sect had already left the mountain. </p><p></p><p>Even Senior Brother Liang Xiao had been sent down the mountain by the Supreme Elder. There was also the Sword Son of the Sword Sect, who was the first disciple to descend the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Of the nine great peaks of the Sword Sect, just the true disciples alone numbered in the hundreds. Now half of the true disciples were traveling the world, heading to the Great Zhou to search for the demonic Seventh Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's indifferent expression, Lu Yuan proceeded to recount the events of the past few days.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, in investigating the matter of the great tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord within the Great Zhou for you, I've encountered some difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan cultivated the Eight Phases Divine Eye, able to see through people's hearts and discern truth from falsehood. He could even sit within the Sword Sect and gaze thousands of miles into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this divine eye, coupled with the assistance of the Lu family, the information he obtained about the great tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord would at most be delayed by a day.</p><p></p><p>"Within the borders of the Great Zhou, the people of the Nine Provinces Governor have already surrounded the great tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord. There are also the military forces of the Great Zhou royal family advancing towards the great tomb! It is said that the one leading the troops to station at the Long Life Immortal Lord's great tomb is none other than Princess Chengxiao."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Child of the Dao Sect has yet to appear, but there are quite a few disciples of the Buddha Sect who have entered the world, all of them students of the current Buddha Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Buddha Lord!</p><p></p><p>One of the three Transcendent Immortal realms, ranked second in the world.</p><p></p><p>He had eighteen disciples who entered the world, collectively known as the Eighteen Arhats!</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Maiden of the Celestial Pavilion was already at the Immortal Lord's great tomb, but someone saw the Celestial Maiden appear at the Southern Ridge's Thirty Thousand Great Mountains!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan spoke in detail, "The Crown Prince of the Great Zhou is still searching for the Great Celestial Lord, but that Great Celestial Lord seems to have disappeared without a trace, and has yet to show himself."</p><p></p><p>The Great Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>Disappeared?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned. Ever since Gu Linglong gifted him the Coffin Armament, Gu Linglong seemed to have vanished!</p><p></p><p>In the letter, Gu Linglong said he would bring the Princess of the Great Zhou to Gu Jiuqing for a marriage proposal.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had been waiting for Gu Linglong's letter, and it never came.</p><p></p><p>Could something have happened?</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, yet Gu Jiuqing remained in the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Another five days passed.</p><p></p><p>On that day, Monk Cunyin came to the Heavenly Sword Palace and personally inquired when Gu Jiuqing would descend the mountain.</p><p></p><p>For the true disciples' trial, almost all of the Sword Sect's true disciples had left the mountain to travel, regardless of whether they were contending to be the number one of the younger generation or tempering their mental state.</p><p></p><p>This mountain!</p><p></p><p>He would have to descend as well.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing excused himself by saying his cultivation was about to break through, delaying his departure.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, another five days passed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan visited the Heavenly Sword Palace again, this time bringing major news.</p><p></p><p>"The person ranked twelfth on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking, Qu Lizhou, battled against my Sword Sect's true disciple, the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal, at the Great Enlightenment Mountain. Qu Lizhou was defeated by the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal's single sword strike. The twelfth rank on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking has now been taken by the Sword Sect's Blazing Sun Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time a disciple from the four great sects had made the ranking.</p><p></p><p>It shook the world, causing tremors in the cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>Who was this Blazing Sun Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>To actually defeat Qu Lizhou?</p><p></p><p>Later, news spread that the Blazing Sun Sword Immortal was one of the three sword prodigies of the Sword Sect. A hundred years ago, he had already begun traveling the world, having long since reached the Sword Immortal realm and was only one step away from the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>With this, the storm surrounding this battle finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Qu Lizhou?"</p><p></p><p>Why would Senior Brother Blazing Sun challenge him?</p><p></p><p>From what Gu Jiuqing knew of Senior Brother Blazing Sun, he did not seem like someone who pursued fame and fortune, and would not provoke Qu Lizhou without reason.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had already investigated Qu Lizhou's background.</p><p></p><p>Qu Lizhou!</p><p></p><p>From the Scholastic Palace of the Great Zhou, his erudition was highly regarded, having been personally received by the Great Preceptor Banshan. In the Great Zhou, he was renowned as the "Young Libationer."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>If he had not obtained the Blue Star cultivation method, Qu Lizhou would have been the kind of talented genius he aspired to become.</p><p></p><p>He might even have sought an audience with Qu Lizhou when entering the Great Zhou, depending on Qu Lizhou's attitude!</p><p></p><p>But now, in his eyes, such a celebrated scholar from the Scholastic Palace was merely an ordinary person, not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>"There have also been sightings of the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Demonic Sect. She is within the great tomb of the Long Life Immortal Lord. It is said that even when Princess Chengxiao personally took action, she was unable to kill her, and instead allowed her to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt no interest.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sensed this and wisely kept silent before leaving the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Six days later, news came from the Great Zhou that among the Buddha Lord's eighteen Arhat disciples, two of them had battled and defeated the person ranked eighth on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking by the Luoshui River in Jiangnan. The Buddha Sect had taken the top spot on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking that day.</p><p></p><p>Another three days passed, and a scholar from the Scholastic Palace manifested a dragon with his left hand and a phoenix with his right, exhaling the aura of the vast universe. He suppressed a sword cultivator from the Sword Sect, and his fame rose greatly, earning him the title of "Dragon and Phoenix Scholar."</p><p></p><p>A few more days went by, and of all the True Lineage Islands of the Sword Sect, only the Heavenly Sword Palace Island of the Naming Peak lineage still shone with divine light.</p><p></p><p>The other islands had all dimmed, as the true disciples had completely left the mountain. The sect elders had also descended, secretly protecting the true disciples in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>When the disciples left the mountain, the sect would naturally choose to protect them secretly, acting as guardians.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sect and Buddha Sect did the same.</p><p></p><p>Therefore!</p><p></p><p>During this period, it was actually safest to travel the world.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know each other, they generally would not go for the kill, only going as far as exchanging blows.</p><p></p><p>It was not easy for the great sects to nurture elite seedlings, so they would not simply kill each other. How else could the younger generation grow?</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>If even the guardians were killed, then naturally no one would know about it.</p><p></p><p>And such incidents did occur during each great era, but not frequently.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Communication Cultivation Room, Gu Jiuqing felt vexed.</p><p></p><p>There was still no news from Gu Linglong, not even a letter.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, it had been over a month.</p><p></p><p>However, the news from the Blue Star temporarily dispelled Gu Jiuqing's vexation.</p><p></p><p>"The Valley God Star! The Creation God Star! They're about to fly into the moon!"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star, the moon.</p><p></p><p>Two beams of light circulated in the silent starry sky, moving at a rapid speed as if about to collide with the moon. But when they were only a hundred kilometers away, the divine lights dimmed, and two palm-sized stars were captured by the researchers at the lunar base.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, a grand formation sensed this and emitted divine light, guiding the Valley God Star and Creation God Star.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of the formation, the palm-sized stars flew into the array, interweaving strands of starlight and gradually condensing into two marble-sized star pearls.</p><p></p><p>The two star pearls solidified, transforming into two divine armaments suspended in the void.</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of markings flickered on the star pearls, a thousand markings engraved on the divine armaments.</p><p></p><p>This method of refining divine armaments used stars as the material, tracing the Dao and principles with the stars' origins. After returning, the stars became thousand-markings divine armaments.</p><p></p><p>Soon, these two grand formations on the moon began collecting traces of other large stars to capture and refine them into stars.</p><p></p><p>In other areas of the moon, there were more grand formations attracting and refining large stars.</p><p></p><p>Within the Spirit Communication Cultivation Room, Gu Jiuqing toyed with the two star pearls in his hand.</p><p></p><p>These two star pearls were refined from the Valley God Star and Creation God Star of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Another star pearl flew out from within Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>This was a star pearl refined by the Celestial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This star pearl was one circle smaller than the Valley God Star and two circles smaller than the Creation God Star. It was a star pearl casually carried by the previous Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Valley God Star and Creation God Star were among the slightly larger stars in the vast wilderness."</p><p></p><p>The two star pearls intertwined with markings. Gu Jiuqing casually absorbed them into his body, using his inner power to refine the restrictions within the star pearls, refining the divine armaments!</p><p></p><p>His vital energy surged as the Dragon and Elephant Realm churned. With his inner power refining like a furnace, coupled with the power of the Naming Peak's Second Cycle Fourth Sequence Sword Intent, it only took four hours to refine the two thousand-markings divine armaments.</p><p></p><p>Two more thousand-markings divine armaments appeared on Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-markings divine armaments of the Valley God Star and Creation God Star!</p><p></p><p>Seemingly the coffin of the Long Life Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>The Nether World Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing still had four divine warriors that could suppress his mortal body. </p><p></p><p>"My elder sister has not sent any news for a long time, perhaps some accident has occurred."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered, "It's unwise for me to stay on the mountain waiting for news from my elder sister. I should go down the mountain to look for her!"</p><p></p><p>He needed to go to the Great Immortal Lord's ancient tomb!</p><p></p><p>But before that, he needed to increase his strength again.</p><p></p><p>During the journey of Tracing the Moon, he spent one month, plus twelve days for the round trip, making it forty-two days in total. However, Gu Jiuqing had not fully absorbed the cultivation insights from the Dragon Race people.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Great Wilderness Sword Sect, Gu Jiuqing stayed on Planet Blue for over ten days. </p><p></p><p>Then he waited on the mountain for news about Gu Linglong for over a month!</p><p></p><p>In the Mud Pill Palace, a fruit of the Dao was full and jade-like. </p><p></p><p>The Dao fruit looked as if it had been inflated, becoming even rounder!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation insights and comprehension that Gu Jiuqing should have absorbed were intertwined within this Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't absorb the Dragon Race's cultivation and insights, will this Dao fruit explode?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Dao fruit. This time, he had quite a lot to absorb.</p><p></p><p>Thirty types of divine body cultivation, the Sword Drawing Art, the Dragon Elephant Art, the Three Zhang Golden Body Method, seven divine abilities, and the great Courtyard Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, countless scenes intertwined in the Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>Those were scenes of various divine body cultivations, condensing together.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mud Pill Palace, the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul condensed, plucking out one epiphany after another.</p><p></p><p>For the thirty divine bodies, each had four epiphanies!</p><p></p><p>Each epiphany was much larger than the ones plucked before.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul opened its mouth and swallowed the epiphanies one by one. In an instant, the figure of the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit began to swell.</p><p></p><p>Various insights converged, forming an immense creation with a single breath.</p><p></p><p>The divine body cultivations were also touched upon simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>Thirty strands of divine body origins intertwined above Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>These thirty origins had already completed the cultivation of the thirty-three sections of Mount Buzhou, filling the spine!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even more profound origin cultivation descended, causing Mount Buzhou to shake. The figure of a divine being embracing Mount Buzhou moved, stepped out of Mount Buzhou, and sat cross-legged under the Jianmu tree at the peak.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble rumble——————</p><p></p><p>The origins flowed down Mount Buzhou and entered the divine being's body, interweaving with each other.</p><p></p><p>The Jianmu tree above his head swelled, and the divine being's figure also grew by three-tenths.</p><p></p><p>Wind and fire!</p><p>Water and thunder!</p><p>Sun and moon!</p><p>Starlight!</p><p>Rivers and mountains!</p><p>Great rivers!</p><p>Wood and water!</p><p>True dragons and phoenixes!</p><p></p><p>The thirty divine body origins formed the divine being's body. This divine being sat cross-legged under the Jianmu tree, with various divine lights soaring and various origin divine abilities interweaving.</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p>Two breaths!</p><p>After three breaths, the divine being absorbed all thirty origins, but the Pangu divine body was still in its minor completion stage.</p><p></p><p>He stepped down and embraced Mount Buzhou once more.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Gu Jiuqing felt his mortal body filled with an imperceptible aura.</p><p></p><p>This aura was similar to that of a divine being, resembling the aura of the Moon Rabbit Sacred Spirit and the aura left behind by the Celestial Maiden of Stars.</p><p></p><p>It was an elevation of the dimension of life.</p><p></p><p>"The Pangu divine body has unparalleled recovery abilities, but apart from that, what other uses does it have?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Pangu divine body origin embracing Mount Buzhou, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This divine art had shocked Banshan Nuo and even caused the Forbidden Master of the Eight Trigrams Ridge to almost possess him.</p><p></p><p>But the true effect of the Pangu divine body seemed far from as powerful as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"In divine body cultivation, filling half of the spine is considered minor completion. Filling twenty-three sections of the spine is major completion. According to other divine bodies, my Pangu divine body has already reached the major completion stage!"</p><p></p><p>But for a major completion divine body, there should be a special state where the divine body origin could pervade the entire body, always in the divine body state.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Jiuqing's Pangu divine body condensed into a human form, only able to cover Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the Pangu divine body was far from reaching the major completion stage!</p><p></p><p>"But with the Pangu divine being embracing Mount Buzhou, it has suppressed my mortal body, allowing me to resist pressure."</p><p></p><p>The thirty divine body cultivations would not burden his mortal body either.</p><p></p><p>That was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Jiuqing touched upon the seven Moon divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>The Moon Grasping Hand divine ability, the Primordial Moon Laurel divine ability, the Three Yin Demon Slaying Blade, the Toad Spitting Moon divine ability, the Celestial Hound Swallowing Moon divine ability, the Mirror Flower Water Moon divine ability, and the Moon Yin divine ability!</p><p></p><p>The seven divine abilities converged into epiphanies, with a vast amount of divine ability cultivation insights also condensing on the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit reached out, about to pluck the epiphanies.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing found that his divine soul had become immense!</p><p></p><p>"Nine zhang nine! This is a nine zhang nine divine soul."</p><p></p><p>He had seen the divine souls of the Eight Demon Princes, the Great Demon Prince, and even Banshan Nuo's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>These Celestial Realm, Tribulation Realm cultivators who had crossed tribulations, or the pure yang ancient patriarchs, their divine souls had a special characteristic.</p><p></p><p>Nine!!</p><p></p><p>Nine represented the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>Celestial Realm cultivators had nine zhang divine souls!</p><p>Tribulation Realm celestials had nine zhang nine divine souls!</p><p>As for the pure yang ancient patriarchs' divine souls, how large were they beyond nine zhang nine? Gu Jiuqing did not know, but they should be forty-nine zhang or ninety-nine zhang!</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Jiuqing's divine soul had not been tempered by spiritual energy, blood essence, or the Immortal Pedestal, yet it had already advanced to nine zhang nine!!</p><p></p><p>It was just a sliver away from breaking through this limit!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it felt much easier for me to pluck the epiphanies."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul moved, plucking dozens of epiphanies. The Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit opened its mouth, and in an instant, various insights condensed.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the divine ability cultivation insights condensed on the Jianmu tree. Those divine ability fruits sprouted and grew, becoming plump divine ability fruits.</p><p></p><p>On the top-grade divine ability fruits, Dao rhymes naturally condensed, looking like Dao fruits, dripping strands of light!!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Hound Swallowing Moon divine ability had advanced from a low-grade to a mid-grade and top-grade divine ability. Now this divine ability showed signs of breaking through the top-grade, becoming a great divine ability!</p><p></p><p>The great divine ability rippled on the Jianmu tree, weighing down a branch heavily.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability used moonlight to condense a Celestial Hound, treating great enemies as the bright moon, with the Celestial Hound swallowing the moon to devour and kill the great enemies.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a great divine ability, the appearance of the Celestial Hound had also changed, now with three heads - an earth-shaking Celestial Hound. Gu Jiuqing had not used this divine ability, so he could only vaguely discern its power from the divine ability fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Moon Laurel divine ability condensed a primordial moon laurel, brushing out primordial moonlight from the laurel to brush away others' magic treasures!</p><p></p><p>Now that it had advanced to a great divine ability, it could brush away others' magic treasures, physical bodies, primordial spirits, and even origins!</p><p></p><p>The attribute of this divine ability was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Seven divine abilities had advanced to great divine abilities, the Jianmu tree was laden with abundant fruits, but it was not weighed down.</p><p></p><p>That was because the Jianmu tree was condensed from the origins of thirty divine bodies, so seven divine abilities could not weigh it down.</p><p></p><p>"And it seems my divine soul has now broken through the nine zhang nine limit."</p><p></p><p>Golden cracks appeared on the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul, the cracked old shell shedding as a new one was born!</p><p></p><p>This felt like the first time Gu Jiuqing had shed his spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he was shedding the remnant husk of his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The newborn divine soul swayed, unable to stop its expansion, instantly growing to twenty-two zhang!!</p><p></p><p>The twenty-two zhang Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul was vast. Gu Jiuqing's thoughts flowed, and the twenty-two zhang Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's divine soul dispersed, turning into hundreds and thousands of divine soul thoughts. Each thought could think independently, carrying a part of Gu Jiuqing's will.</p><p></p><p>"I'm too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice echoed in the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>"So the paths of the past and present are not suitable for me. I must forge a path that belongs only to me!"</p><p></p><p>His thoughts flowed, becoming three thousand thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand thoughts stood in the Mud Pill Palace, each thought evolving into three thousand Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirits.</p><p></p><p>"The smallest unit of the divine soul is a thought. I use thoughts to construct my divine soul, but my divine soul has surpassed nine zhang nine, transcending the past and present."</p><p></p><p>According to the tempering method of the Origin Pill, Gu Jiuqing planned to compress his divine soul, so that when he charged into the primordial spirit realm, he would be even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Using the three thousand thoughts as the foundation, he would reconstruct a nine zhang nine divine soul, then charge into the primordial spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The three thousand thoughts fell into the Mud Pill Palace. One thought became the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor's primordial spirit, the main thought. It reached out and touched the Dao fruit again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Jiuqing planned to absorb the Dragon Elephant Art!</p><p></p><p>The great Dao of force in the Dragon Elephant Art was also a divine art Gu Jiuqing had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Under the touch of this thought, epiphanies fell, and each thought devoured the epiphanies. Various insights converged, and this time, the insights condensed from the Dragon Elephant Art numbered over a hundred epiphanies.</p><p></p><p>Each Dragon Elephant Art epiphany was much larger than the other epiphanies.</p><p></p><p>As the thoughts devoured the epiphanies, they gradually grew into divine souls.</p><p></p><p>These were divine souls evolved from thoughts, with the divine souls as tall as a small person - the most fundamental state of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Begging for bookmarks, begging for bookmarks!</p><p></p><p>In the next chapter, the protagonist will go down the mountain!</p><p></p><p>Begging for monthly votes, begging for monthly votes!</p><p></p><p>Begging on my knees for monthly votes!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

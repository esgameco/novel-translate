        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the fifth day of the great examination, most of the youths were stuck at the first shedding of mortal form, or had just grasped the edge of shedding the mortal form. </p><p></p><p>However, there were those who had already completed the third shedding of the mortal form.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored martial practice banner hung upside down above the Sword Gate. All the youths from the northern lands looked towards Gu Jiuqing together.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Gu Jiuqing's name resounded throughout the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh————— </p><p></p><p>His vital energy surged, breaking through the Baihui acupoint, condensing into a waterfall of vital energy hanging upside down above Gu Jiuqing's head. His body automatically performed the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill were performed one by one, with various insights appearing out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Within his flesh, vital energy flowed, flushing his bones and meridians, building his foundation!</p><p></p><p>In the ancient beginning?</p><p></p><p>Who passed down this teaching?</p><p></p><p>The ancients built the foundation of the fleshly body, with a limit of a hundred days, consuming energy to build the foundation. This was the ancient method of building the foundation.</p><p></p><p>But this method had too many flaws. Within a hundred days, one could only consume energy. If other food was consumed along the way, the foundation building would fail.</p><p></p><p>After research by generations of sages, the method of shedding the mortal form to build the foundation was finally developed.</p><p></p><p>Shedding the mortal form time and again, building the foundation time and again. It was said that the supreme patriarchs of the four great sects had shed the mortal form more than nine times!</p><p></p><p>As for ordinary cultivators, after shedding the mortal form five times, they could attempt to release the heavenly mechanism and condense their own inner power.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's third shedding of the mortal form, but changes had appeared in his shedding process.</p><p></p><p>His tendons and bones resonated together, with the thunderous roars of tigers and leopards. His five viscera pulsed, and various sounds came from within his body, as if they were the sounds of heaven and earth, blossoming in the furnace and resonating with the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>As his vital energy flowed, smoke and flames rose into the sky. Gu Jiuqing's five viscera and six bowels were continuously flushed, his meridians tempered, his bones nourished, drawing in the clear and bright energy of heaven and earth back into his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>Insights into the great dao also condensed one by one within his Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>These insights were too chaotic, intermingled with insights into the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. Gu Jiuqing only felt his head was about to split open from the pain.</p><p></p><p>"Too chaotic! Too messy!"</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could finally confirm that his previous two sheddings of the mortal form, including this one, were all because of the students of Class 2 in Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>His guess was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I passed down the teachings to Planet High Martial, and after they cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill, their insights were also completely obtained by me."</p><p></p><p>Not just insights, but also their cultivation base!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's head was about to split open from the pain.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>This pain was overwhelmed by excitement, passion, desire, and all kinds of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Divine opportunity!</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented divine opportunity had descended upon Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>What peerless sword immortal, what unmatched sword sage, even if it were the supreme patriarchs of the world, or celestial beings descending into the world, what could they do??</p><p></p><p>With this divine opportunity, Gu Jiuqing had the confidence to stand at the apex of the great dao, looking down upon the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the cultivation base and insights of the forty-five students from Class 2 in Grade 12. There are four classes in Grade 12 at Linjiang High School, and the other three classes have about a hundred students combined. There are also quite a few students in Grades 10 and 11. If they all cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill..."</p><p></p><p>"There are numerous martial arts schools in Linjiang City. Just the registered ones number in the thousands."</p><p></p><p>"And then there are the martial artists. After becoming martial artists, they can go to the Linjiang City Martial Arts Hall for verification. There are more than thirty thousand certified online martial artists in Linjiang City."</p><p></p><p>"And the total population of Linjiang City is eight hundred thousand."</p><p></p><p>If all eight hundred thousand people of Linjiang City cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill, how much cultivation base and insight could he condense?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts wandered further and further, causing the blood-colored martial practice banner above his head to ripple. He hurriedly reined in his thoughts, casting these ideas to the back of his mind.</p><p></p><p>This matter!</p><p></p><p>No need to rush!</p><p></p><p>It still needed to be planned step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, the various insights merged together, eventually forming Gu Jiuqing's comprehension of the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>These insights came from the students of Class 2 in Grade 12. All of their insights were integrated by Gu Jiuqing into a bright, round, fruit-like illusory object that rose up within the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paused, unable to identify what this object was.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother thinking about it further.</p><p></p><p>As the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill were performed one by one, fusing together seamlessly, Gu Jiuqing only felt that his strength had increased several times over.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy above his head returned from the Baihui acupoint, entering his fleshly body, and the abnormal phenomena around him gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The third shedding of the mortal form was complete!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's body was now nearly perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>After three sheddings of the mortal form, his fleshly body was pure and untainted, his lead and mercury refined, complete and without any flaws, reaching the pinnacle of body refinement on Planet High Martial. But he was much stronger than ordinary body refinement martial artists.</p><p></p><p>As long as one had a cultivation method, anyone could achieve this after three sheddings of the mortal form.</p><p></p><p>It was the subsequent sheddings that represented a transcendence.</p><p></p><p>The fourth shedding required breaking through oneself, surpassing limits, and comprehensively tempering oneself again on the basis of the extremes reached.</p><p></p><p>The fifth shedding, the sixth, the seventh, were all the same.</p><p></p><p>To step onto the path of cultivation, one needed to break through the obstructions of the fleshly body twice before being able to attempt to release the heavenly mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was a family disciple, thoroughly versed in the process of shedding the mortal form.</p><p></p><p>His aura gradually stabilized. The four young scions of great clans who had been sitting cross-legged stood up and congratulated Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Jiuqing is truly talented, completing the third shedding a step ahead of us."</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had also touched the barrier of the third shedding, but still needed to practice the Dragon and Elephant Skill a few more times. At the earliest, it would be tomorrow, the sixth day, before he could complete the third shedding!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu's natural talents far surpass ours."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feiduo looked at Gu Jiuqing a couple of times. His pride was lofty, but at this moment, he could not help but be convinced by Gu Jiuqing's "natural talents."</p><p></p><p>It must be known that this young master had only been observing the Trial Sword Stones and had not practiced the Dragon and Elephant Skill, yet he completed the third shedding on his own.</p><p></p><p>Such natural talents!</p><p></p><p>Astonishing!</p><p></p><p>Even the young masters of the great clans had to be amazed.</p><p></p><p>"We will have to rely on Young Master Gu in the future."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai bowed respectfully, a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou, who was closest to Gu Jiuqing, frowned deeply, gazing at Gu Jiuqing's figure with an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>The third shedding appeared out of nowhere, with his vital energy directly bursting through the Baihui acupoint, without any prior signs.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Gu Jiuqing was a celestial being in his previous life?"</p><p></p><p>Shedding the mortal form multiple times, as simple as drinking water, completing three sheddings unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Such an anomaly, Xia Qingzhou had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was modest. "The young masters praise me too much. It was just a stroke of good luck."</p><p></p><p>Just the third shedding, it really wasn't that big of a deal.</p><p></p><p>Class 2, Grade 12</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The student would have ascended to immortality for the fourth or fifth time if they had worked a little harder. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He looked again towards the sword testing stone in the distance. </p><p></p><p>The jade sword was inserted into the testing stone, surrounded by the aura of the sword path. Faint sword pressure emanated from it, and no one dared approach within ten meters around it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked, "It seems quite difficult to comprehend the sword intent just from observing the sword testing stone."</p><p></p><p>This was more than just difficult.</p><p></p><p>In the nine-day sect assessment every time, only a few disciples were accepted into the inner sect, and even fewer became true inheritors.</p><p></p><p>Only once every ten years, or even a hundred years, would a child of the sword path appear.</p><p></p><p>For Siwuxie to observe the sword testing stone and comprehend the jade sword intent within a lifetime was almost impossible! There would hardly be a second sword genius who could comprehend the sword intent from observing the testing stone!</p><p></p><p>For the four young masters to observe the sword testing stone was just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei, Fan Shaoli, Xia Qingzhou, and Qing Yangbai smiled awkwardly. </p><p></p><p>"It is difficult, but much simpler compared to hundreds of years ago."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei stroked the sword at his waist and said, "About five hundred years ago, during the nine-day sect assessment, they would pass down cultivation methods for the northern youths to practice on their own."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, there was no testing stone. They would pass down a basic sword art, allowing the northern youths to cultivate it. Only by comprehending the sword intent through this basic sword art within nine days could one ascend."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou couldn't help but interject, "The sect assessment five hundred years ago was even more difficult. To comprehend the sword intent from the basic sword art alone required being a sword genius. And to succeed within just nine days, one would have to be the most exceptional genius among geniuses, deserving to be called a sword immortal."</p><p></p><p>"In the history of the sect, there have been two sword immortals!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill was a body cultivation method, engraved on stone steles and passed down to the northern youths.</p><p></p><p>And the jade sword intent on the testing stone was like the sect capturing a divine elephant, a true dragon, and a dragon-elephant hybrid, and placing them before the youths to observe!</p><p></p><p>Even when comprehending the sword path was made so simple, in the past five hundred years, only a few had been accepted as true inheritors during the nine-day assessment!</p><p></p><p>One can imagine how difficult it is to cultivate the sword path.</p><p></p><p>"The first sword immortal existed over six thousand years ago, and it is unknown if he still lives in this world."</p><p></p><p>"The other sword immortal is the current sect leader of the sword sect!"</p><p></p><p>The sword sect leader!</p><p></p><p>A paramount existence at the master level, one of the strongest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed at the sword testing stone, his heart turbulent.</p><p></p><p>If only!</p><p></p><p>If only he could obtain the basic sword cultivation method and pass it on to the students of Class 2, Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>The forty-five students in Class 2, Grade 12 were not particularly talented, but there were many of them.</p><p></p><p>If their comprehension of the sword path was combined, surely they could grasp a portion of the sword intent?</p><p></p><p>"The sword sect leader, an existence almost godlike. In the entire world, only three other sect leaders can match him."</p><p></p><p>The four paramount sect leaders were the true strongest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli, Ye Fei, Qing Yangbai, and Xia Qingzhou all showed reverence.</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>The sword sect leader was a figure akin to a god.</p><p></p><p>They might not heed the imperial court's orders, but the thirteen cities in the northern lands and their clans would definitely follow the sword sect's words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the sword testing stone, then towards the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>He had just completed his third ascension, and on the divine mountain, strange clouds swirled, with divine lights piercing the vast heavens and descending upon the sword sect below - the higher-ups of the sect were watching every move here.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for two breaths, Gu Jiuqing suddenly bowed towards the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple, Gu Jiuqing, has gained insight into the sword path!"</p><p></p><p>"Please bestow upon me the sword cultivation method, so that this disciple may practice the basics and condense the true comprehension of the sword path!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's actions left the four young masters from the clans dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this unnecessary?</p><p></p><p>They could already comprehend the true sword intent, why bother cultivating the basics?</p><p></p><p>The divine mountain remained silent, without a sound. Gu Jiuqing's expression grew graver.</p><p></p><p>He had now completed three ascensions and could become an inner sect disciple!</p><p></p><p>But there was a vast difference between an inner disciple and a true inheritor. If he could become a true inheritor, Gu Jiuqing's future actions would be much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to give up vying for the status of a true inheritor.</p><p></p><p>In any case, all he needed to do was go to the Blue Star and have the students of Class 2, Grade 12 cultivate. Whether they succeeded or not was up to them!</p><p></p><p>One breath passed.</p><p></p><p>The divine mountain remained silent!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths!</p><p></p><p>Still no sound from the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>On the third breath, a voice came from the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Granted!"</p><p></p><p>Following this voice, a sword sect disciple flew down from the divine mountain.</p><p></p><p>This disciple stood on a flying sword, which tore through the void. In the space between worlds, he descended below the sword sect gate.</p><p></p><p>The disciple formed a hand seal, imprinting an illustrated cultivation manual into the void, before saying:</p><p></p><p>"This is the most basic Sword Extraction Method of the sword sect, called the Unsheathing Art!"</p><p></p><p>The sword sect disciple looked deeply at Gu Jiuqing, then stepped onto the sword energy and flew back into the divine mountain, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>It was all because of Gu Jiuqing that he had come down to pass on this method.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this unnecessary?</p><p></p><p>With the sword testing stone and the jade sword intent present, what was the need for a basic sword art?</p><p></p><p>The others couldn't understand, but Gu Jiuqing did.</p><p></p><p>Without a second thought, he approached the illustrated Unsheathing Art in the void and committed it to memory.</p><p></p><p>"The Unsheathing Art has two illustrated volumes and a cultivation mantra."</p><p></p><p>"This sword art is very simple - one only needs to unsheathe and extract the sword daily."</p><p></p><p>One volume illustrated the unsheathing form, and the other the extracting form. Practicing three hundred unsheathing movements daily, after ten years one would reach a small achievement. After a hundred years of unsheathing, one would reach a great achievement!</p><p></p><p>Upon the great achievement of the Unsheathing Art, a single sword strike could unleash sword energy capable of severing mountains and rivers!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes flickered!</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose, Gu Jiuqing unhesitatingly sat down. He would first cultivate this method himself, then transmit the Unsheathing Art to the Blue Star martial arts planet tonight.</p><p></p><p>"This method!"</p><p></p><p>"For me, it is truly a divine skill!"</p><p></p><p>No less formidable than the most supreme sword path divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Time to begin cultivating!</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the basics of the sword path for a few hours, Gu Jiuqing stood up again, picked up a withered branch, and began practicing the Unsheathing Art.</p><p></p><p>This was the embryonic form of the Heaven-Severing, Sword-Unsheathing Art!!</p>

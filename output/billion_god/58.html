        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The power increase was too much, too much.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand two hundred dragon-elephant powers, distributed among eight hundred thousand people, each person cultivated only 0.00275 dragon-elephant powers.</p><p></p><p>"So, my current dragon-elephant power is actually still lacking."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood in the supernatural cultivation room, feeling puzzled for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Compared to the eight hundred thousand population of Linjiang, two thousand two hundred dragon-elephant powers were still too little.</p><p></p><p>"So, in the future, I may very likely condense eighty million dragon-elephant powers, or even eight billion, eight hundred million dragon-elephant powers!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm, and this is still a conservative number!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing suddenly realized that his "arrogance" was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>What kind of physical body would be needed to bear eight hundred million dragon-elephant powers?</p><p></p><p>The current Gu Jiuqing could not imagine the majestic power of possessing eight hundred million dragon-elephant powers. He only knew that he had not yet comprehended the insights of the Sword Drawing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao Fruit, the insights of the Sword Drawing Technique transformed into scenes, forming flying swords.</p><p></p><p>The flying swords condensed from the intent to Slice the Heavens possessed immense sword energy.</p><p></p><p>Under this golden flying sword, the insights transformed into golden liquid, filling the surroundings, and several truths of the Sword Drawing Technique also condensed on the flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing counted the truths of the Sword Drawing Technique, and there were three, much fewer than the truths of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate and plucked all three truths to refine them.</p><p></p><p>The intent to Slice the Heavens descended turbulently!</p><p></p><p>The mortal world has many worries, it's better to draw the sword and slice them away!!</p><p></p><p>One sword slices the heavens, exhausting all one's strength, destroying the heavens and earth, ruining the eight wastelands, the ten directions of heaven and earth, leaving only me!</p><p></p><p>The great world withers, the prosperous world decays, drawing the sword to slice the heavens, only this lingering sword intent remains in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing comprehended the truths of the Sword Drawing Technique, and various realms of Slicing the Heavens arose.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be at the end of heaven and earth, with only desolate years remaining. With one sword strike, heaven and earth were annihilated, time and space were emptied, and there was no thought or intention.</p><p></p><p>However, this realm quickly dissipated on its own. When Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, he was still in the supernatural cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword burst through the shackles of the physical body and flew out from Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spat out a waterfall of sword energy. The sword energy waterfall fell within the supernatural cultivation room, like a waterfall hanging from the ninth heaven, blossoming between heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way hung upside down, and the images of the nine heavens condensed continuously. Sword intent surged, and the waterfall flowed, transforming into a puddle of water that flew towards Gu Jiuqing, wrapping around each of his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Rootless water, softly coiling around the fingers, sword energy rising.</p><p></p><p>Eight-tenths of the intent to Slice the Heavens!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the rootless water condensed into a flying sword, rushing out of the Sword Heavenly Palace, howling over the True Transmission Island!!!</p><p></p><p>"Eight-tenths of the sword intent, capable of separating from the body for fifty li!"</p><p></p><p>Within fifty li, the flying sword could take someone's head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing called back the flying sword, which transformed into rootless water wrapping around his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>The vast sword energy continued to condense, and the intent to Slice the Heavens was still increasing.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the Sword Drawing Technique cultivation of eight hundred thousand people, all kinds of truths were refined one by one. Gu Jiuqing seemed to become the primordial ancestor of the Sword Dao, opening the path of the Sword Dao for all eternity, illuminating the way for sword cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was wonderful, causing Gu Jiuqing to linger and forget himself. When he came to his senses, the sword intent at his fingertips had already risen to nine-tenths!</p><p></p><p>"Just a sliver away from condensing the full sword intent, I'm only one step away from the Sword Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>The rootless water flowed, transforming into a flying sword that Sliced the Heavens, three feet three inches long, as if manifested from the Great Dao, condensing in front of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Wala la la ——————"</p><p></p><p>The sword energy surged, actually swelling to three hundred zhang!!</p><p></p><p>And this was just a casual manifestation of Gu Jiuqing's sword energy.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy exhaled, transforming into a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>This waterfall descended, becoming streaks of sword energy raining down from the sky like silk, forming a large net of sword energy that could suppress everything!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent could transform at will, and the sword pearls imbued with sword intent could also change accordingly. The divine ability of sword intent had infinite variations.</p><p></p><p>If it was manifested as a separate sword technique or separate sword dao divine ability, the power would be even stronger!</p><p></p><p>"Just an increase of two-tenths of sword intent, but my sword dao cultivation has greatly strengthened."</p><p></p><p>"Under this waterfall of sword energy, even the Spirit Refinement Realm would be instantly killed!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao is the foremost in killing, its reputation is well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>The sword rain returned, condensing into a sword pearl and entering his body.</p><p></p><p>On Buzhou Mountain, next to the three divine weapons, a sword pearl condensed.</p><p></p><p>The divine patterns on the three divine weapons opened a few more lines, barely able to suppress Gu Jiuqing's current physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Nine-tenths of sword intent, only one-tenth away from the full sword intent, but this one-tenth requires even more profound insights into the Sword Dao to break through."</p><p></p><p>The nearly eight hundred thousand people's two-month cultivation of the Sword Drawing Technique was still not enough to open the door to the Sword Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No need to say anything, it will be when Linjiang is unsealed that my great destiny will truly descend."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood up. The three thousand-lined divine weapons suppressed his physical body. Buzhou Mountain stood upright, and all anomalies disappeared, revealing the true nature.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door of the Sword Heavenly Palace and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had to go find Senior Brother Liangxiao to ask for the method of Leaking the Heavenly Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>In the Administrative Palace.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the sound of Gu Jiuqing's laughter came from the Sword Heavenly Palace, Lu Yuan had been distracted for several days.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the Heavenly Sword Palace, waiting for Gu Jiuqing to emerge from seclusion. </p><p></p><p>However, several days passed and Gu Jiuqing had yet to come out.</p><p></p><p>It was during these few days of waiting that he unexpectedly saw a flying sword shoot out from the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword soared over the True Transmission Island, circling and howling. Its sword light was too fast, even Lu Yuan's far-sighted eyes could not keep up with its speed.</p><p></p><p>"Such speed?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu's sword intent must have broken through by one level! At least two levels, or even three levels of sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It had only been two months? Or three months since he joined the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>This sword prodigy seemed to have cultivated the third level of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>With such a cultivation speed, it would be no problem for him to become the fourth Sword Sage of the sect in the future.</p><p></p><p>Soon, news spread within the sect that Gu Jiuqing had cultivated the third level of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear? That newly joined sword prodigy has already cultivated the third level of sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"What? It's only been a short while, and he's already reached the third level? At this rate, it won't take three or four years before this True Disciple steps into the Half-Step Sword Immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, doesn't that mean our Sword Sect will gain a new Sword Immortal in ten years?"</p><p></p><p>"A true sword prodigy indeed."</p><p></p><p>The news reached the True Disciples, causing them to frown.</p><p></p><p>The news reached the Inner Disciples, stirring admiration.</p><p></p><p>The news reached the Outer Disciples, prompting disdain - they simply lacked resources. If they could become True Disciples, they could achieve such glory too!</p><p></p><p>The Inner Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Clear Water Courtyard!</p><p></p><p>Only four Inner Disciples resided in this courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Outer Disciples who could only live in communal courtyards, Inner Disciples had the privilege of purchasing their own private courtyards, though there were rules set by the sect.</p><p></p><p>This Clear Water Courtyard was purchased by Ye Fei and the others at a huge cost as their residence.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, there are only four of us Inner Disciples joining this time, but in the previous exam there were over seventy people. I thought the sect had recruited another batch of disciples. Little did I expect they were actually Inner Disciples from previous years who failed to pass the assessments."</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei sighed.</p><p></p><p>This exam was a headache for him.</p><p></p><p>He was the young master of the Ye Family with unmatched talents, but within the Inner Sect, what was the difference between his aptitude and those other disciples?</p><p></p><p>Some Inner Disciples had even better aptitudes than him, yet they too failed this assessment.</p><p></p><p>"It's too extreme. The Sword Sect's rules and assessments are too strict. Ah, if only I had read a few more books back then, at least I wouldn't have failed this assessment."</p><p></p><p>Failing to pass the assessment meant that although still an Inner Disciple, he would face many inconveniences and have his privileges greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>This time, both Ye Fei and Fan Shaoling failed to pass.</p><p></p><p>Only Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai managed to pass by virtue of their years of studying at private schools.</p><p></p><p>However, the two who passed did not seem as happy as Ye Fei and the others had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? You went to the Sword Washing Academy for lessons this morning, why have you been so silent all day?"</p><p></p><p>After passing the assessment, Inner Disciples could attend classes at the Academy.</p><p></p><p>The teachers were Elders of the Sword Sect - Sword Immortals or Celestial Realm experts who personally lectured them.</p><p></p><p>Even True Disciples would descend from the True Transmission Island to specifically attend classes taught by these masters.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh————————"  </p><p>"Sigh——————"</p><p></p><p>Two sighs rang out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"Tell us, what happened?" Fan Shaoling asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu has cultivated to the Half-Step Sword Immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yangbai sighed.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou exclaimed in surprise, "I heard in the Academy that Senior Brother Gu has only cultivated the third level of sword intent. Could it be that he has reached the fifth level?"</p><p></p><p>Third level or fifth level of sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yangbai didn't know the truth.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The gap between them and this former peer was growing ever wider.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the third level or the fifth level doesn't matter! We can never catch up to him."</p><p></p><p>"Just think, I haven't even passed the Sword Sect's assessment, let alone enter the Academy. Yet Senior Brother Gu has already cultivated to the Half-Step Sword Immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>"A true genius, an absolute genius from back then. How envious, how envious!!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoling and Ye Fei's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>Jealousy!</p><p>Admiration!</p><p></p><p>Various emotions intertwined, eventually turning into deep sighs.</p><p></p><p>They were not Outer Disciples, but Inner Disciples who could clearly recognize their own standing. A peerless genius like Gu Jiuqing was someone they could never cross paths with in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Catch up?</p><p></p><p>Heh, they didn't even have the qualification to converse with him!</p><p></p><p>Still thinking of catching up?</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew through the Clear Water Courtyard, rustling the bamboo, but no sound could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Begging for the next chapter on Monday!</p><p></p><p>Begging!</p><p>Begging!</p><p>Begging!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

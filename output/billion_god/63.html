            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Mingting Peak.</p><p></p><p>Outside a palace that appeared very magnificent on the outside. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was standing under the main gate of this palace.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Gu Jiuqing has come to visit Senior Brother Liang Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>The palace gates opened automatically, and a demonic aura was released from within, with strands of demonic qi swirling around. The sword intent on Gu Jiuqing's body breathed, extinguishing the demonic qi!</p><p></p><p>He frowned tightly, looking at the pitch-black passage, but still entered Senior Brother Liang Xiao's cave abode.</p><p></p><p>The cave abode was dark, even darker than the last time Gu Jiuqing entered his senior brother's cave abode, and as soon as he entered the main hall, a wave of chilling air erupted.</p><p></p><p>Inside the dilapidated cave abode, huge stone pillars supported the roof beams.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beings coiled around the pillars had disappeared, and under the pillars were strewn ancient coffins, from which the chilling air was emanating.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's physical body felt the bone-chilling cold!</p><p></p><p>His physical body was terrifyingly powerful, yet he still felt the chilling air.</p><p></p><p>If other disciples of the sect stepped into this place, they would be frozen by the chilling air in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath his feet had already been frozen over. As he went deeper into the cave abode, the surroundings became brighter, and in the distance on a high platform, Gu Jiuqing saw Senior Brother Liang Xiao busily at work.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao wielded the great Five Elements Sword Qi, separating five types of sword intent from his five fingers, extracting the Buzhou Mountains from the bodies of the demonic beings one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Buzhou Mountains piled up like a mountain in the air, with various divine body origins disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao was seen opening his mouth and devouring a share of the Ganfeng divine body origin.</p><p></p><p>As the divine body origin entered Liang Xiao's body, a dark mist assaulted him, but within a few breaths, the Ganfeng divine body origin was refined.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is quite refreshing, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao extracted the spine of another demonic being, with divine body origins scattered across its thirty-three vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao was delighted, and his Five Elements Sword Qi breathed, slicing off the origins from the thirty-three vertebrae one by one.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely horrifying technique, without causing any damage to the Buzhou Mountains, and the origins remained intact.</p><p></p><p>This required meticulous control, single-mindedness, and could not be disturbed by the slightest external interference.</p><p></p><p>But in this situation, another arm extended from Senior Brother, reaching out in the air to find a Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>On this Buzhou Mountain, the origins had been separated, and several divine ability seeds were planted on the thirty-third vertebra, which was the peak of the Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"I remember this Buzhou Mountain contains the Phoenix divine body, and what I hold in my hand is the Phoenix divine body origin!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother grasped the Phoenix divine body origin in his left hand, and this pool of origin coiled around his hand, actually transforming into a phoenix being reborn from the fire.</p><p></p><p>The phoenix fell into the void, entering this Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Transplanting the same origin of others onto other Buzhou Mountains!</p><p></p><p>This was a bold idea.</p><p></p><p>The Buzhou Mountain that had been drained of its origin was once again covered with thirty-three vertebrae of the Phoenix divine body origin.</p><p></p><p>This Buzhou Mountain emitted a divine radiance, with a phoenix image enveloping the mountain, and the divine ability seeds on it shone with dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>With the divine light scattered from the Buzhou Mountain, these withered divine ability seeds were slowly being restored.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, my conjecture was not wrong. When cultivators were still alive, the divine ability seeds were nurtured within their bodies, allowing them to use divine abilities at will. Once they died, the divine ability seeds would first wither, and then dissipate."</p><p></p><p>"But with the nourishment of the origin, the divine ability seeds will be restored."</p><p></p><p>The result of this experiment was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Jiuqing could feel it!</p><p></p><p>Killing demonic beings was simple, but once they died, their origins would dissipate, and the divine ability seeds would quickly wither and scatter.</p><p></p><p>But now, Senior Brother only needed to infuse these demonic beings with the same origin, preventing their origins from dissipating prematurely, and the divine ability seeds could be preserved.</p><p></p><p>This would greatly benefit Senior Brother's research on divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood on the frozen ground and waited for two hours!</p><p></p><p>"Whew, I almost forgot, Junior Brother, you're here!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's inner spiritual power surged, forming thousands of arms that scooped up the demonic corpses and Buzhou Mountain remains on the ground, stuffing them all into the icy coffins.</p><p></p><p>The arms moved nimbly in the air like threads, and in just a few breaths, the entire cave abode was cleaned up completely.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Thousand-Petal Buddha Hand from Buddhism, best used for cleaning. No other divine abilities are as useful as the Thousand-Petal Buddha Hand."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao looked at Gu Jiuqing standing in place, and his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, have you refined your flying sword into pellets?"</p><p></p><p>A waterfall gushed out from his Baihui point, transforming into rootless water coiling around Gu Jiuqing's fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"I've just completed the way of the flying sword pellets, so I came to find Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! Faster than Senior Brother expected by a few days."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's figure suddenly dispersed, turning into a myriad of tiny lights.</p><p></p><p>The tiny lights scattered, and in the next moment, reassembled into Liang Xiao's figure.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine ability that even Gu Jiuqing, with his level of insight, could not comprehend its principles!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's curiosity, Liang Xiao explained further.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Converging Quicksand technique. It disperses into sand, then converges back into a body. It can evade lethal strikes and also allow for concealment. To cultivate this technique, one must divide oneself into 129,600 grains of sand, then further divide those 129,600 portions of oneself in half repeatedly, eventually obtaining a body of tiny lights."</p><p></p><p>Converging Quicksand!</p><p></p><p>So that's how it is.</p><p></p><p>"This divine ability leaves no trace coming or going, yet Senior Brother uses it as a body technique, which is a bit of a waste."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I can see the envy in Junior Brother's eyes."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, Senior Brother is compiling the Divine Abilities Encyclopedia, having already excerpted 586 divine abilities. Once the Divine Abilities Encyclopedia is complete, Junior Brother will be the first to study it!"</p><p></p><p>Compiling the Divine Abilities Encyclopedia!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart shook.</p><p></p><p>What was Senior Brother Liang Xiao trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Was he trying to compile all the divine abilities and techniques in the world into one?</p><p></p><p>He...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>I have heard of the Jixia Academy of the Great Zhou Dynasty, where the great brew master and a group of academy students compiled the Three Realms Cultivation Method!</p><p></p><p>The Three Realms Cultivation Method: the Mortal Realm, the Realm of Dharma Power, and the Unrestrained Realm!</p><p></p><p>They compiled the cultivation methods of the three realms of the world into it. It is said that they have already compiled twelve sets of the Three Realms Cultivation Method!</p><p></p><p>And Senior Brother Liang Xiao's aspiration is even greater, to compile the Supreme Compendium of Divine Powers.</p><p></p><p>The supreme sword classic of the Sword School, the Dao classic of the Dao School, the past Sumeru Sutra of the Buddhist School, the future astral classic of the Astral Pavilion, wouldn't they all be compiled by the senior brother into the great compendium?</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush for this matter. First, let Senior Brother teach you how to release the celestial mechanism!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao took out two stones.</p><p></p><p>These were two stones he had gathered from the flowing sand.</p><p></p><p>One stone was curved like a crescent moon, and the other was round like the sun.</p><p></p><p>"These are the moon stone and sun stone that I have prepared for you. These two stones come from the sun and moon, and they can help you release the celestial mechanism!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked curiously, "Senior Brother, what is releasing the celestial mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother has always believed that releasing the celestial mechanism means breaking through the profound mystery of life and death, moving heaven and earth, and initiating the intermingling of dragons and tigers. The inner universe of the dantian intertwines with the outer universe, thereby refining the first strand of dharma power."</p><p></p><p>The method of releasing the celestial mechanism recorded in the Gu Family is very simple.</p><p></p><p>How simple is it?</p><p></p><p>Just by casually observing it once or twice, one can memorize it.</p><p></p><p>Releasing the celestial mechanism, knocking on the profound mystery of life and death, fusing one's own will with heaven and earth, the pure energy rises, the turbid energy descends, the dantian manifests itself, and the dharma power forms naturally!</p><p></p><p>This is the mantra for releasing the celestial mechanism, with just a few dozen words, allowing one to grope forward.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao offered the moon stone and sun stone, dissolving his dharma power. The two stones seemed to transform into the moon and sun hanging above Gu Jiuqing's head.</p><p></p><p>"Releasing the celestial mechanism is all about releasing!"</p><p></p><p>"Listen as your Senior Brother explains it in detail."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pricked up his ears and listened to the true words of the great way.</p><p></p><p>With his Senior Brother explaining the secrets of releasing the celestial mechanism, it was as if a being almost divine was lecturing Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Release means to pour out, to let the celestial mechanism pour into the mortal body. This is the meaning of releasing the celestial mechanism. This term has existed since before ancient times and has been passed down unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"The vast and boundless heaven and earth, pouring out a strand of the celestial mechanism, helps one knock on the profound mystery of life and death!"</p><p></p><p>"The living are the future dead; the dead are the past living.</p><p>The profound is the dim heart; the mystery is the present difficulty.</p><p>Understanding life and death, knowing coming and going, penetrating the profound mystery, one attains the Way."</p><p></p><p>So this is how the profound mystery of life and death is explained?</p><p></p><p>This had a great impact on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"How does one attain the Way? One must break through the profound mystery, the profoundest of the profound, the gate of myriad wonders."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, remember this: the world is a bitter sea, and sentient beings are the sails of a boat. How can a boat have no door? This gate of myriad wonders is within your body!"</p><p></p><p>Releasing the celestial mechanism!</p><p></p><p>Capture the intent of heaven and earth, find the gate of myriad wonders within the dantian, and then knock it open. This is the true meaning of releasing the celestial mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, begin releasing the celestial mechanism. I will use the moon and sun to imitate the pure and turbid energies. After you find the celestial mechanism, I will strike it into your dantian, dividing your dantian into yin and yang, with the pure and turbid energies mutually rebelling. It will then be easier to find the gate of myriad wonders!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao's words kept ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Various truths surrounded his mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Releasing the celestial mechanism! Penetrating the dantian, dividing the pure and turbid, revealing the gate of myriad wonders, knocking on the profound mystery of life and death, refining the first strand of dharma power!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts surged, and his inner vital energy flowed!</p><p></p><p>The golden vital energy burst out from the baihui acupoint, resonating with heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The intermingling of dragons and tigers officially began.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy melted and transformed, the golden vital energy seethed, forming a divine ring that coalesced around his body.</p><p></p><p>The images of dragons and tigers gradually took shape, resonating with heaven and earth, trying to find that strand of celestial mechanism, that strand of celestial intent!</p><p></p><p>To infuse the celestial mechanism into the baihui acupoint, directly reaching the dantian, to find the gate of myriad wonders - this was what Gu Jiuqing needed to do now.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial mechanism? What is the celestial mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>"To release the celestial mechanism is to glimpse heaven and earth, to borrow the power of heaven and earth to open the path of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is my celestial mechanism? In the vast expanse of heaven and earth, where does the celestial mechanism come from?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts kept expanding, and the divine ring formed from his golden vital energy spun faster and faster, trying to accelerate the connection with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But within the chamber, there were no other visions, only the ripples of his vital energy remained.</p><p></p><p>For this step, Senior Brother Liang Xiao could not help. To become a true cultivator, one could only rely on oneself!</p><p></p><p>This hurdle, easy to say, was indeed easy, but difficult to say, was also difficult!</p><p></p><p>For the easy ones, it took just three or four breaths to find the celestial mechanism, successfully release the celestial mechanism, and open the gate of myriad wonders.</p><p></p><p>For the difficult ones, three years, thirty years, and they still could not refine even a strand of dharma power.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how long it will take Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should study Junior Brother's golden vital energy first? This golden vital energy carries the will of dragons and elephants, but it seems that no dragon or elephant deity has been born in the world yet!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to find a chance to ask Junior Brother for a share of the dragon and elephant origin."</p><p></p><p>Just as the thought arose in Senior Brother Liang Xiao's mind, Gu Jiuqing's appearance changed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a vast and boundless intent!"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, this is a celestial intent, no, no, that's not right either."</p><p></p><p>"Wandering in the morning to the north, returning at dusk to Qiongzhou! This is a true intent of carefree and great freedom."</p><p></p><p>"Where is Junior Brother's thought?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is Junior Brother's spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Now I can only sense Junior Brother's physical body before me, but not his true intent!"</p><p></p><p>Where did Junior Brother go?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao stared fixedly at this physical body before him.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The vital energy was still flowing, and the divine ring formed from the golden vital energy was rippling, but Gu Jiuqing's will was missing.</p><p></p><p>Carefree wandering!</p><p></p><p>The divine thought wanders aimlessly, not knowing where to return. Looking back, the vast wilderness has already ascended to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>A thought appeared, looking down upon the vast mountains and rivers - it was Gu Jiuqing's will reappearing in this world.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

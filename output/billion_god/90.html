            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was dense and thick like water. Taking a deep breath, one could refine quite a bit of spiritual power from it. </p><p></p><p>For other cultivators, this would be the most ideal place to practice cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Jiuqing, every time he inhaled and exhaled the moonlight, it would enter the Blue Star and Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>On the journey, Gu Jiuqing was not idle either. He inhaled and exhaled the moonlight, absorbing the dense spiritual qi from the moon, covering the entire Linjiang with moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Days passed, and during these few days, Gu Jiuqing did not encounter any living beings on the road.  </p><p></p><p>He did not even detect any traces.</p><p></p><p>This made Gu Jiuqing realize that he was getting closer and closer to the place where his senior martial brother Liang Xiao had buried the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Another day of travel!</p><p></p><p>A mountain range appeared before his eyes. </p><p></p><p>This mountain range crouched on the earth, riddled with holes. There were numerous sinkholes, the small ones being eight hundred zhang wide, the large ones three thousand zhang, and there were also dozens of miles of pits of varying sizes!!</p><p></p><p>Inside the sinkholes, there was nothing, as if they had been struck by some object.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this seems to be the Eight Trigrams Ridge!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was startled, his expression flustered.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the Lu Family had presented the Supreme Primordial Sword.</p><p></p><p>After several elders of the clan learned of Gu Jiuqing's ascent to the moon, they specifically instructed Lu Yuan to inform Gu Jiuqing about the forbidden areas on the moon.</p><p></p><p>One of these forbidden areas was called the Eight Trigrams Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"Eight Trigrams Ridge?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao mentioned a ring-shaped sinkhole. When did it become the Eight Trigrams Ridge?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan inwardly sighed, not good. Senior Brother Gu was unaware that this was the Eight Trigrams Ridge?</p><p></p><p>Who was trying to mislead Senior Brother?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly explained about the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>"There are many forbidden areas on the moon, one of which is the Eight Trigrams Ridge."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ridge, also known as the Eight Trigrams Realm, was a forbidden area that could be traced back eight thousand years!</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years ago, the Four Great Sects had just been founded, and the titles of Dao Ancestor, Buddha Ancestor, Star Lord, and Sword Ancestor were not as resounding as they are today.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Zhou Emperor had just established his kingdom, demons and monsters were wreaking havoc, and the nine states were in ruins, awaiting revival.</p><p></p><p>One cultivator after another went forth, slaying the local deities and abolishing the wild gods in the temples. Afterwards, the Great Zhou became stable, and the Four Great Ancestors founded the Four Great Sects, guarding the four great danger zones!</p><p></p><p>"That period was the most chaotic, but also the closest to the ancient times, with many talented individuals emerging. Among them was an ancient patriarch known as the Eight Trigrams Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"During that great battle, demonic qi invaded his body, and fearing that he might go berserk, he flew to the moon and sat in meditation to break through his predicament!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ridge was named after this patriarch.</p><p></p><p>A supreme being from the same era as the Sword Sect's Ancestor and the Dao and Buddha Ancestors actually took up residence in this mountain range!</p><p></p><p>No wonder it became a forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked at the Eight Trigrams Ridge in horror.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors that the Eight Trigrams Patriarch had already achieved immortality. Later, six thousand years ago, the Divine Dao Monarch failed in his attempt to break through to the Deity Realm and flew to the moon to sit in meditation at the Eight Trigrams Ridge!"</p><p></p><p>"In more recent times, there were also many supreme beings who failed to break through to the Deity Realm and went to the Eight Trigrams Ridge!"</p><p></p><p>That was a nest of immortals!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's scalp went numb, and he quickly listed the other major forbidden areas, afraid that Gu Jiuqing might enter them.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there are also several other forbidden areas on the moon, such as the Dragon's Den, the Phoenix's Nest, and the Divine Pit..."</p><p></p><p>There were too many forbidden areas on the moon. Lu Yuan had only introduced seven or eight of them.</p><p></p><p>However, the ancient forbidden areas and the Eight Trigrams Realm were different. The ancient forbidden areas were mostly treacherous places where no one could survive!</p><p></p><p>But the Eight Trigrams Ridge was inhabited by living beings!</p><p></p><p>The mountain ranges twisted and turned. As Gu Jiuqing stepped into the void and ascended to a higher place, majestic mountain ranges appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>In total, there were eight mountain ranges, each one coiling on the ground like a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight poured down like water onto the Eight Trigrams Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Illuminating this place with clarity, one could see the sinkholes formed on each mountain range.</p><p></p><p>"However, the appearance of this place is somewhat different from what the elders described. These sinkholes must have formed in the past thousand years or so."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan tightly clutched the Supreme Primordial Sword, closely following behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Yet this Realized One did not retreat, but instead headed towards the Eight Trigrams Ridge!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan exclaimed in alarm, but Gu Jiuqing did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan suppressed his flustered expression. Since the Realized One had already made his decision, he, as the follower, would simply follow.</p><p></p><p>Their figures, one in front and one behind, entered the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Eight Trigrams Ridge, the moonlight was even denser than in other areas of the moon, like water. Walking on the mountain ranges felt like walking underwater.</p><p></p><p>In the void, the moonlight rippled.</p><p></p><p>With each step, the void surged.</p><p></p><p>As the two set foot in the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Area, Lu Yuan vigilantly scanned their surroundings, worried that a great horror might appear.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, however, remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Since Senior Brother Liang Xiao had asked him to come to the moon to retrieve the divine weapon, he naturally would not harm him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing leisurely strolled along the mountain range. Not long after, a stone chamber appeared in the distance, inside a large pit!</p><p></p><p>The stone chamber was decaying!</p><p></p><p>Wisps of an ancient, decaying aura drifted out from the stone chamber, enveloping the entire sinkhole.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan stood in place, not taking another step towards the stone chamber.</p><p></p><p>This could possibly be the meditation dwelling of an immortal from the chaotic era eight thousand years ago!!</p><p></p><p>If they disturbed this ancient immortal, a single slap from them would be no different from swatting two flies.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stared at the stone chamber and said softly, "Senior Brother, there's something off about this stone chamber. The aura of decay is too strong. If this ancient patriarch were still alive, he couldn't possibly emanate such a decaying aura!"</p><p></p><p>"It's possible that this ancient patriarch is undergoing the process of transcendence!"</p><p></p><p>Transcendence?</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao had said that transcendence meant dissipating one's spiritual power. After a cultivator died, their spiritual power would first dissipate, followed by the primordial essence on the Wuzhu Mountain, and finally the last trace of their true spirit would vanish.</p><p></p><p>Only then would the physical body follow.</p><p></p><p>After the physical body lost all its supernatural qualities, it would decay and age. If preserved properly, it would become a remnant husk.</p><p></p><p>"Crack——————"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the door panel of the stone chamber sank down!</p><p></p><p>With a crashing sound, it collapsed.</p><p></p><p>In the silent Eight Trigrams Ridge, this noise was like a thunderclap, resounding endlessly for dozens of miles around.</p><p></p><p>But for this mountain range, dozens of miles was nothing.</p><p></p><p>The stone slab fell, broken and tattered. At the moment it collapsed, it shattered into pieces, and the ancient, decaying aura gushed forth into the void.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the cave dwelling!!</p><p></p><p>He gathered his spiritual power in his eyes, briefly activating his divine sight to see further.</p><p></p><p>The decaying aura scattered boundlessly, disappearing into the world.</p><p></p><p>Inside the stone chamber, white bones lay decaying!</p><p></p><p>"No Celestial Realm? No Wuzhu Mountain either?"</p><p></p><p>Where were the fruits of immortality from Wuzhu Mountain? Where was the primordial essence that formed the foundation?</p><p></p><p>On the white bones, the thirty-four vertebrae had disintegrated. The skeletal remains sat upright in a bizarre manner, without a spine yet still standing tall!</p><p></p><p>On the skull, there was nothing, no trace of a Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Only a single line was carved on the stone wall opposite the skeletal remains!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan focused his divine sight, using the Clear Water Heavenly Eye technique to read the line on the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh! Sigh! Sigh!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas! Alas! Alas!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not resigned to this, I was just half a step away..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's voice was filled with sadness.</p><p></p><p>This supreme being, an ancient patriarch of thousands of years, was filled with a sense of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>He was just half a step away from breaking through to the next realm!</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to what realm?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Realm to the Tribulation Realm?</p><p></p><p>Or the Tribulation Realm to the Deity Realm?</p><p></p><p>Or was he at the final half-step of the Deity Realm, cultivating to become a true deity?</p><p></p><p>This nameless ancient patriarch had died in this stone chamber for who knows how many years. Just this set of white bones alone, without any remnants of divine abilities or great techniques, made it too difficult to discern his true identity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt a sense of realization, "This ancient patriarch must have been a brilliant and extraordinary being in more recent times. It's a pity that he still couldn't take that final half-step!"</p><p></p><p>What was that final half-step?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing already had the answer.</p><p></p><p>That final half-step must be to become a deity.</p><p></p><p>To open the gate of divinity and behold the true gods!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stared at the stone chamber. After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Senior Brother, this was the dwelling of a supreme being who was almost a deity in his later years. Perhaps within this cave dwelling, there are remnants of this nearly divine being's legacy!"</p><p></p><p>"Your unworthy junior disciple is willing to scout ahead for Senior Brother. Please, Senior Brother, stay away from the Eight Trigrams Ridge. If any mishap occurs, Senior Brother need not concern himself with me!"</p><p></p><p>This could be a fortuitous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain the legacy of this nameless ancient patriarch, with Senior Brother Gu's talents, he could avoid taking many detours and shorten his path to Realization.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing waved his hand, "There's no need for that. We shall continue onwards."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not allow Lu Yuan to enter the stone chamber.</p><p></p><p>There was one more thing he did not say.</p><p></p><p>This nameless ancient patriarch was brilliantly talented, yet he still failed.</p><p></p><p>The path of a failure?</p><p></p><p>He had no need to pick it up.</p><p></p><p>Self-proving the Primordial Chaos! Using the power of dragons and elephants, using power to prove the Way! These two paths to Realization and divinity could not possibly fail!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's unshakable determination had already quietly taken form.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing was about to take another step, a brilliant light suddenly emerged from within the stone chamber.</p><p></p><p>The soaring radiance shattered the stone chamber, and the white skeletal remains were blasted into scattered pieces all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The moonlight dispersed, and the soaring radiance continued to surge into the void.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A huge beam of light shot up above the moon, illuminating the starry sky. </p><p></p><p>This massive ray was too dazzling, piercing through the cosmos for hundreds or even thousands of miles! Combined with the brilliant divine radiance blooming and intertwining with the moonlight, it formed an even more striking brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"This is the ominous sign of a celestial treasure emerging. A celestial treasure is being born inside the stone chamber, and everyone on half of the moon will be able to see this divine radiance."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>The divine radiance lasted for just three breaths before dissipating. As it vanished, this mountain ridge was torn apart. From inside the stone chamber, a seven-colored radiance slowly flew out, hovering atop one of the mountain peaks!</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored auspicious light contained seven different Dao auras intertwined, manifesting the celestial treasure within the radiance.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive medicinal herb, with seven leaves encircling a snow-white flower bud. </p><p></p><p>The flower was fragrant, its scent wafting through the heavens and earth, quickly reaching Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Just one breath of it made his Nihuan Palace tremble, as if a real divine soul was about to condense!</p><p></p><p>When one's will reached a certain profound level, a divine soul could indeed condense. Ordinary cultivators could refine a divine soul upon reaching the Imperfection Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the Celestial Palace Realm, the divine soul would reside within the Nine Revolutions Primal Pill, transcending the Imperfection Realm and Celestial Realm to open the Nihuan Palace, where the divine soul became the primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>This was a true priceless treasure!</p><p></p><p>It could allow him to refine a divine soul at just the Dharma Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this is the Primordial Spirit Herb, it should be the Seven Revolutions Spirit Herb. Consuming it can allow one to refine a perfected divine soul. If a Celestial Palace cultivator consumes it, their primordial spirit's power will increase by at least thirty percent!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Such a rare herb had appeared once before in the Primordial Chaos, but never on the moon.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Revolutions Spirit Herb had to go through seven color transformations - red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet - to fully mature.</p><p></p><p>Here on the Eight Formations Ridge, the flower bud of this herb had turned from red to orange.</p><p></p><p>Its fragrance was even richer than before, permeating further through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked up!</p><p></p><p>In his vision, a divine radiance came roaring over.</p><p></p><p>The starlight rippled, transforming into divine light that pierced through the azure void and descended upon this mountain ridge.</p><p></p><p>A celestial robe fluttered, starlight scattered, and specks of radiance coalesced into a massive star beneath her feet!</p><p></p><p>She stood atop that great star, like a celestial deity from the stars treading upon the mortal realm untainted by mundane dust.</p><p></p><p>The celestial woman was stunningly tall, nearly two meters, her slender beautiful legs standing on the great star, making her seem even more exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Illuminated by the starlight, even the hems of her robe were translucent, clearly revealing her undergarments.</p><p></p><p>It was someone from the Celestial Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>The celestial woman standing on the great star also noticed Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze lingered briefly on the sword case in Lu Yuan's hand before falling on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"So you are disciples of the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Step aside, I, Celestial Moon Lady, want this herb!"</p><p></p><p>Celestial Moon Lady!</p><p></p><p>This woman held no insignificant status within the Celestial Pavilion to be so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Celestial Moon Lady, your Yin Moon Brilliance Art has indeed increased several fold on the moon, even I could not catch up."</p><p></p><p>Another person appeared. </p><p></p><p>He cautiously looked towards the seven mountain ridges in the distance. Seeing no reaction from them, he descended onto the Eight Formations Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight wove around him as he casually pinched it into a bead and placed it above his head, forming a resplendent canopy that enveloped his entire body. Jade pendants hung from the canopy's edges, clinking melodiously as he moved.</p><p></p><p>"These arrogant Sword Sect cultivators have no respect."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't drive them away, they won't leave willingly."</p><p></p><p>The canopied cultivator exhaled a breath towards Gu Jiuqing's direction!</p><p></p><p>That breath transformed into a celestial canopy, like a waterfall cascading down. It was not a sword art, just a simple exhalation forming this spectacle.</p><p></p><p>He actually intended to blow Gu Jiuqing and the others away with just a breath!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's expression changed!</p><p></p><p>That breath contained immense power - if they forcefully withstood it, even Imperfection Realm cultivators would be obliterated, body and soul.</p><p></p><p>This was at least the pinnacle of the Spirit Condensation Realm!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his arm, casually sweeping it horizontally to disperse the cascading breath.</p><p></p><p>On his Imperfection Mountain, the coiling dragons and elephants had already stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers, it's just a herb, no need for such hostilities. I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had no intention of contesting.</p><p></p><p>This herb was exceptional, but to him, it would only allow the refinement of a divine soul, not as useful as a millennia-old spirit herb king.</p><p></p><p>He urgently needed to find the spirit armaments his senior brother had planted on the moon, so he could accept the power bestowed by the Azure Star.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, no need to leave!"</p><p></p><p>"We're here!"</p><p></p><p>Two sword rays crisscrossed the azure void, sword auras devouring space, slashing apart the moon's vast expanse. Even the moonlight was cleaved, unable to mend for a long time - as if a rift had been torn in the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>As the sword rays dissipated, two figures appeared behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Wind Sword Immortal and Frost Sword Immortal, two sword immortals, gazed at the Seven Revolutions Spirit Herb with greed!</p><p></p><p>They were at the pinnacle of Spirit Condensation, just one step away from condensing a Celestial Palace and forging a primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>With this herb, they could definitely break through to the Celestial Palace Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brothers Wind and Frost Snow."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing saluted, but the two sword immortals did not respond, fixated on the precious herb.</p><p></p><p>"Centuries ago, we roamed the world together. I never imagined we'd reunite on the moon with Celestial Moon Lady and Boyue Shan, two elite disciples of the Celestial Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Wind Sword Immortal's gourd trembled, transforming into a red cloud that rippled into the shape of a sword within wine - his spirit armament, the Wine Sword, a four-hundred-groove divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Frost Snow Sword Immortal did not move, still staring at the Seven Revolutions Spirit Herb.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators were invincible against peers of the same realm!</p><p></p><p>Those two elite Celestial Pavilion disciples were not Celestial Palace cultivators, no match for Senior Brothers Wind and Frost Snow.</p><p></p><p>But do not forget, they were Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>What is a Sword Immortal? One who has comprehended one-tenth of the Sword Dao, with battle prowess comparable to Celestial Palace cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers, please proceed. This junior must enter the mountains, so I bid you farewell."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not look back as he left with Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two sword immortals were stunned but did not stop Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>How could they? Ask him to stay and share the Seven Revolutions Spirit Herb?</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>But they also had to be wary of the madman behind Gu Jiuqing, which could create an opening.</p><p></p><p>"Wooosh—————"</p><p></p><p>More rays of light appeared in the azure void - it was disciples of the Sword Sect and Celestial Pavilion finally arriving outside the first mountain ridge of the Eight Formations Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty Sword Sect disciples came, with several sword rays streaking across.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Pavilion disciples were even more numerous, nearly eighty of them.  </p><p></p><p>The two great sects' disciples formed opposing camps, on the verge of all-out war.</p><p></p><p>But this had nothing to do with Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Each mountain ridge of the Eight Formations Ridge had a circular celestial pit, each of different sizes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing exerted his physical strength, but could never create such massive pits on the incredibly sturdy Eight Formations Ridge, tougher even than spirit-forging chambers.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the first ridge, Gu Jiuqing quickly arrived at the second one.</p><p></p><p>This ridge was somewhat different from the first!</p><p></p><p>On the main peak stood a spring!</p><p></p><p>The spring's waters flowed down the entire mountain in an unbroken stream, the clear tinkling sound echoing endlessly across the second ridge.</p><p></p><p>"The Inexhaustible Spring! I've finally found it!"</p><p></p><p>His senior brother Liang Xiao had planted ten spirit armaments on the moon, eight within the Inexhaustible Spring, and two under the Primordial Moon Trees on the moon's other side.</p><p></p><p>This time, the celestial ship had docked on the far side of the moon from the Primordial Moon Trees.</p><p></p><p>Hence, he came to the Eight Formations Ridge first to locate the Inexhaustible Spring Peak.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was apprehensive, seeing Gu Jiuqing's intent to ascend the Inexhaustible Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this junior seems to know some secrets about this ridge."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Legend says during the Primordial Chaos era eight thousand years ago, when the Primal Chaos was in turmoil and demonic beasts ran rampant, the Eight Formations Ancestor found this Inexhaustible Spring in a demonic lair."</p><p></p><p>"After the Eight Formations Ancestor ascended to the moon, the Inexhaustible Spring vanished."</p><p></p><p>So this ridge was likely where the Eight Formations Ancestor once closed off his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paused, glancing back at the first ridge.</p><p></p><p>All was silent there.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister once said the Three Sword Immortals of our sect would eventually die!"</p><p></p><p>This had weighed on him since then. After flying to the moon, Gu Jiuqing dared not get too close to the Three Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>He always felt this herb's appearance was too timely!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing worried his power of three thousand-groove spirit armaments could not be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was in such a hurry to find the ten spirit armaments his senior brother had planted on the moon.</p><p></p><p>He sought to solidify his cultivation!</p>

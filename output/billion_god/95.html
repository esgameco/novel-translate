        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Deep in the forbidden realm.</p><p></p><p>"Banshanuo, don't you want to live a second life?"</p><p></p><p>"Why? You want to give him a hint? Back then, Jiang Buyu's talent shook us all. This is just a little fellow who has cultivated for over a thousand years, but his gifted talents are extraordinarily brilliant, unprecedented in history."</p><p></p><p>"His fleshly body is nearly perfect, his magic powers are infinite and inexhaustible. Only his primordial spirit is the weak point. But after discoursing with us, he will remold the Heavenly Palace, and his primordial spirit will also become perfect. Coupled with his divine abilities, he will definitely be the one in this world to become an immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"For the first time, the Venerable of the Eight Trigrams has obstructed us. Nine hundred years we've been waiting for Jiang Buyu's arrival. We didn't get him, but instead another prodigy came."</p><p></p><p>Different voices bloomed in the divine consciousness. </p><p></p><p>Banshanuo's voice also appeared among them, "Heh heh, are you all blaming me?"</p><p></p><p>"We dare not blame the Great Celestial Wine Maker!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Celestial Wine Maker's profound knowledge of the heavenly and human realms, we dare not blame you."</p><p></p><p>"Well then, although I gave him some guidance, it seems he didn't listen clearly and still revealed his original form."  </p><p></p><p>"You all saw it too, with his meager magic, it's difficult for him to achieve the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Banshanuo gazed at the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"That's precisely why we let him leave."</p><p></p><p>"Sitting in meditation to overcome death, sitting to overcome death! One's own Dao will ultimately surpass the Dao of others."</p><p></p><p>The voices disappeared, only Banshanuo still gazed at the sky, looking at that huge celestial body.</p><p></p><p>That was the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>"Did he do it intentionally? Or did he really not catch my implied meaning?"</p><p></p><p>Banshanuo looked at the Great Wilderness, as if seeing the Scholastic Palace in Jixia of the Great Zhou Divine Capital. </p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Pangu Divine Body, I really hope to see the Pangu Divine Body and the Ninth Cycle Golden Immortal compete in the future."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and continued sitting in meditation to overcome death.</p><p></p><p>His seventh cycle of the Golden Immortal had dissipated vital energy, his fleshly body weakening by the moment.</p><p></p><p>The first mountain range. </p><p></p><p>A celestial pit!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the corpse in this pit, his expression extremely grave. </p><p></p><p>It was the Sword Immortal Wind!</p><p></p><p>The chief disciple of Mang Huang Peak's Mang Huang Peak Lord, Elder Martial Brother Wind who had roamed the world hundreds of years ago, had fallen in this pit.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wind had a scholarly spirit. Among the three Sword Immortals, he addressed Gu Jiuqing as Elder Martial Brother.</p><p></p><p>After boarding the Moon Ship, Elder Wind celebrated his embarkation with scriptures as wine.</p><p></p><p>Scenes related to Elder Wind appeared one by one in Gu Jiuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>But before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure was already dead.</p><p></p><p>The sword transformed from the wine gourd shattered into pieces, scattered by his side.</p><p></p><p>In the pit where Elder Wind fell, some sword auras had not dissipated. One could see the shattered fragments of flying swords and pellets on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wind has fallen, his Sword in Wine and flying sword pellets are all broken."</p><p></p><p>Who was it that killed Elder Wind?</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing left the first mountain range, the other two Sword Immortals descended, their sword disciples maneuvering sword auras to arrive.</p><p></p><p>With the cultivation of those two at the Xingxuan Hall not even reaching the Heavenly Palace Realm, it was impossible for them to kill Elder Wind!</p><p></p><p>Could it be an immortal of the Heavenly Palace Realm from Xingxuan Hall took action?</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother! This is the Celestial Moon Lady of Xingxuan Hall!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan exclaimed, discovering the figure of Xingxuan Hall's Celestial Moon Lady in the pit.</p><p></p><p>The woman lay half-naked and bloodied on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Her Mud Pill Palace had exploded, pierced through by a sword.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the Dao of flying sword pellets that killed her with one strike.</p><p></p><p>But there were no wounds on Elder Wind's body at all.</p><p></p><p>Was he injured by some divine ability?</p><p></p><p>His life force extinguished without being cut down?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>In this deep pit, two top disciples from the great sects had died, seemingly killing each other.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing searched through pit after pit, finding scattered divine weapons everywhere, as well as a few damaged thousand-streaked divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>These thousand-streaked weapons had activated their Dao traces, most of their spiritual natures dissipated, their surfaces dull and lusterless.</p><p></p><p>"Dead? All dead?"</p><p></p><p>The other top disciple from Xingxuan Hall had his crown shattered, Bo Qingshan's entire head severed from his body by a divine weapon's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother! I counted, there are thirty corpses of sword disciples, including the Sword Immortal Wind and four of his principal disciples!"</p><p></p><p>One Sword Immortal died, and four principal sword disciples also fell at the Eight Trigrams Ridge!!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect suffered devastating losses.</p><p></p><p>One of them was even Dugu Ming!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked at Dugu Ming's corpse, grieving from the heart.</p><p></p><p>This was his childhood playmate, his sword cultivation not bad at all, how could he have fallen here?</p><p></p><p>Dugu Ming's corpse had decayed, the life force within extinguished, his facial features distorted, as if he had witnessed some great horror.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stepped forward and closed Dugu Ming's eyes. In that moment, he took something from Dugu Ming's hand.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's expression turned grave, enduring the pain.</p><p></p><p>When he stood up, he opened his five fingers and clasped his hands together, bowing to Dugu Ming's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Good brother! Rest in peace!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan returned to Gu Jiuqing's side, "Seventy-two people from Xingxuan Hall have fallen, including the Celestial Moon Lady and Bo Qingshan, two peak Spirit Condensation cultivators."</p><p></p><p>So many people died?</p><p></p><p>Did they all kill each other? </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why didn't anyone take that stalk of seventh-cycle spirit herb?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt this matter wasn't so simple.</p><p></p><p>Principal disciples of the Sword Sect, top disciples of Xingxuan Hall, plus so many disciples from the great sects dying together, when this news spreads to the Great Wilderness, it will surely shake both major sects!!</p><p></p><p>"Among them, I saw the corpse of my old friend Dugu Ming. This trip to the moon, I had two other friends who came too."</p><p></p><p>"But I only found Dugu Ming's body, the other two friends must have run away!"</p><p></p><p>Run away?</p><p></p><p>If they had all killed each other, why would anyone need to flee?</p><p></p><p>Besides the two Sword Immortals and two top Xingxuan Hall disciples, was there someone else involved?</p><p></p><p>Or did Senior Martial Sister Han kill them all secretly?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Lu Yuan, whose expression didn't change, but instead pointed at the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda cradled in Gu Jiuqing's palms.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother carries a treasure, it's too dangerous on the moon. We should return to the Moon Ship soon!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lu Yuan had arranged things for Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda! That was the embodiment of the Venerable of the Eight Trigrams' body.</p><p></p><p>Pointing at the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda?</p><p></p><p>So there was still someone on the first mountain range?</p><p></p><p>Someone? The Venerable of the Eight Trigrams was no longer human!</p><p></p><p>Not human?</p><p></p><p>Then it was a demon or evil spirit!</p><p></p><p>There were evil spirits on the moon!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts were profound. After comprehending over ten insights, he had transcended the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll return to the Moon Ship!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't waste words. Sword auras condensed under his feet, forming sword energy that slashed through the sky as he flew towards the distant horizon, leaving the Eight Trigrams Ridge behind.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan also summoned his sword pellets!</p><p></p><p>His sword intent was only three parts, but using the flying sword pellets to ride the sword energy allowed him to follow Gu Jiuqing's flight.</p><p></p><p>The two figures disappeared into the vast moon's realm.</p><p></p><p>However, their direction was not towards where they had come from, but the opposite way!</p><p></p><p>It was towards the other side of the moon!</p><p></p><p>The side where the Primordial Moon Tree was located.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy, why did you conceal that trace of demonic energy?"</p><p></p><p>"You took this trace of demonic energy from Dugu Ming's hand, why not tell your Elder Martial Brother Gu? Were you worried there were evil spirits here?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, they're just demons and evil spirits, look how scared you are. You're my disciple of the Eight Trigrams Sect, unless it's a Demon Sovereign or Demon Emperor emerging, otherwise you can just walk right through. Go get the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda back, this old man will teach you how to wield my true body!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, with your current abilities, you're not even a match for one finger of that fallen Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"That demon has at least the power of three fused Heavenly Palaces. The demon that killed these people absolutely wasn't alone."  </p><p></p><p>"This trace of demonic energy from Dugu Ming's hand, if it was from a true immortal demon, even just this trace would be able to assimilate him."</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you responding to this old man? Say something, good disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Still not saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Boring, boring."</p><p></p><p>"Later when you beg this old man, this old man won't lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>The voice from the Mud Pill Palace was too noisy, so Lu Yuan sealed it.</p><p></p><p>He followed behind Gu Jiuqing, flying across the moon.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he noticed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Because the direction they were flying in was definitely not where the Moon Ship was docked.</p><p></p><p>"Is Elder Martial Brother doing this intentionally?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stared at Gu Jiuqing's figure, not asking, only following silently.</p><p></p><p>With evil spirits appearing on the moon, they must have some scheme.</p><p></p><p>But to Elder Martial Brother, this was just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>On the path to immortality, what great danger could there be that he couldn't safely overcome? Just follow Elder Martial Brother and watch what I say.</p><p></p><p>"Thump thump thump————"  </p><p></p><p>A pounding sound came from Gu Jiuqing's dantian.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the pounding stopped.</p><p></p><p>This was the third time Gu Jiuqing had forged his Elixir.</p><p></p><p>In his dantian, the myriad wondrous gates poured forth magic power, fusing with the hair-thin Elixir that had been forged three times.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, two sword beams flew across the moon, piercing through the moonlight, heading straight towards the distance without stopping.</p><p></p><p>The sword beams moved rapidly, passing by mountain range after mountain range. Even when encountering spirit plants and herbs, they did not linger, their destination clear.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On that sword light, Gu Jiuqing's magical power surged, maintaining the speed of the escaping light. </p><p></p><p>But his mind had already concentrated within the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's reminder was obvious enough.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know from where Luyuan learned of the demon!  </p><p></p><p>But with the demon emerging into the world and bringing catastrophe to the human realm, he had not yet absorbed the cultivation of the Blue Star people.</p><p></p><p>Facing the demon, he could not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace!</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the Dragon Elephant skill cultivation of 50 million people from Jiangnan Province did not cause any change to the Dao fruit, it remained as full as before!</p><p></p><p>"Now I should still have some time."</p><p></p><p>"The demon appeared on the moon, killing disciples of the Star Building Sect and the Sword Sect, but they did not immediately take action to kill me! This is to follow me to their main base!"</p><p></p><p>Only then could they wipe them all out in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>So he should be safe before arriving at the moon ship.</p><p></p><p>Blue Star people!</p><p></p><p>Let me see your efforts during this time.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Dragon Elephant skill, the sword intent of my sword cultivation, these are my trump cards for victory. Now I only have three divine weapons, it's best to absorb one type at a time."</p><p></p><p>Let's absorb the Dragon Elephant skill first!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Dao fruit expectantly, his thoughts touching the Dao fruit, the Dragon Elephant truths from each province interweaving.  </p><p></p><p>Dozens of truths condensed within the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Those were hundreds of Dragon Elephant truths, appearing together.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing plucked off each Dragon Elephant truth, the vague divine soul gradually condensing into reality.</p><p></p><p>Each province had thirty-four cities, some more.</p><p></p><p>And the Dragon Elephant skill had become widespread throughout the Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of scenes rippled, countless people in the Dragon Kingdom cultivating the Dragon Elephant skill, flowing like water.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant skill had become the nation's number one exercise for the spiritual energy revival era, starting from elementary school all the way through university graduation.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists sprouted like bamboo shoots after rain, every day there were many new martial artists reporting to the Martial Arts Alliance, martial artists breaking through to grandmaster level, grandmasters breaking through to great grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>There were even great grandmasters who cultivated to the Martial Saint realm!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of Dragon Elephant insights gathered together.</p><p></p><p>The translucent truths were plucked off by Gu Jiuqing, the little divine soul figures swallowing them down.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul condensed into reality, various divine lights flickering on its surface, with patterns of dragons and elephants interweaving.</p><p></p><p>There was also the enlightenment of Potian, allowing Gu Jiuqing to comprehend the truths.</p><p></p><p>Mastering one law leads to mastering all laws.</p><p></p><p>There are three paths to divine attainment: power attainment, spirit attainment, and body attainment. After the three become one, one must choose the path of divine attainment.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Jiuqing plucking the truths was a path of spirit attainment.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the Dragon Elephant skill had long surpassed the creator of the skill.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing comprehending the truths further opened the path of spirit attainment!</p><p></p><p>The divine soul grew stronger and stronger, condensing into substance.</p><p></p><p>The little figure standing under the Mud Pill Palace suddenly shook and transformed into a dragon elephant!</p><p></p><p>The dragon elephant spirit roamed the Mud Pill Palace, flying into clarity, escaping into the vast, like the manifestation of spirit or the embodiment of heavenly law and earthly phenomena!</p><p></p><p>This dragon elephant was a full three zhang tall, and after a moment, the dragon elephant soul expanded even more.</p><p></p><p>The truths condensed from the insights of 1 billion people cultivating the Dragon Elephant skill were one by one refined by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the dragon elephant soul expanded to twenty zhang!</p><p></p><p>The twenty zhang dragon elephant soul was Gu Jiuqing's soul body.</p><p></p><p>With a move of the soul, scenes of the vast wilderness appeared, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations all interweaving, finally collapsing into the form of a giant.</p><p></p><p>"My current soul is still not powerful enough, lacking the majestic spirit soul of Banshan Nuo, and a few degrees of nimbleness."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's dragon elephant spirit dissipated the illusory giant form.</p><p></p><p>The absorption of the Dragon Elephant truths was complete, now it was time to absorb the cultivation of the twenty-two sets of the Dragon Elephant skill.</p><p></p><p>Still one province's cultivation at a time!</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Jiuqing absorbed the cultivation from Xijiang Province.</p><p></p><p>Xijiang was near Jiangnan and also a major province, with a slightly smaller population than Jiangnan.</p><p></p><p>Vital energy like a dragon appeared from nowhere, filling his entire body!</p><p></p><p>With the comprehension of the truths, the vital energy washed over his flesh, strengthening his bones and spirit storages. The Buzhou Mountain immediately showed changes, each vertebra filled with the original source.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing's attention was on his five viscera and six bowels.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation of the vast wilderness, one would not refine the five viscera and six bowels.</p><p></p><p>But in the Blue Star's cultivation, the refinement of the five viscera into the five qi was more appropriate. After the five viscera of the flesh body were refined into the five qi, they became five deities, which was safer.</p><p></p><p>And now, under the washing of one province's cultivation, Gu Jiuqing's five viscera and six bowels were being washed away, gradually dissolving.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant primal five qi began to condense.</p><p></p><p>Primal metal qi appeared in the lungs!</p><p></p><p>Primal wood qi appeared in the liver!  </p><p></p><p>Primal water qi appeared in the kidneys!</p><p></p><p>Primal earth qi appeared in the spleen!</p><p></p><p>Primal fire qi appeared in the heart!</p><p></p><p>The five viscera gradually dissolved, transforming into the primal five qi. Gu Jiuqing felt no discomfort, but rather a sense of naturalness.</p><p></p><p>It was just that under such consumption, the vital energy washing the five viscera and six bowels and condensing the primal five qi was depleted very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing consecutively drew in the cultivation of the six major provinces of Jiangdong, Jiangbei, Hedong, Hexi, Nanhe, and Beiheto sustain the five viscera qi.</p><p></p><p>The five viscera continued to be refined, and more and more primal five qi covered their surface.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant original source on Buzhou Mountain expanded at a visible speed, directly climbing to twenty vertebrae, thirty vertebrae!</p><p></p><p>Finally reaching the thirty-third vertebra at the peak of Buzhou Mountain, breaking through and growing into a sapling tree.</p><p></p><p>Several spirit fruits condensed on it!</p><p></p><p>These were the spirit fruits condensed from the Dragon Elephant original source.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Stepping on the Heavens! Transforming into a dragon elephant, stepping through the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Combined Strike! Head and tail striking together, harmonizing with the great way, erupting in the most supreme strike.</p><p></p><p>These were spirit techniques, spells, and martial skills, growing on the tree of spirit fruits condensed from the Dragon Elephant original source.</p><p></p><p>"Crackling sounds————"</p><p></p><p>The Buzhou realm was perfected. For others, this realm would already be the great achievement, allowing one to begin refining divinity.</p><p></p><p>But before Gu Jiuqing could even have that thought, he sensed a force pouring down from Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Weighing heavily upon his body.</p><p></p><p>It was the force of the Dragon Elephant, beginning to condense on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked inwardly at Buzhou Mountain, and with one glance he saw thirty thousand dragon elephants crouching on each vertebra, the three divine weapons also erupting.</p><p></p><p>The five hundred grooves on the Dragon Tiger Bell rippled of their own accord, the Bronze Cauldron also opened five hundred grooves, and even the Star Pearl emitted countless rays of starlight, groove after groove rippling.</p><p></p><p>The power of the three divine weapons firmly suppressed Buzhou Mountain, preventing its collapse and Gu Jiuqing's flesh body from crumbling.</p><p></p><p>"Forty thousand dragon elephants!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand dragon elephants!" </p><p></p><p>"Sixty thousand dragon elephants!"</p><p></p><p>"Seventy thousand dragon elephants!"</p><p></p><p>A total of seventy thousand dragon elephants condensed.</p><p></p><p>Head after head of dragon elephant landed on Buzhou Mountain, crouching on each vertebra, densely packed, a massive seventy thousand in number.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing only felt an unmatched divine power.</p><p></p><p>"My path of divine attainment is proven by force!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three divine weapons, their limits not yet reached.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know what tribulations he would face next, but no matter what, he had to exhaust all his power.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Sister said the three sword protégés of the Sword Sect would eventually die. Senior Brother Feng has already died, leaving only Senior Brothers Lieyang and Hanxue. Whether they die after returning to the Sword Sect or on the moon, I must ensure my own safety!"</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's main concern.</p><p></p><p>Who dares to kill the true disciples of the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>These demons were extremely audacious, killing the true disciples of the Sword Sect, they must have made full preparations.</p><p></p><p>"Continue drawing in the Dragon Elephant power from the sixteen provinces and five capital cities of the Dragon Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing drew it in province by province, the Dragon Elephant force condensing head after head, his five viscera constantly washed over, more and more primal five qi covering their surface.</p><p></p><p>Eighty thousand dragon elephants!</p><p></p><p>Ninety thousand dragon elephants!  </p><p></p><p>One hundred thousand dragon elephants!</p><p></p><p>After one hundred thousand dragon elephants crouched on Buzhou Mountain, it seemed to reach some kind of threshold or limit.</p><p></p><p>The one hundred thousand dragon elephants let out a long roar, the resounding howl echoing around Buzhou Mountain, even entering the flesh body, cleansing it like thunder.</p><p></p><p>After roaring, the one hundred thousand dragon elephants moved, gathering together to crouch on a single vertebra!</p><p></p><p>On this one vertebra gathered the one hundred thousand dragon elephants, their force giving rise to a vision, an ancient kingdom condensing!</p><p></p><p>One hundred thousand dragon elephants for one nation!</p><p></p><p>The force of one Dragon Elephant nation gathered on Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump——————  </p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump————————</p><p></p><p>Buzhou Mountain shook, the divine weapons radiating brilliance, involuntarily tracing the remaining grooves.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liangxiao's Bronze Cauldron activated nine hundred and ninety-nine grooves!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Tiger Bell activated nine hundred and ninety-nine grooves!</p><p></p><p>The two divine weapons reached their limits, activating one thousand grooves would cause damage after just ten days of maintaining that state.</p><p></p><p>But activating nine hundred and ninety-nine grooves allowed the divine weapons to last at least dozens of years without damage.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough! Not enough! The force of one Dragon Elephant nation is not enough! I need two nations, three nations!"</p><p></p><p>His Star Pearl had not yet activated nine hundred and ninety-nine grooves.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant spirit condensed outside of Buzhou Mountain, he gazed madly at this scene.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Star people, let me see the limits of your cultivation in this time!"</p><p></p><p>What was the limit of the cultivation of 1 billion people practicing the Dragon Elephant skill?!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters! Pleading for more!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The profound insights of the Dragon Elephant Skill within the Dao Realm were continuously pouring into Gu Jiuqing's body. </p><p></p><p>The rich Dragon Elephant Origin on Buzhou Mountain caused the divine wood formed from the condensed origin to grow at a visibly rapid speed, and the two spiritual fruits hanging on it were also slowly growing larger.</p><p></p><p>This was the innate spiritual power bestowed by the Dragon Elephant Origin, growing according to the strength of the origin.  </p><p></p><p>The twenty-two forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill were the most fundamental transcendence methods of the Sword Sect. Above it were the Heavenly Snake Molting Technique, the Nine Celestial Tempering Bones Technique, the Flood Dragon Swallowing Heaven Technique, and various other body refining methods beyond the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill was ordinary. For a regular cultivator through years of accumulation, they could at most complete three transcendences. With slightly better aptitude, they could complete five transcendences, thereby gaining the power of a Dragon Elephant.  </p><p></p><p>For such an ordinary method, even the innate spiritual powers were very average.</p><p></p><p>The two spiritual powers, Dragon Elephant Stepping on Heaven and Dragon Elephant Striking Together, were only low-grade spiritual powers. But with the continuous input of the origin, the grades of these low-grade spiritual powers were advancing.</p><p></p><p>The divine wood was rapidly expanding, and the two spiritual fruit hanging on it had also grown much larger, advancing from low-grade to mid-grade.</p><p></p><p>Within the spiritual fruit of Dragon Elephant Stepping on Heaven, there was an ancient and enormous image of intertwined dragons and elephants, their figures spanning the heavens, as if wanting to shatter this celestial dome with a single stomp.</p><p></p><p>Illusory and real auras were evolving. The primordial Dragon Elephant, breaking through the cosmos, descended from the endless eons into the mortal realm.  </p><p></p><p>It wanted to dominate this vast heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of Dragon Elephant Stepping on Heaven was far more powerful than when it was a low-grade spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual fruit of Dragon Elephant Striking Together, the dragon and elephant struck each other head-on, forming the profound Dao character. Brilliant divine light radiated out, like the strike of the Great Dao itself.  </p><p></p><p>Its grade had also advanced to a mid-grade spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>As the two spiritual powers slowly increased in grade, the divine wood's form seemed to be growing a thirty-fourth vertebra, brimming with vibrant life force.</p><p></p><p>On Buzhou Mountain, there were a hundred thousand Dragon Elephants on each vertebra!</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand Dragon Elephants formed a Dragon Elephant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After condensing into the Dragon Elephant Kingdom, Gu Jiuqing's strength did not increase, but the gathered Dragon Elephant force was nearly unbreakable!</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest advantage of the Dragon Elephant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant power took the Dragon Elephant as the unit. Previously when Gu Jiuqing had two thousand two hundred Dragon Elephants, he could gather the force of those two thousand two hundred Dragon Elephants into one strike with the power of two thousand two hundred Dragon Elephants.  </p><p></p><p>This strike could subdue the Spirit Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>But against talented cultivators like Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao, they could instantly divide their spiritual power into countless gossamer threads, far finer than silk, and in an instant dissipate the force of two thousand two hundred Dragon Elephants one by one.</p><p></p><p>Against them, the power of two thousand two hundred Dragon Elephants was no different from the power of a single Dragon Elephant.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different!</p><p></p><p>With the Dragon Elephant Kingdom formed, taking a hundred thousand Dragon Elephants as the unit, to dissolve Gu Jiuqing's strike would require breaking through the power of a hundred thousand Dragon Elephants.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Kingdom gave Gu Jiuqing the strength to challenge the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>Wah-lah!!</p><p></p><p>Heads of Dragon Elephants condensed on another vertebra.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand, forty thousand - soon the second Dragon Elephant Kingdom also took shape!</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand Dragon Elephants formed a kingdom, densely packed in a black mass. When gathered together, each Dragon Elephant let out a roar, the tremendous sound sweeping over Buzhou Mountain and his flesh body.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to Gu Jiuqing undergoing another transcendence!</p><p></p><p>The two Dragon Elephant Kingdoms made it as if Gu Jiuqing had completed twelve transcendences!!</p><p></p><p>Such an earth-shattering transformation was unprecedented throughout all ages, only achieved by Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Kingdom has nearly a billion cultivators. It should be less than a billion, maybe eight or nine hundred million. Under the influence of the twenty-three provinces and five capital cities, my Dragon Elephant force has already broken through two hundred thousand!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Divine Soul gazed at Buzhou Mountain, where the two hundred and first thousand Dragon Elephants were condensing.  </p><p></p><p>The entire Buzhou Mountain shook, and the vertebrae transformed one by one.</p><p></p><p>The limits of the two thousand-grooved divine weapons had been reached. To continue condensing Dragon Elephants, the two thousand-grooved divine weapons could no longer suppress such a majestic force.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Pearl flickered, this divine bead shimmering with starlight, hanging at the peak of Buzhou Mountain alongside the other two divine weapons, activating nine hundred and ninety-nine celestial grooves!</p><p></p><p>The suppressive force of the divine weapons kept Buzhou Mountain under control, allowing Gu Jiuqing's spine to straighten again.  </p><p></p><p>The two Dragon Elephant Kingdoms coiled on two vertebrae, while the remaining Dragon Elephants crawled on the third vertebra!</p><p></p><p>At the third vertebra, Dragon Elephant figures continuously took shape, quickly reaching thirty thousand in number.</p><p></p><p>"The force of two hundred and thirty thousand Dragon Elephants!!"</p><p></p><p>Outside Buzhou Mountain, the Dragon Elephant Divine Soul spoke in human voice, gazing at the two Dragon Elephant Kingdoms and the thirty thousand Dragon Elephant figures.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Jiuqing smiled with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can freely unleash a strike equal to one of the thousand-grooved divine weapons, opening a thousand Dao grooves in a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>Within his flesh body, all six viscera had already dissipated. </p><p></p><p>The five internal organs were also nearly washed away, forming five vague humanoid figures from the five primordial vital energies - the birthplaces of the five primordial celestial beings!!</p><p></p><p>"Now just my flesh body alone, without using the Dragon Elephant force, should have reached the second stage of the Nine Revolutions Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>The first stage of the Golden Body allowed flight, the second stage allowed diverting rivers. With just his flesh body, he could overturn a river.</p><p></p><p>"In close quarters combat, I can unexpectedly manifest the five primordial vital energies into the five primordial celestial beings to slay enemies!"</p><p></p><p>Those were the five primordial vital energies, surpassing all spiritual powers in grade and able to easily break through others' spiritual powers and techniques!</p><p></p><p>With these two methods, even without using his sword will, divine weapons or Dragon Elephant force, Gu Jiuqing could suppress Buzhou Mountain with a casual wave of his hand and challenge the Spirit Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>The two mid-grade spiritual powers could be ignored, as cultivators at the Spirit Condensation Realm would generally have at least one high-grade spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Drawing Art, thirty types of divine body cultivation, and seven spiritual powers have yet to be absorbed."</p><p></p><p>The divine body cultivations could forge Buzhou Mountain to withstand the sword will and Dragon Elephant force.</p><p></p><p>As for the spiritual powers! Although they grew on the divine wood, they would still exert pressure on Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Low and mid-grade spiritual powers could be ignored, but high-grade and great spiritual powers would indeed exert pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Roaming of the Yin-Yang Divine Body is definitely a supreme-grade spiritual power!"</p><p></p><p>A spiritual power of this level condensed within the body would exert no less pressure than an entire Dragon Elephant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Gu Jiuqing did not first accept the thirty types of divine body cultivation from the Dragon Kingdom's twenty-three provinces.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda in his hand.  </p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda was forged from the flesh body of the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder. To refine it, Gu Jiuqing needed the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder's consent. Only with his agreement could Gu Jiuqing refine it.</p><p></p><p>This matter could not be rushed.</p><p></p><p>"Wah-lah————————"</p><p></p><p>Moonlight rippled around him, a distant breeze stirring up a sea of moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Then a massive wave of moonlight appeared before him, blowing them back hundreds of meters before stabilizing in the air again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother! The Primordial Moon Tree has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing, an enormous divine tree took root on the moon.  </p><p></p><p>This Primordial Moon Tree was tremendously huge, far larger than the one Gu Jiuqing glimpsed during his Carefree Roaming.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had only caught a fleeting glimpse of the moon with his mind's eye, nowhere near as shocking as standing beneath the Primordial Moon Tree now.</p><p></p><p>The true transmission island of the Sword Sect was only one-third the size of the moon ship's divine banner.</p><p></p><p>And the moon ship itself was only as large as one of the twelve horns on the back of the Celestial Beast of Starry Space.</p><p></p><p>While the Celestial Beast of Starry Space itself was only as big as one of the Primordial Moon Tree's thicker branches!!</p><p></p><p>Even if all the mountain ranges and peaks of the Sword Sect's divine mountains were combined, they would only equal the thickness of one of the Primordial Moon Tree's slightly thicker branches!!</p><p></p><p>Could hundreds or even thousands of the Sword Sect's divine mountains compare to the Primordial Moon Tree???</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Primordial Moon Tree took root on the moon, and no one could move it!"</p><p></p><p>Throughout the successive eras of celestial emperors, none of those supreme beings or deities had the power to relocate the Primordial Moon Tree.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they didn't want to, but that they lacked such tremendous might.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed in admiration!</p><p></p><p>The two divine weapons Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao buried on the moon were within the Primordial Moon Tree.</p><p></p><p>He flew towards the moon, and Lu Yuan hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Moon Tree is really too huge! I used to wonder how the First Celestial Lord ascended to the moon using just a branch of the Primordial Moon Tree. Now I understand, a single branch of the Primordial Moon Tree must be comparable to the divine mountains of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>This was Lu Yuan's first time seeing the Primordial Moon Tree as well.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, the Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder had already inspected Lu Yuan's flesh body, spiritual power, spiritual powers, divine soul, sword will, bloodline, and Buzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This disciple's aptitude was far lower than he had imagined.  </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan had only completed seven transcendences, reaching the level of a celestial prodigy. Eight transcendences was a cultivating genius, nine transcendences a human sage!</p><p></p><p>He needed at least a genius who had completed eight transcendences to inherit his legacy.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable Elder sighed, "The branch of the Primordial Moon Tree you mentioned was a remnant from the Primordial Chaos Era!"</p><p></p><p>He knew even more profound secrets!</p><p></p><p>Since he regarded Lu Yuan as his successor to inherit his legacy, he naturally held nothing back in sharing his knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"It was probably during the time when I had just emerged into this world, the Sword Primogenitor, the founding ancestor of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Primogenitor's true name was Jian Taichu.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor, the Buddha, and even the Celestial Lord fought a great battle!  </p><p></p><p>Back then, those four powerhouses had not yet established their great teachings.</p><p></p><p>They clashed in the starry void, the battle raging onto the moon, where they unleashed their full power and severed a branch from the Primordial Moon Tree!</p><p></p><p>That fallen branch descended to the Primordial Chaos, and was later obtained by the First Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>That is the origin of that Primordial Moon Tree branch.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The origin of the branches and twigs.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic invaders, the Sword Primordial was killed violently, and the Lord of Zhou also died violently. Although the second generation leader of your Sword Sect has transcendent powers, he is no match for the Dao Patriarchs and Buddha Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Luyuan's mind was shaken, "Are you saying that my Sword Sect's ancient ancestor was killed by the combined forces of the Dao Patriarchs and Buddha Patriarchs?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch's voice came again from the Mud Egg Palace.</p><p></p><p>"You're not that stupid after all. Otherwise, how could those supreme powers suddenly die violently? How could the demonic invaders suddenly attack the northern lands of the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"You are now a disciple of the Sword Sect. After receiving my inheritance, you will definitely come under the scrutiny of the Dao Patriarchs and Buddha Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch was possessed by demonic energy during the Primordial Chaos era, and it has been thousands of years, but he still hasn't died!</p><p></p><p>And he is only a dual-cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Primordial and the first Lord of Zhou were triple-cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"You'd better find an excuse to leave the Sword Sect soon."</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about facing the Dao Patriarchs and Buddha Patriarchs, the Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch, a pure Yang ancient patriarch from the Primordial Chaos era, was trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Luyuan laughed coldly. Leave the Sword Sect? Impossible. Wherever his martial uncle was, he would be there too.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Once those two act against the Sword Sect, Jiang Xiaoyou will die before you, the second will be your Senior Martial Brother Gu, and the third will be the current leader of the Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, after those three die, it won't be too late for you to leave the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"It's strange, have you noticed that your Senior Martial Brother Gu has suddenly become different again?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch's words made Luyuan pause, and he looked at Gu Jiuqing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Blue robe and azure garment, holding the Yin-Yang Pagoda, with a handsome countenance and an upright bearing.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Senior Martial Brother Gu seemed even more resplendent!</p><p></p><p>"This old man guesses that this stubborn fellow's cultivation has soared again, yeah, it must have soared several times."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch couldn't discern exactly how many times.</p><p></p><p>"Shut your mouth, old thing, don't babble nonsense. Senior Martial Brother Gu is not someone you can pry into."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch was furious!</p><p></p><p>This brat, whenever he mentioned that stubborn fellow, he forgot to respect his elders.</p><p></p><p>Luyuan ignored the Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch and closely followed Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>They were about to reach the Primordial Moon Tree!</p><p></p><p>Behind these two figures, at an unknown distance away.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight trembled, and a blurred figure coalesced.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, his figure solidified into a human form, but he was not human, but a demon!</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from this demon was not demonic energy!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the demonic energy would spread across heaven and earth, and could be sensed dozens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>His aura was very strange, harmonizing with the moonlight. Strands of energy dispersed from his body, intertwining with the moonlight, and disappearing into the world.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon resembled a human, with horns growing from his head, and his body seemed to be formed from clouds and mist, his true form unseen.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Moon Tree? The Sword Sect's Moon Ship for this lunar journey is docked under the Primordial Moon Tree?"</p><p></p><p>"That shouldn't be right. Previously, the Eighth Prince personally searched the Primordial Moon Tree and didn't find the Sword Sect's Moon Ship!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the Sword Sect have some hidden means?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and summon the Eighth Prince first!"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon looked down at the land below, which was the land on the moon.</p><p></p><p>He intertwined his hands, and a wisp of spiritual energy gathered in his palms, shaping into the form of the moon, which he then sent into the moon.</p><p></p><p>Soon, this spiritual energy disappeared along the surface.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon's figure dimmed as he continued to follow behind Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Sect, on an independent mountain peak, there was a huge palace!</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace, there were always Sword Sect disciples standing guard.</p><p></p><p>This was the Sword Sect's forbidden ground!</p><p></p><p>Even the true disciples were not allowed to set foot here.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain peak, a stone stele hundreds of zhang tall radiated light that illuminated the world dozens of miles around.</p><p></p><p>"The Soul Palace!"</p><p></p><p>This was the palace where the Sword Sect stored the soul essences of its disciples!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Soul Palace, there were layers of prohibitions. If it wasn't a Soul Palace disciple entering, even the surrounding prohibitions could kill them.</p><p></p><p>And inside the Soul Palace, the soul lamps arranged there also had a strict hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>The soul lamps of the outer court disciples were placed in the first main hall, which was also the largest, with dozens of Soul Palace disciples guarding it. Most of them were disciples who had completed sect missions and came to guard this place.</p><p></p><p>Entering the first main hall, one would reach the second hall, where the soul lamps of the inner court disciples were placed.</p><p></p><p>There were also not few people guarding the inner court disciples' soul lamps, around twenty or so.</p><p></p><p>Going further in was the third hall!</p><p></p><p>The third hall was where the soul lamps of the true disciples were placed.</p><p></p><p>There were only three Soul Palace disciples guarding it day and night.</p><p></p><p>In each of the soul lamps, there was a blurred spiritual soul, formed from the essence of their blood. Their spiritual souls ignited the heavenly lamps!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy was also infused, fueling their burning and preventing them from extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>These three Soul Palace disciples were not only guarding, but also using their own spiritual energy to constantly replenish the soul lamps with a source of energy.</p><p></p><p>They had been stationed in the Soul Palace for decades and were accustomed to their daily work.</p><p></p><p>One could see their inner spiritual energy flowing, surging into each soul lamp, repeated every three days.</p><p></p><p>It was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!" A soul lamp extinguished.</p><p></p><p>One of the Soul Palace disciples opened his eyes, full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"A true senior martial sister has fallen!"</p><p></p><p>"There was no reaction before her demise!"</p><p></p><p>This meant that the true disciple Qingque was killed in one strike, with no time to resist and no other injuries!</p><p></p><p>"Swish————" The sounds of more soul lamps extinguishing rang out.</p><p></p><p>Another four soul lamps went dark!</p><p></p><p>Five true disciples had almost died at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The three Soul Palace disciples turned pale, inwardly feeling that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>A major incident must have occurred.</p><p></p><p>If one true disciple of the Sword Sect fell, the entire sect would mobilize!</p><p></p><p>But now, the Sword Sect had suddenly lost five true disciples at once.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares kill my Sword Sect's people?"</p><p></p><p>After their faces turned pale, anger rose from their chests.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect dominated the northern lands and was one of the four great sects in the world. To kill their true disciples was a challenge to the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Have they forgotten that my Sword Sect has a hundred thousand sword cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>The three Soul Palace disciples were about to walk out of the third main hall.</p><p></p><p>Then someone hurriedly came out from the depths of the hall.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed disciple had an anxious expression and furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers, did something happen at the Sword Immortal Palace too?"</p><p></p><p>The three Soul Palace disciples also sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed senior brother nodded, "It's Senior Brother Feng from Primordial Peak, one of my Sword Sect's Three Greats, the Sword Immortal Feng, has fallen."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p>A Sword Immortal has fallen??</p><p></p><p>The three Soul Palace disciples were both shocked and enraged.</p><p></p><p>The four of them walked out of the third hall and into the second hall.</p><p></p><p>The second hall was in chaos, with soul lamps extinguishing one after another, inner court disciples falling one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down! What kind of conduct is this?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed disciple shouted, finally restoring order.</p><p></p><p>They had never encountered such a scene before, with dozens or even scores of inner court disciples falling at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Was the sect under attack?</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Feng was escorting the Moon Ship on its lunar journey. Senior Sister Qingque, Senior Sister Jingyan, Senior Brother Changfeng were all Moon Travelers!"</p><p></p><p>"My Sword Sect's disciples have met with trouble on the moon!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed disciple seemed to realize something, revealing a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>"You three, go to the main Soul Palace and request the Palace Master to come out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to go to Nameless Peak!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed disciple was a disciple of the Soul Palace Master and also a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice. The other true disciples of the Soul Palace were all in secluded cultivation, and only he was qualified to enter Nameless Peak.</p><p></p><p>That madman!</p><p></p><p>Who would want to see him?</p><p></p><p>The black-robed disciple flew out of the Soul Palace and arrived at Nameless Peak.</p><p></p><p>On Nameless Peak Mountain, a sword furnace hung high, emanating strands of nameless sword intent, but causing no harm to the black-robed true disciple.</p><p></p><p>He walked to the only palace on Nameless Peak and mustered his courage, bowing towards the palace.</p><p></p><p>"From the Soul Palace lineage, Cang Jiuliu comes to pay respects to Senior Martial Brother Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>This Sword Immortal lowered his head in a bow!</p><p></p><p>A leisurely voice came from inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>"You're mistaken, I'm not surnamed Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>Cang Jiuliu hurriedly corrected himself, "From the Soul Palace lineage, Cang Jiuliu comes to pay respects to Senior Martial Brother Liangliao!"</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and Liangliao, dressed in white, walked out.</p><p></p><p>On his face, the divine eyes had not yet closed, and he walked out of the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>The divine eyes flickered and closed one by one, leaving only the two eyes of the Eight Trigrams Ancient Patriarch still open.</p><p></p><p>Cang Jiuliu's heart sank, not daring to look further. He was about to speak when Liangliao waved his hand, forcing the words back into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"No need for further words, I already know what happened on the moon."</p><p></p><p>"For this matter, I still lack the necessary strength."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lacking strength?</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>As the senior martial brother of the Soul Palace and a Sword Immortal himself, Cang Jiuliu knew of Liangliao's past.</p><p></p><p>He said his strength was insufficient?</p><p></p><p>How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>Under Cang Jiuliu's astonished gaze, Liangliao bowed towards the distant sword furnace.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple Liangliao requests an audience with the Master!"</p><p></p><p>But the sword furnace showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Master, if you don't come out, this disciple will have to leave the mountain and enter the Great Wilderness, enter the Great Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>This time, the sword furnace finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>The Nameless Peak lineage, that peak master from the same era as the Sword Sect's ancient ancestor, the supreme elder Immortal Trace, was finally coming out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!

            <p>以下是我对这段中文小说片段的完整翻译:</p><p></p><p>会议室里,武者们的气息喷涌而出。在场的每一位商会精英都是武者,他们气血旺盛,泄漏出来的气息相互纠缠在一起,导致会议室的温度升高了许多。</p><p></p><p>在场的任何一个人,只需跺一脚,都足以让临江发生地震。</p><p></p><p>而这位临江高中的校长,他的实力也不容小觑,能够坐稳高武时期一所高校的校长职位,光是他的修为就达到了炼筋层次,是一位大宗师!</p><p></p><p>"校长,你先请坐,关于临江祖城计划我还没说完。"</p><p></p><p>杨沾天继续说道。</p><p></p><p>"接下来临江需要你们出力,不管是科技公司还是金融公司,全部停止营业。临江的基础设施照常运转,但你们需要扩大营养液的生产。"</p><p></p><p>"我希望在接下来的三个月内,将临江市营养液的产量提高五十倍以上!"</p><p></p><p>五十倍以上?</p><p></p><p>这个数字太夸张了。</p><p></p><p>但如果整个临江全力以赴,用来扩张营养液生产线,似乎也并非不可能。</p><p></p><p>"制作营养液的材料你们不用担心,临江市外有武道大军镇守,每天都会送来妖兽,而你们要做的就是全力生产营养液。"</p><p></p><p>"D级营养液定价三千,这太贵了,我希望这一批营养液能便宜十倍!一支D级营养液三百元,一支C级营养液一千元。"</p><p></p><p>"当然了,我知道在场的诸位老板大佬,手底下都有几条能生产B级营养液的生产线,B级营养液你们卖多少,我不管,但C级和D级一定要确保供给群众使用。"</p><p></p><p>"三个月的时间,我要让临江百姓的气血值提升一点!!"</p><p></p><p>气血值提升一点??</p><p></p><p>这是要将八十万民众提升成武者啊,八十万武者?</p><p></p><p>整个临江也只有三万武者啊。</p><p></p><p>江南省的省会江南市有一千万人口,但武者也没有八十万啊。</p><p></p><p>"这是第一点,第二点,龙象功二十式你们找个机会,传入公司,先从公司开始,通过公司员工,让公司员工的家庭也知道龙象功,从而让龙象功普及整个临江市,让八十万临江老百姓都能修炼龙象功。"</p><p></p><p>"第三点,高考那一天,临江举行第四届武道大比,奖金从原来的五十万提升到五千万!"</p><p></p><p>华云也捧着文件,体内的气血震动。</p><p></p><p>这就是打造临江祖城计划,全名皆兵,八十万武者坐镇临江,华云也都不敢想象未来的临江将会是何等璀璨的画面。</p><p></p><p>"等临江成为真正的祖城后,帝都都无法与临江相比,外国那些武道神城,更是无法和临江相提并论。"</p><p></p><p>"而我们在场的临江公司和家族将成为祖城内的第一批古老世家,沾染上的荣光无法想象。"</p><p></p><p>"我希望大家能把握好这一次机会。"</p><p></p><p>"三个月,只需要三个月,换来一场泼天的富贵!"</p><p></p><p>杨沾天看着会议室内激动的商会人员,他的内心也异常激动。</p><p></p><p>二十二式龙象功太恐怖了,他知晓自家女儿的天资平平,不然他早就在暗中培养杨妙静成为武者,以武入道,还做什么商会的会主?</p><p></p><p>若是能修炼成换血武圣,入住帝都,八大世家都要拱手称臣!</p><p></p><p>提前全国三个月修炼龙象功,将临江打造成唯一祖城,这就是三大集团公司老总、临江市长、武道协会会长、临江高中校长、临江安全部部长他们合力通过的草案。</p><p></p><p>这是一场泼天的富贵,有五成可能!</p><p></p><p>就算失败,那也无妨,他们早已经想好了后退之路。</p><p></p><p>会议散去,一众大佬乘坐豪车离开商会大厦,又有几位高层还在会议室内,继续商议临江祖城计划。</p><p></p><p>卧室。</p><p></p><p>顾九清放下手机,他向学校请假了,将上午的课移到下午。</p><p></p><p>高武蓝星礼拜一,也是大考九日的第七日!</p><p></p><p>第五日、第六日、第七日,三天时间,顾九清都在剑门关下修炼拔剑术。以他三次蜕凡的境界,三日不眠不休也能做到。</p><p></p><p>"呵呵,看来我的剑道天赋有些差啊。"</p><p></p><p>三日苦修拔剑术,每一日拔剑三百次,足足拔剑出剑一千次,还是无法感悟出一丝剑道真意,连剑势都未曾修炼出来,更别说是剑意。</p><p></p><p>"如此只能看高三二班的学生了。"</p><p></p><p>顾九清从床上起来,正要收拾一番,突然他看到床头柜上还在运行的监控摄像头。</p><p></p><p>"差点忘记此事了。"</p><p></p><p>为了验证两界穿梭的关系,顾九清专门在床头柜安装摄像头。</p><p></p><p>顾九清调出监控摄像头。</p><p></p><p>"嗯?空白?"</p><p></p><p>"床上空无一物?"</p><p></p><p>监控摄像拍摄的画面,床上空无一物,根本就没有顾九清的身体。</p><p></p><p>突然下一刻,床上的虚空涟漪,一道身影就这么突兀的出现在床上,随后顾九清就拿起一旁的手机。</p><p></p><p>这是他出现在高武蓝星的画面。</p><p></p><p>顾九清调到最开始的监控,那是他躺下睡觉的时候。</p><p></p><p>等顾九清躺在床上入睡后,床上的身体化成一片光芒,消失的无影无踪。</p><p></p><p>这几天,顾九清消失在高武蓝星。</p><p></p><p>顾九清眼神闪烁,"虽然我不知道为何会这样,但我在高武蓝星入睡的时候,我的身躯消散,那岂不是近乎无敌了?"</p><p></p><p>只要遇到危险,直接入睡,消失在原地!</p><p></p><p>不过下一次进入高武蓝星,也会在原地出现。</p><p></p><p>这可以成为顾九清在高武蓝星的一道底牌。</p><p></p><p>"就是不知道在大荒是不是一样。"</p><p></p><p>顾九清思索片刻,重新将监控放在床头柜上,而他来到了卧室。</p><p></p><p>卧室很简洁,几乎没有什么家具,顾九清成为顾自修后,也没有添加任何家具,他看了看时间。</p><p></p><p>下午1:30</p><p></p><p>"该去学校了!"</p><p></p><p>这一次,他要看一看,高三二班的学生中,会不会出现剑道奇才!</p><p></p><p>学校,高三二班教室。</p><p></p><p>高三二班的学生早已经在教室内等候多时了。 </p><p></p><p>上个周末!</p><p></p><p>绝对是他们难以忘却的周末。</p><p></p><p>他们只在电视上看到过的临江名人,竟然一一来拜访他们。</p><p></p><p>有武道协会的会长,也有学校的校长,就连市长都亲自出面了。</p><p></p><p>他们何时见过如此大的阵势?</p><p></p><p>缓了一个晚上,还没恢复过来。</p><p></p><p>而这些大佬来找他们,目的是让他们好好上课!</p><p></p><p>准确来说,是好好的上顾老师的课。</p><p></p><p>这还用他们说吗?</p><p></p><p>顾老师的课,谁不会认真听讲?</p><p></p><p>除此之外,高三二班所有学生,都得到了一份来自临江商会的助学金,一份夸张到极致的助学金。</p><p></p><p>每个月十万!!一年一百二十万!不包括物质!这只是单纯的现金资助。</p><p></p><p>准武者,每日一支D级营养液。</p><p></p><p>武者,每日一支C级营养液。</p><p></p><p>临江武道会馆内的所有设施,都对他们免费开放。</p><p></p><p>一整套用黑金打造出来的战衣,价值三百万以上,附加T20合金大刀,光是这一口战刀就要五十万!!</p><p></p><p>黑金是打造战衣的最佳材料,是灵气复苏后出现的材料。</p><p></p><p>T20也是灵气复苏后的材料,用来锻造武器,具有超高的坚韧性,不易损坏,能削铁如泥。</p><p></p><p>武者身穿黑金战衣,手持T20合金战刀,能搏杀炼骨宗师!</p><p></p><p>这就是战衣和战刀的魅力。</p><p></p><p>于是,他们将上课拍下来的照片交给了商会。</p><p></p><p>用顾老师讲的龙象功,换来这一身造化!</p><p></p><p>他们有些羞愧,但这等造化,他们无法割舍啊。</p><p></p><p>"等顾老师来了,就将此事告诉顾老师。"</p><p></p><p>虽然在周五的时候,顾老师让他们拍照龙象功,而他们私自将功法传给别人,这是重罪!</p><p></p><p>但那个时候,他们没有第二条路可以选择。</p><p></p><p>"叮铃铃——————"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The bell rang for class to start. Shortly after, the classroom door was pushed open and a young, handsome figure stepped into senior class two. </p><p></p><p>"Stand up, good morning teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Good morning students." </p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling was the class monitor. Today, Yang Miaoling seemed a bit different, which Gu Jiuqing immediately noticed. </p><p></p><p>Some other students also seemed a bit unusual. </p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing didn't care.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the podium, looked at the students in the classroom, scanned them, and then said:</p><p></p><p>"How is your practice of the Dragon Elephant Skill going?"</p><p></p><p>"How many of you have cultivated into warriors? Stand up and let me see."</p><p></p><p>Soon, seven or eight figures stood up.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling!</p><p>Ning Que! </p><p>Fang Linli!</p><p>Ke Jing!</p><p>Wen Daihua!</p><p>Lu Qing!</p><p>Lan Bai!</p><p></p><p>A total of seven figures. These seven people had cultivated into warriors through the Dragon Elephant Skill, while the rest of the students' inner energy was just a bit away from becoming warriors.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you all have practiced well. So today, I will impart a new skill to you."</p><p></p><p>A new skill?</p><p>Teacher Gu was going to transmit a method again?</p><p>The 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill had just been transmitted, and now he wanted them to cultivate a new martial arts manual?</p><p></p><p>The 45 students looked at Gu Jiuqing in shock.</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation is divided into techniques and the Way."</p><p></p><p>"Techniques refer to spells, also called Dao techniques - methods of self-protection. To seek the Great Way, you need to protect your entire body. The Dragon Elephant Skill tempers the body, opening the path of martial arts for you. But the path of martial arts is arduous. If you encounter a great calamity, you'll need self-protection methods."</p><p></p><p>"So today I will transmit to you the art of swordsmanship."</p><p></p><p>Swordsmanship??</p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts world of Planet Blue, physical power reigned supreme. As long as one's physical body was powerful, that was strength. No supernatural abilities or spells had emerged.</p><p></p><p>Swordsmanship was even more unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wrote three large characters on the blackboard:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the simplest sword art, with only two moves - drawing the sword and presenting the sword. From now on, you need to practice the Sword Drawing Art 300 times per day. If you have average talent, it will take ten years to achieve small success."</p><p></p><p>Ten years to achieve small success in the Sword Drawing Art?</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling felt a bit of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and another three years of high school - that's twelve years in total.</p><p></p><p>If she had started practicing the Sword Drawing Art from elementary school, she would have achieved small success in it by now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing began drawing diagrams. The Sword Drawing Art only had two moves, but drawing each one was somewhat more difficult than any of the 22 moves of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Jiuqing's painting skills were superb. In less than an hour, he had drawn out the two sword moves.</p><p></p><p>He also wrote the oral instructions for the Sword Drawing Art on the blackboard.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, first take pictures of the oral instructions and diagrams for the two sword moves of the Sword Drawing Art. This will be your method of protecting your practice of the Way. You should cultivate it day and night. It's best to find a decent sword, so you can eventually condense it into a flying sword projectile."</p><p></p><p>Taking pictures to record was an established practice!</p><p></p><p>The students of senior class two were well prepared. They carefully took over ten photos each of the two diagrams and oral instructions for the Sword Drawing Art before stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, what is a 'flying sword projectile'?" A student couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing immediately recognized this student from a glance.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua.</p><p>A newly cultivated warrior.</p><p>Fair skin, an egg-shaped face, looking like a beauty from a painting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's gaze fall on her, Wen Daihua's fair face turned red.</p><p></p><p>Was Wen Daihua so curious about the way of the flying sword? Could it be that she had an affinity for the sword path?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled gently, "A flying sword projectile, also called a sword pellet, refers to refining an ordinary sword into a pellet through cultivation. This requires a skill close to the divine realm. By comprehending the sword's intent and condensing sword force, you can make tempered steel as flexible as a willow branch coiling around your finger. Condensing the sword into a pellet, forming a flying sword - that allows you to glimpse a portion of the sword's intent!"</p><p></p><p>This was the sword path of the sword sect - exhaling sword qi, unleashing a waterfall of sword energy to slay enemies. This was the technique of sword cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In order to become a true inheritor, Gu Jiuqing had consulted the four young masters of the great clans about the true meanings of the sword path.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I have another question."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing continued smiling at Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, if I solely cultivate the sword path, can I reach the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>When Wen Daihua said this, Gu Jiuqing's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Solely cultivating the sword path?</p><p></p><p>He had never considered this question before.</p><p></p><p>He actually didn't understand the sword path much better than the students of senior class two.</p><p></p><p>But he needed to answer this question, and answer it resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"There are three thousand paths of the Dao, each capable of proving the Way. If the sword path can reach the divine realm, then naturally it can also prove the Way!"</p><p></p><p>Although no sword cultivator had ever proved the Way in the Archaic Wilderness, who could say that Planet Blue wouldn't produce one?</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua looked pensive as she returned to her seat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze swept across the room. Seeing the students had no other questions, he was about to end the class, but the class monitor stood up.</p><p></p><p>As Yang Miaoling stood, the other students turned to look at her, revealing complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Class monitor Yang? Do you have a question?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at this student with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were the source of his cultivation. Gu Jiuqing naturally maintained a smiling expression.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, we have transmitted the Dragon Elephant Skill to others."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling finally said it out loud.</p><p></p><p>You can't hide fire with paper - this matter would inevitably be known to Teacher Gu later on.</p><p></p><p>The other students looked at Yang Miaoling with worry, afraid Teacher Gu would get angry.</p><p></p><p>Transmitted it to others?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing laughed heartily, "No problem, no problem. Since I have already transmitted the skill to you, it has become your skill. Whatever you want to do with it is up to you."</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation of martial arts, one learns by doing. If one only cultivates alone, how can one verify one's learning?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke with feeling.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient city of Tianyuan, he had discussed the arts of zither, chess, calligraphy and painting with literati and scholars, wishing they could agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>For example, in painting, he used points to convey momentum, while some painters used lines. If they could agree on using points for momentum, wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p></p><p>One path, mutually verified by both sides - didn't the four supreme patriarchs of the Archaic Wilderness verify each other's learning through mutual challenge, striving to reach the divine realm?</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, so you agree that we can transmit the martial arts you taught us to others?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Teacher Gu's thinking was different from theirs.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. If you can transmit the Dragon Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Art to everyone under Heaven, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with spreading the teachings across the world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled and left the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Spread the teachings across the world!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shuddered. In this world, it didn't seem too difficult to spread teachings across the world.</p><p></p><p>He just had to publicly release the Dragon Elephant Skill and Sword Drawing Art online. Then everyone globally would cultivate them - everyone would be contributing to Gu Jiuqing's cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing leave, the students hurriedly sent the photos they took to the Linji Trade Firm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling even changed the name of the Sword Drawing Art.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art!"</p><p></p><p>The name "Sword Drawing Art" was too ordinary. The "Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art" would better befit the name of the skill Teacher Gu transmitted.</p><p></p><p>[Grandpa, I want a T20 battle sword to cultivate the Heaven Severing Sword Drawing Art.]</p><p></p><p>[Approved, approved. Grandpa will notify the factory right away to forge 45 T20 battle swords.]</p><p></p><p>In the classroom, Wen Daihua took out her phone and sent the photos she took to the Linji Trade Firm.</p><p></p><p>The 45 students each had a dedicated handler, and these handlers all came from the Linji Trade Firm.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua's handler was from Huaren Technology.</p><p></p><p>[I want to forge swords and cultivate the Sword Drawing Art. Please prepare a gravity room for me! An ordinary sword for wearing will suffice.]</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua didn't know what was going on, but she felt that the sword path was her destiny.</p><p></p><p>Flying sword projectiles, the path of sword pellet cultivation.</p><p></p><p>She had even imagined herself riding the winds on a sword, flying to the moon.</p><p></p><p>This scene!</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before it became reality!</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the great lord Changyo for a 10,000 contribution!</p><p></p><p>Crying tears of gratitude!</p><p></p><p>The new book was recommended, but the effect was terrible in terms of favorites - no one favorited it. Is it a problem with the book title?</p><p></p><p>I'm thinking of learning from the veteran authors on Qidian and changing to a catchier title, but I'm hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"The God on Planet Blue"?</p><p></p><p>Ahem, requesting some recommendation votes, monthly votes, and contributions - even 100 would help make the data look better!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

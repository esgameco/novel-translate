            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The moon, the primordial moon tree.</p><p></p><p>This primordial moon tree was immensely huge. Standing under the divine tree, Gu Jiuqing's previously soaring power and sense of invincibility were quickly shattered. </p><p></p><p>When things reached the extreme limit, it was also a realm in itself.</p><p></p><p>The primordial moon tree took root on the moon without any restraint. No one knew from which era this moon tree had existed.</p><p></p><p>Even in the ancient books recording old legends, there were only fragmentary mentions of the primordial moon tree.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got to the primordial moon tree, the more concentrated the spiritual power flowing out from the three-zhang deep spiritual embryo became.</p><p></p><p>His nine-zhang spiritual embryo was once again filled to the brim with spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>The surging spiritual power intertwined into a Yuan Dan the size of a palm. As soon as it condensed, it flew up to Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing controlled the dragons and elephants to converge into a divine form. He dared not use the two from within his domains, instead gathering 30,000 dragon and elephant heads into a primordial dragon-elephant divinity!</p><p></p><p>The dragon-elephant divinity swung its four massive elephant legs to strike the Yuan Dan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With just one strike, the Yuan Dan exploded into rice grain-sized pieces.</p><p></p><p>Another booming sound followed.</p><p></p><p>The Yuan Dan grains were now only hair-thick in size. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly stopped tempering his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>His foundation was profound, but it was too difficult to break through using just the spiritual power flowing from the Wondrous Gate.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Lu Yuan also heard the striking sounds coming from Gu Jiuqing's body, but paid no heed. Instead, he pointed towards the distance!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Divine Eye silently activated!</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Eight Trigrams Venerable had imparted all his supreme arts to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a divine eye ability called the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>The eight trigrams: Heaven, Earth, Water, Fire, Thunder, Mountain, Wind, and Marsh. The thunder of heaven triggers the fire of earth; the mountain wind meets the water marsh!</p><p></p><p>His left eye opened Thunder and Fire, his right eye opened Wind and Water. The two pupils spun, interweaving landscapes of rivers and mountains.</p><p></p><p>To use this divine eye required drawing hundreds of talismans, all of which the Eight Trigrams Venerable had helped Lu Yuan trace.</p><p></p><p>Only then could he utilize the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>Under Lu Yuan's Eight Trigrams Divine Eye, the patterns on the primordial moon tree became clearly visible, even the Dao rhymes could be discerned!</p><p></p><p>In a breath's time, Lu Yuan's spiritual power was depleted, and he dared not activate it again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there are cultivators under the moon tree! Under that patch of the moon tree, there are four cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"They are refining moonlight essence, the emanating spiritual power contains starlight - they should be disciples of the Celestial Stars Sect."</p><p></p><p>Disciples of the Celestial Stars Sect?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Jiuqing looked towards the direction Lu Yuan pointed.</p><p></p><p>He could not see any human figures.</p><p></p><p>But based on the scene under the primordial moon tree and the hanging moonlight essence, he could deduce that the divine weapon buried by Senior Brother Liang Xiao must be at the cultivation ground of the Celestial Stars disciples.</p><p></p><p>If he rashly disturbed their cultivation, it would not bode well if conflicts arose.</p><p></p><p>"Stay quiet later."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instructed Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>"I will listen to Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>This brat Lu Yuan, he had seen him before.</p><p></p><p>When encountering outsiders, he would flaunt and make a big scene.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet obtained the divine weapon, so he needed to keep a low profile!</p><p></p><p>Under the primordial moon tree!</p><p></p><p>A patch of brilliance formed the image of a celestial body.</p><p></p><p>This celestial body resembled the moon, with a consistent surface, even the moon tree on the surface existed.</p><p></p><p>Celestial ripples hung over the heads of the four Celestial Stars disciples.</p><p></p><p>Chains extended from within their bodies, piercing into the leaves of the moon tree.</p><p></p><p>The four shared four leaves of the primordial moon tree, continuously absorbing the flowing moonlight essence.</p><p></p><p>The one in the lead had a profound aura. He traced talisman after talisman, tracing the final pattern on the last talisman. He then converged all the talismans before him into a single seed of divine ability!</p><p></p><p>The divine ability seed blossomed, transforming into a formidable divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The moon disc spun, hanging like an inverted celestial blade.</p><p></p><p>This was a great divine ability of the Celestial Stars Sect. Only true disciples could cultivate it, but not all true disciples qualified - special conditions were required!</p><p></p><p>For the sake of cultivating this divine ability, Jun Wushang had entered the Primordial Wilderness, slaying hundreds of demonic beasts. He then spent decades coexisting with celestial beasts, finally accumulating enough contribution points to exchange for the Moon Disc Divine Ability!</p><p></p><p>The other three Celestial Stars disciples looked at Jun Wushang's Moon Disc with envy upon seeing it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Moon Disc, a great divine ability. Condensing a great divine ability grants invincibility in the same realm!"</p><p></p><p>A great divine ability far surpassed even top-grade divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>The Wind Senior Brother was a true disciple of the Sword Sect, even a Sword Immortal, but he had not cultivated a great divine ability.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the essence of Buzhou Mountain, Jun Wushang's divine ability seed directly hung on the Ancestral Wood.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability seed absorbed the primordial essence, slowly growing.</p><p></p><p>For the divine ability seed to become the divine ability fruit, it needed to blossom and bear fruit - a metaphorical description.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard Senior Brother has already opened 365 celestial apertures. Once this great divine ability is fully formed, he may be able to battle true immortals of the Celestial Palace realm!"</p><p></p><p>One Celestial Stars disciple exclaimed loudly.</p><p></p><p>The other two gasped in admiration upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"A great divine ability is a transcendent divine ability, but breaking through the realm barrier is still very difficult."</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang did not exaggerate or downplay himself.</p><p></p><p>"My current divine ability is similar to Senior Brothers Tian Yue and Bo Qingshan, and our cultivations are also comparable. The three of us have battled Celestial Palace cultivators within our sect."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head. "True immortals of the Celestial Palace ascend to the Immortal Terrace, open the Mud Pill Palace, send their nine-cycled spirit pills into the Mud Pill Palace to fuse with their divine souls, completing their metamorphosis and rebirthing their primordial spirits!"</p><p></p><p>"This can only be considered half-step Celestial Palace."</p><p></p><p>The three listened intently, learning the cultivation steps of the Celestial Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating the primordial spirit, one needs to construct celestial palaces. The newly reborn primordial spirit constructs the celestial palaces, ushering in a period of primordial spirit weakness. One celestial palace, one period of weakness; ten celestial palaces, ten periods."</p><p></p><p>"The primordial spirit residing in the first celestial palace constructs the second. The third is constructed by the spirits from the first and second palaces together."  </p><p></p><p>"And so on, the spirits from all previous palaces construct the next one together."</p><p></p><p>"The primordial spirits within the celestial palaces cultivate, transforming into three souls and seven corporeal souls, corresponding to the ten great celestial palaces. When the three souls and seven corporeal souls from the ten palaces fully merge, only then can that primordial spirit hope to transcend tribulations!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang explained meticulously as his three junior brothers listened with great insight.</p><p></p><p>"Once I cultivate this Moon Disc great divine ability for seven or eight years with my current cultivation, I can battle half-step Celestial Palace true immortals!"</p><p></p><p>"If I fully form the Moon Disc, I may be able to exchange a move with Celestial Palace true immortals without great divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Only one move, before being defeated.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang sighed. "Which is why sword cultivators can become peerless in their realm. Every sword cultivator is akin to cultivating a great divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>His three junior brothers wanted to ask more, but Jun Wushang looked towards the sky outside the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Silence, someone is coming!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as his words fell, two figures approached from afar, standing under the moon formation.</p><p></p><p>One in azure robes holding a precious pagoda, without divine radiance emanating.  </p><p></p><p>The one behind him carried a sword case, sword light flickering around his extraordinary figure.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this is the moon formation, formed from hundreds of moon seals. It took us three days to set up this moon formation."  </p><p></p><p>"These two may not show their cultivations, but they seem to be Buzhou cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Two Buzhou cultivators?</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they looked down on Buzhou cultivators, but the three of them were Refining Spirit realm!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The three juniors moved, but the azure-robed youth cupped his fists in salute to them.</p><p></p><p>"A true sword cultivator of the Courtyard Peak lineage, Gu Jiuqing, greets the four Senior Brothers of the Celestial Stars Sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was courteous, bowing fully before rising.</p><p></p><p>The moon formation dissipated!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang stood up and praised, "Such a jade-like youth, the Sword Sect is fortunate to have produced a sword cultivator like Junior Brother Gu."</p><p></p><p>As a senior disciple, seeing Gu Jiuqing's manners, he naturally would not look at them coldly.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang also introduced himself, "Celestial Stars Sect's Moon Peak, Jun Wushang, greets the two Junior Sword Brothers."</p><p></p><p>The three Celestial Stars disciples behind him reluctantly stood and greeted as well.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the two Junior Sword Brothers!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Stars and Sword Sects had been on good terms, their disciples addressing each other as senior and junior brothers for over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>This was his first time meeting someone besides Senior Brother Liang Xiao and Si Wuxie who carried such graceful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Senior Brother was only halfway there, lacking some scholarly elegance.</p><p></p><p>But Jun Wushang was different, possessing great family bearing and the air of a sect master.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Jiuqing did not dally either. "I have disturbed Senior Brother Jun."</p><p></p><p>"This junior has a matter to trouble Senior Brother with!"</p><p></p><p>"Just speak directly."</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang calmly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Has Senior Brother found two thousand-pattern divine weapons in this area?"</p><p></p><p>Using the method taught by Senior Brother Liang Xiao, Gu Jiuqing tried to locate the two divine weapons, but even after the moon formation dispersed, he could not detect them.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the two divine weapons had already been taken by someone else.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang frowned, not questioning Gu Jiuqing, but instead asking his three junior brothers.</p><p></p><p>"You three juniors, when setting up the formation, did you find any thousand-pattern divine weapons here?"</p><p></p><p>The three juniors were stunned, then laughed.</p><p></p><p>What an idiotic question to ask Jun Wushang.</p><p></p><p>Even if they found thousand-pattern divine weapons here, why would they tell others?</p><p></p><p>Those were thousand-pattern divine weapons, exclusive armaments of the Celestial Palace realm!</p><p></p><p>They were only Refining Spirit cultivators, without a single thousand-pattern divine weapon. Their senior brother had one, but could not activate it either.</p><p></p><p>"We have not seen any."</p><p></p><p>Receiving this answer, Jun Wushang apologized regretfully, "Junior Brother Gu, it seems the two thousand-pattern divine weapons you mentioned have been taken by others."</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt Gu Jiuqing was lying.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he expressed apologies - such scholarly grace was no less than the great cultivated disciples Gu Jiuqing had met before.</p><p></p><p>"It should be so!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not take another step forward. His two divine weapons seemed to have been taken by others.</p><p></p><p>But who could it be?</p><p></p><p>Behind Gu Jiuqing, Lu Yuan grew anxious.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother!</p><p></p><p>Just because they said they didn't have it, does it mean they really don't? </p><p></p><p>Why not check their spirit bridges, spiritual embryos, Buzhou Mountains - maybe they hid the divine weapons inside?</p><p></p><p>The voice in the Mud Pill Palace agreed with Lu Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, you must do this in the future when traveling the world."</p><p></p><p>"Good things are never held out in the open!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This stubborn one was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing cradled the Yen Fou Pagoda, looking at this innate laurel, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Jun, this junior brother has other matters to attend to. If there is time in the future, I will definitely ascend to the Star Palace Moon Peak to have an in-depth discussion with Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Allow me to take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was slightly startled, but did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing turned to leave the innate laurel tree. </p><p></p><p>But he was still a step too slow.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight scattered!</p><p></p><p>Like petals, piece by piece enveloping the heavens and earth here.</p><p></p><p>The petals were bright and pristine, like mutton tallow. Piece by piece they fell to the ground, and a huge moon was somehow formed underfoot, covering an area of three to four li.</p><p></p><p>Completely enveloping Gu Jiuqing, Jun Wushang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stopped in his tracks!</p><p></p><p>Now it was impossible to leave.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was such an elegant person, he wanted to befriend him. But he had demons following behind him, so he dared not bring danger to them.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The demons had already arrived!</p><p></p><p>The illusory moon on the ground took shape, slowly turning into a black full moon.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic aura!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang shouted loudly, "Three junior brothers, quickly prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>And he himself instantly opened all his heavenly orifices!</p><p></p><p>Unlike those who liked to hide their strength, he preferred to always be in peak condition.</p><p></p><p>Once in danger, he would exhaust all his power, leaving no reserves.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the large orifices opened, three hundred and sixty-five heavenly orifices flickering. The spiritual power contained within the orifices was outlined, three hundred and sixty-five orifices meant three hundred and sixty-five dan tians!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual powers connected into a river of stars, hanging upside down behind him.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang held an exquisite pagoda in his hand, with lines of inscriptions rippling on its surface, gradually unleashing the mighty power of this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>His nine revolutions spirit pill breathed, spiritual power gushing like a waterfall. His hair danced wildly, his clothes fluttering noisily.</p><p></p><p>What an elegant cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Heh, we haven't even met face to face, yet you, a Refining Spirit cultivator, are acting as if a great enemy has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"Your skills make me think of an old acquaintance."</p><p></p><p>A prince?</p><p></p><p>A demonic prince!!</p><p></p><p>A demonic prince had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The three junior brothers turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign had ten scions, each having lived for thousands of years. The eldest prince had even crossed the tribulation to become a Celestial. The other princes were slightly weaker, but were still at the Celestial realm!</p><p></p><p>They had encountered the Demon Clan many times when entering the Wilderness, and knew quite a few of their secrets.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, demonic shadows swirled, demonic qi blanketing the sky and dispersing the moonlight!</p><p></p><p>As the demon descended, the demonic qi formed clouds that gathered above the demon prince's head.</p><p></p><p>Behind the demon prince were several other demons!</p><p></p><p>These demons had massive bodies, some with six eyes, some with eight arms, and others with four wings - all powerful fiends.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Gu Jiuqing had seen the demon prince, the first being in Senior Brother Liang Xiao's cave abode.</p><p></p><p>That seventh demon prince was sliced into pieces by Liang Xiao, and his demonic blood was melted into a drop of the Demon Sovereign's true blood, which Liang Xiao threw into the Ling River.</p><p></p><p>This demon prince took on a human form, with a jade-like face and graceful bearing, appearing as a handsome youth who would be considered a peerless genius even among humans.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, I remember now. There is an immortal in the Star Palace who is just like you."</p><p></p><p>"That is my master!" Jun Wushang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"So he is your master. Tsk tsk, that old bag of bones is as tough as they come, causing us quite some losses."</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, that stubborn old fool is single-minded. I merely said that Jun Wushang was trapped under the innate laurel tree, and that old man went crazy, insisting on coming to the innate laurel tree."</p><p></p><p>Tsk tsk!</p><p></p><p>The peak lord of Moon Peak was killed?</p><p></p><p>The three junior brothers turned even paler.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, trying to disturb my mind? If your demon had the ability to suppress my master, who opened the eight-fold Celestial realm, would you resort to such honeyed words?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang remained calm, the spiritual ripples above his head growing brighter, the celestial orifices around his body shining even more brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>The demon prince took out a broken divine weapon. "Surely you recognize this?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's gaze focused, and a wave of sorrow welled up from his heart!</p><p></p><p>That was his master's thousand-grooved divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>Even the thousand-grooved weapon was shattered?</p><p></p><p>No, no!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's expression changed, then returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>"My Star Palace summoned the celestial beasts to enter the moon. Did your great one also enter the moon?"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince was taken aback. "No!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign would never take action himself!</p><p></p><p>"No? Then with my master stationed on the celestial beasts, how could your great one dare face them?"</p><p></p><p>The celestial beasts!</p><p></p><p>Those were colossal existences!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had seen the celestial beasts before. If such massive beings went berserk, who would dare approach?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Jun remains unperturbed in danger and keeps his wits about him!"</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he would have lost his composure long ago!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha————"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince laughed. "Well played, Jun Wushang. I had intended to provoke you into anger to test your depth, but there's no need for that now."</p><p></p><p>The black moon swelled rapidly, enveloping the mountains and rivers within ten li.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan were completely ignored by the demon prince.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, the demon prince had not even spared them a single glance.</p><p></p><p>"The disciples of your Star Palace claim to have the greatest spiritual powers, but the abilities of these junior brothers are quite ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a path to live. If your spiritual power can surpass mine, I'll spare your life."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the demon prince's hand, the three Refining Spirit cultivators behind Jun Wushang immediately collapsed on the blood-red moon beneath their feet.</p><p></p><p>Their essence blood scattered, the blood-moon rippling.</p><p></p><p>The demonic aura invaded their bodies, destroying their life force. With such a lethal technique, even the best spirit pills would be powerless to save them.</p><p></p><p>The silhouette of a moon demon appeared above the corpses!</p><p></p><p>"Make your move, Jun Wushang. You and I shall battle with our spiritual powers, and you'll have a chance to live!"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>He had tested the abilities of too many humans on the moon. His methods, his divine abilities had far surpassed those of these humans long ago.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was the true inheritor of one of the four great human sects, nearing the Celestial realm. The demon prince had heard of Jun Wushang's reputation.</p><p></p><p>So he went to great lengths to lure Jun Wushang here, to battle him at the peak of his power!</p><p></p><p>Yes, a battle of spiritual powers. He feared he might accidentally kill Jun Wushang using other means.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, why don't we fight on equal footing?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's three hundred and sixty-five celestial orifices instantly closed, the spiritual ripples above his head disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Let us battle with just our spirit pills, which will better test our abilities."</p><p></p><p>Marvelous!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Jun is truly marvelous.</p><p></p><p>The demon prince's realm was one level higher than Jun Wushang's, and their spiritual powers were worlds apart. How could they battle directly?</p><p></p><p>But by fighting on the same realm, and moreover using just their nine revolutions spirit pills, it would come down to whose spirit pill was more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The profound depths of the Celestial realm would be set aside!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, watching from the side, became interested but remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, a spirit pill battle it is, as you wish!"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince's aura changed, transforming him into a cultivator of the Spiritual Power realm.</p><p></p><p>The celestial realms of the Mud Pill Palace closed one by one, the Buzhou Mountain disappeared into his body, and the celestial orifices dimmed, leaving only his dantian shining with spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang did the same!</p><p></p><p>The two cultivators instantly made their moves!</p><p></p><p>Refining their nine revolutions spirit pills, their spiritual powers surged. The demon prince's nine revolutions spirit pill was infused with black demonic qi and was as large as a palm. Jun Wushang's spirit pill was only thumb-sized.</p><p></p><p>The two spirit pills suddenly bloomed, each outlining their respective methods!</p><p></p><p>They did not employ the divine abilities from their cultivation bases, but rather spontaneously outlined their spell methods.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual powers condensed into a huge arm, with the spirit pill at the center of the palm!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's spiritual power arm was three zhang long!</p><p></p><p>The demon prince's spiritual power arm was five zhang long!</p><p></p><p>The arms collided, the spirit pills clashing. Jun Wushang's three zhang arm dispersed, instantly interweaving into a full moon!</p><p></p><p>The moon disk shimmered, splitting into two spiritual power swords, one to the left and one to the right, bypassing the demon prince's spirit pill to strike directly at his true body!</p><p></p><p>The demon prince did not move, his spirit pill returning to form an ocean, from which countless spiritual power arms emerged, crushing the two swords.</p><p></p><p>One of the swords containing a spirit pill trembled and split into ten spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>The ten spirit pills moved at unmatched speed, once again attacking the demon prince!</p><p></p><p>Thousands of spiritual power arms rose up in the void, wildly trying to capture the ten spirit pills. But the spirit pills were too fast, and the thousands of arms could only protect the demon prince's physical body.</p><p></p><p>"You're getting hasty."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, one of the spiritual power arms in front of the demon prince's ocean was missing, leaving only 999 arms still trying to capture the ten spirit pills!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment!</p><p></p><p>A spiritual power arm materialized behind Jun Wushang's back and slapped him down into the depths of the earth with a palm strike!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom——————</p><p></p><p>By the time Jun Wushang crawled back up, he had regained his elegant demeanor.</p><p></p><p>But his face was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He had lost!</p><p></p><p>He had acted too hastily, failing to notice that one of the demon prince's spiritual power arms was missing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could not have lost so quickly!</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the disciples of the Star Palace are still lacking."</p><p></p><p>The demon prince captured each of the spirit pills one by one, forcibly crushing them.</p><p></p><p>With each explosion, Jun Wushang's body would tremble, and after the ten spirit pills were destroyed, his aura had withered by half, blood dripping from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The demon prince waved his hand dismissively. "Just kill them all."</p><p></p><p>Boring. He didn't find the Sword Sect's moon ship, and even the renowned Jun Wushang was so weak.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have come in the first place.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Prince, since you wish to test your spiritual power against others, why not try me?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled at the demon prince!</p><p></p><p>The demon prince wanted to test his abilities!</p><p></p><p>Why wouldn't he want the same?</p><p></p><p>The battle between Jun Wushang and the demon prince had stirred Gu Jiuqing's heart of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>The demon prince laughed derisively.</p><p></p><p>He was a Celestial demon - not just any cat or dog could be his opponent!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing released his aura, the atmosphere of the Spiritual Power realm rippling outward.</p><p></p><p>The hair-thin spirit pill flew out of his dantian and hovered in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Dare you battle me?"</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters! Kneeling to beg for more chapters! The protagonist is about to make his move!</p><p></p><p>It will definitely be amazing, it will definitely be brilliant!</p>

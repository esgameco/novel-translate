        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, dressed in a long blue robe stained with blood, stood calmly on the ground. The sound of a sword chant was emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>A sword!  </p><p></p><p>Sword force!</p><p></p><p>Sword aura! </p><p></p><p>Sword intent!</p><p></p><p>The three fundamental aspects of the sword path blossomed simultaneously, slashing the heavens and extinguishing the earth, piercing through the void. The extraordinary phenomenon appearing this time was dozens of times more magnificent than when Si Wuxie comprehended the jade sword intent.</p><p></p><p>His blue robe dyed with blood fluttered noisily. The youth from the northern lands only felt his eyes dry, as an overwhelming intent to kill emerged from nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent contains the meaning of slashing the heavens and extinguishing the earth. In this sword test, the jade sword is inserted into the trial stone, possessing only the jade sword intent. How could the intent to slash the heavens arise?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei focused his gaze, allowing his eyes to dry and shed clear tears, still staring fixedly at Gu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>He felt it!</p><p></p><p>He felt that boundless sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The sword aura raged forth, emanating from Gu Jiuqing's body. Within a three-meter radius, the sword aura formed a ring, refining into steel-like threads, softly wrapping around his finger.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of sword aura coiled around Gu Jiuqing's index finger.</p><p></p><p>The glowing sword aura did not harm Gu Jiuqing at all, instead bringing a sense of warmth.</p><p></p><p>The sword aura continued to flow, the sword force naturally forming. The heaven-slashing sword force condensed within, and after this wisp of sword force reached full condensation, it finally converged into a strand of sword intent!!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh——————</p><p></p><p>The sword aura dispersed from Gu Jiuqing's body, and an illusory great sword formed behind his back.</p><p></p><p>This sword could slash the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Hence, it was called the heaven-slashing sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the sword intent of the Unsheathing Sword Art?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing seemed dazed, as if inquiring and affirming at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Within his Mud Pill Palace, the illusory fruition swayed, and insights from cultivating the Unsheathing Sword Art condensed onto the golden flying sword, touched by Gu Jiuqing's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>There were too many insights into the Unsheathing Sword Art, with new ones converging every moment. The heaven-slashing sword intent was born from the Unsheathing Sword Art, the most quintessential sword intent!</p><p></p><p>A strand of sword intent rose, the boundless sword aura dispersing. The insights within the fruition continuously converged, causing this strand of sword intent to grow and condense more sword intent, visibly to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the jade sword intent. This kind of sword intent is too profound. If sword intents are also graded, this sword intent would at least be of the highest grade!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's beautiful eyes flickered incessantly. As the heir of the Xia family, she understood the secrets of the sword path.</p><p></p><p>She also knew about the cultivation of the sword path.</p><p></p><p>The beginning of the sword path involved using one's blood energy or spiritual power to stimulate the true comprehension of the sword path, transforming it into sword aura. Achieving this step meant stepping onto the path of cultivating the sword path.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to condense the force of the sword path and comprehend its true comprehension. If one could comprehend a strand of sword force, they could be called a sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>One strand of sword force, two strands of sword force, three strands of sword force... After ten strands of sword force, they would condense into one complete sword force.</p><p></p><p>Starting from one complete sword force, one would continue to condense two complete sword forces, three complete sword forces... After reaching ten complete sword forces, they could finally converge into one strand of sword intent!</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how difficult it was to transform sword aura within nine days, then condense ten complete sword forces into one strand of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Those sword cultivators within the sword sect might not be able to condense a single strand of sword intent in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between a sword prodigy and an ordinary sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>One was like a bright lamp in the eternal night, while the other group of sword cultivators fell in the eternal night, unable to emit even a glimmer of light.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family is about to rise!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's expression changed, finally turning into a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The four of them had sought out Gu Jiuqing early on, intending to join forces and enter the sword sect. Although they also wished to become sword prodigies, only they knew how difficult it was to become a true sword prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly!</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing did it!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli gripped his folding fan tightly, crushing the dragon bone within.</p><p></p><p>A sense of powerlessness!</p><p></p><p>For the first time, this feeling arose in the hearts of these four young masters from great clans.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was as brilliant as the sun in the sky. One figure after another accepted the reality, closing their eyes, unable to look any longer.</p><p></p><p>The son of heaven, the sword prodigy - they could not even catch a glimpse of his back.</p><p></p><p>The Xie steward was excited.</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Qu family appeared. The Xie steward and the Qu family's protector had already separated - one at the half-Nascent Soul stage, the other a...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators in the Realm of the Gods stared fixedly at Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Not just them, but also the outer disciples, inner disciples, and even the true disciples of the Sword Sect revealed hints of curiosity, looking around restlessly. </p><p></p><p>"He's promising! The young master is promising!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the demeanor of a sword genius, he will definitely become a Sword Immortal in the future. My Gu Family will produce a Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent is somewhat similar to the sword intent of drawing the sword, but more profound, as if it was born from the practice of drawing the sword!"</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing asked for a cultivation method of drawing the sword, and then in just three or four days aided by practicing drawing the sword, he cultivated sword intent? And it's even a top-grade sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a top-grade sword intent."</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Sword Sect looked on with envy and jealousy, their sword intent constantly scanning around Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating a top-grade sword intent in just three or four days? This far exceeds the talent of the disciple the Third Elder took in previously."</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Jade Sword Intent is just an ordinary sword intent, barely qualifying as mid-grade, but this strand of sword intent is a precious top-grade sword intent."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing! He's not just a sword genius, but the paramount genius of the sword!"  </p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect has existed for tens of thousands of years, and now another paramount sword genius will appear!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed the scorching gazes!</p><p></p><p>They came from the high-levels of the Sword Sect, making him feel like sitting on a bed of nails, the sword intent even seeming to pierce his physical body.</p><p></p><p>This was the gaze of Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>He knew!</p><p></p><p>He had finally gambled correctly!</p><p></p><p>Killing Qu Yaozhou was to achieve comprehension of intent, but after comprehending intent there were still lingering worries.</p><p></p><p>That was this old patriarch of the Qu Family, a peerless Sword Immortal of the era.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sword Sect had rules that after becoming an Elder one must cut ties with the Northern Lands, how could one sever their roots so easily?</p><p></p><p>What Gu Jiuqing did could be considered major or minor, and the Qu Family Elder wanted to imprison him in the Demon Suppressing Pagoda - that was the will of a Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of Gu Jiuqing, a rare body cultivation genius who had undergone five Sheddings of Mortality, they chose to offend the legitimate peerless Sword Immortal and give up on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>Everything was different.</p><p></p><p>A sword genius, no! That was the paramount genius of the sword, the birth of such a figure in the Northern Lands happened to occur within the jurisdiction of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this a blessing for the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing severed his spiritual fruits, stripping away all his comprehensions of the drawing sword technique. He had a feeling that if he continued probing, his single strand of sword intent would condense into two strands of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>If the appearance of the paramount sword genius had already shocked the Sword Sect to this extent, what if he comprehended two strands of sword intent in just three or four days??</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing chose to remain low-key. The drawing sword technique and Dragon Elephant Skill could both be practiced in secret, avoiding him a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Rending Sword Intent disappeared, and the figures of the Northern youths around Gu Jiuqing also vanished.  </p><p></p><p>He stood alone below the gate of the Sword Sect, looking up at the Qu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak, just smiling brightly as he gazed at the Qu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The Qu Family Patriarch also didn't speak, standing in mid-air with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>The six enforcement disciples hesitated, mustering their courage to look at the Qu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qu, do we now need to arrest Gu Jiuqing, or..."</p><p></p><p>The leading enforcement disciple was flustered. Arrest the paramount sword genius?  </p><p></p><p>They didn't dare, but defying an Elder's order, they also didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>Caught between a rock and a hard place, he could only inquire with the Qu Family Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph————"  </p><p></p><p>The Qu Family Patriarch didn't reply, this incarnated ripple dissipating.</p><p></p><p>This scene!</p><p></p><p>Even a Sword Immortal couldn't make a decision!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the paramount sword genius had already shaken the higher ranks of the Sword Sect. One Sword Immortal after another emerged from seclusion, the sword qi in the Sword Palace becoming extremely concentrated, even leaking sword intent that sliced the white clouds overhead in two.</p><p></p><p>This is a short one, I'll make up for the last two days.</p><p></p><p>Last night before going to sleep I started feeling fatigued, and sure enough this morning I had a fever from a cold.</p><p></p><p>Going now to get an IV drip, hopefully I can recover soon.</p><p></p><p>Sorry about that.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Lu Yuan walked from the Executing Officer Palace to the Heavenly Sword Palace. </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's appearance was markedly different from before. </p><p></p><p>He carried a huge sword case on his back, made of divine gold with intricate patterns, and adorned with golden dragons winding around it, emitting faint golden rays, like a golden-armored sword deity entering the Heavenly Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>He excitedly looked at Gu Jiuqing, "Junior Brother greets Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his eyelids, also drawn to this golden sword case.</p><p></p><p>Without saying much, Lu Yuan untied the golden sword case and placed it before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, please don't take offense, this is a supreme treasure of my Lu family!"</p><p></p><p>A supreme treasure?</p><p></p><p>Taking the sword as the treasure, a supreme sword?</p><p></p><p>A thousand-grooved divine weapon requires imprinting one thousand Dao grooves, an exclusive weapon for the Heavenly Palace Realm cultivators. It takes a Heavenly Palace cultivator one year to imprint one groove, totaling a thousand years to successfully forge it.</p><p></p><p>But a supreme treasure!</p><p></p><p>It requires a Heavenly Palace cultivator to spend three thousand years imprinting three thousand Dao grooves on the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The power of time is unfathomable. After being imbued over time, the divine weapon gains unimaginable might.</p><p></p><p>And the Lu family is an aristocratic clan, with at least one Heavenly Palace cultivator alive now.</p><p></p><p>This supreme treasure has been nurtured in the Lu family's ancestral temple for three thousand years with the entire clan's efforts!</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years ago, one of my Lu family's ancestors obtained a chunk of Imperishable Primordial Divine Gold weighing thirty tons. That ancestor used the Imperishable Primordial Divine Gold as the embryo for the supreme treasure, adding azure bronze thunderstone, mica tri-colored goldstone, and a large piece of five-colored celestial material. It took eight hundred years just to refine the embryo."</p><p></p><p>After learning about this profound heritage of his family, Lu Yuan couldn't help but sigh in awe.</p><p></p><p>Eight hundred years was merely spent refining the embryo for the supreme treasure!</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine what terrifying form this divine weapon would take upon completion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stroked the sword case, without even opening it, he could sense the dreadful aura of the divine sword within.</p><p></p><p>A pure sword aura, suppressed inside the case. Once unleashed, it could cleave the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>This was just the sword aura contained on the surface. If the Dao grooves inside were activated, the sword aura could slay a Heavenly Palace cultivator with one strike!</p><p></p><p>The rippling dragon patterns on the case seemed like real dragons soaring across the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Lu Yuan with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Was Lu Yuan going to gift him this supreme treasure he carried?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing quickly dismissed this preposterous thought.</p><p></p><p>This was a supreme treasure, not a thousand-grooved divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>It was nurtured by the Lu family over generations, with countless disciples sacrificing their lives. How could the Lu family simply gift such a supreme treasure to him?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's voice continued, as Gu Jiuqing caressed the sword case, entranced.</p><p></p><p>"In the following years, my Lu family devoted all its efforts to nurturing the Imperishable Primordial Divine Sword. Some ancestors even infused their Heavenly Palace Realm cultivation base into the sword, forming Dao grooves."</p><p></p><p>Offering one's body to nurture the weapon was a common method for supreme treasures.</p><p></p><p>Many great clans, lacking the profound heritage to nurture a supreme treasure, would have their elders sacrifice themselves!</p><p></p><p>Using their essence, flesh, bones and cultivation to nurture the supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>And for this Imperishable Primordial Divine Sword, it had consumed countless Lu family scions.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sighed, "It's a pity that the quality of this supreme treasure is too high, forged from the Imperishable Primordial Divine Gold which is the prime material for crafting divine weapon embryos."</p><p></p><p>Ordinary disciples of the Sword Sect use divine weapons made from divine gold and materials. The Artifact Peak forges hundreds or thousands of divine weapons every year for sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Thousand-grooved divine weapons require imprinting Dao grooves - the imprints of the great Dao, the patterns of the Heavenly Dao. These are naturally formed and need to be manually preserved.</p><p></p><p>Each year, a divine weapon will reveal one Dao groove, requiring someone to nurture it and prevent it from cracking.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Sect, elders often issue tasks for disciples to "feed" their swords, using their essence and energy to nurture the weapons. These tasks offer high rewards and sect contribution points.</p><p></p><p>If a divine weapon develops three thousand Dao grooves, it enters another realm.</p><p></p><p>The might of the divine weapon soars tremendously. Simultaneously refining three thousand grooves unleashes a terrifying pressure called "Divine Might"!</p><p></p><p>This strike is also known as the "Divine Strike"!!</p><p></p><p>Among supreme treasures, those with three thousand years of Dao grooves are considered the lowest grade. Six thousand years is the middle grade, and nine thousand years is the highest. Even eternal families rarely possess such mighty treasures, let alone ordinary aristocratic clans.</p><p></p><p>But if one thousand more years of grooves are added to a nine-thousand-year supreme treasure, it becomes a divine artifact!</p><p></p><p>Legends say these are the weapons used by deities!</p><p></p><p>But in the Primordial Wilderness, apart from the Four Great Sects and the Great Zhou Empire, no one possesses divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it took eight hundred years just to forge this supreme treasure from the embryonic divine gold of divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, my Lu family spent four thousand years nurturing it, almost causing our lineage to be severed. We had no choice but to move this half-finished supreme treasure out of the ancestral temple."</p><p></p><p>Four thousand eight hundred years ago, the Lu family was glorious, even producing Eternal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, that glory faded, reducing the Lu family to an ordinary aristocratic clan in Guiyuan Ancient City. Those noble families aspire to become aristocratic clans, but the Lu family fell from being an eternal family to a mere aristocratic clan.</p><p></p><p>At its peak, the Lu family ruled four of the thirteen ancient cities in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gazed at the Imperishable Primordial Divine Sword, "Senior Brother, this divine sword lacks just one more Dao groove to evolve into a supreme treasure. At most, it can only be considered a half-finished supreme treasure now, but its might is already on par with one."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lifted the sword case to stand beside Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Above the case, numerous spirit symbols were tightly affixed to the scabbard's position.</p><p></p><p>Those were sword talismans used to suppress the Imperishable Primordial Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>A supreme sword treasure's sharpness is fully exposed. If a cultivator's realm is too low, it could turn against and kill its owner.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this supreme treasure was extremely heavy. Lu Yuan was only at the Unitary Realm with the Sun Divine Body, but without those suppressing talismans, the sheer weight of this divine sword alone would crush his physical body!</p><p></p><p>Marvelous!</p><p></p><p>Truly marvelous.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was about to have ten billion people assisting his cultivation. The three thousand-grooved divine swords in his body would soon be unable to suppress his physical form. If he had this half-step supreme treasure to suppress the Unitary Mountain, he should be able to absorb the cultivations of the people of Planet Blue unrestrained, right?</p><p></p><p>"However, this time Senior Brother is only escorting our sect's disciples to the moon for cultivation, so there likely won't be any danger."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan reminisced.</p><p></p><p>"There are no demon lairs on the moon, and demons won't appear there. According to ancient records, at most there are only some low-level spirits on the moon. With Senior Brother's great talents and this half-step supreme treasure in hand, you can easily subdue anything."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Listening carefully, Gu Jiuqing caught the underlying meaning.</p><p></p><p>Wielding this half-step supreme treasure?</p><p></p><p>Was Lu Yuan going to let him take this half-finished supreme treasure?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan lowered his head and bowed to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>He said deeply,</p><p></p><p>"I, Lu Yuan, am willing to become Senior Brother's follower!"</p><p></p><p>"The eight hundred disciples of my Lu family are willing to become Senior Brother's followers!"</p><p></p><p>"The two Heavenly Palace Realm elders, twelve Refining Spirit elders, and all the ancestors of my Lu family are willing to become Senior Brother's followers!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Senior Brother, achieve the Dao and lead my Lu family to enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>Imperishable Primordial Divine Gold!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing finally recalled the origins of this divine gold.</p><p></p><p>According to legends, in the ancient imperial eras, those Heavenly Emperors built ten celestial palaces, assisted by ten celestial emperors to unify the Primordial Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>And these ten celestial palaces were constructed from Imperishable Primordial Divine Gold!</p><p></p><p>This divine gold is extremely rare. Ever since the disappearance of the Eighteenth Imperial Era ten thousand years ago, it has never appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Lu family, using this half-finished supreme treasure as a pledge, was requesting Gu Jiuqing to accept them as his followers!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing naturally understood the relationship between the Achieved Dao and followers.</p><p></p><p>It was akin to his master-servant relationship with Steward Xie.</p><p></p><p>If he agreed, the eight hundred Lu family disciples would all become Gu Jiuqing's servants.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to be followers, not Dao Protectors?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>Dao Protectors protect and support the Achieved Dao, holding a status equivalent to a master, vastly higher than followers.</p><p></p><p>But followers were merely servants, with a huge gap in status between the two.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked anxious and quickly raised his head, sincerely gazing at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother jests. How could my Lu family dare to become Senior Brother's Dao Protectors? With Senior Brother's great talents, who in this world would dare to become your Dao Protector?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Jiuqing's doubts dissipate, Lu Yuan hurriedly continued.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother's talents are immense. You've only briefly stayed in the Sword Sect, yet achieving divinity is just around the corner. Would the patriarchs of the Four Great Sects or those semi-divine wild gods dare to become your Dao Protectors?"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Senior Brother, in consideration of my sincerity, accept my Lu family lineage as your followers."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan spoke with great humility.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he entered the Heavenly Sword Palace, he had already made this decision.</p><p></p><p>Humble now?  </p><p>Esteemed in the future!</p><p></p><p>This was Lu Yuan's only chance to achieve the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just a little humility was a small price to pay for the opportunity to achieve the Dao. This deal was worth it!</p><p></p><p>Affectionate words?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, don't look at me with those eyes again." </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was not attracted to men.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan gave a sly laugh!</p><p></p><p>He had finally accomplished the greatest thing in his life. </p><p></p><p>With Gu Jiuqing's personal approval, the last shackle in Lu Yuan's heart disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He had taken it upon himself to declare within the family that he was a follower of Master Gu.</p><p></p><p>And now, this matter was truly settled!</p><p></p><p>Master Gu Jiuqing, his first follower, Lu Yuan, was born today!</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong————"</p><p></p><p>A melodious bell sound came from outside the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The bell sound broke through the formations and fell into the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is the summons from the sect. The bell rang six times."</p><p></p><p>Six bell rings, a summons from the sect?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made a note of this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why don't you set off?" Lu Yuan saw Gu Jiuqing standing there, caressing the Taiyi Divine Sword, and hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Only the summoned person can hear the summons from the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Now that daylight has arrived, it's time to herd the moon. The sect is calling for you to ascend the moon!"</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Taiyi Divine Sword, then at Lu Yuan, and handed the Taiyi Divine Sword to him.</p><p></p><p>"You take this divine sword first. On the journey to ascend the moon, you will follow me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stepped out, with Lu Yuan carrying the sword case of the Taiyi Divine Sword on his back, his face full of surprise!</p><p></p><p>Master was going to cultivate him as a close disciple!</p><p></p><p>He must not become a burden to his master.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Sword Sect's divine mountain, the clouds rippled, and divine light flickered, with a brilliant light shining through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Then, a huge ship broke through layer after layer of clouds, shattering the heavens and appearing outside the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>This divine ship was exaggeratedly large, with figures on the deck looking like ants.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble————"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The divine ship sailed forward, entering the Sword Sect, and disciples gazed up at the sky, excitedly watching the divine ship.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Moon Divine Ship!"</p><p></p><p>A sect disciple recognized the divine ship and excitedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Every few hundred years, the sect mobilizes the Moon Divine Ship to transport disciples to the moon for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, is today such a joyous occasion?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder who will be selected!"</p><p></p><p>The divine ship was so large that it covered the sun and enveloped the surrounding mountains.</p><p></p><p>Jade bridges descended from the Moon Divine Ship, landing on the various peaks, and several Elders stepped onto the jade bridges and entered.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Fiery Sword Immortal of Jiuyang Peak! The Wind Sword Immortal of Manhuang Peak! The Cold Sword Immortal of Tianxue Peak!"</p><p></p><p>"It's said that these three Sword Immortals will personally lead the team and escort the sect's disciples to ascend the moon for cultivation this time."</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Washing Academy.</p><p></p><p>Although the morning teacher had not yet arrived, the inner sect disciples who came to attend the class had already become a mess.</p><p></p><p>An enormous divine ship hovered above the academy, and they witnessed fellow disciples being taken away by jade bridges, to ascend the moon for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Moon Divine Ship was right overhead.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that someone among us will also be taken by the Moon Divine Ship for cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Many inner sect disciples were filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Imagining the great fortune descending upon them.</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths!</p><p></p><p>A jade bridge descended from above, breaking through the clouds and falling vertically into the Sword Washing Academy.</p><p></p><p>The identity token of a disciple emitted a brilliant light, and he was taken away by the jade bridge!</p><p></p><p>"That's Senior Brother Gao Shuli!"</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized Gao Shuli and exclaimed in surprise, "Senior Brother Gao is truly fortunate to be selected."</p><p></p><p>Another jade bridge descended!</p><p></p><p>This time, it selected Du Guming.</p><p></p><p>As more and more jade bridges fell, many inner sect disciples from the academy were taken away.</p><p></p><p>However, most people remained in the academy, and they became dissatisfied. It wasn't until they saw a newly joined inner sect disciple also being taken away that their dissatisfaction reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>"That is?"</p><p></p><p>A female disciple stepped onto the jade bridge, enveloped by the jade bridges, and within a few steps, she ascended into the clouds and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The people around this inner sect disciple were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that Xia Qingzhou, who just joined the inner sect this year?"</p><p></p><p>There were few female cultivators in the inner sect, and Xia Qingzhou's appearance and background were exceptional. In the few days she attended classes at the academy, many people had come to know her.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang Bai, who was beside Xia Qingzhou, was also taken away by the jade bridges!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a slightly older but highly cultivated disciple who had been in the inner sect for over a hundred years and had opened twenty-eight vertebrae suddenly took action.</p><p></p><p>Why!</p><p></p><p>Why was Xia Qingzhou, a newcomer of unknown origin, selected for moon cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Now even this newly joined disciple could be chosen?</p><p></p><p>He circulated his spiritual power, attempting to seize Qing Yang Bai.</p><p></p><p>The vast spiritual power condensed into a white arm, about to pull Qing Yang Bai down from the jade bridges.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're an elder of the inner sect, yet after cultivating for so long, you still don't understand the rules?"</p><p></p><p>How ridiculous!!</p><p></p><p>His family had spent a hundred thousand spirit stones to obtain a spot for moon cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One hundred thousand spirit stones for a spot to cultivate on the moon!!</p><p></p><p>That was still acceptable!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou's family had spent a hundred and ten thousand spirit stones to obtain the last spot.</p><p></p><p>Moon cultivation was a benefit the sect provided to its disciples.</p><p></p><p>Either you had exceptional talent and were actively selected by the sect!</p><p></p><p>That group was the elite among the elite, receiving special attention from the sect.</p><p></p><p>The other group paid their own way, needing to offer a large amount of resources in exchange for a spot.</p><p></p><p>And the resources they offered would go into the sect to cultivate other disciples.</p><p></p><p>Did this inner sect elder not understand even this?</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had cultivated for over a hundred years and was still stuck in the inner sect, unable to advance.</p><p></p><p>"Insolence!"</p><p></p><p>A figure flew in from outside, an enforcer disciple who had witnessed this scene and intervened.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? The use of spiritual power is forbidden in the academy. Do you want to end up in the Punishment Hall?"</p><p></p><p>The inner sect elder hurriedly dispersed his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The jade bridges soared into the sky, taking Qing Yang Bai up into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The academy fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Those inner sect disciples who had unrealistically hoped to be chosen by fate now felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Without paying the price, how could such an opportunity fall into their laps?</p><p></p><p>After a while, the divine ship sailed away from above the Sword Washing Academy, heading towards other areas of the Sword Sect's divine mountain to collect more disciples for moon cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As the morning sun rose, the Moon Divine Ship lingered within the sect, and a large group of disciples had already gathered on board.</p><p></p><p>The three Sword Immortals stood amidst the crowd, surrounded by disciples.</p><p></p><p>Closest to the three Sword Immortals were seven or eight Elders, while the inner sect disciples formed the outer circle.</p><p></p><p>The inner sect disciples were the most numerous, with nearly a hundred of them.</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong————"</p><p></p><p>A palm-sized chiming bell was hung on the ship's sail.</p><p></p><p>The chiming bell suddenly rang out, and the divine ship came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples curiously looked down.</p><p></p><p>"More people are coming aboard!"</p><p></p><p>"Judging by the time, the Moon Divine Ship is about to ascend the moon. It seems this is the last batch of inner sect disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why is this inner sect disciple running from such a remote corner of the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Several breaths passed, but the person boarding had not appeared.</p><p></p><p>This had already far exceeded the boarding time.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The three Sword Immortals were still patiently waiting??</p><p></p><p>"The three Sword Immortal Masters have such good temperaments. Someone is delaying, yet they don't urge them on."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou and Qing Yang Bai marveled.</p><p></p><p>They had only recently heard about the Three Sword Immortals of the sect.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that these three Sword Immortals were the Three Sword Immortals, who had been roaming the world for decades, even hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, seeing the three Sword Immortals waiting, the other disciples naturally did not dare to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>After some more time, finally, two figures ascended onto the Moon Divine Ship from below.</p><p></p><p>One in front and one behind, neither hurried nor slow, they calmly flew up to the Moon Divine Ship.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>Many disciples were surprised. There were too many inner sect disciples, and they could not possibly remember them all.</p><p></p><p>Someone suddenly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yuan! That's Lu Yuan from Zaowu Peak!"</p><p></p><p>"Zaowu Peak?"</p><p></p><p>Zaowu Peak was like the Enforcement Peak, selecting disciples each year to maintain the operations of the sect.</p><p></p><p>However, the status of Zaowu Peak disciples was much lower than that of Enforcement Peak disciples.</p><p></p><p>Gazes turned towards Gao Shuli, Du Guming, and Wu Shaojie.</p><p></p><p>The three inner sect disciples formed their own group, standing on one side of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The scrutiny of those gazes made them feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Since joining the Sword Sect, when had they ever enjoyed the attention of so many eyes?</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Shuli was puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Lu Family had long since declined, so how could they afford spirit stones to pave the way for Lu Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Then he saw the three Sword Immortals and their Elders react!!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, those three Sword Immortal Elders had not moved, but smiles had already appeared on their faces as they walked towards the bow to welcome the arrivals.</p>

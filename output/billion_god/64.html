        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Jianmen Pass, dividing the vast wilderness. </p><p></p><p>The boundless scene reappeared before Gu Jiuqing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His perception was now very subtle. </p><p></p><p>Under the state of wandering freely, his "thoughts" were infinitely extended. With a single thought, he could reach anywhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>"The vast world has no bounds, and my thoughts have no limits either."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing saw his physical body at Mingting Peak. </p><p></p><p>His golden vital energy formed a divine halo, resonating with the world to seek the celestial mechanism.</p><p></p><p>With a flicker of thought, Gu Jiuqing's consciousness extended for unknown distances across the universe.</p><p></p><p>Vast!</p><p></p><p>Boundless! </p><p></p><p>Profound!</p><p></p><p>Jianmen Pass became a speck of dust in his "eyes." The entire northern lands were dwarfed under his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Mountain ranges crisscrossed, peaks winding endlessly, with plains, plateaus, and even primeval ancient forests. Gu Jiuqing even saw cities dotting this vast land.</p><p></p><p>Those were the cities of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Qingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>So this was the Qingzhou mentioned in the books.</p><p></p><p>One of the nine states, Qingzhou connected to the northern lands. The farther away from the north, the more prosperous it became.</p><p></p><p>Near the Qingzhou prefecture, there was a county town every hundred li, bustling with people. Soldiers and merchants walked along the official roads, as dense as ants.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing lived in the northern lands, thousands of li away from the nearest divine city.</p><p></p><p>And in the entire northern lands, there were only thirteen ancient cities; aside from those, there were no other signs of human habitation.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Zhou is so prosperous, the heart of our human race!"</p><p></p><p>The four major sects guarded the four desolate regions, preventing demons from entering the Great Zhou. This was the original purpose for establishing the four sects.</p><p></p><p>"Let me verify Qingzhou's resemblance to an elephant."</p><p></p><p>Ancient books recorded that Qingzhou's terrain resembled an elephant, with the northern lands as the tail and the thirteen cities strung along it like a line.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the topography of Qingzhou appeared before Gu Jiuqing's eyes, followed by the other eight states.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Qingzhou does resemble a great elephant!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt his thoughts flowing smoothly, as if he had gained enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>He gazed down upon each of the great states, then penetrated the entire geography of the nine states with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>Jianmen Pass in the northern lands!</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Western Heaven in the Western Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>Wind and Thunder Valley in the Eastern Wilderness! </p><p></p><p>The Thirty Thousand Mountains in the Southern Ridge!</p><p></p><p>These four desolate regions separated the Great Zhou from the vast wilderness, where countless people lived and multiplied across the nine states.</p><p></p><p>"I can wander the cosmos with a thought, but where is the celestial mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed up at the vast sky. He was already far from the wilderness, and the moon and sun had grown much larger.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing forcibly suppressed the urge to venture to the moon and sun.</p><p></p><p>The last time he went to the moon during the wandering state, he almost lost his physical and spiritual form.</p><p></p><p>As for the sun, the ancient legends called it the King of Stars, revered as the Sun Star. Even the Celestial Emperor dared not follow when patrolling the great sun, for fear of falling into the Sun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not know if his wandering state could withstand the burning of the sun's true fire.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the celestial mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed blankly at the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>He then looked up at the myriad stars twinkling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Could the celestial mechanism be among those stars?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts swept over them but felt no mystical resonance.</p><p></p><p>This meant the celestial mechanism he sought was not among the stars.</p><p></p><p>"Then where could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts extended infinitely, his consciousness growing thinner and thinner.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>His thoughts circulated.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanism...</p><p></p><p>Where?"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally formed a complete thought.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts had scattered too far, enveloping the nine states and encompassing the four desolate regions.</p><p></p><p>But his wandering state clearly had not reached such a profound level. His consciousness continued merging with heaven and earth, completely dissipating into the vast sky. If Gu Jiuqing could not awaken, then his consciousness would completely fuse with heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Entering an even higher state than the unity of man and heaven, harmonizing with the Dao, becoming one with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>I am heaven and earth, heaven and earth are me.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it meant dissipating into nothingness, or more poetically, merging one's body with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—————</p><p></p><p>His consciousness flowed like water, drifting through the wilderness. Gu Jiuqing's spirit wandered the cosmos, his thoughts scattering across the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness grew weaker and weaker, until all his thoughts completely fragmented.</p><p></p><p>And at that very moment!</p><p></p><p>From beyond the wilderness, a gentle breeze blew, stirring the white clouds, the ancient primeval forests, and Gu Jiuqing's scattered consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Why not ride the wind and soar? Traversing ninety thousand li!"</p><p></p><p>His consciousness began contracting, blown together by the great wind into the illusory form of a peng bird!</p><p></p><p>The great peng soared through the nine heavens and ten earths, falling into the azure void to become the great kun fish, roaming the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>All of this!</p><p></p><p>Occurred in such a profound and wondrous way that Gu Jiuqing only felt he had grasped something.</p><p></p><p>"Profound!"</p><p></p><p>"Wondrous!"</p><p></p><p>Profoundly profound, the gateway to all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial mechanism is not in the wilderness, nor among the myriad stars. Where could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thought made contact!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth contracted, his thoughts descended, and countless wills returned to his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"My celestial mechanism is within my own body!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Gu Jiuqing understood the true way to release the celestial mechanism.</p><p></p><p>He had been misguided by Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao all along.</p><p></p><p>He thought releasing the celestial mechanism meant leaking it from heaven and earth into the human body.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't wrong - what was wrong was Gu Jiuqing searching for the celestial mechanism in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The gateway to all wonders is not in heaven and earth, but within my body. Using the gateway of all wonders as a medium, I can touch upon the celestial mechanism!"</p><p></p><p>In the chamber,</p><p></p><p>The golden vital energy halo entered his body from the baihui acupoint, the endless flow of energy washing over him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's physical body suddenly moved.</p><p></p><p>The body that was originally standing now sat directly on the ground, eyes half-open, palms facing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he used the wandering state to explore his own physical body.</p><p></p><p>A vast divine mountain appeared before his eyes, with thirty-three celestial steps like the stairway to heaven on Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>An enormous peng bird soared over Mount Buzhou, descending from the peak, intertwining with the primal forms of dragons and elephants, the yin-yang primal body, and the golden raven primal body.</p><p></p><p>Finally, passing through...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not Far Mountain, fell into the vast "chaos realm". </p><p></p><p>That was an unexplored bitter sea, the body was a ship, the soul was a sail. Open the ship's door, steer the sails, and roam the bitter sea!!</p><p></p><p>"I have found the gate of all wonders!"</p><p></p><p>The dantian!</p><p></p><p>Chaotic and boundless.</p><p></p><p>The image of the roc was so enormous that it defied the heavens, the entire dantian appeared before his eyes. </p><p></p><p>This was also the first time Gu Jiuqing saw the "gate of all wonders" with his own eyes!</p><p></p><p>The entire dantian was the gate of all wonders, opening the gate of all wonders meant opening the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The gate before him was ancient, bearing the years of Gu Jiuqing's life, all decayed outside the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>The gate was mottled, with traces of decay imprinted on it.</p><p></p><p>"Blast open the gate of all wonders, and you can reveal the heavenly secrets!"</p><p></p><p>Why couldn't this saying be passed down?</p><p></p><p>It was this saying that solved all of Gu Jiuqing's problems about revealing heavenly secrets.</p><p></p><p>Can the law not be lightly transmitted?</p><p></p><p>But those supernatural laws, laws of shedding mortality, laws of immortality, laws of refining divinity could all be chanted, why was it that when it came to revealing heavenly secrets, it could not be spoken of directly?</p><p></p><p>Even his martial brother did not directly tell Gu Jiuqing, but let him seek the heavenly secrets and undergo the union of dragon and tiger!</p><p></p><p>There must be profundities hidden within!</p><p></p><p>"On the Blue Star, there should be no such qualms?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing's random thoughts arose, the chaos before him suddenly shook, and rays of divine light came from the outside world, surging into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>There were two kinds of divine light, constantly washing the dantian, cleansing away the decay outside the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>It was his martial brother, using the moon spirit stone and sun spirit stone!</p><p></p><p>He was helping me open the gate of all wonders!</p><p></p><p>The gate before him had far fewer traces of rust, even the dantian had become much brighter.</p><p></p><p>The shape of this gate was fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Revealing heavenly secrets! Here I come!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing moved, the roc shook heaven and earth, fiercely crashing into the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>It sounded like the voice of the primordial beginning, shaking the earth as it opened the heavens, making the dantian sway, even the gate trembled.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gate cracked open, the roc had burst open a sliver of the gate's corner.</p><p></p><p>Not large, only a sliver.</p><p></p><p>Through this slender crack, a thread of light from the primordial beginning surged into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>That was Gu Jiuqing's first thread of divine power!</p><p></p><p>The divine power flowed, slowly flowing out from the slender crack of the gate of all wonders, falling into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The divine power realm was established at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Not enough!</p><p></p><p>Such a slender thread of divine power, who could see it?</p><p></p><p>On Not Far Mountain, dragon and elephant images stirred, those were two thousand two hundred dragon and elephant images flying towards the gate of all wonders!</p><p></p><p>Me!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing, the first to reach the realm of shedding mortality since ancient times, so naturally in the divine power realm, he would also become the first person since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>One after another, the dragon and elephant images charged forward, crashing into the gate of all wonders. This gate was blasted from the chaos, first transforming into an indescribable gate.</p><p></p><p>It seemed three zhang (about 10 meters) high, utterly illusory, and that crack was blasted open by several chi (about 1 foot).</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish ——————"  </p><p>"Swish swish ————————"</p><p></p><p>Like the Milky Way pouring onto the mortal realm, the reverse flow of the four seas, an ocean of divine power, the dantian even swelled several times, from its original thumb-size to the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, still not enough!"</p><p></p><p>On Not Far Mountain, the three primordial sources stirred, the primordial sources swirling on Not Far Mountain gathered together, transforming into a golden roc, a dragon and elephant, a roc soaring towards the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Another unprecedented primordial thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang gate of all wonders shook, blasted open even more heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, the gate of all wonders had been blasted half open, constantly flowing threads of divine power from within the three-zhang gate.</p><p></p><p>The divine powers intertwined, forming mist, expanding the dantian as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum————</p><p></p><p>A sword's ring sounded, a sword beam fell from Not Far Mountain, nine-tenths of the sword intent to sever the heavens peeled off from the flying sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword!</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless, the sword energy scattered, the supreme sword intent to sever the heavens wished to cleave open the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>Wandering at ease!</p><p></p><p>The three primordial source avatars!</p><p></p><p>The power of two thousand two hundred dragon and elephant images!</p><p></p><p>Plus this nine-tenths sword intent to sever the heavens, these were all of Gu Jiuqing's means to blast open the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, this gate was thoroughly blasted open.</p><p></p><p>Thread after thread of divine power poured into his body, fusing into the dantian, the gate of all wonders enveloped by divine power.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts also fell into the divine power.</p><p></p><p>He looked at this gate, his gaze penetrating everything, seeing the heaven and earth behind the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"The divine power flows out from the gate of all wonders, but where does this flowing divine power come from?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't know if other cultivators in the divine power realm who revealed the heavenly secrets had fully opened the gate of all wonders when revealing them.</p><p></p><p>But they should all wonder!</p><p></p><p>Where does the divine power inside the gate of all wonders come from?</p><p></p><p>And is this gate a gate innate to the human body?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts arose one after another, only to instantly vanish again.</p><p></p><p>He saw the scene behind the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>"That is!"</p><p></p><p>"That is a gate!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the gate of all wonders there was another gate of all wonders!</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that Gu Jiuqing was powerless to open the second gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>Under the torrent of divine power, Gu Jiuqing's thoughts were washed into form.</p><p></p><p>A blurred figure stood outside the gate of all wonders, looking at the gate of all wonders inside the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>This passage plants several foreshadowing details.</p><p></p><p>Why can revealing heavenly secrets not be spoken of directly? If the gate of all wonders inside the gate of all wonders is opened, what kind of image would appear?</p><p></p><p>Also, is the gate of all wonders real or illusory?</p><p></p><p>The wind of the Great Wilderness helped Gu Jiuqing condense the roc image to shake heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Originally, revealing heavenly secrets was meant to be written as a story arc, with the protagonist roaming the primordial cosmos, witnessing the images of the Great Wilderness, comprehending that the heavenly secrets lie within the body, revealing heavenly secrets means opening the gate of all wonders, the heavenly secrets are the gate of all wonders.</p><p></p><p>At least like the "shedding mortality" in Xian Ni, cough cough, but afraid of being called filler, so the pace was accelerated.</p><p></p><p>Allowing Gu Jiuqing to directly cultivate to the divine power realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

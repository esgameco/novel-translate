        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A strand of elemental pill as thin as a hair floated in front of Gu Jiuqing. </p><p></p><p>This single elemental pill, forged from the divine hammer strikes of 30,000 dragon and elephant spirits, had condensed Gu Jiuqing's repeatedly tempered spiritual power into a strand as thin as a hair.</p><p></p><p>To the uninitiated, it would seem this was merely a strand of Gu Jiuqing's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The demon let out a booming laugh.</p><p></p><p>One of the demon leaders had bull-like horns protruding from his head. His body rippled with demonic energy as he stuck out his crimson tongue, endlessly mocking Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what kind of human is this? A disciple of the Xingchen Pavilion? Or a disciple of the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"If he's from the Sword Sect, why is he so confident in his spiritual power instead of unleashing his sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>The bull-headed demon was enormous, three zhang tall like a small mountain peak towering over the land. </p><p></p><p>The moonlight was like water, dispersing his demonic aura to reveal his iron-like bull fur.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be he has just entered the Spiritual Power Realm? This strand of power could be extinguished by the Eighth Prince with just a puff of breath! Does he really think he can compete with the Eighth Prince?"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from behind.</p><p></p><p>On the blood-red moon, the Moon Demon stepped forward behind the Eighth Demon Prince.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement from the Moon Demon, the other demons all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon was a powerful subordinate of the Eighth Demon Prince, holding a lofty position. The other demons dared not act rashly - even the three-zhang tall bull demon shrank in his presence, standing meekly beside the Moon Demon.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight pervaded, standing out distinctly from the demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang cupped the exquisite pagoda tower, sublimating his spiritual power. The fresh blood that had just spilled was vaporized as the power from 365 divine bridges flowed into his dantian, recondensing into a nine-cycled elemental pill.</p><p></p><p>The moment he recovered to the peak of the Spirit Refinement Realm, his injuries were healed.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Gu, don't overexert yourself. This Eighth Demon Prince of the Spiritual Power Realm is three levels stronger than me just with this nine-cycled pill!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang spoke frankly without telepathic transmission.</p><p></p><p>"My dantian spans seven zhang, while the Eighth Prince's is at least seven zhang and two chi!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate that three-level difference in elemental power. If we were in the Spirit Refinement Realm, the power stored in each of his celestial spirit apertures would be three levels higher than mine!"</p><p></p><p>"Three levels compounded three hundred and sixty-six times - he's vastly more powerful than me!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang admitted his foundation was inferior to the Eighth Prince's, while indirectly revealing the Eighth Prince's power level.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, if you still want to fight him, you absolutely must not let it escalate to the Spirit Refinement Realm. If you face him there, you'll need a power ten times greater than your senior brother to stand a chance!"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Power Realm!</p><p></p><p>The three-level gap between Jun Wushang and the Eighth Prince became a tenfold difference in the Spirit Refinement Realm!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was an elite disciple of the Xingchen Pavilion, with far greater spiritual power than disciples of the other three sects. Yet compared to the Eighth Prince, his power was only one-tenth!</p><p></p><p>This Eighth Demon Prince was undoubtedly one of the top ten peerless experts Gu Jiuqing had ever faced.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly, "No need for concern, Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>He looked again at the Eighth Prince as the hair-thin elemental pill swirled and transformed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The strand's ripples wove into a spiritual arm, which then tore apart into a treasured sword, soaring like a flying sword technique.</p><p></p><p>As the flying sword transformed, it became an enormous dragon and elephant, stepping through the void as if to crush this barbaric world.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Demon Prince, dare you have a bout with me?"</p><p></p><p>"If I win, I ask that the Eighth Prince release my Senior Brother Jun!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang was touched by his words.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Prince let out a booming laugh. "You're from the Sword Sect, so if we fought with swords I'd have some reservations. But what makes you think you can challenge me in spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's sword arts were unmatched!</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Prince would never underestimate any Sword Sect cultivator's sword path.</p><p></p><p>But their spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>Among the four great human sects, the Sword Sect ranked last in spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>The Xingchen Pavilion was first, the Dao and Buddha sects were equal, and the Sword Sect was at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan could barely contain himself any longer.</p><p></p><p>If his Master Gu hadn't instructed him not to speak earlier, he would have furiously berated the Eighth Prince!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of 'Eighth Demon Prince' is he? Just a stepping stone on Master Gu's path to immortality, yet he dares to mock Master Gu like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Just because he can take human form, he thinks he's the pinnacle of magnificence? Why doesn't he reveal his true demonic form for Old Lu to see how hideously ugly it is!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Bead Palace of Lu Yuan's spiritual consciousness, he could only call out to the Eight Trigrams Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder chuckled, "If your Master Gu ends up beaten to death, go retrieve the Nether Crossing Pagoda. I can unleash its power to keep you from dying."</p><p></p><p>"Pah, you old thing, stop talking nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan kicked at the Fountain of Eternal Youth.</p><p></p><p>"Master only told me not to speak up, he didn't say I couldn't take action."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Moon Demon behind the Eighth Prince and took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Unbounded Realm rippled around him as his Primordial Sun Body radiated, a great sun disk rising behind his head.</p><p></p><p>Then the Wood of Establishment on the Unbounded Mountain swayed, its spiritual fruits shaking, two of which remained perfectly still.</p><p></p><p>One was the Eight Trigrams Divine Eye!</p><p></p><p>The other was the seed of the Chaotic Eight Forms!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Divine Eye had just formed, so its spiritual fruit was slightly larger.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual fruit of the Chaotic Eight Forms was much smaller. Recently, the Eight Trigrams Elder had been helping Lu Yuan condense the spirit talismans of this technique. It had just finished condensing into a spiritual seed hanging on the Wood of Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Not yet blossomed, it was just a tiny bud the size of a thumb, round like a small fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu didn't immediately try to kill the Eighth Prince, he clearly intended to have a contest of spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>As Master Gu's follower, I should naturally help him achieve his wish.</p><p></p><p>He extended a finger towards the Moon Demon, beckoning.</p><p></p><p>"Demons! How dare you mock Master Gu? You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>As Lu Yuan spoke, the Eighth Prince's brow furrowed as the demonic aura of the demons behind him coalesced into ominous black clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Demon Prince! Master Gu is willing to have a contest with you, that's how much he regards you!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>"I, Lu Yuan, may be untalented, but after following Master for months I've made some small progress!"</p><p></p><p>"You, Moon Demon, killed my fellow disciples. Dare you cross moves with me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was Gu Jiuqing's junior brother, while the Moon Demon was the Eighth Prince's junior brother.  </p><p></p><p>If the junior brother was powerful, the senior brother must be even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was highlighting Gu Jiuqing's might, to secure him a chance to contest the Eighth Prince.</p><p></p><p>The blood moon under the Moon Demon's feet dimmed into a regular full moon.</p><p></p><p>As an exalted Moon Demon, he was more special than ordinary demons.</p><p></p><p>Even the Eighth Prince wouldn't insult him so brazenly!</p><p></p><p>This little human was being so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>And he was just an Unbounded cultivator of the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>Die!</p><p></p><p>The moonlight poured down as the moon shifted positions, instantly appearing under Lu Yuan's feet.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Moon Demon's figure vanished!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's expression changed as his spiritual consciousness contacted the Wood of Establishment, his mind tugging at the spiritual fruit of the Chaotic Eight Forms.</p><p></p><p>That spiritual fruit instantly disappeared from the Unbounded Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Eight Forms! Great Wind Form!"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Eight Forms had eight total forms - Lu Yuan had only mastered the foundational Great Wind Form.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wind Form!</p><p></p><p>One of the four initiating forms along with Great Thunder, Great Mountain and Great Marsh. It was the most basic.</p><p></p><p>The great wind arises!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual chaos inverted!</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind scattered the moonlight. The moon that had just formed under his feet was blown away.</p><p></p><p>Raging winds howled around him. The surrounding moonlight ripples and the moon under his feet dissipated. A figure suddenly appeared behind Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon like hooks!</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon's hands curved like crescent moons, clutching at Lu Yuan's throat.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wind Form, wind extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>As the wind arose, the moonlight moved.</p><p></p><p>As the wind fell, the moonlight gathered.</p><p></p><p>The howling dispersed, but before the Moon Demon's hooked hands could clench, his figure was blasted back dozens of li before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight poured down like water as silence fell.</p><p></p><p>A faint whisper of wind arose within him.</p><p></p><p>"Whooosh——————"</p><p></p><p>It blew at his spirit apertures, making them all tremble.</p><p></p><p>With each tremor of an aperture, the Moon Demon's figure shook violently.</p><p></p><p>After 365 apertures shook, the Moon Demon's figure shattered, his lunar aura crumbling as he teetered on the brink of collapse.</p><p></p><p>But his immense spiritual power allowed him to barely withstand this "wind extinguishing" of his apertures.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Prince's gaze sharpened as he looked from Lu Yuan to the Moon Demon's battered form, giving an ominous smile.</p><p></p><p>"So you received the inheritance of the Eight Trigrams Elder. No wonder it took you so long to emerge from the Eight Trigrams Ridge."</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan entered the Eight Trigrams Ridge, the Eighth Prince had already laid an ambush at the first mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you who planted the seven-cycled spirit-nurturing grand medicinal herb in the cave abode of that ridge's master!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing understood the whole situation now.</p><p></p><p>The demons had used the seven-cycled spirit herb as bait to lure the Xingchen and Sword Sect disciples here to be slaughtered!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jun Wushang seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Gu, were disciples of my Xingchen Pavilion killed as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers Tian Yue and Bo Qingshan, along with seventy other elite Xingchen disciples and thirty of my Sword Sect brothers, all fell at the first peak of the Eight Trigrams Ridge's forbidden area!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing revealed this.</p><p></p><p>"After emerging from the Eight Trigrams Ridge's forbidden area, we..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"When I arrived, I sensed demonic aura, so I wanted to borrow the two divine weapons under the Primordial Moon Tree to subdue the demons. That's why I flew to the other side of the moon," Gu Jiuqing said with an apologetic look.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his arrival, those three Star Palace disciples wouldn't have died!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang's expression changed again and again. The scholarly cultivator, holding an exquisite pagoda treasure, glared at the Eighth Demonic Prince. </p><p></p><p>He didn't utter harsh words, nor did he flee. Standing in the void, he unleashed his full power!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan shouldered the Taiyi Divine Sword, standing with his hands at his sides. "Did you see that? My strength is not even one-tenth of my senior brother's. Eighth Demonic Prince, do you dare fight my master now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan inwardly lamented. </p><p></p><p>"Master, this Inverse Chaos Eight Styles actually requires so much spiritual power? Why didn't you tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you didn't ask either."</p><p></p><p>"The Inverse Chaos Eight Styles is my Eight Manifestations Ancestor's famous divine ability. When the eight styles unite, they can slay beings of the Pure Yang realm."  </p><p></p><p>"With your meager spiritual power, you haven't even opened your celestial apertures. If I didn't lend you a hand just now, you would have died long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I was just wondering how I almost killed a Refining God demon. Turns out you intervened, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, so now you call me Master? Just now you called me 'old thing' left and right."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you must have misheard."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the Primordial Moon Tree, this ancient divine tree connected to the starry void. </p><p></p><p>Demonic air pervaded, spanning the Azure Void.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's gaze fell on Gu Jiuqing, the first time he examined this Sword Sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>Utterly ordinary!</p><p></p><p>At most an Immortal Realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>To compare spiritual power?  </p><p></p><p>Where did he get such confidence?</p><p></p><p>The aura around the Eighth Demonic Prince grew faint. The celestial palaces atop his Elixir Realm closed their celestial gates, the celestial platforms dimmed, Mount Buzhou and Jianmu lost their divine radiance.</p><p></p><p>Within his dantian, seven zhang and two chi of spiritual power surged, forming a Nine Revolutions Natal Pill!</p><p></p><p>The natal pill flew out of his dantian, hovering before the Eighth Demonic Prince.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly spinning Nine Revolutions Natal Pill emanated black rays of light.</p><p></p><p>"This prince will compare with you!"</p><p></p><p>As the Eighth Demonic Prince spoke, the demons trembled!</p><p></p><p>It seemed this time, the Eighth Demonic Prince was going all out again.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Demon King flew back from ten li away, its aura withered as it absorbed the moon's radiance.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, be careful and don't be rash!" </p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang had already noticed this Sword Sect elder's hidden power. </p><p></p><p>He cautioned.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded seriously. "Junior Brother will go all out!"</p><p></p><p>A wisp of spiritual power flew out of his dantian and hovered before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>It was still that same wisp from before.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince frowned. This human!</p><p></p><p>Was he just putting on a front?</p><p></p><p>Or was he feigning madness?</p><p></p><p>In a spiritual power comparison, natal pills reigned supreme. A mere wisp would shatter upon contact.</p><p></p><p>And now this human wanted to use a wisp to fight his Nine Revolutions Natal Pill?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that just courting death?</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince snorted coldly. These humans just loved beating around the bush.</p><p></p><p>He was about to attack!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made his move.</p><p></p><p>That wisp of natal pill, about the size of a strand of hair, slashed through the sky toward the Eighth Demonic Prince's Nine Revolutions Natal Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Come on!" </p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince showed delight.</p><p></p><p>He was the eighth son of the Demonic Emperor, his talents far inferior to the Seventh Demonic Prince's.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Seventh Demonic Prince was dead.  </p><p></p><p>To avenge him, they had joined forces to ascend to the moon and slaughter the Sword Sect disciples, never expecting Star Palace disciples to be there too.</p><p></p><p>They took the opportunity to subdue them as well!</p><p></p><p>The Star Palace disciples' spiritual power was unmatched, the Sword Sect's swordsmanship supreme.</p><p></p><p>He had long dwelled in the demonic den, with few chances to fight humans.</p><p></p><p>To surpass his several older brothers, he had to keep tempering himself.</p><p></p><p>But the great sect disciples who came to the moon this time were too weak in cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Even that Sword Sect's Drunken Sword Immortal was subdued by him after seventy moves.</p><p></p><p>Let me see what's so special about this Sword Sect disciple!</p><p></p><p>The Nine Revolutions Natal Pill separated into a thousand arms, one of which stretched up in a posture of propping up the heavens.</p><p></p><p>That strand of hair-sized natal pill then descended onto the palm of this spiritual arm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's mind stirred. The hair-sized natal pill wanted to split, but his spiritual power was already depleted!</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when he manifested the spiritual illusion, he had expended all the spiritual power from his Three Myriad Wondrous Paths.</p><p></p><p>Only this strand of natal pill's power remained!</p><p></p><p>This strand of natal pill's power had been tempered by thirty thousand dragon-elephant hammers, condensed to the limit. Even Gu Jiuqing couldn't separate it!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince noticed the anomaly. This hair-sized strand of power descended onto his palm.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual arm collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Some skill, but not much!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining 999 spiritual arms propped up the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the vast expanse, arm after arm swayed, each three to four meters long, raised high just to bear this strand of hair-sized natal pill!</p><p></p><p>Crack! </p><p></p><p>Crack!!</p><p></p><p>Sounds of shattering rang out incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The rippling strand of hair, the descending natal pill - no fancy moves, just this one strike weighing down the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>More and more spiritual arms collapsed under the pressure. Finally, the Eighth Demonic Prince felt a hint of strain.</p><p></p><p>"It's just condensing spiritual power to the extreme, what's so amazing about that?"</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince retracted the spiritual arms, leaving 800 that converged into the shape of a natal pill, now only 80% of its original size.  </p><p></p><p>The natal pill shrank several times, shrinking to just thumb-sized.</p><p></p><p>The thumb-sized spinning natal pill charged at Gu Jiuqing's strand of hair natal pill!</p><p></p><p>Crack——</p><p></p><p>Still that shattering sound.</p><p></p><p>A weighty force descended from the heavens, shattering the Nine Revolutions Natal Pill!!</p><p></p><p>The strand of hair natal pill lightly dropped from above, shattering the natal pill!</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?!"</p><p></p><p>The shattered natal pill's spiritual power dissipated.  </p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince stared at this strand of hair in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Only now did he finally see the true nature of this wisp of power.</p><p></p><p>It was a natal pill, just extremely small, and not even round in shape.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it couldn't be hammered into a sphere after being struck by the dragon-elephant hammers.</p><p></p><p>With the natal pill shattered, the Eighth Demonic Prince felt his fleshly body sink, his dantian impacted, his blood and qi shaken throughout, his flesh suffering unprecedented trauma!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! This can't be!"</p><p></p><p>He lost?</p><p></p><p>He actually lost to an unknown human?</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang couldn't defeat him, the Sword Sect's Sword Immortal couldn't defeat him, yet he lost to this Sword Sect disciple?</p><p></p><p>That weighty force still pressed down from above as the strand of hair natal pill descended toward him!!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Eighth Demonic Prince opened Mount Buzhou, Jianmu, the Celestial Platform, the 365 celestial apertures, and all the celestial palaces.  </p><p></p><p>But this took time!</p><p></p><p>The strand of hair natal pill dropped down, striking the Eighth Demonic Prince's head!</p><p></p><p>Its speed increased several fold.</p><p></p><p>Mount Buzhou shook, its primal source replenishing the mountain. Jianmu pierced the heavens, regaining its glory. Divine fruits glowed brilliantly from each celestial aperture!</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince regained Mount Buzhou's strength.</p><p></p><p>But the strand of hair natal pill had already struck his head.</p><p></p><p>Splatter——————</p><p></p><p>His head exploded.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's head instantly burst apart, five celestial palaces flying out of the shattered skull.  </p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble——————</p><p></p><p>On the Eighth Demonic Prince's Mount Buzhou, the primal source flowed, flushing his entire body.</p><p></p><p>All 365 celestial apertures opened!!</p><p></p><p>Rays of divine light radiated. After shattering his head, the strand of hair natal pill reached his nape, colliding with the 34th vertebra - the location of the Celestial Platform!</p><p></p><p>Rumble——————  </p><p></p><p>The celestial apertures converged, divine light rippling, flushing that vertebra into the Celestial Platform!!</p><p></p><p>The strand of hair natal pill descended, resting atop the Celestial Platform, like a strand of hair falling to the ground, without causing any ripples.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>A sigh rang out as Gu Jiuqing looked at the Eighth Demonic Prince with regret.</p><p></p><p>He was so close to subduing a Celestial Palace demon prince while in the Spiritual Power Realm!</p><p></p><p>But at the last moment, the Eighth Demonic Prince broke his own seals, returning to the Celestial Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I've won this battle of spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Jun, why don't you leave now?"</p><p></p><p>Leave?</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang still hadn't reacted.</p><p></p><p>He had expected the fight with the Eighth Demonic Prince to have some fancy moves, not just the simplest collision!</p><p></p><p>A strand of hair's spiritual power suppressing the Eighth Demonic Prince??</p><p></p><p>Junior Brother Gu's strength was astonishingly formidable!</p><p></p><p>Jun Wushang knew staying would only burden Gu Jiuqing, so without hesitation he turned and flew away from the Primordial Moon Tree, heading toward the direction of the starry beast.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, this prince actually almost died by your hand!!"</p><p></p><p>A gloomy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's figure re-formed.  </p><p></p><p>He was enraged!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing actually felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Since Jun Wushang had finally left, he no longer needed to hold back...</p>

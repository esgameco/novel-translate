            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Blue Star, the moon.</p><p></p><p>A large formation covered the lunar crater. The primordial lunar essence formation outlined the essence of heaven and earth, attracting the radiance of the stars which transformed into lunar essence and merged into the star gathering formation and star refining formation within this great formation. </p><p></p><p>Blue Star had set up four great formations!</p><p></p><p>The first formation was three hundred meters wide, the second a few hundred meters, the third three kilometers, and the fourth ten kilometers wide. </p><p></p><p>All four formations had already been activated!</p><p></p><p>The first and second formations were recapturing the great stars. </p><p></p><p>While the third and fourth formations had already captured two great stars, which were flying towards the moon. Along the way, they were being refined into divine weapons. Soon, these two great stars would condense into stardust pearls.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure appeared at the lunar research base. </p><p></p><p>The people at the lunar research base had seen Gu Jiuqing before, he could come and go freely.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Jiuqing entered the research base, someone quickly came to contact him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu! You've finally appeared!"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader of Linji City stood before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the martial arts leader's cultivation level was much higher than before, having completed the fifth blood condensation!</p><p></p><p>Fast!</p><p></p><p>Too fast!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was shocked by the martial arts leader's cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Having completed the fifteenth node of the Golden Crow Inner Source and five blood condensations, in the martial realm defined by Gu Jiuqing for the Blue Star, this was the Earthly Immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>"Something is strange!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had not appeared on the Blue Star for a long time. The last time, after taking away the Valley Star and Creation Star, he left the moon and entered the Primordial Chaos, completely disregarding the Earth.</p><p></p><p>Such a cultivation speed would be considered the pinnacle even in the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader looked at Gu Jiuqing excitedly, "Master Gu, there have been changes in the Dragon Nation during your absence."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What changes?"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader pointed towards the huge azure star in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"An interdimensional portal has appeared in Linji City!"</p><p></p><p>An interdimensional portal?</p><p></p><p>Appearing in Linji City?</p><p></p><p>"This interdimensional portal just appeared, and the space is still chaotic and unable to be entered. But from the spatial cracks, a massive amount of spiritual qi is gushing in!"</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual qi value within Linji City has exceeded fifty!"</p><p></p><p>Such a value was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had channeled two spiritual veins into Linji City, causing its spiritual qi value to reach only twenty to thirty. But the spiritual qi flowing out from the spatial cracks had actually caused Linji City's spiritual qi value to exceed fifty!</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of world existed behind this "portal" for it to contain such an immense amount of spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>The massive influx of spiritual qi into the Blue Star meant the overall aptitudes of the Blue Star people surpassed even those of the Primordial Chaos!</p><p></p><p>From the few times Gu Jiuqing had guided the Blue Star people's cultivations, he had concluded that the Blue Star people's aptitudes were generally higher than those of the Primordial Chaos races.</p><p></p><p>He did not know why this was the case.</p><p></p><p>But for him, it was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"The higher-ups of the Dragon Nation and the four major cities are discussing this matter. Master Gu, when will you have time to spare?"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader looked at Gu Jiuqing cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic World and Bizarre World had already greatly impacted the Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>But it was nothing compared to the shock of the interdimensional portal that had opened in Linji City.</p><p></p><p>What kind of terrifying beings would emerge from a world with such dense spiritual qi?</p><p></p><p>They could only seek help from Gu Jiuqing, this Martial Ancestor, this God, to aid them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled but did not reply.</p><p></p><p>When would he have time?</p><p></p><p>His identity on the Blue Star was that of a God. Why should a God answer mortals' questions?</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Gu Jiuqing also did not know how to deal with this other world.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic World and Bizarre World were clearly lower-level worlds, while the world that appeared in Linji City might even be higher-level than the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"This time I've come to the moon hoping you can set up more formations here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out the cosmic bag given to him by Da Kou.</p><p></p><p>"There are divine metal materials for thirty formation sets inside. Set up the formations on the moon as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The martial arts leader was a bit disappointed. </p><p></p><p>He had thought this God would give a definite answer.</p><p></p><p>But then again, the matters he spoke of were trivial in the eyes of this God.</p><p></p><p>Until now, they still did not know the full capabilities of this God!</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, in their hearts, Gu Jiuqing was an invincible existence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the azure-colored star!</p><p></p><p>This star was his future garden. If the Blue Star really had problems, how would Gu Jiuqing continue his cultivation in the future?</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would have to find time to deal with the interdimensional portal in Linji City.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, after some time, I will enter the Blue Star and personally visit the interdimensional portal in Shennongjia."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the martial arts leader immediately understood!</p><p></p><p>This God was going to explore other worlds.</p><p></p><p>He nodded repeatedly, "Then please notify us in advance, Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>"Mmm."</p><p></p><p>After waiting another two to three days on the moon and the third and fourth formations still had not absorbed the stars, Gu Jiuqing did not wait any longer.  </p><p></p><p>Two divine weapons could not resolve his current crisis.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Force Bodhisattva Guangping is a pure Yang Elder Immortal. Even if I could shamelessly absorb the Blue Star people's cultivations and insights right now, I would still not be his match!"</p><p></p><p>"So I can only use wisdom to prevail!"</p><p></p><p>Or wait for news from Senior Martial Brother Liangxiao.</p><p></p><p>At the Ancient Mountain.</p><p></p><p>On the cliff edge, Lu Yuan had already put away the Taiyi Divine Metal into his cosmic bag.</p><p></p><p>He was now recording the events that had occurred at the Ancient Mountain with pen and paper.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple! You should cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget about the Great Wind Clan. You're following that stubborn one, I won't bother you about it. But you still need to make your mark. You've seen the talents in the Great Wind Clan, there are several Refining God realm cultivators. Besides kissing that stubborn one's ass, what else can you do?"</p><p></p><p>"Now whenever that stubborn one enters the Primordial Chaos, he encounters attacks from one-bodied experts. What if he encounters two-bodied or even three-bodied powerful enemies in the future? How will you handle it then?"</p><p></p><p>"Can you only watch from the sidelines?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder Immortal was disappointed that his disciple was not living up to his potential.</p><p></p><p>Why did he have to choose this...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with being a disciple like that? I just need to cheer for my senior martial brother, and he will definitely become a deity in the future and reorganize the Heavenly Court."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you don't need to keep harping on it. In a couple of days, I'll find a good place to cultivate again."</p><p></p><p>Although Luyuan was worried that Dafengshi would take away his position in Gu Jiuqing's heart, he thought it over and over again. If that was really the case, there was nothing he could do about it. His natural talents were average, and even with the help of the Eight Trigrams Venerable One, increasing his cultivation level was not something that could be done in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>With a move from Luyuan, the surrounding void rippled, and layer upon layer of prohibitions were torn apart. Down below! The void prohibitions were broken open, and a figure appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sacred sounds reverberated, shaking heaven and earth. A Bodhisattva pinched the lotus mudra with his fingers, breaking through the prohibitions one by one. He was panting heavily, and the naked woman crouching on the golden lotus beneath his feet was also gasping for breath.</p><p></p><p>"So you were here all along!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping showed a delighted expression. He had finally found these two bugs. But where was the other little bug?</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping used both hands to break through the prohibitions. The divine power within him flowed, propelling him forward dozens of meters. It wouldn't take long for him to set foot on the cliff.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable One was anxious. "Where's Stubborn Head? Why hasn't Stubborn Head come out yet?"</p><p></p><p>"This old man alone cannot stop this Pure Yang Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Luyuan remained calm. "Just wait, my senior martial brother will appear soon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, and two great scourges were sitting cross-legged beside him. Now, these two great scourges had recovered quite a bit of their blood essence, and their physical bodies were no longer as withered as before. If they walked on the street, they would not attract too much attention.</p><p></p><p>They looked similar to ordinary old men. The first great scourge was tall and thin, with a hooked nose, while the second great scourge was also tall and thin, with ears that seemed to catch the wind. The two great scourges were easily distinguishable, although they looked somewhat alike.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't made a move?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing deliberately brought out the Sword Sect's aura, hoping to provoke these two great scourges into attacking him. As long as the great scourges attacked him, Gu Jiuqing would have a reason to subdue and kill them!</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect Venerable must know about these two great scourges. But they don't know that the Sword Sect Venerable is already dead. With the supreme patriarchs of the Four Great Sects' personalities, if they encounter these scourges, they will definitely attack and slay them!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme patriarchs of the Four Great Sects were all people who cared about the world. Otherwise, they would not have established great sects in the four dangerous regions to shelter the human race.</p><p></p><p>If these scourges left Mount Tiangu and were invited to join the Sword Sect, they would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>So when would they make their move?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was not in a hurry and continued to wait.</p><p></p><p>A tremor came from Mount Buxiou, where the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda was shaking. This treasure pagoda was refined from the Eight Trigrams Venerable One's physical body, spiritual soul, and divine power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this pagoda was trembling slightly. The Eight Trigrams Venerable One was using the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda to convey his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping is here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood up! And as he stood up, the two people beside him reacted.</p><p></p><p>The first and second great scourges opened their eyes, and streams of energy intertwined, rippling within the ancient divine mirror!</p><p></p><p>The second great scourge's killing intent flared up, and he was about to attack.</p><p></p><p>Brother!</p><p></p><p>Is this the time?</p><p></p><p>"Open your minds, and I'll lead you out of here!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The killing intent that had just arisen in the two great scourges instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Is this person really capable of leaving this place?"</p><p></p><p>That's impossible. They had been trapped here for thousands of years. Even using great divine weapons to bombard the place couldn't shatter this wall!</p><p></p><p>But they still harbored a glimmer of hope! They quickly opened their minds, and a strange aura enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>The two great scourges' figures became blurred.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual souls roamed freely, their physical bodies wandering!</p><p></p><p>Roaming the vast cosmos unseen, traversing the stars and galaxies in a thought.</p><p></p><p>Roaming freely once more!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The void shattered, and layer upon layer of prohibitions were torn apart. The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping stood at the edge of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>He looked curiously at the world around him.</p><p></p><p>This realm had no prohibitions at all!</p><p></p><p>He relaxed a bit, letting his Pure Yang thoughts flow and envelop the surrounding universe, but he still couldn't find the future Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Where did the future Buddha go?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping stared at Luyuan, his voice carrying a hint of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>More and more naked women flew out from the golden lotuses, enveloping Luyuan's body.</p><p></p><p>His figure was tightly pressed against the women.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a test of my loyalty to my senior martial brother?"</p><p></p><p>Luyuan was tempted.</p><p></p><p>Who could resist such a temptation?</p><p></p><p>In the Blissful Realm, he had been seduced by the world of flowers and became a human emperor, enjoying seventy-two palaces.</p><p></p><p>"Traitor, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly guard your Yang essence! If you leak your Yang essence, your entire essence, energy, and spirit will dissipate in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable One's voice startled Luyuan, who immediately guarded his mind and silently recited the Pure Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? It seems there's another spiritual soul within you?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the future Buddha's?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping extended his hand, about to attack Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, ripples appeared on the wall behind him, and three figures instantly emerged!</p><p></p><p>As soon as these three figures appeared, one of them shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, these two are the First Great Scourge and the Second Great Scourge!"</p><p></p><p>The First Great Scourge and the Second Great Scourge were taken aback, and even the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping was drawn in by Gu Jiuqing's voice.</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping!</p><p></p><p>He was a Bodhisattva of the Buddhist tradition, but he emerged after the Primordial Chaos period when the great scourges appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist tradition was established after the Primordial Chaos period, but the Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping had heard of the great scourges' names.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So you found help!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Strength Bodhisattva Guangping instantly realized why the future Buddha had questioned coming to Mount Tiangu.</p><p></p><p>He had come to Mount Tiangu to gather reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>But it was a pity!</p><p></p><p>He was a Pure Yang Venerable, and the First Great Scourge and the Second Great Scourge from the Primordial Chaos period were not a match for him, even together.</p><p></p><p>"Future Buddha, let me, a Buddhist, shatter your hopes!"</p><p></p><p>Guang...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva waved his hand, emanating pure yang energy. Golden lotuses emerged from the ground, celestial flowers rained down chaotically, tinged with a hint of the pure yang aura, instantly vanishing into the void. </p><p></p><p>The first and second great villains' faces changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>This was an elder of the Sword Sect?  </p><p></p><p>Has he gone mad?</p><p></p><p>This is a Bodhisattva!</p><p></p><p>A living Bodhisattva!</p><p></p><p>A pure yang ancient ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect has such a Bodhisattva suppressing them?</p><p></p><p>But wait, doesn't the Sword Sect need their treasures?</p><p></p><p>Why did he attack with lethal force as soon as he appeared?</p><p></p><p>The first great villain retreated continuously, while the second great villain's body swelled dozens of times, transforming into a small giant.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens collapsing!"</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer of the void cracked, blocking the celestial flowers and golden lotuses in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens sinking!" </p><p></p><p>Under the shattering void, the golden lotuses and celestial flowers disappeared one by one. The second great villain opened his mouth, from which more golden lotuses and celestial flowers emerged.</p><p></p><p>He devoured the Buddhist dharma, transforming it into his own powers. His withered dantian instantly stirred, as if revived.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling!!</p><p></p><p>The myriad wondrous paths reappeared, power flowed, the lands outside Tiangu Mountain shook, forming a swallowing image as countless celestial and earthly spiritual energies flew towards the second great villain.</p><p></p><p>Buzhou Mountain shook, primal ripples emerged, the divine tree pierced the heavens, the immortal terrace shone brilliantly, even the Niunan Palace reopened, with shriveled primordial spirits walking out from its celestial palaces, converging into a single primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>The myriad celestial acupoints summoned starlight, attracting boundless starlight!</p><p></p><p>The second great villain let out a roar, innumerable divine lights flickered, his divine body instantly matured, layer upon layer of realms perfected, he regained several degrees of his strength.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva saw this and shook his head, "Weak, so weak!"</p><p></p><p>A celestial being who had transcended eight tribulations, only retaining three-tenths of his power.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>His primordial spirit emerged, his pure yang primordial spirit transformed into a flying sword, spanning the vast sky. His primordial spirit, like a refined celestial golden man, pierced through the void, slashing and extinguishing the second great villain's newly converged single primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>The boundless radiance vanished, the second great villain died!</p><p></p><p>The second great villain died too quickly!</p><p></p><p>It had only been a breath since he absorbed the celestial starlight and recovered his realms.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful being could not withstand even one strike from Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>The first great villain retreated to the wall, nearly retreating back into the mirror space.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said, "It's a misunderstanding, all a misunderstanding. This Bodhisattva must have made a mistake."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Bodhisattva smiled faintly,</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's a mistake or not doesn't matter!"</p><p></p><p>The first great villain frowned, then opened his mouth to devour the second great villain's corpse, divine lights shining forth from his body one by one.</p><p></p><p>This villain who had dominated the Primordial Chaos era revealed his true power!</p><p></p><p>Pure yang!</p><p></p><p>A pure yang aura manifested around him.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation realm was clearly much higher than the second great villain's.</p><p></p><p>At his peak, the second great villain was an eight-tribulation celestial being, while the first great villain was a nine-tribulation celestial being at his peak.</p><p></p><p>The majestic aura of the ninth tribulation descended, his primordial spirit transformed into a great dragon, instantly piercing through the void, intending to escape the celestial realm and devour the thunder force within the nine celestial bafang layers.</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist anymore, even if you recover your peak strength, you can only withstand three strikes before me!"</p><p></p><p>This was the current power of Guangping Dali Bodhisattva after splitting himself in two.</p><p></p><p>Three strikes to subdue a nine-tribulation celestial being.</p><p></p><p>"Tathagata Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva struck, a palm sweeping across the sky, an enormous handprint descended from beyond the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The nine celestial bafang layers shook, opening a huge hole, boundless divine radiance scattered, the sunlight fell upon Tiangu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As the Tathagata Divine Palm descended, the golden dragon primordial spirit flickered and was suppressed into fragments.</p><p></p><p>The first great villain spat out fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>The aura he had just emanated withered!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly acted, extending a finger to tap the first great villain's crown, planting the seed of the Great Name Palace Sword Intent within the first great villain's niunan palace.</p><p></p><p>Once this seed sprouted, it would subdue and kill the first great villain!</p><p></p><p>After completing this, Gu Jiuqing withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>He looked solemnly at Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"What's this? Have you given up resisting?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you unleash that other true form of yours?"</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva seemed to regard Gu Jiuqing's future Dao body as the true form of a future Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand thoughts reconstituted the divine soul within the niunan palace!</p><p></p><p>The dragon-elephant celestial emperor's soul stirred, and the pangu celestial spirit within Buzhou Mountain also moved.</p><p></p><p>The primal divine abilities manifested at this moment!</p><p></p><p>This was the third primal divine ability displayed by Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Wandering freely, the art of transforming into a rainbow, and now the deadly curse!</p><p></p><p>The golden crow divine body possessed the deadly curse ability, channeling sunlight to cast curses, igniting divine flames within the target to burn them to death.</p><p></p><p>But this divine ability clearly could not kill Guangping Dali Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Therefore!!</p><p></p><p>He needed to use other means!</p><p></p><p>Guangping Dali Bodhisattva's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to sense something, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight fell upon Tiangu Mountain, Gu Jiuqing stood at the cliff's edge, his eyes snapping open!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The mirror flower water moon also blossomed.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the mirror flower water moon was aimed at the abyss below.</p><p></p><p>The void trembled, the ancient aura emerged once more from below!

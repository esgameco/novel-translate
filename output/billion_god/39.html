        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Time passed day by day. This was Gu Jiuqing's last period of time staying at home. </p><p></p><p>Elder Liangxiao went to the Great Wilderness to hunt demons, which would take some time. The Sword Sect was also constructing a true transmission island for Gu Jiuqing, which also required time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing calculated the time, he had already stayed in the Ancient City of Tianyuan for seven days. </p><p></p><p>During these few days, the Northern Region was quite peaceful, except for Gu Jiuqing joining the Sword Sect and obtaining the true transmission.</p><p></p><p>The news of Si Wuxie joining the true transmission of the Sword Sect was also spread in the Northern Region.</p><p></p><p>However, Si Wuxie's origins were somewhat mysterious, as he was not a youth from the thirteen cities of the Northern Region, but came from the Great Zhou instead.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, Young Master! There is huge news from the Great Zhou."</p><p></p><p>The butler Xie rushed into the main hall in a panic, accompanied by Luoshen.</p><p></p><p>Luoshen had an impressive figure, and as soon as she entered the hall, she caught Gu Jiuqing's attention.</p><p></p><p>"An ancient relic has appeared in the Great Zhou, suspected to be an excavated ancient relic from tens of thousands of years ago. Many disciples from prestigious families in the Northern Region have gone to the Great Zhou to explore the relic."</p><p></p><p>After learning about this, Gu Jiuqing did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>He was still too weak now and could not compete with those talents even if he knew about the emergence of an ancient relic.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that a celestial palace has been excavated from the ancient relic!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the celestial palace realm from the ancient era!"</p><p></p><p>The butler Xie spoke excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This was an event that had occurred in the Great Zhou a few days ago, and the news had been delayed in reaching the Northern Region.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the ancient cultivator in that celestial palace was a celestial soldier from the heavenly court tens of thousands of years ago!"</p><p></p><p>An ancient celestial soldier?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was shocked!</p><p></p><p>He had read many ancient books and learned about the ancient heavenly court from a scripture.</p><p></p><p>Roughly tens of thousands of years ago, the heavens and the earth were unified under the rule of the heavenly court. However, a great calamity suddenly occurred, and the ancient heavenly court fell to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Great Zhou began to unify the Great Wilderness, with the four major sects assisting the Great Zhou in governing the people.</p><p></p><p>Most ancient relics were remnants from the ancient era of the heavenly court.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, many ancient relics had emerged, but this was the first time a celestial palace with an ancient celestial soldier had been excavated.</p><p></p><p>"That is not a relic from the fallen ancient heavenly court, but just an ordinary ancient relic. However, for the celestial palace of this ancient celestial soldier to have been preserved for so many years, it seems that this celestial soldier's strength was among the pinnacle in the ancient heavenly court!"</p><p></p><p>Luoshen explained.</p><p></p><p>Above the Refining Immortal realm was the Celestial Palace realm, comprehending the heavens and the earth, understanding yin and yang, connecting the Buzhou Mountain and the Nilian Palace, separating the yin and yang energies, and condensing a celestial palace within the Nilian Palace.</p><p></p><p>This was the dwelling place of the Primordial Spirit!</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Spirit was the ultimate achievement of cultivation, containing the Dao of divine abilities and the principles of the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>With the excavation of the ancient celestial soldier's celestial palace, they might be able to find the ancient celestial soldier's cultivation method through the celestial palace, or even discover the ancient celestial soldier's memories and uncover the information about the fall of the ancient heavenly court!</p><p></p><p>"Young Lord, this emergence of an ancient relic has piqued my interest as well."</p><p></p><p>"I have disturbed your family's hospitality for these few days."</p><p></p><p>Luoshen left!</p><p></p><p>She left very decisively.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Luoshen depart, the butler Xie breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although Luoshen appeared delicate, her strength was undoubtedly above the butler Xie's.</p><p></p><p>A day later, more news came from the Great Zhou to the Northern Region.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient celestial soldier's celestial palace has been opened. Ancient prestigious families and even the Great Zhou royal family have entered the celestial palace, seeking the ancient true transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Students from the Jixia Academy have been mobilized. It is said that a few students from the Jixia Academy died before they could open the secret realm of the ancient celestial soldier's celestial palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone discovered an ancient divine weapon in the celestial palace, which was the exclusive divine weapon of this ancient celestial soldier, but it has already decayed."</p><p></p><p>"A Sword Immortal from the Sword Sect has entered the celestial palace!"</p><p></p><p>"An ascetic monk from the Buddhist Sect has entered the Great Zhou from the Small Western Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"They've gone mad! Disciples from the Taoist Sect have also come down from the mountains."</p><p></p><p>This emergence of an ancient relic has alarmed the three major sects of the Sword Sect, Buddhist Sect, and Taoist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Disciples from the three sects have all entered the Great Zhou, hoping to take advantage of this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, all of this had nothing to do with Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day, the eleventh day since Gu Jiuqing entered the Ancient City of Tianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>New news once again spread to the Northern Lands. </p><p></p><p>"A peach has appeared within the Heavenly Palace Secret Realm of Gu Tianbing!"</p><p></p><p>This matter shook the Great Wilderness, and even the Xingchen Pavilion, the last major sect, emerged.</p><p></p><p>The peach, that was said to be a sacred object from the Heavenly Court in legends, had actually appeared in this era. </p><p></p><p>"The peach appeared briefly like an ephemeral blossom, leaving behind only a peach pit!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciples of the major sects moved into action, and the Heavenly Palace Secret Realm was destroyed. Gu Tianbing's remains were shattered, and an enormous tomb appeared within the ancient ruins!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The news coming from the Great Zhou kept shocking the Northern Lands. </p><p></p><p>Within the thirteen ancient cities, many young cultivators set off, heading to the Great Zhou in search of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Gu Jiuqing was also preparing to depart for the Sword Gate, but early in the morning, Steward Xie came looking for him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, another letter has arrived from the Young Lady."  </p><p></p><p>A letter from Elder Sister?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the sealed letter. This letter was slightly bulging, indicating there was something else inside besides the letter itself.</p><p></p><p>"Besides this letter, is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie shook his head. "Only this letter."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, please read the letter sent by the Young Lady first. This old servant will go prepare your luggage."</p><p></p><p>Today was the day Gu Jiuqing was set to depart for the Sword Gate. </p><p></p><p>After Steward Xie left, only Gu Jiuqing remained in the room. He opened the letter and saw Gu Linglong's handwriting.</p><p></p><p>[Is that lover deeply favored by younger brother? These past few days, elder sister has been thinking it over and feels there is something amiss.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>[If younger brother can subdue this person, elder sister has nothing to say. But this sister-friend of mine has a flirtatious nature, and I can't help feeling she may cause trouble for younger brother in the future. During this time, elder sister has gotten to know another sister-friend. After some time passes, elder sister will introduce this friend to you.]  </p><p></p><p>[This lover hails from a major sect and has an even better reputation than the Four Fairy titles of the Northern Lands. She is deeply favored by elder sister, and I think younger brother will also take a liking to her. I'll say no more, as elder sister has matters to attend to. Oh, there is also a peach pit inside the letter. Elder sister purchased this peach pit from a merchant. It is said that planting this pit will grow a spiritual peach tree.]</p><p></p><p>[Why don't you find a place to bury the pit? I hope the next time elder sister returns home, I can see the peach tree growing.]</p><p></p><p>There was not much content in this letter, mostly about elder sister wanting to introduce another partner to Gu Jiuqing. Besides that, there was this peach pit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing tore open the envelope, and a peach pit fell out. This pit was slightly smaller than a regular peach pit, but the patterns on its surface were more intricate. The lines seemed to have been carefully carved, swirling in strange directions.</p><p></p><p>Holding it in his palm, a refreshing coolness washed over him, instantly calming his spiritual sense, as if celestial music was ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing released the pit, that strange feeling disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this peach pit really can grow spiritual fruit."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not plan to plant it in the courtyard, since he was about to leave for the Sword Gate. Planting it on his own inherited island would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing burned the letter and was about to go find Steward Xie when he overheard a conversation between two guards at the manor that made him pause.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Maiden of the Xingchen Pavilion was traveling through the Great Zhou. I heard that after this Holy Maiden entered the ancient ruins, she disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"What? The Holy Maiden of the Xingchen Pavilion disappeared in the ancient ruins?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xingchen Pavilion was enraged. Several of their elders emerged and entered the Great Zhou. This matter has spread throughout the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>"I also heard that the Xingchen Pavilion's Holy Maiden was struck from behind. Someone saw a figure in black robes carrying the Holy Maiden appear within the ancient ruins."</p><p></p><p>A strange look appeared on Gu Jiuqing's face.</p><p></p><p>A peach pit?</p><p></p><p>The Holy Maiden of a major sect?</p><p></p><p>This seems...familiar somehow.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be, could it?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's hand holding the peach pit trembled, and he put the pit away in his qiankun bag before leaving and heading towards the rear gate of the manor.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendation tickets, donations, monthly tickets, and readers to follow!</p><p></p><p>Begging on my knees!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

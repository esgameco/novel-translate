        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>When the Daoist cultivator Cunyin left seclusion, it also resolved Gu Jiuqing's two biggest problems at present. </p><p></p><p>There are three methods to cultivate inner power.</p><p></p><p>The first is to consolidate the foundation and cultivate the primordial essence. When the essence is full, it will overflow.</p><p></p><p>The second is to refine an inner power pill!</p><p></p><p>The third is to capture the innate attributes and infuse them into the dantian, dispersing the innate attributes to form the first strand of inner power.</p><p></p><p>After returning from Senior Brother Liangxiao's abode, Gu Jiuqing had already made up his mind. </p><p></p><p>Of the three methods to cultivate inner power, consolidating the foundation and cultivating primordial essence is the most stable and least likely to fail.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't need a great genius like Senior Brother Liangxiao to appear on Planet Blue. There was no need to choose the second or third slightly dangerous methods.</p><p></p><p>What he needed was mediocrity, using the most basic methods to enhance the strength of the people of Planet Blue, and gradually ushering in the era of immortal cultivation and divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Mingting Peak, Tianjian Palace, and the Divine Abilities Cultivation Room.</p><p></p><p>At his feet were eleven interspatial bags!</p><p></p><p>This time, on his journey to chase the moon, Gu Jiuqing recovered Potian. With such abundant cultivation resources, Gu Jiuqing's strength would enter a period of explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>With a thought touching the Dao fruit, in an instant the world before his eyes changed, and after more than a month, he came to Planet Blue again.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble———"  </p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble———————"</p><p></p><p>Huge excavation sounds came from the wilderness outside Linjiang, where a protective wall was being built.</p><p></p><p>Ever since entering the era of spiritual qi's revival on Planet Blue, every major nation building cities would construct city walls.  </p><p></p><p>Towering walls would be built, with outposts set up on the walls manned by martial artists day and night. The walls also had electric fences to prevent demonic beasts from climbing over when the martial artists were inattentive.</p><p></p><p>Now Linjiang, as the fifth capital of the Dragon Palace, was renowned as the ancestral city. Countless people came here seeking fame, all wanting to buy a house in Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Linjiang's real estate prices skyrocketed dozens of times, almost catching up to the Divine Capital and Demonic Capital.</p><p></p><p>This led to Linjiang's economy developing rapidly. The Linjiang Commerce Association promoted all kinds of body cultivation pills which sold well nationwide and received praise.</p><p></p><p>On top of that, the Immortal Academy was about to open, so the entire Dragon Nation's attention was almost entirely focused on Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>At the highway toll station, an endless stream of large vehicles passed through inspection at the toll station before being allowed to enter Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the third railway line was in operation.  </p><p></p><p>The small city of Linjiang, which originally had only 800,000 people, had just two railway lines - one in and one out. There was no extra manpower to guard railways in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>But now the third railway was operating, and the fourth and fifth railways were under construction.</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness outside Linjiang, tents were set up everywhere, with martial artists from all over the nation volunteering to guard Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>The dense spiritual qi within Linjiang attracted demonic beasts, but with so many martial artists guarding it, the demonic beasts in Linjiang's wilderness were almost extinct.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial King from Yangcheng completed the Hundred Demon Slaughter today, congratulations on becoming the eighth martial artist to complete the Linjiang Hundred Demon Slaughter."</p><p></p><p>"Reports say the Dragon Science Academy has researched the formula for the Leaving Immortality Pill, and during the refinement process, they added special materials to increase the effects of the Leaving Immortality Pill by 20-30%. The Linjiang Commerce Association congratulates them and will hold a celebration ceremony at the Linjiang Commerce Building today."</p><p></p><p>"Three days ago, the First Martial Sage returned to the Divine Capital. Upon hearing about Linjiang establishing itself as a capital, he decided to personally go to the ancestral city of Linjiang."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Sages are disappearing one after another, while the 72 Martial Sages are gradually appearing."  </p><p></p><p>"Linjiang Immortal Academy has officially been renamed the Immortal Dao Academy, on par with the Dragon Science Academy. The first batch of admission lists has been announced. Students on this list can directly pursue doctoral studies. The 45 professor positions at the Immortal Dao Academy will come from this list, and no more professors will be added later."</p><p></p><p>"The position of first president of the Immortal Dao Academy is vacant. The vice president is taken by Elder Wen, while the former principal of Linjiang Ancestral High School is the honorary principal of the Immortal Dao Academy."</p><p></p><p>The TV then showed scenes of the Immortal Dao Academy. </p><p></p><p>The picture flashed, revealing a huge pit on the playground with faint rays of light flickering inside, forming a hexagram pattern.</p><p></p><p>"I saw the ancient teleportation array! This array can teleport to the moon."  </p><p></p><p>"Mom, what the books said is true, look at the ancient teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>At Jingyangxiaoquresidential area, a noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>The boss was still busy in the kitchen. Compared to when Gu Jiuqing last saw him, he looked much younger and his figure was more upright.</p><p></p><p>Besides Gu Jiuqing in the noodle shop, there was also a mother and daughter, and a young couple.</p><p></p><p>The TV was broadcasting the latest news.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang and the Dragon Nation were online, with the latest information broadcast daily.</p><p></p><p>Sitting opposite Gu Jiuqing was the young mother and daughter.</p><p></p><p>The woman was very fair-skinned. It seemed she had rushed out without having time to tie her hair, so she casually used her chopsticks to put her hair up in a bun, revealing her slender white neck.</p><p></p><p>The little girl kept pointing at the TV excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, mom, did you see that?"</p><p></p><p>"Mom, I've been practicing the Dragon Elephant Skill for over four months now. I think I'm about to become a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>"In the class, my qi and blood value is the highest. Maybe when I'm in sixth grade of elementary school, I'll be able to become a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>The little girl's words made the young couple at the neighboring table glance over, but it was just a glance.</p><p></p><p>The current Linjiang was not the Linjiang of the past.</p><p></p><p>This young couple came from another province specifically to travel to Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>Initially, they were shocked by the number of martial artists in Linjiang. Walking on the streets, they encountered almost all martial artists, even great masters and martial kings.</p><p></p><p>After staying for a few days, the young couple became numb to it.</p><p></p><p>Inside this small noodle shop, seeing a fifth-grader about to become a martial artist didn't surprise them at all.</p><p></p><p>"Here's your braised beef noodles."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, it's been a while since I've seen you come eat noodles. If I remember correctly, handsome, you live in this neighborhood, right?"</p><p></p><p>The noodle shop boss smiled in recognition at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered that day when Gu Jiuqing came to eat noodles, and a man in a suit rushed in asking if they had elephant meat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the boss in surprise. "Boss, you've become a master cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Jiuqing's physical body was only at the master cultivator level.</p><p></p><p>"Heheh, it's all thanks to my wife working at the Huaren Technology Company. She brought me a lot of spirit pills, which allowed me to cultivate to the master level."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the young couple finally showed some reaction.</p><p></p><p>This young handsome man lived in Jingyang Neighborhood?</p><p></p><p>Good heavens, the housing prices in Linjiang had risen tenfold now, and the prices in Jingyang Neighborhood were estimated at 120,000 per square meter!</p><p></p><p>A high school teacher's monthly salary of 4,000 wouldn't even be enough to buy half a square meter in Jingyang Neighborhood!</p><p></p><p>The woman's eyes lit up as she stared at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>She was an immigrant who came to Linjiang with her child a few months ago to work, just in time for the city lockdown of Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>This lockdown lasted three months!</p><p></p><p>During these three months, the company helped her solve the issue of her child's schooling. Because her child showed excellent martial talent, the company even bought her a house!</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't in Jingyang Neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>It was in the newly built new district. Well, the house wasn't built yet and the land was still being cleared, but the housing prices there had already been driven up to 50,000 per square meter. Without special connections, she couldn't get one.</p><p></p><p>The single mother looked at Gu Jiuqing, thinking of a way to strike up a conversation with him.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance, a large crowd of people rushed towards the main street, with many exclaiming in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It's the First Martial Sage! The First Martial Sage has come to the ancestral city of Linjiang! He's at the gate of the Immortal Dao Academy right now!"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Dao Academy gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, you're not a local, are you? The Immortal Dao Academy is the former Linjiang High School. The principal of Linjiang High School is now the honorary principal of the Immortal Dao Academy. He moved the high school division out of the Immortal Dao Academy and renovated the school with the high school division as the core. See those two buildings over there?"</p><p></p><p>Curious, the few people in the noodle shop went outside.</p><p></p><p>The street was lined with residential buildings, some over 20 stories tall, blocking the view of the Immortal Dao Academy.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head, unable to see it. No matter.</p><p></p><p>He was a teacher at Linjiang High School who had disappeared for over a month without any notice from the school about attending classes.</p><p></p><p>Besides the principal's phone number, Gu Jiuqing didn't know who else to call.</p><p></p><p>The noodle shop became quiet as the woman took her daughter and joined the crowd on the street.</p><p></p><p>The young couple also rushed into the crowd, wanting to see the First Martial Sage of the Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>The noodle shop was quiet again for a while before another customer entered from the crowded street.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, one order of Yangchun noodles, no scallions or cilantro please."</p><p></p><p>The voice was crisp and clear.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Gu...Mr. Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked up to see an elegant beauty standing before him.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Who was she?</p><p></p><p>The woman carried herself with poise, her long hair tied up high in a mature yet youthful style.</p><p></p><p>On her back was a sword case made of a high-quality metal alloy, though the exact grade couldn't be discerned.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Gu, it's me, Wen Daihua!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing recalled - she was a student from Class 2 of Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, she had good talent in swordsmanship. When Gu Jiuqing was perceiving the insights of the Unsheathing Sword Art, he did see this student practicing it.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Wen Daihua, you look so different now that I almost didn't recognize you."</p><p></p><p>During high school, what girl had time to dress up?</p><p></p><p>But now, the students of Class 12-2, following Gu Jiuqing's guidance to travel the world and spread martial arts, had all reached the master cultivator realm and undergone dramatic transformations.</p><p></p><p>Each student from Class 12-2 was a outstanding figure, the top scorers in the college entrance exam.</p><p></p><p>As students comparable to the Dragon Science Academy's Immortal Dao Academy, their future prospects were...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Becoming a professor was already a done deal!</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua was very happy, with a smile on his face. </p><p></p><p>"Teacher, where have you been recently?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua was hired by the Chinese Tech Company, and also learned this teacher's identity from the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p></p><p>He is the young master of one of the top four noble families in the Imperial Capital!</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>In the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce, they prefer to call this teacher the Sage!</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Capital, they call their teacher the Martial Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I went to another place. I just returned today and happened to run into you. It must be fate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt very relaxed on Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to cultivate on Planet Blue, nor did he need to engage in any deception. He also didn't need to worry about his own safety.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, how long will you stay in Linjiang this time?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua was like Gu Jiuqing's student, without any guile, saying whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>"How long? I don't know either, we'll see!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had not thought about this question before.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, we all miss you. Master Gu, I'm very powerful now!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua untied the sword case in his hand. With a flick of his finger, a strand of sword energy flew out from the case. The cold sword light, the fierce sword force!</p><p></p><p>This was an eight-part sword force!</p><p></p><p>On the entire Planet Blue, Wen Daihua's sword cultivation was the strongest, condensing an eight-part sword force!</p><p></p><p>This was a self-taught sword genius who cultivated the eight-part sword force just by practicing the unsheathing sword technique.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the class president's physical energy is a bit stronger than mine, but after we sparred once, she is now completely no match for me!"</p><p></p><p>"And the vice president Ning Que, he's been messing around with that elephant at the zoo all day. I heard that elephant is about to die, it seems Ning Que has drained too much of its blood. I haven't fought the vice president yet, so I don't know if he's as powerful as me."</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua talked about some things regarding the other students in Class 2, Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, do you know Lan Bai? After Lan Bai went to the Jiangdong Province to inherit the River God's Body, he was noticed by the Jiangdong Province's head. That head is a half-step Martial Saint and wants to cultivate him as a successor."</p><p></p><p>"The class president is the young lady of the Yang Corporation! When I first learned about this, I was really shocked that the CEO's daughter would appear in our class."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the class president's talent is average, but her strength is stronger than ours. However, the class president really works hard cultivating the seven divine abilities passed down by you, Master."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From Wen Daihua's words, Gu Jiuqing learned about many students in Class 2, Grade 12.</p><p></p><p>Soon, after the two finished eating noodles, they left the noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>In the distance!</p><p></p><p>There were crowds of people packing the streets.</p><p></p><p>There were also Martial Kings hovering in the air, standing out prominently. </p><p></p><p>This was the scene at the entrance of the Jingyangxiaoqudistrict. The Immortal Dao Academy, built on the former Linjiang High School campus, could be reached by passing through this commercial street and then turning left.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua led Gu Jiuqing through the crowds and out of the commercial street. After turning left, they finally saw the former Linjiang High School, now the Immortal Dao Academy.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's eyes, the former Linjiang High School and the current Immortal Dao Academy overlapped and superimposed on each other.</p><p></p><p>The entrance of Linjiang High School used to have railings and a security booth, with Old Yang and Old Jin sitting at the entrance. Now those two elders were gone, replaced by two rows of armed police!</p><p></p><p>Eight officers in one row, sixteen in two rows.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen martial artists serving as armed police guarded the school entrance.</p><p></p><p>Looking from the school gate, one could not see the playground, only a square and two large buildings.</p><p></p><p>A huge statue was carved in the square!</p><p></p><p>The statue was nine zhang (about 30 meters) tall, wearing ordinary clothes, with no facial features.</p><p></p><p>"Whose statue is this, how dare they erect it at the Immortal Dao Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Immortal Dao Academy trying to rival the Dragon Academy? Could this statue be of the Venerable Wen? No, Venerable Wen doesn't have that status!"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Wen was only a professor at the Dragon Academy back then, not even the dean!"</p><p></p><p>"Then who is this person? Judging by the attire, it doesn't seem to be an elderly person."</p><p></p><p>People in the crowd muttered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the distance, a group of people approached the Immortal Dao Academy.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists cleared the way ahead, each of them at the Grandmaster level, and there were even Great Grandmasters!</p><p></p><p>The Great Grandmasters used their internal energy to easily part the crowd, opening a wide path to the academy's entrance.</p><p></p><p>A group of prominent figures appeared at the school gate.</p><p></p><p>"It's the mayor of Linjiang Ancestral City!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard this mayor has already reached the Martial Saint realm and succeeded in his blood transformation. And there's Secretary Wen too!"</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Wen and the mayor are both Martial Saints."</p><p></p><p>"Is that the First Martial Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Next to the mayor and Secretary Wen stood a martial artist in his forties, looking youthful, resembling the First Martial Saint from the news!!</p><p></p><p>He was a Martial Saint who had lived for three hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Standing right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The first group consisted of these three Martial Saints. The second group was the principal of the Immortal Dao Academy and other Linjiang higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Linjiang Martial Arts Association did not appear, but several corporate CEOs accompanied them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the First Martial Saint and the Linjiang higher-ups enter the school, the crowd's exclamations grew louder.</p><p></p><p>"Principal! It's me, Wen Daihua. Master Gu is here."</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua?</p><p></p><p>Who was that?</p><p></p><p>Those standing near Wen Daihua, this beautiful lady, turned to look at her.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a long sword, with a young handsome man by her side.</p><p></p><p>And this young man, they seemed to have seen him somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>At the school gate!</p><p></p><p>The principal walked together with a few corporate CEOs.</p><p></p><p>Now, his status was elevated, holding a prestigious position. Just a few days ago, he had reached the Martial Saint realm and completed a blood transformation.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the eighth Martial Saint of Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>The CEOs of the Yang Corporation and the Zheng Corporation had ascended to Martial Saints before the principal.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Did someone just call me?</p><p></p><p>The principal turned his head. He was very familiar with the name Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment!</p><p></p><p>He did not want Wen Daihua to appear.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua, one of the first batch of students at the Immortal Dao Academy, a future professor, the foundation of Linjiang Ancestral City.</p><p></p><p>Now, the First Martial Saint had descended upon the ancestral city.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of all the Linjiang higher-ups were fixed on the Immortal Dao Academy, worried that this Martial Saint might cause chaos!!</p><p></p><p>The title First Martial Saint, solidified over three hundred years, could not be shaken by anyone.</p><p></p><p>But what did Wen Daihua just say?</p><p></p><p>Master Gu?</p><p></p><p>That Sage??</p><p></p><p>The Sage has appeared??</p><p></p><p>Why didn't they receive any information about this??</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Sage dislikes going online now?</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the principal hurried out of the school gate.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in the crowd, he saw a sword-carrying lady waving at him.</p><p></p><p>And standing next to the lady was Master Gu!</p><p></p><p>The principal's unusual behavior caught the attention of the two corporate CEOs, and even the three Martial Saints walking in the distance stopped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's eyes converged on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Someone exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look!"</p><p></p><p>"The clothes he's wearing are exactly the same as the ones carved on the statue!"</p><p></p><p>"The statue just doesn't have facial features. If you put his face on it, wouldn't that be him?"</p><p></p><p>"It's him?!"</p><p></p><p>"He's the Martial Ancestor of Linjiang!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Over the past month or so, there had been constant rumors online.</p><p></p><p>That the Linjiang Ancestral City had given birth to a Martial Ancestor, who commanded forty-five disciples to spread martial arts across the land.</p><p></p><p>Opening the true era of martial artists in the twenty-three provinces and five metropolitan areas of the Dragon Nation.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant Skill, Heavenly Sword Unsheathing Technique, Divine Abilities Cultivation Method, Divine Body Cultivation Method, Great Courtyard Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>These skills and abilities that far surpassed the current era all came from this Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"So the Martial Ancestor is so young!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd went into a frenzy, and those standing near Gu Jiuqing also tried to push their way closer.</p><p></p><p>The principal personally intervened, his Martial Saint spiritual will descending to calm the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu! You're here, but you didn't even give me a call. I could have helped make arrangements for Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>The principal was amiable, his face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>He led Gu Jiuqing and Wen Daihua into the school without any martial artists obstructing them. Even those few Martial Saints only observed from a distance, not approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, it's summer vacation now, so we took the opportunity while the students are on break to renovate the school a bit."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to one of the buildings, "This is the school's teaching building. The school used to only have three floors, but now it has twelve."</p><p></p><p>"The other building is for research labs, where Master Gu can conduct research."</p><p></p><p>"Behind these two buildings, we've kept the original school facilities but expanded them a bit. Master Gu, you are a teacher at this school. When the Immortal Dao Academy starts recruiting students, will Master Gu have time to come teach classes?"</p><p></p><p>The principal excitedly awaited Gu Jiuqing's response.</p><p></p><p>Inviting the Sage to teach classes!</p><p></p><p>He was probing Gu Jiuqing's intentions.</p><p></p><p>The Sage!</p><p></p><p>An outsider who occupied Gu Ziuxiu's body! This was the perception of the Linjiang higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>This Sage has been too good to the people of Linjiang, so the principal was now speaking from his position, hoping to invite Gu Jiuqing to teach at the Immortal Dao Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, maybe if there's an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not agree.</p><p></p><p>Come to Linjiang to teach classes?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could come teach in Linjiang after becoming a Sage.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Every time he came to Planet Blue, it was with a purpose.</p><p></p><p>"This time I've come, I have something to tell you all."</p><p></p><p>Something to say?</p><p></p><p>Did the Sage have new instructions?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the principal's face lit up with joy, and Wen Daihua also moved a bit closer.</p>

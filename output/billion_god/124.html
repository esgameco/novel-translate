        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the restaurant, more and more people gathered. Yuzhou Prefecture had always been a place of talented people. Adding to that, the disciples of the Four Great Sects were traveling all over the world. </p><p></p><p>Just within the prefecture, there were over a hundred gathered talents and prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu sat in the very front, while Cultivators Chi Minlu and Zhu Qingjin, two great cultivators at the Refining Spirit realm, sat behind Lord Tianyu.  </p><p></p><p>The Robe-Wearing Monk raised his hand, shielding the three great cultivators.  </p><p></p><p>Ripples of Buddhist aura flickered, with strands of Buddhist light shimmering and undulating around the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding crowd kowtowed and prostrated themselves on the ground, already converted.</p><p></p><p>Only those cultivators could withstand the conversion of Buddhist dharma.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, I want to see what great Buddhist dharma can manifest in the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu had an extraordinary bearing. He was the son of the Lord of Yuzhou Prefecture and had been cultivating for over a hundred years.  </p><p></p><p>Following the body refining methods passed down from the Jixia Academy, he built his foundation, shed his mortal form eight times, and completed the Heavenly Mechanism realm of cultivation. After the ninth cycle of his Natal Pill, he embarked on the cultivation of the Nonpolar realm!</p><p></p><p>He pioneered his own path, taking the Wood Element as the origin of his divine body, forming the Wood Element Divine Body.  </p><p></p><p>After his divine body took minor form, he found that the Wood Element origin resonated better with the Divine Tree of Communications.</p><p></p><p>During battles, his divine powers often gave him an edge over others.  </p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he was a cut above other Spirit Refining cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"To discuss the Way? With my Wood Element Divine Body as the origin, I can suppress all in this world."</p><p></p><p>The people of Yuzhou Prefecture were all curious about the origin of Lord Tianyu's divine body, but he had never revealed it publicly.  </p><p></p><p>Now, at this moment, trampling on the body of a Buddhist disciple, he was about to achieve success and fame.</p><p></p><p>The Robe-Wearing Monk's large hand descended onto Lord Tianyu's head.  </p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianyu, this penniless monk has three questions. If you can answer these three questions and still feel that this penniless monk's methods are inferior to your cultivation, then this monk will turn around and leave!"</p><p></p><p>The three question method?  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Master Lianqiao looked at the bald monk with faint smiles.  </p><p></p><p>They were also curious about how the Buddhist disciple would question him!</p><p></p><p>"Please ask!"  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu remained expressionless, allowing the Robe-Wearing Monk to touch his head.</p><p></p><p>"The first question from this penniless monk: May I ask why you cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Why cultivate?  </p><p></p><p>This question, imbued with the unique "mind-opening" quality of Buddhism, made one answer from the depths of one's soul involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>That was the Dao Sound.  </p><p></p><p>It struck directly at Lord Tianyu's spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>Within his Mud Pill Palace, Lord Tianyu's spirit and soul showed a perplexed expression.  </p><p></p><p>Why cultivate?  </p><p></p><p>He was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, why did he cultivate?  </p><p></p><p>Was it because he was the son of the Lord of Yuzhou Prefecture, so he had to cultivate?  </p><p></p><p>Or was it because everyone in the world was cultivating, so he cultivated as well?</p><p></p><p>The pain of shedding mortal forms, the agony of tempering the flesh, the torment day and night.  </p><p></p><p>Releasing the Heavenly Mechanism, painstakingly seeking the gateway!  </p><p></p><p>The thirty-three levels of the Nonpolar realm, forging the origin!  </p><p></p><p>Refining the divine apertures, merging with the cycles of heaven and earth, shattering the void!</p><p></p><p>"For survival? Even if I don't cultivate, who dares to kill me, the son of the Lord of Yuzhou Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"To seek the Way? The paths to become an immortal have already been blocked. Even the patriarchs of the Four Great Sects cannot become immortals. If I seek the Way, I will spend my entire life in vain without any achievement."</p><p></p><p>"To attain the Way? To attain the Way through one's body, to reach the pinnacle and dominate the world? My father's cultivation has reached the Heavenly Realm, yet he still dares not brave the Thunder Tribulation. To attain the Way through one's body, to become one with the Way, how difficult is that? For the sake of braving the tribulation, how many years has it been since I last saw my father?"</p><p></p><p>Father!  </p><p></p><p>He had so many sons!  </p><p></p><p>And those elder brothers of his?  </p><p></p><p>They were single-mindedly seeking the Way, secluded in cultivation, not walking in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeking the Way was not Lord Tianyu's path, nor was attaining the Way!</p><p></p><p>"To roam freely? To roam freely in the world, but humans are bound within the world, imprisoned by rules and restrictions. With rules, there are boundaries!"  </p><p></p><p>"I do not seek to roam freely. The laws of the Great Zhou are well-established, giving everyone the opportunity to pursue their ambitions, even evildoers have a place to return to!"</p><p></p><p>Not seeking to roam freely, not seeking the Great Way, with life guaranteed, unless it was to witness the scenery along the path of the Great Way?</p><p></p><p>Heh?  </p><p></p><p>The wilderness was so vast, even just measuring the Nine Provinces would exhaust an ordinary person's entire life without being able to traverse it all.</p><p></p><p>Human lifespans were limited, but why were they limited?  </p><p></p><p>Because within this limited lifespan, one could experience all aspects of life. If one exceeded this limit and became an ageless monster, life would lose its flavor!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lord Tianyu fell into perplexity.  </p><p></p><p>Even the Robe-Wearing Monk opened his eyes wide.  </p><p></p><p>This??  </p><p></p><p>He could never have imagined that the heart of the son of the Lord of Yuzhou Prefecture would be so fragile.  </p><p></p><p>One question had already shattered Lord Tianyu's heart of the Way.</p><p></p><p>"Why cultivate, this first question of yours, venerable monk, is truly difficult for me to answer."  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu shook his head, and after a long while, he finally said, "I am not like others, seeking to roam freely or seeking the Great Way, nor am I like others who bitterly study knowledge to seek answers from the Great Way."</p><p></p><p>To roam freely, to seek the Way, to specialize in study!</p><p></p><p>"I cultivate my own Way, simply because I cultivate it, without any reason."  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu's aura changed.  </p><p></p><p>He had long opened his Celestial Platform, using the power of shattering the void to cleanse his thirty-fourth vertebra.  </p><p></p><p>The power of his Natal Pill at the ninth cycle, the power of his divine apertures in the Celestial Cycle, the power of his dantian, and the Wood Element origin from Mount Nonpolar, all flowed into the Celestial Platform!</p><p></p><p>The power of the Natal Pill origin!  </p><p></p><p>Plus his divine abilities!  </p><p></p><p>All these were manifestations of essence, energy, and spirit!  </p><p></p><p>These things then transformed back into essence, energy, and spirit, like a great river, cleansing the ineffable on the Celestial Platform.</p><p></p><p>A celestial palace was washed out!  </p><p></p><p>Rumble!  </p><p></p><p>The Mud Pill Palace was shattered, and the spirit and soul flew out, stepping onto the Celestial Platform, interweaving with countless essences, energies, and spirits.  </p><p></p><p>The spirit and soul were cleansed by the essence, energy, and spirit, the entire illusory spirit and soul evolving towards substantiality.  </p><p></p><p>That was the spirit and soul transforming into the Celestial Soul!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianyu has stepped into the Celestial Soul realm."  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was slightly surprised.  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu's answer had caught him off guard.  </p><p></p><p>It was like "I think, therefore I am," "I have attained the Way, therefore I have attained the Way."  </p><p></p><p>Because he cultivated, so he cultivated.  </p><p></p><p>Without so many reasons, this was the fundamental reason for most cultivators embarking on the path of cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>To them, what was the heart of the Way? It was not important at all.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to capture this Lord and dissect his Mud Pill Palace to study how his thoughts differ from other cultivators'."</p><p></p><p>Master Lianqiao cultivated not to attain the Way, nor to roam freely, and even less to save the mortal world.  </p><p></p><p>He bitterly studied knowledge, seeking answers from the Great Way!  </p><p></p><p>He wanted to understand all things in the world, which was why he was reborn twice, earning the name Master Lianqiao.</p><p></p><p>As for me?  </p><p></p><p>Why did Gu Jiuqing cultivate? Hmm, it seemed he hadn't really cultivated much, it was all thanks to Lan Xinren's help.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dwell too much on this question.  </p><p></p><p>His answer leaned towards Lord Tianyu's: I cultivated, so I cultivated.  </p><p></p><p>No need for further explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Soul surged forth, a nine-zhang tall giant appearing behind Lord Tianyu.  </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Soul realm!  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu!  </p><p></p><p>Yuzhou Prefecture had produced another peerless talent and prodigy.  </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the competition between the Four Great Sects and the Jixia Academy moving the Dragon and Tiger Ranking, Lord Tianyu would have been the rising star of this era, on par with the Three Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>"Then this penniless monk shall ask you the second question: Is cultivation difficult?"  </p><p></p><p>The Robe-Wearing Monk's voice penetrated deep into one's heart as he questioned Lord Tianyu's Celestial Soul.  </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Soul lowered its head, looking at the monk.  </p><p></p><p>The nine-zhang giant towered over even the restaurant above.  </p><p></p><p>Under the Celestial Soul, everything appeared tiny.  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu, having reached the Celestial Soul realm, gained three portions of extraordinary bearing. Facing the monk's second question, he quickly gave his answer.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's arduous! Among those who cultivated alongside me, many have already died of old age!"  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu had been cultivating for a hundred and eighty years, and some cultivators who shed their mortal forms could not even live that long.  </p><p></p><p>Not to mention ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then this penniless monk shall ask you the third question!"  </p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to look at this penniless monk's palm!"  </p><p></p><p>Huh?  </p><p></p><p>What kind of question was that?  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu raised his head, and his Celestial Soul also made a gesture of raising its head.  </p><p></p><p>The two Spirit Refining cultivators standing behind Lord Tianyu, Chi Minlu and Zhu Qingjin, also looked up at the Robe-Wearing Monk's palm.</p><p></p><p>It was just this one look!!  </p><p></p><p>Three figures simultaneously moved, and streams of conversion intent fell from the palm.  </p><p></p><p>The Buddha supports my crown!  </p><p></p><p>Receiving longevity through tonsure!  </p><p></p><p>Buddhist dharmas were manifested in the palm, as if a nation was condensing. The two Spirit Refining cultivators and the Celestial Soul cultivator all had dazed expressions.  </p><p></p><p>One breath!  </p><p></p><p>Two breaths!  </p><p></p><p>Three breaths!  </p><p></p><p>Time ticked by, but these three cultivators remained motionless, gazing at the Robe-Wearing Monk's palm, revealing a look of complete satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>In an ancient courtyard of a grand manor in Yuzhou Prefecture.  </p><p></p><p>Three stone statues, weathered by wind and frost, a place even the manor's steward could not set foot in.  </p><p></p><p>One of the stone statues moved, cracks spreading across its surface.  </p><p></p><p>A voice came from within.  </p><p></p><p>"I sense the Buddhist dharma! Tianyu has been converted by Buddhism."  </p><p></p><p>This deep voice reverberated within the courtyard but did not travel outward.  </p><p></p><p>Another stone statue cracked open, its old skin shedding.  </p><p></p><p>"Let's just consider it him shielding a disaster for Yuzhou Prefecture. Father can have another son."  </p><p></p><p>The third stone statue remained motionless.  </p><p></p><p>"You see, Elder Brother's state of mind is much higher than ours. Elder Brother is only one step away from the Tribulation realm, just waiting for next spring to go to the Wind and Thunder Valley to brave the tribulation!"  </p><p></p><p>"Let's continue cultivating."  </p><p></p><p>The cracks on the two elder brothers' statues healed, and no more sounds came forth.  </p><p></p><p>There were also gazes coming from various directions within the city.  </p><p></p><p>Those were from the high officials and old patriarchs of the noble families of Yuzhou Prefecture.  </p><p></p><p>They first looked towards that ancient manor, but seeing no one emerge, they couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the power of the Buddhist Sect is indeed formidable, converting a son of the Lord, even the Lord himself dares not intervene!"  </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Four Great Sects guard the borders of the Nine Provinces of the Great Zhou, slaying how many demons and monsters for the human race?"  </p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist Sect converting one person is also for the purpose of guarding the Small Western Heaven, prolonging the prosperity of the human race."  </p><p></p><p>Gazes rippled in the darkness. Since the Lord did not take action, they naturally would not either.</p><p></p><p>The ripples of Buddhist dharma subsided, and the three cultivators stood up.  </p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the restaurant, the nine-zhang Celestial Soul flew back into Lord Tianyu's Mud Pill Palace, forming a celestial palace as the dwelling for the nine-zhang Celestial Soul.  </p><p></p><p>Traces of Buddhist light shone upon them, and they bowed towards the Robe-Wearing Monk.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist dharma is boundless, my Buddha is immeasurable, my Buddha is the Tathagata!"  </p><p></p><p>"Truly the supreme dharma, only today upon witnessing the Buddhist dharma do I realize how short-sighted I was."  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu's eyes were filled with piety!!  </p><p></p><p>That was his yearning for the Buddhist dharma!  </p><p></p><p>Not a shred of insincerity, these were his most devout words at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators around were stunned as they looked at Lord Tianyu.  </p><p></p><p>"What? Lord Tianyu actually said out loud that the Buddhist dharma is boundless? Has he been converted? Otherwise, why would he say such things?"  </p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist dharma, the Buddhist dharma, does it really have such allure?"  </p><p></p><p>"Even the son of the Lord praises it so!"  </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, as one of the Four Great Sects, the Buddhist dharma is naturally unmatched."  </p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Voices of praise arose, quickly becoming a chorus of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, it's just some illusory images after all."  </p><p></p><p>This voice came suddenly, causing the surrounding crowd to pause.  </p><p></p><p>Illusory images?  </p><p></p><p>What did that mean?  </p><p></p><p>The Robe-Wearing Monk opened his eyes and looked at Gu Jiuqing.  </p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing took half a step back, revealing Master Lianqiao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you can make your move. If any ageless monsters bully the young, I'll help you slaughter them."</p><p></p><p>Hahaha!  </p><p></p><p>Master Lianqiao laughed heartily, his white-robed figure stepped forward, his eyes flickering with divine light as he stared at the Robe-Wearing Monk, revealing two rows of white teeth.</p><p></p><p>"The conversion sound of the Buddhist Sect, the Buddhist nation in your palm, you've already used these two divine abilities ever since you sat down!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, on top of that, you projected your inner landscape using your Celestial Soul and dharma power, merging it with the Buddhist nation in your palm to form a Paradise realm, using that to convert these three."</p><p></p><p>"Am I wrong?"  </p><p></p><p>Master Lianqiao looked at the Robe-Wearing Monk with a half-mocking, half-smiling expression.  </p><p></p><p>He had revealed all the Buddhist Sect's secret techniques.  </p><p></p><p>These were the Buddhist Sect's profoundest secrets!!  </p><p></p><p>Those old monsters all knew about them but did not expose them.</p><p></p><p>Why do people cultivate?  </p><p></p><p>To attain the Way? To roam freely? For wealth? Power? Immortality? Longevity? As long as you have the seven emotions and six desires, they could manifest in the Buddhist nation.  </p><p></p><p>Allowing you to indulge in them!  </p><p></p><p>Illusion or reality?  </p><p></p><p>If illusion becomes reality, then reality is illusion!  </p><p></p><p>Lord Tianyu, Chi Minlu</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The golden body fell!</p><p></p><p>The great sword dissipated. </p><p></p><p>Turning into rainwater, it fell to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But soon, these raindrops gathered upwards again, forming a divine sword one thousand zhang long.</p><p></p><p>A hundred zhang divine sword would be like an ant before this one thousand zhang sword. </p><p></p><p>One thousand zhang, six li in magnitude, this sword towered over the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>Half the people of Yuzhou Prefecture witnessed this divine sword.</p><p></p><p>They gazed in awe at the heavens and earth, feeling as if a sword immortal had descended to the nine realms, manifesting the supreme sword way.</p><p></p><p>But only Gu Jiuqing sensed the true essence of this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze focused on the thousand zhang divine sword.  </p><p></p><p>This was merely the most basic application of sword qi in the sword way.</p><p></p><p>Sword qi, sword momentum, sword intent - these were the three levels of the sword way.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao had only catalyzed a strand of sword intent, forming sword qi.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi rose and gathered the forces of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Dispersing and then coalescing, over and over again, finally converging into this thousand zhang divine sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike had already surpassed countless divine sword techniques!</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the complex, simplifying the simple to reach the divine - that was all there was to it!!</p><p></p><p>In the vast heavens, this thousand zhang divine sword finally descended.</p><p></p><p>The vast sword qi spanning the sky, a thousand zhang colossus, fell towards the Cloth Monk!</p><p></p><p>The Cloth Monk stood unmoving like a mountain, like an immovable Ming Wang Buddha.</p><p></p><p>His golden body formed a hand seal, becoming a great bell!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Bell Shield!</p><p></p><p>"Dong————————"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi shattered, the sword body rippled, layer after layer dissipating. But cracks soon appeared in the Golden Bell Shield.</p><p></p><p>"Shua la——————"</p><p></p><p>Golden shards fell as the sword strike slashed towards the Cloth Monk.</p><p></p><p>Infinite radiance exploded, the ground beneath collapsed!</p><p></p><p>When the brilliance faded, the Cloth Monk had fallen into a deep pit, his entire body flowing with golden blood.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao shook his head, "I told you, you can't block this sword qi."</p><p></p><p>He had already held back. Otherwise, this sword could have killed the Cloth Arhat.</p><p></p><p>He walked a few steps forward, standing before the Cloth Arhat.</p><p></p><p>His left hand stretched out, five fingers waving, threads of sword intent pulsing.</p><p></p><p>He actually sliced the Cloth Arhat into pieces on the spot!</p><p></p><p>However, this time he did not cut the Arhat's spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Slicing the spiritual soul would prevent reassembly, but slicing the physical body allowed him to maintain the Arhat's physical vitality, inner qi and origin of power. Once reassembled, it would be as good as new!</p><p></p><p>His five fingers danced in the air, sword intent forming rootless water enveloping the Cloth Arhat, emitting divine light.</p><p></p><p>The Cloth Arhat's body instantly became hundreds of pieces.</p><p></p><p>Beside the sliced Arhat, the reverent looks on Tianyu Gongzi and several great cultivators faded.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other in shock, then back at the sliced Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat poured down their backs endlessly!</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's path of salvation was truly impregnable. If not for this cultivator's intervention, they might have followed the Cloth Arhat back to the Small Western Heaven and entered Buddhism!</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>"He actually sliced the Arhat's body!"</p><p></p><p>The blood did not flow out, the inner power did not dissipate, and even the spiritual soul remained intact, residing in the mud spirit palaces.</p><p></p><p>Mount Buzhou was dug out!</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three vertebrae shone brilliantly!</p><p></p><p>This was Tianyu Gongzi's first time seeing the complete Mount Buzhou!</p><p></p><p>There was also a Bodhi tree, with supernatural fruits!!</p><p></p><p>The secrets of Buddhism were exposed before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Shua shua——————"</p><p></p><p>An aura flowed through heaven and earth, interweaving and binding Liang Xiao tightly.</p><p></p><p>It was an undying elder taking action!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly phenomena changed, the celestial omens shifted. All the citizens of Yuzhou Prefecture felt it and hurried indoors, even the officials and soldiers instinctively ran towards the prefectural office!</p><p></p><p>It seemed only the prefectural office could give them a sense of safety.</p><p></p><p>Pure yang auras intertwined, and a second sun rose in the sky. A figure stood above Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"A heavenly immortal at the Catastrophe realm! It's the Cloth Arhat's protector appearing!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just not known which protector from Buddhism this Catastrophe immortal is!"</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard of the ancient mansion, three stone statues broke free of their shackles and walked out.</p><p></p><p>They were three ancient existences, the three sons of the Yuzhou Prefecture lord.</p><p></p><p>However, they were much older than Gao Tianyu.</p><p></p><p>All over a thousand years old, with the resources of Yuzhou Prefecture, their cultivation had long reached the Celestial Palace realm. Seeing a Catastrophe immortal appear, they emerged and gazed up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the pure yang auras, they revealed looks of shock and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Their divine eyes illuminated the city, immediately seeing the sliced Cloth Arhat.</p><p></p><p>"What? This person killed a Buddhist disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone mad? To dare kill even a Buddhist disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen Arhats are third generation disciples of Buddhism, each a grandstudent of the Buddha. What force dares to do such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>Madness!</p><p></p><p>That was their first thought.</p><p></p><p>Of the four great sects, the Sword Sect and Star Gauge Sect were similar, </p><p>divided into outer disciples, inner disciples, and true disciples.</p><p></p><p>The true disciples inherited the great teachings. If the elders or peak masters of a lineage died, the true disciples could become the new elders or peak masters.</p><p></p><p>But Buddhism and Taoism were different from them. In these two great sects, the Patriarchs and Buddhas were revered.</p><p></p><p>The two Patriarchs passed down their teachings.</p><p></p><p>The second generation Buddhist disciples were the Three Buddhas of past, present and future. The third generation were the Four Bodhisattvas.</p><p></p><p>In Taoism, the first second generation disciple was Patriarch Chan Tian, an unmatched existence from three thousand six hundred years ago! At that time, Taoism only had one person - the Dao Patriarch himself!</p><p></p><p>After the Dao Patriarch took Chan Tian as a disciple, Taoism began widely accepting students.</p><p></p><p>Chan Tian's disciples became the third generation!</p><p></p><p>One thousand six hundred years ago, the Dao Patriarch took a second disciple, so Taoism gained a second lineage headed by Patriarch Jie Tian.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Dao Patriarch's third disciple had descended to the world. Taoism would have a third lineage, and the three great Patriarchs would reign supreme!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it drew out a Catastrophe protector!"</p><p></p><p>The three prefecture lord's sons were aghast.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Catastrophe immortal was too terrifying. They were close to the Catastrophe realm, that great lord had even reached the Ten Great Celestial Palaces, just one step away from crossing the Catastrophe!</p><p></p><p>But he! Sensing the Catastrophe immortal's pure yang aura, he felt his inner powers, inner qi and divine abilities sealed.</p><p></p><p>Such a gap in realms could not be bridged.</p><p></p><p>The four city gates opened, squad after squad of Yuzhou soldiers marched in from outside.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire city was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>But ordinary troops facing a Catastrophe immortal were merely striking a rock with an egg.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>Thunderous rumbles shook Yuzhou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The entire city was filled with trepidation, as if celestial majesty had descended and spoken in their ears.</p><p></p><p>Endless thunderclaps shook their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Sinful beast, accept death!"</p><p></p><p>The protector stood above the city, pure yang energy refining around him. The pure yang aura rained down as he pointed a finger at Liang Xiao!!</p><p></p><p>It was a pure yang finger, imbued with his pure yang intent. This finger temporarily possessed the pure yang attribute.</p><p></p><p>Majestic celestial might, altering celestial phenomena, this terrifying figure stood in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao was still studying the Cloth Arhat's body, absorbing the Buddhist way!</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist way is different from the worldly way."</p><p></p><p>"Buddhism has myriad great ways, but the Buddha's way is singular. The Buddha originally left the Way to create the World of Ultimate Bliss in the Small Western Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I am the Buddha Tathagata, the Buddha's teachings are boundless and infinite. Whether Arhats or Buddhas, they are all depicting the World of Ultimate Bliss, projecting their inner realms outwards as the Way - just like the teachings of the great Confucian scholars!"</p><p></p><p>"Now in this world, some people are starting to cultivate the way of inner realization and outer manifestation, visualizing their inner realms and projecting them outwards as the Way."</p><p></p><p>"The one who comprehended this Way is the Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha wanted to use the World of Ultimate Bliss to assist his own comprehension of the Way! One person attains the Way, allowing myriad others to witness it. Salvation upon salvation, the Buddha is not only saving others but also himself!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao studied the Arhat's true body, the supernatural fruits hanging from the Bodhi tree, the Buddhist techniques in his palm. He saw faint threads - the karmic threads connecting to the Western Heaven, intertwined through the World of Ultimate Bliss.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A finger descended with rippling force. Liang Xiao turned his head abruptly, staring intently at this finger.</p><p></p><p>Myriad divine eyes appeared densely on his face, fixated on the Catastrophe immortal's finger!</p><p></p><p>He laughed loudly, "You dare be so reckless with just a finger carrying a pure yang intent?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao struck out!</p><p></p><p>The great genius intertwined his hands, the five elemental sword qi shaking the azure sky. Heaven and earth seemed to be a waterfall, severed by the five elemental sword qi.</p><p></p><p>There was also an inverted celestial palace hanging overhead. The five elemental sword qi entered it, forming five celestial palaces!</p><p></p><p>The five great celestial palaces intersected, aiming at the immortal's finger!</p><p></p><p>Countless rippling divine lights shattered the azure sky. The five great celestial palace sword intents pulsed as one sword strike descended, severing the finger from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood disintegrated as this pure yang intent ascended.</p><p></p><p>"Quite a dashing display of the five elemental celestial palace sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not act. He wanted to see Liang Xiao's true strength as well.</p><p></p><p>It was said his senior brother could slay Catastrophe immortals!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see how other talents could defy immortals and slay celestials.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing a realm meant being an immortal before others.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother infused the five elemental sword intent into the great celestial palaces, manifesting five elemental celestial palaces. Just this one sword strike could rank him on the Dragon and Tiger Roll!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing praised.</p><p></p><p>But above the ancient city, that figure enveloped in divine light was pained. A massive head suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>The immortal was manifesting the celestial phenomena!</p><p></p><p>Activating the divine abilities of celestial phenomena, his spiritual soul intertwined to form a figure hundreds of zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>As the head fell, pure yang auras converged.</p><p></p><p>An elderly bald monk glared furiously at Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sinful beast, it has been a long time since this pauper monk last used the Purple Golden Bowl!"</p><p></p><p>The old monk looked down, ripples appearing in the Purple Golden Bowl in his palm as strand after strand of the Way activated - a great treasure was awakening!</p><p></p><p>An immortal who had lived over three thousand years, wielding a great treasure against Liang Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao showed no fear, instead staring intently at the old monk's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Your physical body is much stronger than this Arhat's!"</p><p></p><p>The five great celestial palaces rippled, all aiming at the old monk's spiritual soul!</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's aura flared as myriad divine apertures opened one by one, each filled with immense inner power, far greater than when Gu Jiuqing had opened twenty-eight zhang apertures!!</p><p></p><p>Within the divine apertures were nurtured ranks of divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and sixty-five divine weapons trembled in unison. Liang Xiao raised his hand to the heavens as strand after strand of the Way rippled, majestic forces unleashed from the divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes lit up. "So Senior Brother Liang Xiao has this many divine weapons, not just for suppressing his physical body!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing first saw Liang Xiao, he had doubts.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred and sixty-five revolving celestial stars suppressed three hundred and sixty-five divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Jiuqing's calculations, one thousand-strand divine weapon with nine hundred and ninety-nine strands of the Way activated could suppress ten thousand dragons and elephants - an entire dragon-elephant kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and sixty-five divine weapons could then suppress three hundred and sixty-five dragon-elephant kingdoms, the power of thirty-six million dragons and elephants!</p><p></p><p>Such power alone was almost enough to prove the Way and become a deity.</p><p></p><p>But that did not account for the great treasures on Liang Xiao's Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>"So Senior Brother Liang Xiao's path to comprehending the Way is through proving it with divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing felt something was amiss. If it was just proving the Way through divine weapons, Liang Xiao would have no need to compile the Divine Techniques Compendium.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons opened strand after strand of divine patterns, the myriad divine apertures becoming massive stars. A terrifying force erupted, the true power to shatter the vacuum itself.</p><p></p><p>The Catastrophe old monk's expression changed as the Purple Golden Bowl shattered under this force!</p><p></p><p>The great treasure collapsed, its patterns of the Way extinguishing one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Catastrophe old monk's spiritual soul trembled as pure yang intents flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Shua la la————"</p><p></p><p>A finger pointed at the old monk's spiritual soul hundreds of zhang tall, shattering it. Only pure yang intents remained, flying back into the old monk's true body.</p><p></p><p>"Sinful beast! You dare destroy my spiritual soul! Dare destroy my Purple Golden Bowl!!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Golden Bowl was damaged, many of its patterns of the Way severed.</p><p></p><p>The old monk raged, stepping into the void and descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Intents scattered, pure yang intents interweaving around him.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three, four!</p><p></p><p>"This is an immortal who has crossed two levels of the pure yang lightning tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person, to be able to defy a Catastrophe immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"This cultivator is definitely not a Catastrophe immortal. If he was, he would have used pure yang intents long ago!"</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial Palace true immortal, defying a Catastrophe immortal? Such an audacious event unprecedented in history is happening today?"</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Palace true immortal!!</p><p></p><p>Defeating a retreating Catastrophe immortal!</p><p></p><p>This scene left the people of Yuzhou Prefecture in shock.</p><p></p><p>The old monk's expression turned even more unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Where did this Celestial Palace true immortal of such strength come from?</p><p></p><p>"Old monk, why be enraged?"</p><p></p><p>"This Arhat of your Buddhist sect is not dead!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao waved his hand, reassembling the Arhat's true body. The sliced Cloth Arhat was restored to his original state.</p><p></p><p>Only his injuries remained as his celestial palace spiritual soul awakened. The Cloth Arhat opened his eyes, staring aghast at Liang Xiao!</p><p></p><p>"Sinful beast! Die!"</p><p></p><p>The old monk was truly enraged now, no longer listening to Liang Xiao's words.</p><p></p><p>Liang Xiao's expression changed. "I am a true disciple of the Sword Sect. Old monk, if you kill me, it may provoke a war between the Sword Sect and Buddhism."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>So this person was from the Sword Sect, no wonder he was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>He</p>

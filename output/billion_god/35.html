        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The blue area represents the scale of spiritual energy value 7. </p><p></p><p>In the display of spiritual energy values, there was no blue area at all, the entire Lijiang City was covered in red.</p><p></p><p>It was a purple-red Lijiang City!!</p><p></p><p>"12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 13, 12, 14, 13, 13, 14, 15"</p><p></p><p>Some areas even had spiritual energy values soaring to 15!!</p><p></p><p>What concept was this?</p><p></p><p>It was three levels more concentrated than the most spiritually rich places on the Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to one person cultivating in the city, while another cultivated in the wilderness. </p><p></p><p>Cultivating in the wild, without worrying about the threat of demonic beasts, one could fully enjoy the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, bathing in the essence, with the cultivation speed increasing by more than 30%!</p><p></p><p>Each level of spiritual energy value could increase the cultivation speed by 10%.</p><p></p><p>"There was no place in Lijiang City with a spiritual energy value below 12, and some places even broke through to 15!"</p><p></p><p>"Jingyang Community, isn't that the community where Gu Zixiu lives? The spiritual energy is most concentrated around that community as the center."</p><p></p><p>"Did he secretly take action again?"  </p><p></p><p>"This time even the spiritual energy of Lijiang has been altered!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief stared at Jingyang Community.</p><p></p><p>Divine!</p><p></p><p>Apart from divine, he could no longer find an adjective to describe Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy was the core of the High Martial era, with concentrated spiritual energy giving birth to martial artists.</p><p></p><p>If Lijiang City could maintain such concentrated spiritual energy values all the time, it would almost certainly become an ancestral city in the future!</p><p></p><p>Even the imperial capital only had a spiritual energy value of 9, which had not reached the average level of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——————"</p><p>"Roar——————"</p><p></p><p>The roars of demonic beasts rose one after another, growing more numerous.</p><p></p><p>The reason demonic beasts could quietly dwell in the wilderness was because the spiritual energy there was more concentrated than in cities.</p><p></p><p>Once the wilderness spiritual energy value was no longer higher than the cities, it would trigger a demonic beast tide!</p><p></p><p>In the history of High Martial era, such incidents had occurred a few times.</p><p></p><p>It was when a heaven-defying genius was born in the city, changing the spiritual energy value of the city, triggering a demonic beast tide that attacked the city!!</p><p></p><p>That was a heavenly disaster!</p><p></p><p>Under the onslaught of the demonic beast tide, even the strongest cities would be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"So it seems my warning to the Grand Chief about the demonic beast tide has come true."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief sighed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the stationed troops gathered and began clearing the demonic beasts outside Lijiang City overnight.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Gu Jiuqing went out early.</p><p></p><p>Last night, he had stayed on the Blue Star for one night, and also browsed the Lijiang forum for one night.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Blue Star, Lijiang's population base was not large, but for Gu Jiuqing, it was too many.</p><p></p><p>As more and more people began practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Art, many made mistakes in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If this was in the Primordial Chaos, Gu Jiuqing wouldn't care so much.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Blue Star!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Blue Star people was helping him cultivate. Gu Jiuqing couldn't just watch so many people make mistakes, so he stayed up all night on the forum, lecturing on the insights of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, guiding their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Going back and forth like this, it quickly became the next day.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Jiuqing got off the elevator, he felt the concentrated spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Mist!</p><p></p><p>The entire community was shrouded in a thick mist condensed from the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Such rich spiritual energy, befitting Lijiang with its two spiritual veins."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the spiritual veins were too powerful. This was only the first day, and it would take another ten or eight years for the effects of the spiritual veins to fully open up.</p><p></p><p>By then, Lijiang's spiritual energy could rival that of the great clans and sects of the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>In the community park, many elderly people rose early to practice their skills.</p><p></p><p>Holding long swords, they practiced the Sword Drawing Art. Some elderly cultivated the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's a pity. Last night on the forum, there appeared a martial arts master who lectured us on the true essence of the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity we couldn't receive his guidance. Hopefully we can encounter him again on the forum today."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, last night Old Li received guidance from that martial arts master. Like a withered tree regrowing, he actually stepped into the Sect Master realm and began tempering his bones! His vital energy was reborn, ushering in a second spring. In the middle of the night, I could hear noises coming from his house."</p><p></p><p>"Envious, really envious."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly retracted his ears, not daring to listen further.</p><p></p><p>At the community entrance, there were far fewer vehicles coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Adding to the thick mist surrounding them, it was impossible to see clearly beyond three or four meters, making the streets appear even more desolate.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the street and the floors of the community buildings, the sounds of martial practice could occasionally be heard. The martial arts halls had even put up signs advertising the Dragon and Elephant Skill, their neon lights visible from afar through the mist.</p><p></p><p>After walking a little further, about a hundred meters away from the corner, Gu Jiuqing heard the sound of the Dragon and Elephant leaping into the air nearby.</p><p></p><p>Someone was practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill in a slightly more open passage!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A woman was practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill. </p><p></p><p>As she went through the 22 movements of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the qi and blood energy extended from the top of her head, dispersing the dense fog around her, allowing Gu Jiuqing to clearly see her appearance.</p><p></p><p>She wore a white vest, with her long hair tied back in a ponytail. </p><p></p><p>She had long pants on the bottom half!</p><p></p><p>However, she had been practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill here for a long time, drenched in sweat, her vest and skin tightly clinging together.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh————</p><p></p><p>As her qi and blood surged, Bai Muqian's whole body trembled, her energy uniting and breaking through the shackles. Her blood cultivation was completed, ripples of qi and blood energy enveloping her body, causing all the bones to vibrate.</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths! </p><p></p><p>Three breaths!</p><p></p><p>It took a full ten breaths before the trembling finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian's face was flushed red, and after repeated bone-setting, her skeletal frame had formed the most ideal physique.</p><p></p><p>Originally tall, she had now grown another 3-4 centimeters taller, her slender legs even more shapely.</p><p></p><p>A Bone Cultivation Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian's eyes flashed with a strand of brilliant light - she had finally reached the Grandmaster realm before the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can even become a Great Grandmaster before thirty!"</p><p></p><p>Grandmaster cultivates bones, Great Grandmaster cultivates tendons, Martial King cultivates organs!</p><p></p><p>She, Bai Muqian, would strive to become the Martial King!</p><p></p><p>Last night, she saw someone post on the forum, and whether it was true or not, she came directly to the area below the poster's building and stood in the open space to practice the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>And the result was shocking.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating here, her cultivation speed was greatly accelerated, even faster than cultivating in the gravity chamber.</p><p></p><p>"The housing prices in these few residential areas are not expensive, perhaps I can take out a loan to buy one!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy here was so dense. Taking advantage of being the first to discover this place before others, Bai Muqian wanted to seize the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>She picked up the used nutrient bottles nearby and threw them into a trash can.</p><p></p><p>Only then did she head towards the school.</p><p></p><p>The dense fog rose, and Bai Muqian's mood was delighted.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a Bone Cultivation Grandmaster, her strength had greatly increased, and even her mental state had changed.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Not far in front of her, there was also a walking figure heading towards Linjiang High School, just like her.</p><p></p><p>"This figure seems somewhat familiar."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a school teacher?</p><p></p><p>She showed a pleased expression. Since they were teachers at the same school, perhaps this teacher could help inquire about any houses for sale nearby?</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian stepped forward to walk side-by-side with that figure.</p><p></p><p>"A school teacher?"</p><p></p><p>"Hello, I'm also a teacher at Linjiang High School's branch, Bai Muqian!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to meet a teacher from the same school here."</p><p></p><p>"Which campus area do you live in?"</p><p></p><p>The walking figure stopped and turned to look at Bai Muqian.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Teacher Bai."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was now innocent.</p><p></p><p>He had just noticed Bai Muqian practicing by the roadside earlier. </p><p></p><p>He had deliberately quickened his pace to avoid unnecessary contact.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect Bai Muqian to actively strike up a conversation with him.</p><p></p><p>However, the current Gu Jiuqing was no longer as timid as when he first descended to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's Teacher Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The tall figure, coupled with simple attire, looked like a neighborhood girlfriend waiting downstairs for her boyfriend to go to work together.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Teacher Bai is going to school very early today."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian looked at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This was a perfect man!</p><p></p><p>The young master of one of the eight aristocratic families of the imperial capital, Gu Family. He entered the Imperial Capital University at 18 and graduated at 24.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was his innate status or his later efforts, this Teacher Gu was truly a dragon among men!</p><p></p><p>They had crossed paths once back in the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>But it was a pity!</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Zixiu was high above, while she, Bai Muqian, was just a martial artist who graduated from Jiangnan University. Their statuses were worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that one encounter, they never intersected again.</p><p></p><p>She also didn't know why this son of heaven had come to Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors spreading about him and her.</p><p></p><p>"I come to school very early, the earlier the better, as the school provides free breakfast."</p><p></p><p>"It's Teacher Gu who rarely comes to teach classes."</p><p></p><p>These past few days, the senior third-year class she was teaching had been let loose. With the college entrance exams approaching, these students, who seemed to be martial artists, didn't need to work so hard.</p><p></p><p>"I've been quite busy these past few days, so I haven't been to school as much."</p><p></p><p>From these few short sentences, Gu Jiuqing gained quite a bit of information.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that only the few major figures in Linjiang knew about him transmitting his teachings to the senior third-year class, while ordinary people like Bai Muqian were still unaware.</p><p></p><p>Begging for monthly tickets, review tickets, and rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

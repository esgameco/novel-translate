        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"How do you see it?"</p><p></p><p>"How do you see it??"  </p><p></p><p>"How should I see it?"</p><p></p><p>"How can I see it?"</p><p></p><p>Pure yang like refining, thoughts damaged, each thought forming the yuanshen scattered, transforming into three hun and seven po residing in the heavenly palace, suppressing the mud elixir palace. </p><p></p><p>Move mountains, no!</p><p></p><p>This great sacrificial wine maker from the Zixia Academy, the pure yang ancient ancestor from the barbaric times, has already refined his yuanshen and powers into the pure yang attribute. Reaching the two-in-one state of the three-in-one!</p><p></p><p>He is also the teacher spoken of by students everywhere, his disciples filling the world, his status noble, talents overflowing. On the path of spiritual attainment, he has walked a small path, with hopes of becoming a deity.</p><p></p><p>But even for such a person, after hearing Gu Jiuqing's method of spiritual attainment, he stood dazed on the spot. </p><p></p><p>Completely unaware of how to respond to Gu Jiuqing's words.</p><p></p><p>After his yuanshen was damaged, he still continued to deduce the self-evident Pangu method.</p><p></p><p>With the heavens and earth clear and bright, the great wilderness emerged. In Ban Shan Daoren's mud elixir palace, the three hun and seven po re-condensed into a seventy-zhang tall yuanshen!</p><p></p><p>The yuanshen like refined, thoughts full, evolving the inner landscape of the great wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The four great dangers!</p><p></p><p>Using mountains and lands as the body, rivers and seas as the blood and qi, wind, clouds, thunder as the vast qi, the sun and moon as the two eyes, the stars surrounding the heavens as the 365 acupoints within the flesh body.</p><p></p><p>On this great land surrounded by the four great sects, sealed as the nine provinces, the location of the great Zhou dynasty.</p><p></p><p>And this thought triggered celestial phenomena, causing great terror.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past, Ban Shan Nuo would definitely have refuted it.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor remained silent, suddenly recalling the scene when Jiang Buyu debated the Way with him.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the great Zhou, was the boundless great wilderness. </p><p></p><p>The entire great wilderness was his transformation, the Way of the great wilderness, naturally his own Way!</p><p></p><p>Such a method of spiritual attainment, such a great Way, it can be called perfect!</p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo stood up and bowed to Gu Jiuqing, "Friend's Way has greatly opened my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Wala la ——————"  </p><p></p><p>"It seems your nine revolutions golden body will rank third in the world!"</p><p></p><p>The masses, all things, re-assembled into the image of a giant figure, he is the deity transformed from the great wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The great wilderness was destroyed, and thus the Pangu clan was born!</p><p></p><p>"Your method is very perfect, but your Way is too illusory. Ban Shan Nuo's cultivation is not bad, able to evolve a real Way for you."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also studied the chaotic divine body!</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon, surrounding stars, myriad stars, qi of celestial patterns inhaling and exhaling, clouds and mists swirling.</p><p></p><p>Another great terror condensed, this great terror condensing on the fourth mountain ridge. In the farther distance, the fifth ridge, the sixth ridge, also had great terrors gathering.</p><p></p><p>That time, Jiang Buyu was also debating about the divine body.</p><p></p><p>That was indeed the great sacrificial wine maker of Zixia Academy, admitting it himself.</p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo looked at the giant figure he had evolved, praising it repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Liang Xiao has indeed studied the divine body!"</p><p></p><p>The inner landscape intertwined into form within the mud elixir palace. Ban Shan Nuo infused his own powers into the inner landscape, projecting the inner landscape outwards, forming a real scene.</p><p></p><p>A majestic deity appeared on Bulao Peak.</p><p></p><p>That was the myriad Ways submitting!  </p><p></p><p>That was the Heavenly Mandate being carried!</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the other mountain ridges in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Containing all divine bodies in the world, fusing them into the form of chaos.</p><p></p><p>If able to condense such a divine body, achieving the Way and realizing the Dao would certainly be possible.</p><p></p><p>But now, this great sacrificial wine maker was immersed in the perfection of the Pangu divine body, unable to extricate himself. Deducing the great wilderness repeatedly, wanting to verify the most perfect Pangu divine body!</p><p></p><p>"Ban Shan Nuo, your nine revolutions golden body cultivated from the Heavenly Furnace of Ten Thousand Worlds method claims to be the number one divine body. Now without even encountering Jiang Buyu's chaotic divine body, it has lost to this junior's Pangu divine body."</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one, he is using your method to prove his own Way."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing heard the voice of the unknown forbidden land's master from deep within the Eight Trigrams Ridge, his brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>The northern lands, western territories, southern ridges, eastern wilderness! The four great sects guarded the four great dangers.</p><p></p><p>On Bulao Peak, a great continent emerged in midair, surrounded by myriad stars filling the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze flickered, also staring at this great wilderness continent.  </p><p></p><p>The continent floating in midair, the heavens and earth shattered, all things returning to one, all living beings melting away.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this sentence that established Gu Jiuqing's Way as the number one great Way of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was the ancient forbidden land ancestors awakening, but they did not complete their awakening, only awakening a strand of thought.</p><p></p><p>"This is the self-evident Pangu method!"</p><p></p><p>This is far more difficult to achieve than Gu Jiuqing's illusory evolution.</p><p></p><p>His figure was vast and boundless, each strand of hair standing upright, his exaggerated muscles bulging high, countless halos formed around his body, with various auras of the great Dao swirling at his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect! Too perfect!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor stared at this scene, also sighing in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was startled in his heart!</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had made a mistake. He told the sect about Senior Brother Gu cultivating the chaotic divine body method. He thought Gu Jiuqing needed so many chaotic divine body methods in order to cultivate the chaotic divine body.  </p><p></p><p>Only now did he realize that Gu Jiuqing wanted to cultivate the Pangu divine body.</p><p></p><p>Wala————</p><p></p><p>A strand of scrutinizing gaze fell, causing Lu Yuan's hair to stand on end, feeling his entire body being probed by an unknown gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The Sun Divine Body? There are not many great wilderness cultivator clans practicing the Sun Divine Body, you have the aura of that Great Sun Heaven! It seems you are a descendant of the Great Sun Heaven lineage."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Heaven, an ancient ancestor of the Lu family from four thousand years ago. He discovered the Taiyi Indestructible Divine Gold, using all the family's inherited teachings to forge the Taiyi Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>And he was a celestial immortal who had crossed the catastrophe realm, a renowned existence in the great wilderness back then.</p><p></p><p>That forbidden land master actually recognized Lu Yuan's ancestor.</p><p></p><p>This forbidden land master was also an ancient ancestor from the barbaric times!</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Jiuqing's sigh fell, that strand of great terror had already attacked.</p><p></p><p>This scrutinizing gaze, different from the Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor and Ban Shan Nuo, was too overbearing, brazenly rushing into Gu Jiuqing's physical body, wanting to probe his origin!!</p><p></p><p>He was searching for traces of Gu Jiuqing cultivating the Pangu divine body.</p><p></p><p>Boom————————</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Tiger Bell flew out, its 1,800 spirit patterns rippling, linking into a piece, about to fully activate!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A thousand pattern divine weapon?"</p><p></p><p>He was completely unconcerned. He was almost dead anyway, what did he care about? Moreover, it was just a thousand pattern divine weapon, if he awakened he could destroy it with a flick of his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon and white fox performed on the great bell, their Dao rhymes condensing into a piece, the Dao and principles dripping down, evolving into the Heavenly Traces.  </p><p></p><p>The probing sensation on Gu Jiuqing's body lessened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Another divine weapon flew out from Buzhou Mountain!</p><p></p><p>This was a spirit pearl, hanging above Gu Jiuqing's head, evolving into the image of stars.</p><p></p><p>Within it, one of the stars condensed into a physical form - it was the Star Pearl!</p><p></p><p>"The Star Pearl? You are from the great wilderness Sword Sect, how do you have such a high-quality Star Pearl?"</p><p></p><p>The third forbidden land master no longer remained nonchalant, his gaze falling even more intently.</p><p></p><p>The third divine weapon also flew out.</p><p></p><p>It was a bronze cauldron!!</p><p></p><p>This bronze cauldron was plain and ordinary, just a common thousand pattern divine weapon. But as soon as it flew out, it drew the full gaze of the third forbidden land master.</p><p></p><p>Even the Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor and Ban Shan Nuo turned their eyes towards it.</p><p></p><p>"It's Junior Jiang's cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed this stubborn one has caught Junior Jiang's eye."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor's voice carried a strange tone.</p><p></p><p>The third forbidden land master withdrew his gaze, no longer continuing to probe Gu Jiuqing's secrets.  </p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo looked at Gu Jiuqing, smiling calmly.</p><p></p><p>"That old rascal is just a vulgar person, bullying the weak and fearing the strong. He saw you had Junior Jiang's divine weapon and clearly became afraid."</p><p></p><p>Afraid of Senior Brother Liang Xiao?</p><p></p><p>A forbidden land ancient ancestor would fear my master?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's three divine weapons hovered above his head, his powers guiding them, pulling the three divine weapons into the peak of Buzhou Mountain, continuing to suppress the 13,300 dragon and elephant forms and nine parts of the sword will.</p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo patiently explained, </p><p></p><p>"Your master is a True Man, surpassing even celestial immortals with nothing lacking. That old rascal crossed the nine levels of pure yang lightning tribulation, his yuanshen only half pure yang. Junior Jiang is very curious about him. If he dares to act against you, Junior Jiang will have a chance to take action against him!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao dares to take action against an ancient ancestor?  </p><p></p><p>What trump card does my master have?</p><p></p><p>To make even these barbaric ancient ancestors so wary?</p><p></p><p>Just one divine weapon that Senior Brother Liang Xiao used in the past was enough to scare the third forbidden land master into not saying more!!</p><p></p><p>Such brilliance, I am far from matching.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing once again acknowledged Senior Brother Liang Xiao's talents.</p><p></p><p>"Humph!"</p><p></p><p>The third forbidden land master was unsatisfied in secret, only coldly snorting.</p><p></p><p>Gaze after gaze gathered on Gu Jiuqing again, watching as he had completely comprehended the method of the self-evident Pangu method.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, this method is called the self-evident Pangu method, does it have any particulars?"</p><p></p><p>Pangu?</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>They had never heard of it before, was it the name of a deity? Or the true name of an ancient ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked towards the azure sky, the moonlight like water, pouring down on the moon.</p><p></p><p>In the starry depths, the surrounding stars hung high.</p><p></p><p>"Don't these heavens look round?"  </p><p></p><p>Round heavens?</p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo nodded, there were some similarities.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about this earth?"</p><p></p><p>"The great Zhou is surrounded by the four great dangers, isn't it square, like a jade plate?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the plate!"</p><p></p><p>"Pangu Pangu, the ancient heavens!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams ancient ancestor suddenly understood, so that's how it was.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the self-evident Pangu method, the body transforming into all things, wasn't that what people called the heavens?</p><p></p><p>The ancient heavens! The Pangu clan!  </p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo was first startled, then revealed an unhappy expression.</p><p></p><p>His voice was somewhat cold. Gu Jiuqing also didn't understand why Ban Shan Nuo would have such a big reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, although your self-evident Pangu method is wondrous, is there a method to cultivate it and achieve the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Only the Way, no method, how can one achieve the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing laughed heartily, "Naturally there is a method to achieve the Dao."</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>Deep in the forbidden area, the sixth, seventh, and eighth mountain ridges all rippled with the aura of great terror.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the dead first ridge forbidden land master, the remaining seven forbidden land masters all awakened, waiting for Gu Jiuqing's method to achieve the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"My single method is simple to explain, largely similar to Senior Brother Liang Xiao's chaotic divine body."</p><p></p><p>Ban Shan Nuo's expression turned cold, his thin small figure staring at Gu Jiuqing, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"There are many divine bodies in the world. The Gu family has the Golden Crow Divine Body, the Lu family has the Sun Divine Body, there is also the Mountain River Divine Body, the True Dragon Divine Body, the Celestial Patterns Divine Body, the Wood Divine Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Use the origin of divine bodies to replace all living things, cultivate the world's divine bodies, condense the origins of all things, forging the body of Pangu!"</p><p></p><p>Once Gu Jiuqing's method was revealed, anyone could cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>This kind of method...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It sounded simple, but it was easily broken.</p><p></p><p>When the two masters of the Forbidden Realm of Bulao Peak moved, the other five masters of the Forbidden Realms also fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>They realized!</p><p></p><p>This was the best way to cultivate the Pangu Dharma, simple and easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>Only!</p><p></p><p>Banshan No suddenly laughed. His voice was extremely cold, as if he had a deep grudge against Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This was just because Gu Jiuqing explained the phrase "the heavens are round and the earth is square"!</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, in the cultivation of divine bodies in the world, except for Jiang Buyu, one can only cultivate one divine body. If two divine bodies accompany you on Buzhou Mountain, you will explode! Even if you forcefully suppress your primordial spirit, to attain the Pangu Dharma requires dozens or even hundreds of divine bodies. It's impossible for anyone to suppress so many primordial spirits!"</p><p></p><p>This path truly exists, but the road leading to it is impassable!</p><p></p><p>The path to divinity has been severed!</p><p></p><p>"Heh, if you're like Jiang Buyu, extracting others' primordial spirits and refining them, how is that different from the Chaos Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>The paths walked are the same - one is to attain the Chaos Divine Body, the other is to attain the ancient Pangu heavens! In the end, isn't it all about becoming a divine being?</p><p></p><p>So his Nine Cycles Golden Body Dharma should at least rank second!</p><p></p><p>Scorching gazes fell upon Gu Jiuqing, sensing the intentions of those Forbidden Realm masters to refute him.</p><p></p><p>If this method could work for them, what obstacle would there be? </p><p></p><p>What obstacle? </p><p></p><p>Reviving in this life, reversing rebirth in every life, the Trinity would be easy - it's even possible to become a divine being!</p><p></p><p>They had pinned their hopes on Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Banshan No, at the Eight Trigrams Patriarch, and then towards the Forbidden Mountain Ranges.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have made a decision, and his three primordial spirits flew out of his body one by one!</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow Divine Body primordial spirit manifested as a three-legged golden crow perched atop Gu Jiuqing's head!</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Divine Body primordial spirit manifested as the image of a roc floating between heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Then the Dragon Elephant primordial spirit also manifested as a dragon elephant.</p><p></p><p>Among the three primordial spirit manifestations, the Dragon Elephant was the most substantial, while the other two were similar.</p><p></p><p>"Three primordial spirits??" </p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Apart from him, the other Forbidden Realm masters showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Just three primordial spirits!</p><p></p><p>With their power, suppressing these three would be easy, but what about ten primordial spirits? Twenty different primordial spirits?</p><p></p><p>Their physical bodies would explode!</p><p></p><p>That would be a path to death! Impossible to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his primordial spirits and said solemnly, "This is my path, the path to divinity, every step is arduous, but the path lies where my heart goes!"</p><p></p><p>He bowed to Banshan No.</p><p></p><p>"So I must refuse your path, Senior."</p><p></p><p>The Six Cycles Golden Body Dharma was not bad, he would have the opportunity to pass it to the Blue Planet for them to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it, my path is indeed unsuitable for you."</p><p></p><p>Banshan No left!</p><p></p><p>He left quickly, his thin small figure taking a step to the third mountain range.</p><p></p><p>This Senior continued sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>The great terrors disappeared from the mountain ranges one by one, and those Forbidden Realm masters also dispersed their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The debate was over, leaving only the Eight Trigrams Patriarch standing on Bulao Peak.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Elder looked at Gu Jiuqing with a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to pass his path down to Gu Jiuqing, but his path was insignificant to Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>The path of self-attaining Pangu had already been severed. But a talent who could conceive of such a method would still be able to forge his own path to divinity.</p><p></p><p>"Eight Trigrams Patriarch, I heard you say before that your life was about to flicker out. This revival must be your last chance."</p><p></p><p>"If you can't pass down your lineage, your Eight Trigrams path will be severed."</p><p></p><p>Those were the words from Banshan No on the third mountain range.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch sighed and looked towards Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You are a disciple of the Great Sun Celestial lineage. Although I have never met the Great Sun Celestial, as a celestial bloodline, your talents must be considerable."</p><p></p><p>"Kneel down and kowtow to me. I will pass the Eight Trigrams path to you."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch had no choice.</p><p></p><p>This was his last revival, his Deathless Body had lost its spiritual nature. If he didn't pass down his path, he would dissipate into the Dao.</p><p></p><p>His methods were fused into the Deathless Body, and his primordial spirit and powers would also dissipate!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hurriedly shook his head, "No need, no need, I appreciate the Patriarch's kindness."</p><p></p><p>Accept the lineage of a pure Yang elder?</p><p></p><p>Heh, only a fool would accept.</p><p></p><p>Was he, Lu Yuan, a fool?</p><p></p><p>He was following Senior Martial Brother Gu just fine. Why bother cultivating this path?</p><p></p><p>Didn't you see Senior Martial Brother defeat even the Great Brewmaster in debate? Senior Martial Brother's path to divinity was assured.</p><p></p><p>Cultivate the Eight Trigrams path? Could it be faster than Senior Martial Brother's path to divinity?</p><p></p><p>How bitter the cultivation would be?</p><p></p><p>You all know it.</p><p></p><p>Years of secluded meditation, intensive study of theories, comprehending divine abilities, researching those damn spirit symbols and talismans, memorizing all those patterns!</p><p></p><p>I, Lu Yuan, dislike reading books, and dislike studying talismans just as much.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the Eight Trigrams path, I'd have to disperse my Sun Divine Body and solely cultivate the Eight Trigrams Divine Body, then cultivate the Eight Trigrams divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>No way, young master ain't doing it!!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch had been rejected too many times, and was numb to it.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You mean you agree?"</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll guide you in cultivation then!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch's Deathless Body transformed into a pool of water, merging into Lu Yuan's flesh in the time of a breath.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are my Eight Trigrams Patriarch's disciple. I will borrow your Mud Pill Palace to suppress this Deathless Body, for at most fifty years before I dissipate into the Dao."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch's voice grew weaker and weaker, eventually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He had taken residence in Lu Yuan's Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>At this, the Yanluo Pagoda appeared in Lu Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"At your age, how can you still be so shameless?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan cried.</p><p></p><p>The Mud Pill Palace was his most vulnerable spot. From now on, the Eight Trigrams Patriarch would force him to cultivate, and he could not refuse.</p><p></p><p>He frowned bitterly and presented the Yanluo Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, this treasure pagoda belongs to its original owner!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Old thing, don't call me that. He is my Senior Martial Brother. What's mine is his. Although you're my master, Senior Martial Brother Gu is my senior. If you keep this up, I'll go to the Sword Sect and ask the Celestials to intervene. If the Celestials can't do it, I'll ask the Sect Master to expel you from my Mud Pill Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan rebuked angrily!</p><p></p><p>His Senior Martial Brother was supreme!</p><p></p><p>This would never change.</p><p></p><p>The voice from the Mud Pill Palace indeed grew quieter.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan regained his composure and stood behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we should leave the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Realm first."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the Yanluo Pagoda, a divine weapon forged from the combined fleshly bodies. This divine weapon was of extremely high grade, currently a thousand-pattern divine weapon, and would soon be upgraded to a great weapon, or even a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing exited the Eight Trigrams Ridge much faster than when he entered. He even rode on sword energies, flying out of the second mountain range before landing on the first.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, why are you leaving so hurriedly?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the mountain, his Senior Martial Brother was not rushed or anxious at all. Why was he in such a hurry leaving?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked back at the second, third, and fourth mountain ranges, only speaking after seeing no great terrors surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>"It was Senior Banshan No reminding me!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Banshan No was reminding you, Senior Martial Brother?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled bitterly. "Yes, it was Senior Banshan No reminding me!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Banshan No's attitude towards me changed because I mentioned 'the heavens are round and the earth is square' - he is the Great Brewmaster of the Zhouxi Academy, advocating scholarship. But that phrase is an outdated theory, so naturally Senior disliked it."</p><p></p><p>"But as the Great Brewmaster, how could he be so petty!"  </p><p></p><p>"Then he brought up Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao's Chaos Divine Body. In our debate, why did he bring up someone else's path?"</p><p></p><p>In a debate between two people, what did it mean to invoke someone else's path?</p><p></p><p>That was Banshan No reminding Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's self-attaining Pangu method was too astonishing, awakening the Forbidden Realm masters one by one to investigate.</p><p></p><p>If the Pangu method could truly work, then a path to divinity would be revealed before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Patriarch could not take over another's body due to his Deathless state.</p><p></p><p>Banshan No was the teacher of all scholars in the world, disdaining such methods.</p><p></p><p>But what about the other Forbidden Realm masters?</p><p></p><p>Even if they obtained the complete path to divinity, could they progress faster than taking over others' bodies?</p><p></p><p>After realizing this, Gu Jiuqing did not conceal anything, but openly manifested the three primordial spirit forms.  </p><p></p><p>If he had hidden it, those Forbidden Realm masters might have attacked from the shadows!</p><p></p><p>But by openly displaying his path, it indirectly proved that even the creator of the self-attaining Pangu method could only cultivate three primordial spirits.</p><p></p><p>The path of the Pangu Divine Body had already been severed!</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they would not investigate further and let Gu Jiuqing leave the Forbidden Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Senior Martial Brother Liang Xiao also encountered a similar issue when debating in the Eight Trigrams Ridge."</p><p></p><p>And the one who resolved this matter was the Eight Trigrams Patriarch!!</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Lu Yuan was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"So there were so many layers to this."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, um, the Eight Trigrams Patriarch wants me to ask you, has your path truly been severed?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Lu Yuan, his trusted aide, and had no need to hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"No, my path has a very broad future, and this is not my only path."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze deepened as he looked towards the mountain range below.</p><p></p><p>There, a seven-colored spirit-nurturing divine herb was blooming vigorously, having unfolded to the green color of its seven red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet hues.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the divine herb, in various deep pits, lay corpses from the Celestial Pavilion and Sword Sect, even Sword Immortals had fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that, old thing? Could talents like my Senior Martial Brother's be measured by the likes of you?"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't doubt what Senior Martial Brother says."</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, a clear pool of water remained, the form of the Eight Trigrams Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his head was pounding, feeling rather ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>"To think I wanted to accept such a person as my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buyu?</p><p></p><p>This was a second Jiang Buyu!</p><p></p><p>And an elderly, deeply calculating Jiang Buyu at that!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was unhappy that the Eight Trigrams Patriarch doubted his Senior Martial Brother's talents.</p><p></p><p>He then looked down at the mountain range below and also saw the mountain of corpses!!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters! Self-ordering is fine too, cough cough, this chapter got a bit long.</p><p></p><p>There's still one more!</p><p></p><p>I'll go write it right away.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the eighth day of the nine-day grand examination at Jianmen Pass, starting from the morning, quite a few people had completed their first Tui Fan (shedding of mortal form). </p><p></p><p>Their qi and blood burst through the Baihui acupoint, forming cascades of qi and blood hanging above their heads. Such an extraordinary sight was everywhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Even Lu Buye had completed his first Tui Fan. </p><p></p><p>The ripples of qi and blood washed over his muscles, bones, membranes, and internal organs, leaving his entire physical body perfect and flawless, cleansed of its mortal dross. He looked much more vigorous and handsome.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but play with the Bawang Tripod!</p><p></p><p>He easily lifted the thousand-pound tripod, exhibiting superhuman strength beyond that of ordinary mortals - the majestic power that comes after a Tui Fan, transcending the limits of common people.</p><p></p><p>After playing with the Bawang Tripod for a long time, Lu Buye finally put down the great tripod. </p><p></p><p>He had participated in the Jianmen trials with the wish of joining the outer sect of Jianmen. Now that he had completed one Tui Fan and achieved his goal, he had no intention of continuing his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He walked over to Qu Yaozhu's side. </p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu was still practicing the Dragon and Elephant Skill. At his feet were many empty medicine bottles. In order to complete three Tui Fans, Qu Yaozhu had continuously consumed medicines over these past few days, even eating a 500-year-old ginseng root.</p><p></p><p>"Lululuuu——"</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood circulated within, washing his bones, tempering his internal organs. His muscles, bones and membranes became an integrated whole.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from the third Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be able to attempt the third Tui Fan today, and at most complete it tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu was confident that he would complete three Tui Fans during this examination trial and join the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>As he continued cultivating, in the distance, streaks of blood-red qi crisscrossed the sky, soaring seven or eight zhang into the void!</p><p></p><p>Such an ominous sight was too astonishing. This was not a first or second Tui Fan, but someone had completed the third Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has completed the third Tui Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu's hands paused in mid-air as he looked towards the blood-red streaks of qi.</p><p></p><p>It was a scholar, adorned with jade chimes, his hands outstretched as the Dragon and Elephant imagery intertwined with the qi above his head, forming a massive Dragon and Elephant figure amidst the boundless qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The precious jade ornaments he wore continuously collided and shattered, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But he did not stop, continuing to practice the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli had begun his third Tui Fan. His qi and blood rose, his physical body becoming a blazing furnace. The blood-red Dragon and Elephant imagery resonated with Heaven and Earth, absorbing mysterious substances that flowed into his body, making it radiant and translucent like glass!</p><p></p><p>The transformations of Heaven and Earth, the sun and sky - his qi and blood burst forth from his body, intimately connecting with the world, directly absorbing spiritual energy to temper his flesh!</p><p></p><p>The first Tui Fan was like this, the second Tui Fan was like this, and the third Tui Fan made these changes even clearer.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious spiritual energy around him poured into Fan Shaoli's body, joining with his qi and blood to wash over every part of him, inside and out, above and below.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Shaoli! It's Fan Shaoli from Tianyuan Ancient City who has finally completed the third Tui Fan."</p><p></p><p>"So it was him."</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli's reputation in Tianyuan Ancient City was extremely famous.</p><p></p><p>But upon seeing Fan Shaoli's third Tui Fan, instead of surprise, people showed sighs of regret.</p><p></p><p>"With his talent, he should have completed the third Tui Fan long ago. During these nine days of examination, he had hopes of attempting the fourth Tui Fan, but now, Fan Shaoli and the others can at most only complete three Tui Fans."</p><p></p><p>Following Fan Shaoli's third Tui Fan, three figures by his side also entered their third Tui Fan one after another.</p><p></p><p>Three streaks of qi and blood smoke burst through their Baihui points, converging between Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Three Dragon and Elephant images merged, streaks of qi and blood spanning the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei!</p><p>Qing Yangbai!  </p><p>Xia Qingzhou!</p><p></p><p>These three talents also began their third Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, they're all undergoing Tui Fan together, as if they had discussed it."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Many young masters sighed regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli, Qing Yangbai, Xia Qingzhou, Ye Fei - they were absolutely the talents among them. On the first day they completed one Tui Fan, on the third day the second Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>If not for the dark horse that emerged from Tianyuan Ancient City disrupting their mental focus, why would these talents be like this?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, where is Gu Jiuqing from Tianyuan Ancient City?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>This young man's name from Tianyuan Ancient City was not very prominent among them.</p><p></p><p>It was only after it was rumored that Gu Jiuqing was the younger brother of the Celestial Lady of Yaochi that his name spread.</p><p></p><p>And as Gu Jiuqing completed the third Tui Fan on the fifth day, his reputation truly resounded among his peers.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing completed three Tui Fans, singlemindedly wanting to cultivate the Sword Intent to request the Sword Drawing Technique from Jianmen, causing Ye Fei and the others to cultivate the Sword Drawing Technique day and night, observing the Jade Sword Intent, wasting several days in vain."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it was because of Gu Jiuqing that these few talents only completed their third Tui Fan on the eighth day."</p><p></p><p>Sighs continued as each of the young disciples from the ancient cities looked at the distant blood-red Dragon and Elephant imagery. Only after the imagery dissipated did they avert their gazes.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, Ye Fei, Qing Yangbai, Xia Qingzhou, Fan Shaoli - it seems these five will join the inner sect this year!"</p><p></p><p>With only one day left, it was too difficult to complete the third Tui Fan within that time.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Someone noticed Gu Jiuqing's figure and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Among this batch of young disciples from the ancient cities, Gu Jiuqing was unparalleled, even surpassing Ye Fei and the others. Some secretly praised Gu Jiuqing as the number one genius of this realm!</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing has appeared. He has descended and is heading towards the Sword Testing Rock."  </p><p></p><p>"He only woke up at this hour? He really can sleep. It makes sense though - Gu Family's bloodline is ordinary, and their ancestors have never produced a Refining Immortal expert. Three Tui Fans is Gu Jiuqing's limit. For him to complete the fourth Tui Fan, it might take months, or even years."</p><p></p><p>Doubts and speculations arose, spreading around Jianmen Pass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing heard everything from all directions. After hearing the rumors, he simply smiled and passed by, even blocking out most of his five senses.</p><p></p><p>This way, the world became much quieter.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Testing Rock!</p><p></p><p>The jade sword was inserted into the rock, its sword qi sharp, its sword intent drifting about, with various profound sword teachings converging, allowing one to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>Around the Sword Testing Rock gathered around ten young disciples from the ancient cities. Most had completed two Tui Fans and knew they could not complete three within the nine days, so they sought to seize any opportunity to learn the true teachings.</p><p></p><p>Some held swords, cultivating the Sword Drawing Technique, slashing out three inches of sword qi!</p><p></p><p>Others did not carry any swords, only holding withered branches, comprehending the essence of the Sword Drawing Technique.</p><p></p><p>But more disciples were perceiving the Jade Sword Intent on the Sword Testing Rock.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli's expression was blank. Only upon seeing Gu Jiuqing did he muster a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Brother Gu slept well last night, only getting up at noon."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Brother Gu has gained any new insights?"</p><p></p><p>Those around all looked towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing who requested the Sword Drawing Technique, and he was the first to complete three Tui Fans. They wanted to know about Gu Jiuqing's sword cultivation - just how far had he progressed?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head with a wry smile, "The Way of the Sword is not so easily comprehended."</p><p></p><p>During these past few days of cultivation, Gu Jiuqing had not grasped the Sword Force at all. With all his energy focused, at most he could slash out six inches of sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Having not even comprehended the Sword Force, let alone the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sat outside the Sword Testing Rock, perceiving the Jade Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet outside the rock as figures comprehended the sword intent. No one knew how much time had passed before exclamations came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Someone else has completed the third Tui Fan!"  </p><p></p><p>"This is the sixth person to complete the third Tui Fan. It seems six people will be able to join Jianmen's inner sect this year."</p><p></p><p>The exclamations continued for a while before quieting down.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing paid no heed, observing the Sword Testing Rock, comprehending the Jade Sword Intent, constantly emptying his mind to the Way of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>But it was possible that he truly lacked the talent for swords, gaining no insights from perceiving the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>He heard footsteps, and when Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes, he saw Qu Yaozhu standing before him.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu!</p><p></p><p>Full of vigor, having just completed the third Tui Fan.</p><p></p><p>This slim young man had a vigorous and jade-like appearance, a hint of a smile in his eyes as he looked at the seated Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"We meet again."</p><p></p><p>Behind Qu Yaozhu stood Lu Buye. The other disciples from his ancient city had found another path, while those who had not completed even one Tui Fan were not qualified to follow him into the sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, it seems we have to enter the inner gate together!" </p><p></p><p>The smile in Qu Yaozhou's eyes disappeared, replaced by a chilling look.</p><p></p><p>He was the young master of the Qu family from the ancient city of Tianyuan. Among those of his generation with the "Yao" character in their names, his talents were the best. In the entire Qu family, he was the highly acclaimed son of heaven.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had slapped him in public!</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Shaoli frowned.</p><p></p><p>He knew of the grievances between Gu Jiuqing and Qu Yaozhou. As youths who came from the ancient city of Tianyuan, both had completed three metamorphoses, neither willing to submit to the other. </p><p></p><p>This was common among their fellow countrymen, but once such an incident occurred, it would often lead to a major fallout.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"If you've come to observe the Sword Testing Rock, please take a seat. If you're unwilling to comprehend the meaning of the sword, then leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>A cold voice rang out as Ye Fei looked at Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei! A disciple from an aristocratic family. His words made Qu Yaozhou's face change color.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've found a master, no wonder you're so arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou laughed loudly. "Gu Jiuqing, this matter is not over. After entering the Sword Gate, you and I will settle the score."</p><p></p><p>As Qu Yaozhou was about to leave, Gu Jiuqing stood up!</p><p></p><p>His blood surged as an overwhelming force erupted from his hands. His two arms pressed down on Qu Yaozhou's shoulders, pinning him in place.</p><p></p><p>"You want to join the Sword Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you even qualified?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could no longer tolerate it!</p><p></p><p>He enjoyed the arts of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and the friends he made in the ancient city of Tianyuan were mostly scholars and literati.</p><p></p><p>How could such an uncouth person like Qu Yaozhou be allowed to join?</p><p></p><p>To utter such insulting words?</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous force poured down, causing the ground beneath Qu Yaozhou's feet to cave in!</p><p></p><p>His legs sank two to three inches into the earth.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou's face turned red as he felt his internal organs being squeezed, as if they were about to burst.</p><p></p><p>He circulated his inner energy, employing the first form of the Dragon Elephant Skill, the "Wandering the Great Wilderness" stance, to break free from the restraint. Only then did the feeling of his organs being squeezed disappear.</p><p></p><p>As his inner energy flowed through his body, a hazy image of a dragon and elephant seemed to be gathering above Qu Yaozhou's head.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the enraged Gu Jiuqing and laughed instead.</p><p></p><p>"What? You from the Gu family dare to lay hands on someone from the Qu family?"</p><p></p><p>"When your father was alive, the Gu family didn't dare to speak disrespectfully to the Qu family, let alone take action."</p><p></p><p>"Now that your father is dead, how dare you, a mere child, act so recklessly and without restraint?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes turned red!</p><p></p><p>His father had died in an ancient ruin, but no one knew the exact circumstances.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether he was killed by the ruin's formations or plotted against by someone else. One day, he would investigate and uncover the truth.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a chance!"</p><p></p><p>"As people who came from the same ancient northern city, we'll settle this in the northern way."</p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou couldn't ask for anything better!</p><p></p><p>He never expected Gu Jiuqing to lose his temper so easily.</p><p></p><p>As an aristocratic family in decline, they couldn't even cultivate their inner energy properly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Jiuqing calmly, with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>The Qu family had a divine ability called "Morning Audience at the Celestial Gate"!</p><p></p><p>By paying homage to the Celestial Gate, they could borrow the power of their ancient ancestors. The Qu family was a prestigious clan, just one step away from becoming an aristocratic family. For so many years, they had stood firm in the northern lands, thanks to this divine ability - Morning Audience at the Celestial Gate!</p><p></p><p>Even the younger members of the Qu family could borrow the power of their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the Qu family's younger generation rarely met an untimely demise.</p><p></p><p>Fight?</p><p></p><p>Dare to fight him?</p><p></p><p>Before joining the Sword Gate, not yet disciples of the sect, to settle their conflict in the northern ancient city's way, held under the Sword Gate - the sect would not interfere!</p><p></p><p>"What? A northern duel? Qu Yaozhou wants to have a duel with Gu Jiuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"They're both heavenly talents who have undergone three metamorphoses. If they duel, it will be a matter of life and death. At this crucial time, aren't they worried about being unable to join the inner gate?"</p><p></p><p>Ah, the inner gate of the Sword Sect. Why couldn't they discuss whatever it was after joining the inner gate?</p><p></p><p>Why must they duel during the great examination?</p><p></p><p>One figure after another stood up, and the youths observing the Sword Testing Rock were also drawn in by this impending duel.</p><p></p><p>Even those practicing the Dragon Elephant Skill in the distance were stirred.</p><p></p><p>Two youths who had undergone three metamorphoses were about to duel - such a duel was too captivating.</p><p></p><p>Gaze after gaze fell upon Gu Jiuqing as they curiously watched him, wondering if this young man would agree!</p><p></p><p>"Fine!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sensed the gazes of the crowd around him and uttered this single word.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou smiled. "Good! You and I will duel in the way of the northern ancient city, disregarding life and death!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing, have you considered when you want to die?"</p><p></p><p>Morning Audience at the Celestial Gate was Qu Yaozhou's greatest trump card. He was fully confident in his ability to subdue Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the Sword Gate, slaying a fellow heavenly talent who had undergone three metamorphoses would only strengthen Qu Yaozhou's determination on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not just anyone could slay a heavenly talent of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>"At noon tomorrow, you and I will have a life-and-death duel right here!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, I hope you won't back down then."</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow is the last day of the great examination. If you back out, even if you join the Sword Gate, you'll become a laughingstock of the sect."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou was trying to cut off Gu Jiuqing's path of retreat.</p><p></p><p>With a smug expression, he left the area of the Sword Testing Rock in a flurry.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the area under the Sword Gate erupted into a commotion, and news of this even reached the sect itself.</p><p></p><p>It had been many years since a duel last occurred under the Sword Gate. However, to the sect, this matter was of little importance.</p><p></p><p>Even if both participants died, the Sword Gate would only lose two prospective disciples who had yet to join the inner gate.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sword Testing Rock, upon seeing that this duel had been decided, Xia Qingzhou couldn't help but remark:</p><p></p><p>"You were careless!"</p><p></p><p>As fellow heavenly talents, they both had absolute confidence in themselves.</p><p></p><p>They all believed they were invincible existences, the strongest among their peers.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have agreed to Qu Yaozhou so quickly. Although the Qu family is not an aristocratic family, it's because one of their ancestors joined the Sword Gate and even became an elder."</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules of the Sword Gate, after becoming an elder, one must sever ties with the ancient northern city. Otherwise, the Qu family would have risen to become an aristocratic family long ago."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing remained calm as he took his seat again.</p><p></p><p>"The Qu family has a divine ability called the 'Celestial and Earthly Yin-Yang Cycle.' It was created by that elder ancestor of theirs who joined the Sword Gate. Qu Yaozhou has not yet cultivated his inner energy, so he cannot practice this divine ability."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Qu family has another esoteric technique called 'Morning Audience at the Celestial Gate'! It allows them to borrow the power of their ancestors. With Qu Yaozhou having undergone three metamorphoses, the power he can borrow is probably three to four times his own strength."</p><p></p><p>Three to four times the power of a peer at the same level - how could Gu Jiuqing withstand that?</p><p></p><p>The other three heavenly talents from aristocratic families frowned, inwardly lamenting the unfortunate situation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed one of the family's heavenly talents was about to fall.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly. As a scholar, how could he so easily fall into a trap?</p><p></p><p>This was his intentional ploy!</p><p></p><p>He had said he wanted to kill Qu Yaozhou.</p><p></p><p>And to kill Qu Yaozhou, the best opportunity was before he joined the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Once he became a disciple of the sect, killing someone within the Sword Gate would carry far too severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at Xia Qingzhou with curiosity and inquired:</p><p></p><p>"Why can Qu Yaozhou only borrow three to four times his own strength? Is it because of his ancestor's limitations or some other reason?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingzhou was taken aback!</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>What kind of question was Gu Jiuqing asking?</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he be worried about tomorrow's duel?</p><p></p><p>Why was he inquiring about the power of Morning Audience at the Celestial Gate?</p><p></p><p>Was he trying to understand this divine ability in order to find a way to counter it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Gu Jiuqing also had a trump card?</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the limitations of the physical body? Then how many times can we break through the shackles of our physical bodies?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked Xia Qingzhou seriously.</p><p></p><p>This concerned the number of metamorphoses he could undergo!</p><p></p><p>What kind of question was this?</p><p></p><p>Looking at Gu Jiuqing, Xia Qingzhou felt he might have overthought the situation.</p><p></p><p>Updates are in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Two chapters combined, nearly 5,000 words!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more readers!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Among the mountain ridges, a figure came striding over.</p><p></p><p>His figure was blurred, not existing in the human world, yet appearing in the mortal realm, becoming a taboo of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>Different from the Eight Trigrams Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder's form was blurred because his primordial spirit, magic powers, physical body, and divine abilities had all transformed into the Fountain of Youth, forming his own immortal true body.</p><p></p><p>But this person's physical body was terrifyingly powerful to the extreme. When Gu Jiuqing's gaze fell upon him, his vision was shattered by a horrifying force.</p><p></p><p>This was what caused their perception of this person's figure and appearance to be blurred and distorted.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he said, "I created the Jixia Academy to recruit talents from all over for the Great Zhou Dynasty. After just a few hundred years of its establishment, the national strength of Great Zhou became extremely powerful. My disciples spread across the nine states, all addressing me as Master."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist, the Mountain-Moving Sage!</p><p></p><p>Founder of the Jixia Academy, addressed as Master by the world!</p><p></p><p>Born before me, achieved the Dao before me, a great talent born transcendent - this is a true Master!</p><p></p><p>That was the ultimate attainment from the lifelong study of countless talents.</p><p>Each scholarly person could radiate their own brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"Since your physical body does not decay, and you have reached the level of independent creation, after my death, you can inherit the position of the Second Grand Preceptor of the Jixia Academy."</p><p></p><p>"Master, how did you end up appearing on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>The Unified Theory of the Three Great Secret Realms! The Secret Realm of Qi Cultivation, the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation, the Secret Realm of Spirit Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Those from the Four Great Sects and Four Dangerous Regions would all conceal their identities to sneak into the Jixia Academy and learn in secret.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Ancient Heavenly City, Gu Jiuqing had thought about traveling the nine states to go to the Divine Capital and join the Jixia Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Secret Realm of Qi Cultivation, the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation, the Secret Realm of Spirit Cultivation - they intertwined and took form in the palm of his hand as three celestial realms.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor, a figure from the 8,000-year-old Primordial Era, had taken residence in the forbidden land of the moon and was about to die.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this news from the Mountain-Moving Daoist, Gu Jiuqing still found it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist laughed heartily, "Why would I appear on the moon? Naturally, it is because I am about to die as well."</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing had not joined the Sword Sect, he would have headed south to the Great Zhou Dynasty, joined the Jixia Academy, and become a student.</p><p></p><p>All scholars in the world were addressed as students! Gu Jiuqing had read many of the teachings disseminated from the Jixia Academy, so it was reasonable for him to address the Mountain-Moving Daoist as Master and be called a student himself.</p><p></p><p>Physical body cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>Everything transmitted from the Jixia Academy would shake the world.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Academy recruited talents from all over.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Mountain-Moving Daoist appeared on the Immortal Peak, standing beside the Eight Trigrams Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist stared at Gu Jiuqing, his skinny figure forming a stark contrast with the Master.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist smiled and accepted Gu Jiuqing's respectful bow.</p><p></p><p>That immortal elder on the first mountain ridge, no one knew which year he died.</p><p></p><p>The Jixia Academy!</p><p></p><p>According to the Mountain-Moving Daoist, he had done extensive research on the path of physical body cultivation. With such a skinny true form, how abnormal could his physical body be?</p><p></p><p>"Life and death, I, this Master, have long since let go of such concerns. It's just that the profound knowledge I've attained, those incompetent preceptors have only learned a small portion. After I die, this body of knowledge will dissipate, and I don't know who can reassemble it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly bowed to the Mountain-Moving Daoist.</p><p></p><p>A generation's Grand Preceptor, the creator of the Jixia Academy, with disciples all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Was this venerable Master also about to die?</p><p></p><p>"Destiny? It's not destiny, it's this old man's destiny!"</p><p></p><p>And such a grand academy was created by the Mountain-Moving Daoist's own hands.</p><p></p><p>It was the dream land for scholars, the best platform for all those brimming with knowledge to showcase their talents.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's imagination, the Grand Preceptor who created the Jixia Academy should be a great talent brimming with profound knowledge, right?</p><p></p><p>How could he be so skinny?</p><p></p><p>"I can see you have great potential, so don't be in a hurry to refuse."</p><p></p><p>But the Mountain-Moving Daoist had never rejected anyone from joining the Jixia Academy to cultivate, regardless of their talents.</p><p></p><p>This was the second master of a forbidden land that Gu Jiuqing had encountered. The master of the first mountain ridge had already died, so he didn't count.</p><p></p><p>His magnanimity commanded respect.</p><p></p><p>The skinny figure of the Mountain-Moving Daoist extended his hand, manifesting the three secret realms one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Student Jiuqing greets the Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder chuckled beside them.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Forbidden Land was where only the most senior of the undying elders would reside.</p><p></p><p>Primordial Magnetic Divine Light! Using the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light to forge the Celestial Web Star Chess!</p><p></p><p>He was curious!</p><p></p><p>But he didn't overstep, not wanting the Eight Trigrams Elder to take action and probe Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist didn't respond to the Eight Trigrams Elder and continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing couldn't help but feel admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when Jiang Buyu entered the Eight Trigrams Ridge, I missed the opportunity. But today, when this junior friend enters the Eight Trigrams Ridge, I happened to encounter him. This is destiny."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing understood the Mountain-Moving Daoist's intention as he looked at the three celestial realms.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to expound his own Dao, using it to persuade Gu Jiuqing to become his inner disciple.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've heard of the cultivation of the three secret realms, so I won't elaborate further."</p><p></p><p>The three secret realms, cultivating any one of them to the extreme could lead to divinity.</p><p></p><p>The three secret realms in the Mountain-Moving Daoist's palm separated, with the Secret Realm of Qi Cultivation becoming a river of stars, the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation becoming a human form, and the Secret Realm of Spirit Cultivation becoming a primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Since your physical body does not decay, among the three secret realms, you can follow the path of the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation, which is also my area of greatest attainment."</p><p></p><p>The human form manifested from the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation moved, demonstrating the profound mysteries of this single realm.</p><p></p><p>"The human body's cultivation is essentially about forging the physical body. After strengthening the vital energy and blood, the spirit, essence, and vitality will flourish. The 'Unique Qi and Blood' principle that Junior Jiang spoke of, cultivating the vital energy and blood to empower the physical body and nourish the great path, is precisely this!"</p><p></p><p>The Unique Qi and Blood, nourishing the great path through vital energy and blood - this was the knowledge expounded by Senior Quan Xiaoshi nine hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>Only with powerful vital energy and blood can the physical body become powerful. Cultivating based on this theory allowed the Eight Trigrams Elder's single drop of blood to collapse an entire mountain ridge.</p><p></p><p>"I have studied the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation for a long time and created the 'Celestial and Earthly Furnace, Eternal Cultivation Method.' After obtaining Junior Jiang's 'Unique Qi and Blood' knowledge, this single method of the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation has reached its pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>The human figure in his palm suddenly moved!</p><p></p><p>The small humanoid disassembled, turning into a pool of vital energy and blood, with bones and flesh separating, tendons and vessels peeling away, and the five viscera and six bowels congealing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at this miniature figure!</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely captivated by the Mountain-Moving Daoist's Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even the Eight Trigrams Elder listened attentively without interrupting the Mountain-Moving Daoist's exposition of his Dao.</p><p></p><p>The skinny old figure seemed to become magnificent, like a giant standing at the pinnacle of the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"With heaven and earth as the furnace, the laws of creation as the craft, yin and yang as the fuel, and all things as the copper ore."</p><p></p><p>"Why not take the human as the elixir pill, with heaven and earth as the smelting furnace, refining the pill into medicine, forging the supreme divine pill?"</p><p></p><p>This was the study of the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>A furnace condensed, and the small humanoid reassembled, entering the furnace.</p><p></p><p>"I have divided the Secret Realm of Body Cultivation into nine levels. Each level is ten times more profound than the previous, and the materials required for each level increase exponentially."</p><p></p><p>"The first level is the Solidified Golden Body, using star sand and sea iron as the base, melting a thousand-year-old spirit herb, and supplementing it with the vital energy of demons and monsters to fuse into the physical body, attaining the first level Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>Star sand!</p><p>Sea iron! These were materials used for forging divine weapons, not particularly rare. A few hundred spirit stones could gather these materials, but the quantity mattered.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-year-old spirit herb was much more valuable.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation method for the first level Golden Body was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing now understood the Mountain-Moving Daoist's Dao!</p><p></p><p>He was refining himself into a golden pill, with nine levels representing the stages before achieving divinity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing guessed that the Mountain-Moving Daoist must have made a mistake during his own refinement process.</p><p></p><p>A Master had ended up refining himself to death.</p><p></p><p>And in the recent era, there were many such Masters who had attempted unorthodox methods to achieve divinity.</p><p></p><p>But the path to divinity was never so easily attained, was it?</p><p></p><p>"The second level Golden Body requires gathering sun and moon essence iron, condensing the vast primordial qi, and infusing demon's blood into the furnace!"</p><p></p><p>"The third level Golden Body..."</p><p></p><p>The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh level Golden Bodies!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist listed them all in one breath before pausing.</p><p></p><p>"When I was cultivating the seventh level Golden Body, an error occurred. However, you have the capacity to inherit my Dao. The seventh level can be perfected, and breaking through to the eighth level realm should be no problem!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't mention the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Because the seventh level already meant an unmatched physical body, stronger than even a pure yang body!</p><p></p><p>As for the eighth level, it surpassed the three-in-one true body!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing memorized all the materials needed for cultivating up to the sixth level Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan, who was present, also recorded them.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist did not conceal anything. He didn't explain the seventh level, only feeling that it was not perfect enough.</p><p></p><p>If he rashly transmitted it, there might be another Mountain-Moving Sage in the world who ended up refining himself to death.</p><p></p><p>The first level Golden Body allowed flight, the second level allowed traversing rivers, the third level allowed subduing dragons, the fourth level was indestructible, the fifth level was all-pervading, and the sixth level was virtual divinity!</p><p></p><p>With enough materials, even just these six levels of the Golden Body could establish another major sect.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist dispersed the manifestation of his Dao and looked at Gu Jiuqing with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, are you willing to become my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>To take the Mountain-Moving Daoist as his master, inherit the Jixia Academy, become the Second Grand Preceptor, and cultivate the nine levels of the Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder also pricked up his ears, waiting for Gu Jiuqing's answer!</p><p></p><p>"My Senior Brother has been taken notice of by another venerable elder?"</p><p></p><p>That was the Grand Preceptor of the Jixia Academy, an extremely prestigious position. Even the Son of Heaven of the Great Zhou Dynasty had to address the Mountain-Moving Daoist as "Student"!</p><p></p><p>If he became the Mountain-Moving Daoist's inner disciple, even the Son of Heaven would have to call Gu Jiuqing "Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan felt more and more that his decision to follow Gu Jiuqing as his senior brother's companion when he joined the Sword Sect was the right choice.</p><p></p><p>Several figures all looked towards Gu...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Jiuqing, they were all waiting. </p><p></p><p>At Bulao Peak, the two masters of the forbidden grounds were amiable and approachable preachers, both wanting Gu Jiuqing to become their respective realized disciple.</p><p></p><p>Being watched so intently by the two masters of the forbidden grounds, Gu Jiuqing felt a bit flustered. </p><p></p><p>The way of the Eight Trigrams Ancestor required seeing through all of Gu Jiuqing's illusions before he could cultivate to the pure yang realm.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor's way was the first to be denied.</p><p></p><p>Then what about the way of the Mountain-Moving Daoist?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart wavered, that was his childhood dream, and it was also a direct path to heaven, becoming the great libation master of the Jixia Academy, with all students under heaven addressing him as master!!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he was tempted.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>There was one thing he wanted to prove.</p><p></p><p>The body refining method! Was the Nine Cycles Golden Body, the Ten Thousand Year Heavenly Furnace Method truly the number one body refining method?</p><p></p><p>He created and proved his own Pangu Method, always believing this was the most powerful method to refine the divine body, condensing the primordial essence of the world to prove Pangu.</p><p></p><p>If he joined the Mountain-Moving Daoist as a disciple, that would be admitting that his self-proven Pangu Method was inferior to the Nine Cycles Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>There was also one more thing!</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to verify!!</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes of these two masters, Gu Jiuqing sat down on the ground, simply sweeping away the scattered stones around him to sit on Bulao Peak.</p><p></p><p>He extended his hand and said, "Friends of the Way, please."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he smiled and bowed deeply to Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>After that, he sat down across from Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This was a great courtesy!</p><p></p><p>With his status as a master, who would dare accept his bow?</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing accepted it at this moment, and did not even stand up.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was shocked, he had already guessed what Gu Qing was going to do.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, he, he wants to debate the Way with this master!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing addressed the Mountain-Moving Daoist as a friend of the Way, and the Mountain-Moving Daoist responded accordingly, this was the conduct of a debate on the Way.</p><p></p><p>A genius of the current era debating the Way with an immortal who had lived for four or five thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan could not imagine such a scene.</p><p></p><p>But it was happening right before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor let out a wry laugh at this sight.</p><p></p><p>"This stubborn one is really stubborn, he's debating the Way with Jiang Xiaoyu."</p><p></p><p>He was proving to the two immortal masters that his talents were no less than Jiang Buyu's.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could have just spoken his mind directly.</p><p></p><p>Why reenact the scene of Jiang Buyu entering the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Ground to debate the Way nine hundred years ago?</p><p></p><p>On Bulao Peak, the Mountain-Moving Daoist sat down, a slight smile on his face, his thin small stature not at all connecting him to being the number one cultivator in the world.</p><p></p><p>Across from him sat a scholarly genius with an overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>Facing the current era's greatest libation master, he showed no signs of retreat at this moment, instead extending an arm again.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that your Nine Cycles Method is the number one secret method for body refinement. Cultivating this method can reach the Nine Cycles Realm and communicate with spirits."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart raced, this was the first time he was expounding his own Way to others.</p><p></p><p>It was also the first time he was debating the Way!</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Tomb of Sword Gate, he could only watch Senior Brother Liang Xiao and Si Wuxie "debate the Way."</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>He had finally become a "Master of the Way", debating with an ancient immortal from the primordial era, and one of the most knowledgeable people in the world!</p><p></p><p>This sense of achievement surpassed the joy of joining Sword Gate!!</p><p></p><p>"Friend of the Way, please!"</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Master gestured for Gu Jiuqing to continue, and he listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>Debating the Way, debating the Way!</p><p></p><p>This was a tradition passed down from antiquity. Junior cultivators could debate the Way, great cultivators could debate the Way, True Immortals, Celestials, even Semi-Deities and Deities could debate the Way.</p><p></p><p>But after the debate, if neither was convinced, they would "have a match"!</p><p></p><p>Can't communicate? </p><p></p><p>Then fight it out, whoever wins has the strongest Way.</p><p></p><p>So in the ancient era of the eighteen Emperors, the strongest Way in each era was the Way cultivated by the Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>You say your Way is the strongest?</p><p></p><p>Heh, go defeat the Celestial Emperor first!</p><p></p><p>Not going? </p><p></p><p>Then what are you saying about the strongest Way?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't think that far, at this moment he just wanted to expound his Way and have others validate it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a Way that can also communicate with spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Communicating with spirits means realizing the Way, after the Three Unities, one needs to realize the Way to become a deity.</p><p></p><p>The path to deityhood in recent times has been severed. </p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the Four Great Sects are stuck at the Spirit Communication Realm.</p><p></p><p>On Gu Jiuqing's palm, a river manifested, flowing into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Then waves rose in the vast ocean, crashing against the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>The cliffs shattered into pieces, forming land.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist watched carefully, not underestimating Gu Jiuqing for being at the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>This junior who wanted to be on par with Jiang Buyu, what was he doing?</p><p></p><p>Manifesting mountains and rivers?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Yuan had full faith in Gu Jiuqing. "Since Senior Brother Gu wants to debate the Way with this ancient immortal, he must be confident! It's normal for me not to understand such a profound Way."</p><p></p><p>The debate continued, the manifestations on Gu Jiuqing's palm kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers!</p><p></p><p>Streams!</p><p></p><p>Vast oceans!</p><p></p><p>Stars!</p><p></p><p>Sun and moon! </p><p></p><p>Land!</p><p></p><p>All the common scenes of the world were manifested one by one in Gu Jiuqing's palm.</p><p></p><p>Even wind, rain, thunder and lightning were displayed.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist's smiling expression turned solemn as he pondered and tried to understand the meaning behind this junior's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh-----"</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist thought too much, strands of thoughts flew out from his Mind Palace, forming an image of the Celestial Palace!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Moving Daoist had already reached the Celestial Palace Realm in his early years. The ten great Celestial Palaces manifested, his three souls and seven spirits residing within them.</p><p></p><p>But he needed more thoughts to deduce further.</p><p></p><p>This caused the ten Celestial Palaces to merge into one, the three souls and seven spirits condensing into a single primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>This primordial spirit carried a hint of pure yang essence, far smaller and less concentrated than the Eight Trigrams Ancestor's pure yang primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>The manifested spirit image was only seventy zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit deduced and pondered, thoughts filling it as it analyzed Gu Jiuqing's every move.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, and the changes in Gu Jiuqing's palm reached their conclusion. </p><p></p><p>A golden crow!</p><p></p><p>A true dragon!</p><p></p><p>After these two final transformations, the heavens and earth in his palm became clear, empty of all things.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath, a continent appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>It was a miniature, shrunken version of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>It had the four great danger zones, the four great sects, the nine provinces, and even images of the demons of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>This was the Great Wilderness that Gu Jiuqing had seen after his travels, manifested by him.</p><p></p><p>His qi was depleted, if not for twice refining his natal dan, he would have been drained long ago.</p><p></p><p>The condensed divine soul also became feeble, but Gu Jiuqing's spirit was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He said excitedly to the Mountain-Moving Daoist:</p><p></p><p>"Look, this is my method to communicate with spirits!"</p><p></p><p>The illusory Great Wilderness cracked apart, the mountains and rivers shattered, even the sun, moon and stars began to shake.</p><p></p><p>What method?</p><p></p><p>Such a manifestation?</p><p></p><p>The two immortal masters frowned deeply!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lu Yuan thought, "It seems these ancient immortals don't have much more talent than Elder Lu, they can't comprehend Senior Brother Gu's Way either."</p><p></p><p>The seventy zhang primordial spirit wavered, manifesting the images of the heavens and earth, the spirit image growing dozens, hundreds of times larger, thoughts manifesting even larger, deducing at an even faster speed.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Ancestor seemed to realize something, but still felt like he was missing a piece.</p><p></p><p>Until!</p><p></p><p>The shattered heavens and earth in Gu Jiuqing's palm began to manifest anew.</p><p></p><p>The shattered sun, moon and stars became a pair of eyes, frozen in the void.</p><p></p><p>The inverted rivers became a sea of blood, the vital essence!</p><p></p><p>The mountains and lands of the world flew upwards, peak after peak, range after range, even the nine provinces of the Great Wilderness flew up, condensing into a fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>"I take the sun and moon as my eyes, the lands of the world as my body, the rivers and oceans as my vital essence, and open the celestial apertures of my body with the myriad stars of the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's melodious voice rang out, his other arm also extending to manifest the illusory scenes beyond the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he wanted to show off, it was that he had run out of qi!!</p><p></p><p>He needed to use his fleshly body to imprint the 365 celestial stars surrounding his bodily form.</p><p></p><p>"The winds of this world are my exhalations!"</p><p></p><p>The winds entered the bodily form.</p><p></p><p>"The clouds at dawn are my vast and boundless vital breath."</p><p></p><p>The dawn clouds became a canopy, settling on the bodily form.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Jiuqing's right hand pushed the shattered Great Wilderness, sending the human figures and demons into the bodily form.</p><p></p><p>"The living beings of this world are all my creations, I take the living beings as my spirit, forging the Way of living beings, also becoming my Way."</p><p></p><p>After Gu Jiuqing finished this line, his two arms dropped down.</p><p></p><p>He was depleted of strength.</p><p></p><p>Only a fleshly body remained, standing in the void.</p><p></p><p>He absorbed everything of the Great Wilderness to form his current self.</p><p></p><p>He created the Great Wilderness, he created living beings, he created these myriad beings.</p><p></p><p>"Boom-----"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous explosion rang out.</p><p></p><p>The three thousand zhang heavenly image manifested by the Mountain-Moving Daoist immediately shattered, each thought strand damaged, swirling rapidly to return to his Mind Palace.</p><p></p><p>The ten Celestial Palaces manifested, the three souls and seven spirits residing within, nourishing the primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he coughed up a mouthful of old blood, splattering it on Gu Jiuqing's blue robes.</p><p></p><p>The vital essence in that mouthful of blood had dissipated, only a red flower staining his clothes.</p><p></p><p>"This is my method to communicate with spirits, I call it the Self-Proven Pangu Method."</p><p></p><p>"Friend of the Way, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the Mountain-Moving Daoist and asked!</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, what do you all think?</p><p></p><p>Should we continue following this story?</p><p></p><p>Today was also a full 10,000 words.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

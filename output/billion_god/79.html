        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The school playground.</p><p></p><p>The physical examination for the second day of the college entrance exam was held on the school playground. </p><p></p><p>The specific test items were the 100-meter sprint test, with eight people in a group, running under 10 seconds for a full score.</p><p></p><p>The second item was a strength test.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists could punch out with a force of over a thousand kilograms. The passing standard was one thousand kilograms, only those who could punch out one thousand kilograms were considered qualified.</p><p></p><p>The third was a reaction ability test. In a special reaction testing room, dodgeballs were shot out from various directions. One had to dodge for one minute, and could only be hit by no more than three balls to pass.</p><p></p><p>Speed, strength, and reaction ability were the basic items. There were also tests for spiritual power and final blood energy level!</p><p></p><p>These five items comprised the entire physical examination. </p><p></p><p>Linjiang High School was not holding the college entrance exam for the first time, so the facilities for the physical examination were well-prepared. A huge outdoor screen was set up on the playground.</p><p></p><p>In previous physical exams, the big screen would broadcast the exam scenes from other cities.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Linjiang's physical exam would also appear on the screens of other cities.</p><p></p><p>However, Linjiang's network was still under repair, so the screen was just black and white.</p><p></p><p>Under the huge outdoor screen stood the four examiners and the chief examiner, Teacher Jing'an.</p><p></p><p>Their task was to test the students' spiritual power and blood energy levels.  </p><p></p><p>The other three major items could be handled by the school teachers.</p><p></p><p>On the track, the silhouettes of high school seniors gathered, with two hundred people waiting. Soon, the first batch of examinees entered the track.</p><p></p><p>"It's 8:30, why haven't they come yet?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling, clad in a battle armor and fully armed, with only the T21 battle blade placed in a metal box.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was wrapped in a special material battle armor, and the other three examiners were the same.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an sat in a chair, but his hand was on a briefcase.</p><p></p><p>He anxiously watched the school gate.</p><p></p><p>Outside the school gate, there was no one in sight.</p><p></p><p>He became a bit worried. Could it be that Xiaogao and Bajiao didn't get the message out?</p><p></p><p>It was already 8:30!</p><p></p><p>Not a single person had come?</p><p></p><p>"Bang————————"</p><p></p><p>The warning gun for the sprint rang out across the playground, and the silhouettes of eight people raced at extreme speed on the track.</p><p></p><p>The eight figures ran side by side, with no one leading or lagging behind.</p><p></p><p>For the 100-meter sprint, a full score only required running under 10 seconds. Running faster would still be a full score. But excessive energy consumption would affect the following tests.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? They're running side by side?"  </p><p></p><p>"Their speed isn't slow, they should be able to run under 10 seconds?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling couldn't calculate their speed with the naked eye, but with his years of experience, these ten examinees should be able to run under 10 seconds.</p><p></p><p>These ten examinees all had the speed of martial artists?</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Jiuling knew about the terror of Linjiang and had witnessed the continuation of martial arts the previous day, he was still shocked now.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an's eyelids twitched, and he also saw this scene.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, I feel like these examinees seem to all be martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>Two hundred martial artists?</p><p></p><p>Were all the high school seniors at Linjiang High School martial artists??</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an's words made them re-examine the examinees.</p><p></p><p>This thought had already arisen in their minds.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>They dared not believe it.</p><p></p><p>The two hundred students at Linjiang High School were all martial artists??</p><p></p><p>Even in the capital, there were only about this many in the entire graduating class.</p><p></p><p>"They're starting the strength test now."</p><p></p><p>Under their gaze, in the strength testing area, one examinee after another walked to the force meter, punched it, and a green light indicated a pass.</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't pass would display their strength score.</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang high school examinees proceeded with the physical examination as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the 100-meter sprint, followed by the strength test, reaction test, in just over ten minutes, a group of people stood before the five examiners.</p><p></p><p>One score sheet after another was handed to them.</p><p></p><p>[Wen Daihua: Full score in sprint, full score in strength, full score in reaction ability]</p><p></p><p>[Huang Yuanyuan: Full score in sprint, full score in strength, full score in reaction ability] </p><p></p><p>[Ning Que: Full score in sprint, full score in strength, full score in reaction ability]</p><p></p><p>Full scores!</p><p></p><p>All full scores!</p><p></p><p>The three major items of the physical exam were all full scores, this was the data of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The score sheets in Teacher Jing'an's hands were almost all like this!</p><p></p><p>One student after another came before them, waiting for the spiritual power test.</p><p></p><p>"They all got full scores, only a few examinees lost one point in the reaction ability test."</p><p></p><p>That must have been due to nerves!</p><p></p><p>Forty examinees, fifty examinees, sixty examinees, soon there were a hundred examinees before them.  </p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an looked at the few examiners, "Begin the spiritual power examination."</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to know the spiritual power of these students!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the vast playground, four fully armed examination officials took a step forward, and the students in front of them were visibly nervous. </p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster's will was firm, and the Great Grandmaster had even cultivated to the realm of transformation.</p><p></p><p>These four examiners were all formidable figures, often venturing into the wild to hunt demonic beasts. At this moment, their vital energy surged, exuding an aura of bloodshed and killing!</p><p></p><p>Two auras blossomed simultaneously, the surging of vital energy, spreading towards the one hundred students. </p><p></p><p>It was as if they were enveloped by a ferocious demonic beast, the terrifying aura of vital energy covering the playground.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the examiners turned pale!</p><p></p><p>This time, they had unleashed the full extent of their vital energy, concealing none of their power!</p><p></p><p>The faces of the examinees also turned pale, some students' legs went weak, almost causing them to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Condense the Dragon and Elephant!"</p><p></p><p>Someone in the crowd said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The examinees hurriedly practiced the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant, condensing their vital energy into the Dragon and Elephant forms. The powerful vital energy gathered together, actually breaking through the demonic beast illusion conjured by the four examiners.</p><p></p><p>Boom——————</p><p></p><p>Four figures trembled and retreated several steps, blood dripping from the corners of their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Even Lu Jiuling, the Great Grandmaster, suffered a backlash, his vital energy returning to the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The illusion completely dissipated, and in front of them stood one hundred students who had passed the spiritual power examination.</p><p></p><p>Three Grandmasters lay on the ground, unable to get up, their faces dark yellow, their vital energy depleted!</p><p></p><p>Great Grandmaster Lu Jiuling had blood dripping from the corner of his mouth, his pupils constricted, staring in shock at these one hundred martial artists!!</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds came from behind, and suddenly, a huge screen lit up, with various scenes appearing on it.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-seven scenes divided the screen, showing the high school entrance examination scenes from other cities.</p><p></p><p>"The communications in Linjiang have been restored."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an's heart sank!</p><p></p><p>The other examination officials hurriedly got up, but this scene had already been transmitted to other high schools.</p><p></p><p>At that moment!</p><p></p><p>Countless high schools were shocked, and some examinees even stopped their examinations to look at the scenes appearing on the screen, mocking endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"What? Which school is that? Why are the examination officials lying on the ground?"</p><p></p><p>"It looks like they're bleeding."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, Linjiang High School? Can't be, right? Did someone try to sabotage the examination officials on the exam day?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a thing has never happened before the Spiritual Energy Revival Era, and it has never happened after the Spiritual Energy Revival Era."</p><p></p><p>"Linjiang? Isn't that the city in Jiangnan Province that caused a huge stir recently?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard Linjiang was even sealed off for three months. Could it be that Linjiang is trying to rebel against the country?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>More and more schools switched their projections to Linjiang High School.</p><p></p><p>The three examination officials looked embarrassed, their faces completely disgraced.</p><p></p><p>They were supposed to be examining the students' spiritual power, but now they had been suppressed by the students instead!</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at the gates of Linjiang High School!"</p><p></p><p>On the screen, the projection showed Linjiang High School's playground, and the school gates were also within the monitoring range.</p><p></p><p>Within the monitoring range, they saw dozens of figures appear at the school gates, and one person even casually pushed open the gate with a wave of their hand.</p><p></p><p>"Who are these people, brazenly breaking into the school? It's the college entrance examination time now."</p><p></p><p>All over the country!</p><p></p><p>On the huge projection screens in the playgrounds of high schools in twenty-three provinces, the scene of Linjiang High School appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the four major cities!</p><p></p><p>The imperial capital! The demonic capital! The ram city! The southern city! The schools there also showed the same scene.</p><p></p><p>All the examinees across the country stared at the projection screen, even the examination officials stopped the examinations.</p><p></p><p>They were sweating profusely, looking flustered, and the phones at the highest institution, the Dragon Academy, were ringing off the hook.</p><p></p><p>The phones of the stationed troops outside Linjiang and the security department guarding Linjiang were also ringing non-stop.</p><p></p><p>This was the day of the college entrance examination, and someone was brazenly breaking into Linjiang High School in broad daylight!!</p><p></p><p>This was a challenge to the official authority of the Dragon Country.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I think I saw the President Wei in the crowd!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I also felt some of them looked familiar."</p><p></p><p>President Wei!</p><p></p><p>A president of the Dragon Academy, highly respected and influential, often appearing in the news.</p><p></p><p>"That one looks like the head of the Gu Family, one of the eight great families of the imperial capital. Oh my, why would such a prominent figure come here?"</p><p></p><p>The eight great families of the imperial capital were the ancient aristocratic families, each with their own stationed troops in the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Alliance of the Dragon Country was controlled by these eight great families.</p><p></p><p>The public ruler of the Dragon Country was actually supported by these eight great families from behind the scenes!</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the head of the Yan Family, another one of the eight great families?"</p><p></p><p>Someone compared the photos and recognized the head of the second of the eight great families.</p><p></p><p>Those who could stand alongside the heads of the eight great families and President Wei must not be ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>So the crowd that broke into Linjiang High School wasn't there to rebel?</p><p></p><p>They had come to inspect Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>What had Linjiang done to warrant the presence of so many high-ranking officials?</p><p></p><p>At 9:30 a.m., schools across the country were in shock.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

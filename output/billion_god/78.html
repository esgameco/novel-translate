        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Night!</p><p></p><p>On the highway, an armored truck was driving at extreme speed, already reaching 180 miles per hour, but its speed was still increasing. </p><p></p><p>A journey that normally takes over an hour was completed by the driver in just 45 minutes!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the armored truck entered Tianyuan City. </p><p></p><p>After another hour, the outskirts of Tianyuan City were brightly lit up, illuminating even the wilderness as if it were daytime. A series of military trucks started up, escorting the armored truck that had previously entered Tianyuan City, heading towards the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of martial artists were deployed to protect the driver's safety!</p><p></p><p>Entering the northern toll station of Jiangnan City.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, an aircraft also took off temporarily from the airport of Xiaohai City at night, with its destination being the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>On this night, the 23 provinces and four capital cities of the Dragon Country were destined to be sleepless.</p><p></p><p>At dawn!</p><p></p><p>The imperial capital shook, the Dragon Science Academy shook, a series of military planes took off, a group of powerful martial artists awoke, and even martial saints were summoned back to the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy night, the undercurrents in this part of the Dragon Country across the ocean surged.</p><p></p><p>June 7th. </p><p></p><p>6 AM.</p><p></p><p>Inside the armored truck, the four examiners and Teacher Jing'an had not slept. Apart from Lu Jiuling, the other three examiners were all grandmasters, while he himself was a great grandmaster, so staying up all night would not make them sluggish.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>This night!</p><p></p><p>They also discovered the "great terror" of Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>The elderly men and women had been "dancing" in the square from the evening until 10 PM!</p><p></p><p>That dragon and elephant-shaped aura of vital energy had also lingered for several hours.</p><p></p><p>"How many nutrient drinks did these elderly people drink in these few hours?"  </p><p></p><p>"It seems some people were even taking drugs!"</p><p></p><p>The drug effects were truly potent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling saw a 70 or 80-year-old elderly man who danced in the square for half an hour until he was panting heavily. But after taking a pill, he became energetic again and continued dancing.</p><p></p><p>"In the latter half of the night, streaks of white light pierced through the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>At first, they thought it was some kind of searchlight. But later they realized it was a group of people standing on the other side of the square, practicing sword arts!</p><p></p><p>Calling it sword arts was a bit of a misnomer - it was simply the most basic act of unsheathing and sheathing a sword. The speed of unsheathing was not fast, but on the final unsheathing, a streak of sword energy shot out horizontally!!</p><p></p><p>Even martial artists could unleash a sword aura close to one meter long!!!</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Were all the martial artists in Linjiang failed sword cultivators?</p><p></p><p>The power of the sword aura was immense, able to easily destroy armor unless it was made of T20 material.  </p><p></p><p>The dragon and elephant aura rising, white light swirling about - the ancestral city of Linjiang was filled with bizarre phenomena one after another.</p><p></p><p>They even used a spiritual energy detector to scan Linjiang!</p><p></p><p>The result showed that the spiritual energy value in this area reached as high as 35 points.</p><p></p><p>That was a staggering number - they had never imagined any place could reach a spiritual energy value of 35.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang became much quieter in the latter half of the night.</p><p></p><p>But in the morning, another group began their morning practice.</p><p></p><p>Only their cultivation method was rather unique.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, on the balconies of tall buildings, there were martial artists sitting with their hands raised to the sky, as if inhaling and exhaling.</p><p></p><p>Beams of sunlight shone upon them, with strange rays of light circling their bodies.</p><p></p><p>They were inhaling and exhaling the first wisps of purple air!</p><p></p><p>This was precisely the Celestial Immortal technique that the Linjiang high school students had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Whether cultivating the Golden Crow Divine Body or the Yin-Yang Divine Body, one could practice by inhaling and exhaling the first wisps of purple air from the sun.</p><p></p><p>"Those people are all grandmasters, great grandmasters!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling was shaken.</p><p></p><p>He saw over 20 or 30 people practicing the Celestial Immortal technique!</p><p></p><p>Among them, he even spotted a Martial King!</p><p></p><p>That Martial King sat on the balcony, surrounded by a swirling flame that drew in the first wisps of purple air.</p><p></p><p>When the sun rose from the east, the Martial King stopped cultivating. He exhaled a breath like an arrow shooting into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then he began dancing the "square dance", his vital energy churning, tempering his flesh, his bones and tendons ringing out, his five viscera being refined into five vital energies.</p><p></p><p>After more than half an hour, the Martial King stopped the square dance and returned to the living room to take out a precious sword. He practiced the motions of unsheathing and slashing with the sword.</p><p></p><p>Once, twice, three times, repeating the cycle.</p><p></p><p>Inside the truck!</p><p></p><p>The four examiners and Teacher Jing'an all had complex expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The two Celestial Immortal techniques for cultivating the Golden Crow Divine Body and the Yin-Yang Divine Body - they could now confirm that these two methods were real and reliable, able to extend the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Many grandmaster-level and above martial artists in Linjiang were practicing these techniques.</p><p></p><p>This also led to the grandmasters, great grandmasters, and Martial Kings in Linjiang reaching a pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiuling was anxious!</p><p></p><p>He looked towards Teacher Jing'an.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Jing'an, it's been a whole night already, but they still haven't returned. Could they have run into trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Does it really take this long for the trip from Tianyuan City to the provincial capital of Jiangnan Province and back?</p><p></p><p>And from Xiaohai City to the imperial capital and back?</p><p></p><p>But why haven't Xiao Gao and Ba Jiao returned yet?</p><p></p><p>The other three examiners had solemn expressions as they each opened the metal cases they carried.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cases were specially made suits of armor!</p><p></p><p>Helmets, combat suits, combat boots, and T20 alloy combat knives - this was the examiners' armament!</p><p></p><p>Though the space inside the truck was small, the three still managed to put on their armor.</p><p></p><p>Next was Lu Jiuling, the great grandmaster, opening his metal case.</p><p></p><p>The armor suit inside his case was also somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>The combat suit had natural patterns woven into it, quite unique. And that sword...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The alloy battle blade emanated a cold, eerie glow. After being unsheathed, the temperature inside the vehicle dropped in a straight line. </p><p></p><p>The three examiners looked enviously at the alloy battle blade in Lu Jiuling's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, this battle blade of yours must be the latest research result from the Dragon Science Institute, forged from T21 alloy, right? Its power is much greater than the blades we're holding."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's forged from T21 alloy, capable of breaking through the defenses of an S-class demonic beast!"</p><p></p><p>Defenses of an S-class demonic beast?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean with this blade, there's a chance to hunt down a demonic beast comparable to a Martial Saint?</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the time, "Teacher Jing'an, it's almost time for the college entrance exam. It's not safe inside the transport vehicle. If a Martial King forcefully attacks, they could still break through the defenses."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Jing'an understood Lu Jiuling's meaning. He had already collected Linjiang's 200-point exam papers and put them in his briefcase. </p><p></p><p>"These exam papers, unless I die, will definitely make it safely to the Dragon Science Institute personnel coming to Linjiang."</p><p></p><p>They had just tested the network again but still couldn't connect to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>After opening yesterday evening, the transport vehicle opened its doors again this morning.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the sound of crowds could be heard.</p><p></p><p>In the distance at the plaza, a sea of people as the second day of the Martial Arts Conference continued.</p><p></p><p>At the school gate, high school seniors stood waiting for the morning's martial exam. </p><p></p><p>The five of them entered Linjiang High School.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Linjiang High School, on a tall building.</p><p></p><p>A group of elderly martial artists looked through the floor-to-ceiling windows towards the school in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Behind these elderly masters were some slightly younger martial artists sitting on sofas.</p><p></p><p>"You youngsters really have it good. Us old folks are getting past it, not able to stay as calm as you all."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief had a sword case on his back!</p><p></p><p>The case was four feet long, the precious sword three feet three inches!</p><p></p><p>His figure was upright, his long black hair unbound and naturally falling.</p><p></p><p>Faint thunderous sounds came from within his body, and five dim rays of light flickered from his five viscera.</p><p></p><p>It was dim inside, if an ordinary person saw this scene, they would think these were five lamps shining.</p><p></p><p>Those Martial Kings sitting on the sofa hurriedly stood up, "No, no way."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Chief jests."</p><p></p><p>"We just happened to stumble into becoming Martial Kings, how can we be mentioned in the same breath as you all."</p><p></p><p>There were eight of these young Martial Kings!</p><p></p><p>As for the old Martial Kings, besides the Martial Chief, there were the Mayor, Secretary Wen, the Security Chief, the Principal, Master Qian Yue, and Old Man Wen - seven in total.</p><p></p><p>Just the Martial Kings in this room outnumbered the entire Martial Kings of other cities.</p><p></p><p>"Although you're young, in these past few days of Martial Kings being enthroned by the Martial Arts Alliance, there was even a 30-year-old young Martial King!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief sighed, and the others were also amazed.</p><p></p><p>A 30-year-old Martial King, that's really young.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't belittle themselves. Regardless of who it was, it was because of the Celestial's appearance that they gained this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Calculate the time, that batch of people going to the moon should have already set foot on it."</p><p></p><p>The Mayor looked at the sky outside and said in a muffled voice.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting!</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the Celestial to appear again!</p><p></p><p>The Linjiang college entrance exam, the entire city's lockdown being lifted, at the earliest it would happen in the morning, shaking Dragon Country. At the latest, it would be this morning!!</p><p></p><p>And the Celestial would also reappear today.</p><p></p><p>With Linjiang's current foundations, becoming an Ancestral City still had some difficulties.</p><p></p><p>If they waited three months for the three elixir medicines to be produced, then Linjiang becoming an Ancestral City would be unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Martial Chief was about to speak, the door was pushed open and a senior-rank guard entered.</p><p></p><p>"At the highway toll plaza, a number of military trucks have arrived."</p><p></p><p>"They're all large vehicles from the provincial capital."</p><p></p><p>"There are also a few helicopters flying in from Xiaohai City, about to enter Linjiang's borders."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Martial Kings in the room felt a sinking feeling in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>What was meant to come has come.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>They!!</p><p></p><p>Those were people from Dragon Country outside of Linjiang City who had come.</p><p></p><p>Their opportunity would also be shared with others.</p><p></p><p>"These three months passed so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The Mayor asked the Martial Chief, </p><p></p><p>"How far are you now from becoming a Martial Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, one step? Half a step?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Refining Pill, Celestial Dispersion Pill, and Celestial Meridian Pill had already begun mass production. </p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief's injuries from cultivating the Heaven's Gate Technique had long been healed. With the assistance of the elixir pills, he was just a small step away from filling in the third vertebra.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint realm was right before his eyes, within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>A blood transformation?</p><p></p><p>That would just take a thought.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Mayor smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Linjiang will have its own Martial Saint."</p><p></p><p>A single Martial Saint would be enough to ensure Linjiang's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ding ding -------------------"</p><p></p><p>A special sound came from the school in the distance.</p><p></p><p>It was coming from the school's sports field, the second day of the martial exam had officially begun.</p><p></p><p>Friday morning update, barring any issues there will be 20,000 words updated at midnight, then another 10,000 words updated later that day. So Friday will have a total of 30,000 words updated.</p><p></p><p>Begging readers to support with some first month subscriptions!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

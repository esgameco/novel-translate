        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At Linjiang High School, there were four classes in senior year, five classes in junior year, and six classes in freshman year. </p><p></p><p>As the grade level increased, the number of students decreased. Many students dropped out as they could not vigorously advance in their martial arts cultivation. This was an uncontrollable fact.</p><p></p><p>On the playground, there were fifteen classes, but the lead instructor was not a teacher, but a student.</p><p></p><p>It was a student from Class 2 of the senior year!</p><p></p><p>Fifteen students from Senior Class 2 were leading the exercises!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had already recognized these few students. </p><p></p><p>Class monitor Yang Miaojing, vice class monitor Ning Que, Wen Dai Hua, Lan Bai, Ke Jing.</p><p></p><p>These fifteen students had dragon and elephant aura shadows hovering above their heads. Starting from the first form, they performed and led the students in practicing the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"The school is also comprehensively promoting the Dragon and Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>It seems the principal has joined hands with the three great figures of Linjiang.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, with everyone cultivating, Gu Jiuqing's strength had made rapid progress. This was even before he had fully comprehended the insights contained within the Dao fruits!!</p><p></p><p>The radio broadcast of the twenty-two forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill exercise was soon completed. The broadcast sounded again, and students streamed into the classrooms.</p><p></p><p>A teacher noticed Gu Jiuqing's presence.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu? You've come! The principal said there was something happening at your home, so we thought you wouldn't be coming."</p><p></p><p>The school, the principal, had already made arrangements for Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The days he didn't come to school had been arranged as leave.</p><p></p><p>A slender figure, a slightly tanned woman, walked up to Gu Jiuqing. It was Teacher Le Qing from the same office.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, something came up at home, and with Linjiang being sealed off, I couldn't return for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, it's not very peaceful in the wilderness lately. It's inconvenient to travel by train or plane."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Le Qing was about to speak when her gaze shifted behind Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, Teacher Bai."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian walked past behind Gu Jiuqing. Her beautiful hair flowed naturally, wearing wide-leg pants and a sleeveless top, carrying a long sword.</p><p></p><p>As she moved, she exuded a faint fragrance mixed with a unique personal scent.</p><p></p><p>It was the smell of blood and sweat intermingling after exercise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Jiuqing could no longer pretend to be oblivious. He turned to face Bai Muqian with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, Teacher Bai!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian stopped, looking at Gu Jiuqing with slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>It seemed!</p><p></p><p>She could not believe Gu Jiuqing would greet her.</p><p></p><p>But that surprise quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Surprise?</p><p></p><p>Why was Bai Muqian surprised?</p><p></p><p>Was she surprised that I greeted her??</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, Teacher Le Qing, good morning. I have something to attend to, so I'll go take care of it first."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>She had just seen Hua Yunye's Bentley.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, she had been trying to contact Hua Yunye, calling him countless times, but the calls never went through!</p><p></p><p>This time, since Hua Yunye had come to the school, she needed to properly ask him about it.</p><p></p><p>After Bai Muqian left, Teacher Le Qing felt a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors in the school that Teacher Gu and Bai Muqian were a couple, but when they ran into each other, they just exchanged a greeting and parted ways?</p><p></p><p>They didn't seem like a couple at all!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, someone had seen Bai Muqian interacting with the head of Huaren Technology.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...!</p><p></p><p>Teacher Le Qing looked at the top of Gu Jiuqing's head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the principal is looking for me. I need to go to the principal's office first!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, okay."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly escaped from this place of rumor and gossip.</p><p></p><p>Now he could confirm!</p><p></p><p>There was no relationship between him and Bai Muqian.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Bai Muqian didn't even know about his other identity, Gu Zixiu!</p><p></p><p>So the question was, who spread the news that Gu Zixiu had left to the school?</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu didn't have many friends in Linjiang. If it wasn't someone else,</p><p></p><p>Then it could only be Gu Zixiu himself!</p><p></p><p>Gu Zixiu himself spread this rumor?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing couldn't figure it out. He didn't understand why Gu Zixiu would do such a thing, but he could set this matter aside for now.</p><p></p><p>The principal's office!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood outside the office door. He didn't push the door open right away but instead straightened his clothes and composed himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally pushed open the door and entered.</p><p></p><p>In the office, it was not only the principal, but also an old man besides the principal. </p><p></p><p>This old man was the true master!</p><p></p><p>The old man was very old, with sparse hair and a few deep-colored age spots on his neck. However, his spirit was not bad, his eyes shone brightly. Upon seeing Gu Jiuqing, he immediately stood up, and the principal beside him hurriedly supported the old man.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, please excuse us. This is Mr. Wen, also my master. It was thanks to Master Wen's efforts that this high school in Linji was able to be established."</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts world, it was not easy to establish a school. Especially for the high school section, as high schools could connect to universities, some cities didn't even have one high school.</p><p></p><p>"After learning that Teacher Gu was coming, Master Wen insisted on meeting you."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wen extended his hand, gesturing for the principal to step aside. His blood and energy were dry, but he had not yet reached the point where he needed support to walk.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, you are the most teacher-like teacher I have ever seen."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was stunned! Could he have been discovered? The most teacher-like teacher? Was he implying that Gu was not Gu Zixiu?!!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Gu Jiuqing realized he had thought too much. Mr. Wen extended his palm and slapped the principal's head. The principal was in pain but did not dare to resist, only able to smile wryly.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this guy! I cultivated him into a Martial King! But?"</p><p></p><p>"I told him to pass on the Three Paths True Martial Great View that he cultivated to the students, but he was unwilling."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wen sighed endlessly, then walked up to Gu Jiuqing, with a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Paths True Martial Great View?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, hahaha, this martial art doesn't even compare to a tiny part of the Unsheathing Sword technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Look at you Martial Kings, treating these supreme skills as more important than anything. If all martial artists are like you, how can the martial way develop?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wen was disappointed that his teachings did not bear fruit.</p><p></p><p>This was an era of rapid development of the martial way, requiring predecessors to push it forward. In the next hundred or thousand years, they would be the sages and virtuous ones spoken of by later generations.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>He was old!</p><p></p><p>If it were twenty years earlier, he would have understood this principle. Perhaps he could have changed something in this era.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood by silently, watching Mr. Wen.</p><p></p><p>"In Jiangnan Province, there are thirty-four cities in total, and my disciples are spread across all thirty-four."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Head of the Jiangnan Province Martial Arts Association, who is also the commander of the Jiangnan military region, is my disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The Head of the Martial Arts Association was the president of the Linji City Martial Arts Association. There were thirty-four such presidents in Jiangnan Province.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was the Head of the Association!</p><p></p><p>A martial existence surpassing even Martial Kings - a Martial Saint! One who could be bestowed a title!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wen looked at the principal and slapped his face again, "Did you really think the Head of the Association would believe your reports?"</p><p></p><p>"That the Demonic Beast Tides attacked Linji?"</p><p></p><p>"If you're going to make up excuses, at least come up with plausible ones."</p><p></p><p>"Fools! You're all just fools! With just you fools, you think you can turn Linji into an ancestral city? Comparable to Tian Du?"</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Jiuqing, Mr. Wen bluntly revealed the plans of the major forces in Linji to turn it into an ancestral city.</p><p></p><p>And this scene in the principal's office had already been transmitted to the various powers.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wen's aura was too strong, the principal did not dare to intervene, even Gu Jiuqing was awed by Mr. Wen's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, I know you want to pass on your teachings, I don't care what your purpose is."</p><p></p><p>"But for passing on teachings, I, Wen Baike, fully support you. If you encounter any problems with passing on teachings in the future, you can come find me!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I will die soon, I still have a few accomplished disciples in this world."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Mr. Wen glanced at the principal again.</p><p></p><p>"This one doesn't count."</p><p></p><p>The principal: ...</p><p></p><p>Second update, begging for support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

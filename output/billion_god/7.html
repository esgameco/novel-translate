        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Babe, where would you like to play tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard they opened a gravity room in the east of the city. Only five of the training rooms have 12 times gravity, while the gravity in the other training rooms is only 6 times."</p><p></p><p>"I've already gotten you an annual pass, so you can go whenever you want in the future." </p><p></p><p>The gravity room was an absolute treasure in Linji. Excluding large companies and powerful families, the only publicly accessible gravity room in the entire Linji was this Tiandao Training Hall in the east of the city.</p><p></p><p>To get a pass at the Tiandao Training Hall, only the top powers in Linji could afford it. The annual membership fee alone was over a million yuan.</p><p></p><p>A Linji teacher's monthly salary was only four thousand yuan, and salaries in other industries were even lower. Ordinary families didn't dare dream of letting their members train in the gravity room.</p><p></p><p>But Hua Yunye had actually given Bai Muqian an annual pass to the gravity room, which made even Bai Muqian look at Hua Yunye twice.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Mr. Hua to be so generous. I had just heard that the Tiandao Training Hall opened, and you've already given me an annual pass."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll accept it."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian didn't decline. She couldn't refuse such a generous gift.</p><p></p><p>She had been stuck at the peak of Body Refinement for too long. With the gravity room to aid her cultivation, it wouldn't be long before she broke through her shackles and became a Master!</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I heard there was a major event at your school? During the physical exam this morning, two students advanced to become Martial artists."</p><p></p><p>The luxury car stopped at a red light.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, two students became Martial artists right before the college entrance exam. Linji should have two more university students who are Martial artists this year."</p><p></p><p>"Keep an eye out for me. Huaren Technology's sponsorship is still available this year. If those two students are willing to work at Huaren Technology after graduating from university, I can offer them a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan."</p><p></p><p>A monthly salary of 30,000 yuan!</p><p></p><p>That was considered a high salary in Linji, but a high salary also meant high risk.</p><p></p><p>Students who became Martial artists and went to university would reach the peak of Martial artists after four years of tempering. Upon graduation, they would have a great chance of becoming Masters.</p><p></p><p>With a Master leading the team, whether it was going out to hunt demonic beasts or escorting merchant caravans trading between major cities, it could bring considerable profits to Huaren Technology.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, they'll also get a 100,000 yuan scholarship every year."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian nodded. For those two students, this was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>They would receive scholarships during their four years of university, and after graduating, they could work in their hometown. Who could refuse such an offer?</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——————"</p><p></p><p>The luxury car started moving again, the Xinghuibiaoji logo on the front speeding away.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about our matter..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about it after I become a Master."</p><p></p><p>The black luxury car soon stopped on the commercial street in the east of the city. Two figures entered the Tiandao Training Hall, one from the left and one from the right.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon, 6 pm.</p><p></p><p>An upscale residential area.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang finally got off work and returned home. He seemed to be in quite a hurry, coming home ten minutes earlier than usual.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the best residential areas in Linji, with standalone villas. There were even training rooms made of special alloys in the basements.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, where's our lovely granddaughter? Where did she go?"</p><p></p><p>"Did she not come back yet?"</p><p></p><p>"How come I can't see her anywhere?"</p><p></p><p>In the kitchen, Grandma Yang was cooking and casually replied, "She's in the training room and just entered not long ago."</p><p></p><p>"You actually have time to guide our granddaughter's cultivation today?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang didn't respond and went down to the basement.</p><p></p><p>The training room's door was tightly shut. Old Man Yang didn't push it open but instead sat on a stool nearby, staring intently at the door.</p><p></p><p>The training room!</p><p></p><p>It was designed and renovated by Old Man Yang himself. Just the renovation cost 800,000 yuan to build this training room.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the gravity room, the training room was fully equipped with all kinds of facilities, even including a simulated wilderness warehouse.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his precious granddaughter, Old Man Yang had spared no effort. It was just a pity that his granddaughter's talent was average, and it was even a question whether she could get into university.</p><p></p><p>But now!</p><p></p><p>He had heard rumors from school that his granddaughter had advanced to become a Martial artist.</p><p></p><p>How could this not excite Old Man Yang?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, a Martial artist, an 18-year-old Martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"In the entire city of Linji, there are only a handful of Martial artists under 18 years old born each year!"</p><p></p><p>The rumors of dozens circulating outside were people who had used secret techniques to forcibly excavate their potential at the cost of damaging their foundations, similar to using steroids.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Martial artists, 30 years old was the peak age. From 30 to 40 years old, their Vital Energy didn't decrease much, but after 40, their Vital Energy would drop significantly. By 50 years old, being able to maintain half of their peak strength was already considered good.</p><p></p><p>However, those who forcibly excavated their potential would have Vital Energy comparable to a 50-year-old ordinary Martial artist by the age of 40.</p><p></p><p>An 18-year-old Martial artist - Old Man Yang clearly understood the potential behind this.</p><p></p><p>"The military produces the most university students who become Martial artists each year, but they use secret methods to excavate their potential. My granddaughter, on the other hand, cultivated to become a Martial artist through her own efforts."</p><p></p><p>"Her future accomplishments are limitless!"</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Master?</p><p></p><p>That was a certainty!</p><p></p><p>Even becoming a Great Master was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Bang————————"</p><p></p><p>The training room's door was pushed open, and a young girl in a white training uniform walked out.</p><p></p><p>Her face was flushed, and her body emanated wisps of dense mist - the water vapor evaporating from within her body and condensing into mist floating around her.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for a few breaths before stopping.</p><p></p><p>However, Yang Miaojing had already drunk a nutrition solution, which would quickly replenish her losses.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing asked in puzzlement. At this hour, her grandpa would usually go to the red-light district in the west of the city. He loved going to that lively area the most and wouldn't return until after 9 pm.</p><p></p><p>"Granddaughter, did you really become a Martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>A Martial artist!</p><p></p><p>Quick, say it, say it!</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it seems I've become a Martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing's figure changed, her training uniform instantly bulging from the surging Vital Energy. Rippling waves of Vital Energy made her skin taut, and an illusory, gigantic elephant formed from Vital Energy appeared above her head.</p><p></p><p>However, this Vital Energy elephant was slightly different from the one she had condensed in the classroom. On top of the elephant's head were two additional tusks, or perhaps they were dragon horns.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing's aura was so powerful that Old Man Yang's hair was blown into a frenzy, strands scattering behind him.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang stood up, staring at Yang Miaojing in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Such Vital Energy!</p><p></p><p>It was definitely not something a newly advanced Martial artist could possess.</p><p></p><p>"What's your current Vital Energy level?"</p><p></p><p>"I just measured it in the training room. If there's no mistake, it should be around 1.25."</p><p></p><p>1.25 in Vital Energy?!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang felt like he could hardly accept it.</p><p></p><p>He was considered a talent too, right?</p><p></p><p>He had also become a Martial artist at 18 years old, but it took him a year of cultivation to increase his Vital Energy by 0.2.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until his sophomore year of university that he reached the Vital Energy level Yang Miaojing had now.</p><p></p><p>A monster genius!</p><p></p><p>Was the Yang family about to give birth to a monstrous genius?</p><p></p><p>Old Man Yang laughed heartily, "Good, good, good!"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of my good granddaughter. Come, come, let's go find your father right now and have him get you a pass. The gravity room in Linji has opened, and with your Martial artist level, you'll be perfect for training in the gravity room."</p><p></p><p>Training in the gravity room?</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing hesitated.</p><p></p><p>What she lacked now wasn't a training environment but cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, let's not go. My cultivation has just started, and I still have a lot of room for improvement."</p><p></p><p>The gravity room's increased gravity was used to break through bottlenecks by using external pressure to force one's inner potential.</p><p></p><p>But Yang Miaojing had only just begun practicing the 22 forms of the Dragon Elephant Skill.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you buy me some nutrition solutions instead, Grandpa? The ones at home are almost used up."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, the vice class monitor Ning Que in our class also broke through to become a Martial artist, and there are other students who are Martial artist candidates too. My talent is average, so I can only rely on external aids."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing knew her own talents.</p><p></p><p>Among her classmates, she might be the most talented in Class 2.</p><p></p><p>But she knew that the most talented was Ning Que!</p><p></p><p>"Buy, buy, buy! We must buy them. I'll go ask your father for money right now. This time, we'll definitely buy C-grade nutrition solutions. From now on, you'll use C-grade nutrition solutions. Ah, Linji is just a small city after all, with no allocation for B-grade nutrition solutions. Wait a few days, good granddaughter. Grandpa will ask those old fellows - they should have some good stuff."</p><p></p><p>Anyone could buy D-grade nutrition solutions, which cost...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Around three thousand or so.</p><p></p><p>While C-level nutrient solutions are specially supplied for martial artists, one vial costs around ten thousand, and can even be sold for fifteen thousand on the black market. </p><p></p><p>Each C-level nutrient solution is labeled with its destination, which prevents individuals from purchasing large quantities of C-level nutrient solutions.</p><p></p><p>B-level nutrient solutions are even more unique.</p><p></p><p>One vial of B-level nutrient solution costs over one hundred thousand, which ordinary families cannot afford. Nutrient solutions are consumables, even martial artists dare not use them casually.</p><p></p><p>Above B-level nutrient solutions are A-level nutrient solutions, which are specially supplied and only circulated among the great families in the imperial capital, rarely circulating outside.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary technology companies can only produce D-level nutrient solutions.</p><p></p><p>Old Yang had already started climbing the steps, but he turned around and looked at Yang Miaojing.</p><p></p><p>What did he just hear?</p><p></p><p>Ning Que? </p><p></p><p>That kid has also become a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>And all the students in senior class two are martial artist candidates??</p><p></p><p>More than forty martial artist candidates??</p><p></p><p>Even Old Yang, who has experienced the winds and rains, fell silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He sensed something was amiss!</p><p></p><p>This matter must be abnormal.</p><p></p><p>His granddaughter cultivating into a martial artist, Ning Que cultivating into a martial artist, and the students of senior class two cultivating into martial artist candidates, there must be something abnormal about this.</p><p></p><p>"Tell grandpa, did something happen in your class?"</p><p></p><p>Old Yang's voice was somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that his granddaughter had used some technological means in her martial arts cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could an entire class improve so much?</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I was just about to tell you."</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaojing took out her phone, "Grandpa, take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>Look at what?</p><p></p><p>Old Yang took the phone and saw the photos in Yang Miaojing's hand.</p><p></p><p>What is this?</p><p></p><p>This is a photo of a blackboard drawing. The photo shows a vivid and lifelike elephant, but this elephant is different from the ones they saw at the zoo.</p><p></p><p>It is also different from the demonic elephants Old Yang saw in the wild.</p><p></p><p>This elephant is even more wondrous!</p><p></p><p>It can be called a divine elephant!</p><p></p><p>At second glance!</p><p></p><p>Old Yang finally realized that this is not a blackboard drawing, but a martial arts form.</p><p></p><p>"Elephant Traversing the Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The photos flipped rapidly, with over two hundred photos in total, mostly repetitive.</p><p></p><p>There were about nineteen martial arts forms.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Dragon Elephant Skill that Teacher Gu passed down to us, with a total of twenty-two forms, but I only took photos of nineteen forms."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill has twenty-two forms?</p><p></p><p>What does this have to do with Yang Miaojing becoming a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>"After Teacher Gu passed down the Dragon Elephant Skill to us yesterday, I cultivated it for an afternoon, and I had already broken through to become a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>"Today, Teacher Gu passed down the remaining forms, so my qi and blood value could be so high."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Did I hear that wrong?</p><p></p><p>From what my granddaughter said, she was able to cultivate into a martial artist because she practiced the Dragon Elephant Skill?</p><p></p><p>And she only cultivated the Dragon Elephant Skill for one afternoon yesterday before becoming a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>Old Yang stared blankly at the series of Dragon Elephant paintings on the phone.</p><p></p><p>What kind of supreme martial arts skill is this, for it to be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt what Yang Miaojing said, the facts were right in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu!"</p><p></p><p>In Old Yang's eyes, this was a genius from the imperial capital who came to Linji City specifically for Bai Muqian.</p><p></p><p>This was also a talented but lovelorn genius.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zixiu passed down the Gu Family's supreme skill to the students of senior class two?"</p><p></p><p>But is the Gu Family's supreme skill really that powerful??</p><p></p><p>If it was truly so powerful, the Gu Family would have unified the great families of the imperial capital long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Who else knows about the Dragon Elephant Skill?"</p><p></p><p>Old Yang smiled awkwardly, he felt that question was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>"All my classmates know, and they've also taken photos, but no one has the complete version of the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>This is a big deal!</p><p></p><p>A major incident is about to happen!</p><p></p><p>If only Yang Miaojing had a copy of the Dragon Elephant Skill, Old Yang felt he could still contain this matter himself. But if all the students of senior class two have a copy each!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill will definitely be spread.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these are phone photos, without any special encoding or storage medium. Once spread, they can be viewed freely online.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Old Yang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that in the future, everyone will have a copy of the Dragon Elephant Skill?</p><p></p><p>Everyone will be a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's starting point will be as a martial artist, the lowest will be martial artists, grandmasters will be like dogs, great grandmasters will walk the earth, and even martial kings will not dare to act recklessly in that era?</p><p></p><p>"Your father should still be at the company, he has an important meeting today."</p><p></p><p>"Come with me to see your father."</p><p></p><p>Old Yang pulled Yang Miaojing and ran out.</p><p></p><p>This matter!</p><p></p><p>Cannot be delayed!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill being spread to Planet Blue is an inevitable event.</p><p></p><p>But if handled well!</p><p></p><p>Linji City will become a second imperial capital, or even the number one martial city, the ancestral city, the divine city, the sacred city, the immortal city!</p><p></p><p>And these Linji natives like themselves will soar to great heights, becoming the most brilliant part of martial history!</p><p></p><p>At Linji Zoo.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts era, the animals in the zoo were all rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>If humans could unlock martial cultivation, animals could naturally do so as well.</p><p></p><p>Thus, demonic beasts were born.</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts ran rampant in the wild, and just the annual cost of clearing the outer paths was a considerable expense.</p><p></p><p>Most city dwellers had never fought demonic beasts, and some had never even seen one, so they would come to the zoo to observe the demonic beasts that had not yet mutated.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the animals in the zoo also began to mutate into demonic beasts, and half of the nation's zoos closed down.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that visitors had wandered into the animal enclosures and been hunted down by the animals.</p><p></p><p>So Linji Zoo was deserted, with only a few people coming to visit.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Que, you don't need to help, there aren't many animals left in the zoo."</p><p></p><p>"That elephant has also developed a frenzy syndrome. Huaren Technology will come to purchase that elephant in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Although the elephant is not yet a demonic elephant, it is enough to be used for producing D-level nutrient solutions.</p><p></p><p>This will also bring them a considerable amount of funding.</p><p></p><p>Father Ning looked at the empty scenery inside the zoo and sighed. Ning Que beside him, however, did not seem to care.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I have cultivated into a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Father Ning nodded calmly, "Good, good, it's good that you've cultivated into a martial artist. The college entrance exam is in three months, you must work harder."</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated into a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>"I know, you've cultivated into a martial artist. So in the future, you must cultivate even harder."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, whether you can make something of yourself depends on whether you can cultivate into a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>"Father, I am already a martial artist now."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, hm?"</p><p></p><p>"What did you just say?"</p><p></p><p>Father Ning turned to look at Ning Que, staring at him up and down in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Say that again?"</p><p></p><p>Father Ning had been thinking about how to sell the elephant for a good price. He only heard Ning Que mention something about being a martial artist, but he didn't quite catch the details.</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated into a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>The calm voice fell on Father Ning's ears once more.</p><p></p><p>Father Ning smiled, this time he finally heard it clearly.</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist, a martial artist, good!"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Que, you're making progress."</p><p></p><p>Ning Que was excited, but he didn't show it. The young man walked towards the elephant in the enclosure.</p><p></p><p>The elephant's strength was too great, so it was kept in a separate enclosure.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this elephant, Ning Que felt inspired.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Skill has twenty-two forms, the Divine Elephant has eight forms, the True Dragon has eight forms, and the remaining six forms are the Dragon Elephant forms. So if I observe the elephant and cultivate?</p><p></p><p>"Dragon and Elephant, observe its form. If I could also drink its blood, it might aid my cultivation of the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>Ning Que stared at the elephant, "Father, can we not sell the elephant? I want to use this elephant to cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill."</p><p></p><p>Not sell the elephant?</p><p></p><p>Use the elephant to cultivate the Dragon Elephant Skill?</p><p></p><p>Father Ning didn't know what the Dragon Elephant Skill was, but his son had already become a martial artist. It was just an elephant, so if he didn't want to sell it, then they wouldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll listen to you. Tomorrow I'll call and reject Huaren Technology's offer."</p><p></p><p>Ning Que's eyes lit up. He needed to find an opportunity to drink some elephant blood first!</p><p></p><p>New book setting sail, begging for everything!</p><p></p><p>Give me a recommendation ticket, a monthly ticket, a reward?</p><p></p><p>It's been several days, and it's all blank, too tragic!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>An elder of pure yang, even sword immortals of the Sword Sect could not resist him!</p><p></p><p>And now, the second elder of pure yang has descended!</p><p></p><p>This elder of pure yang, like the first one, wore a face veil and walked in the void, surrounded by pure yang radiance. Divine eyes could not see any information about this elder of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>"Stupid!"</p><p></p><p>The second elder of pure yang scolded loudly, but the first elder of pure yang did not refute him.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly capture the Sword Child!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the void, pure yang aura intertwined with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>An arm descended from beyond the heavens, a heaven-spanning arm condensed from pure yang spiritual consciousness, spanning the azure sky and reaching towards the Sword Child.</p><p></p><p>Sword immortals of the Sword Sect wielded flying swords, unleashing sword auras to strike the pure yang arm, but before they could approach, the pure yang aura melted them.</p><p></p><p>Powerful!</p><p></p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>The elders of pure yang had already surpassed the realm of cultivators. Their dimension of life was elevated, both their strength and longevity raised to an untouchable height.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of the way!"</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Peak Master, Celestial Snow Peak Master, and Nine Yangs Peak Master shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>The three peak masters held a great divine weapon in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Streams of divine power converged into the weapon, activating the dao markings and causing ripples of dao rhythm to scatter the dao and principles.</p><p></p><p>Divine might suppressed heaven and earth, the vast void rippled.</p><p></p><p>It was a divine ship!</p><p></p><p>The Moon Divine Ship!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect's Moon Divine Ship was a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant rays of light condensed from the Moon Divine Ship, emanating the primordial radiance as a divine strike descended.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The massive divine ship connected heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The three peak masters performed heavenly and earthly transformations. Each stood hundreds of zhang tall as they supported the Moon Divine Ship, pouring endless divine power into it.</p><p></p><p>They even crushed a pure yang thought-pearl each.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the pure yang thought-pearls made the divine strike from the Moon Divine Ship even more powerful, able to break through the pure yang body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The world was bathed in white brilliance!</p><p></p><p>The mountains, rivers, sun, and moon, the starry sky and earth were all enveloped in a white radiance.</p><p></p><p>The city of Zhangzhou below was immersed in the white light, the entire city instantly reduced to dust. Only the activation of a great formation barely managed to protect the civilians inside.</p><p></p><p>And this was merely the outermost layer of the divine strike's brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Within the core!!</p><p></p><p>This dazzling primordial ray of light had erupted, surging into the heavens to clash against the pure yang arm.</p><p></p><p>"Riiip!"</p><p></p><p>The pure yang arm was torn apart, thought after thought shattered. Half the arm vaporized in an instant, vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's eyes were temporarily blinded.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly activated his Profound Eyes!</p><p></p><p>His left Profound Eye manifested, piercing through the void of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Around him, sword immortal after sword immortal was blown away. Elder Qu was even forced to retreat while carrying the Sword Child.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, a massive vacuum tunnel had been blasted open. The void was shattered, the vacuum torn apart and intertwined into the image of destruction.</p><p></p><p>There!</p><p></p><p>Two figures stood.</p><p></p><p>One of the figures had his pure yang aura torn apart, even the veil on his face had been knocked off by the divine strike, revealing this elder of pure yang's appearance.</p><p></p><p>He did not disguise himself, his aura scattered and drifting through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This aura was easily recognizable.</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of the Buddha Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"A Bodhisattva of the Buddha Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom!"</p><p></p><p>The three peak masters supporting the Moon Divine Ship let the divine ship dim, streams of dao markings imprinting into the ship before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>This divine weapon was originally used for crossing the stars, so although it had many dao markings, no one had refined them.</p><p></p><p>The three peak masters forcibly awakened the dao markings of the Moon Divine Ship, severely damaging the root of this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>And now that they had discovered the identity of one of the two elders of pure yang, the three peak masters' expressions changed, their faces grim.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom!</p><p></p><p>A Bodhisattva of the Buddha Sect was pursuing the Sword Child of their Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>This was expected, yet also unexpected.</p><p></p><p>"White Jade Peak Master, take the Sword Child and leave!"</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Peak Master struck the Moon Divine Ship, sending it flying into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Rays of guidance light descended from the bright moon on the divine banner, retrieving sword immortal after sword immortal!</p><p></p><p>Soon, only the three peak masters remained, facing the two elders of pure yang from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom, look at what you have done."</p><p></p><p>The other elder of pure yang sighed.</p><p></p><p>"You stay and subdue these three peak masters. I will go after the remaining Sword Sect disciples."</p><p></p><p>The elder of pure yang crossed the void!</p><p></p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p></p><p>Thought-pearl after thought-pearl was crushed. The three peak masters crushed all but one of their pure yang thought-pearls. This remaining thought-pearl governed their spiritual consciousness, while the shattered thought-pearls transformed into streams of pure yang power, enveloping their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Mountain River Peak Master, it seems we must set up the Three Powers Sword Formation today!"</p><p></p><p>"I will take the Heaven position!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Snow Peak Master, the master of the Frost Snow Sword Immortal, smiled. She was born with a proud disposition and had the beauty of a celestial swan descending on water.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Peak Master remained calm. His spiritual consciousness, divine powers, and physical body were all infused with pure yang force, his aura not diminishing but instead rising!</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he would expend everything. Even if he survived, he would fall from the tribulation realm!</p><p></p><p>"Then I will take the Earth position!"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Yangs Sword Immortal moved to take the Human position!</p><p></p><p>The three tribulation realm sword immortals released pure yang aura, interweaving the Three Powers Sword Formation and activating the images of heaven and earth. Sword lights flashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Below, the city of Zhangzhou trembled as sword after sword flew up from below.</p><p></p><p>Soaring into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Not just that, ancient cities across the entire state of Zhangzhou shook, sending divine sword after divine sword flying into the heavens to join the Three Powers Sword Formation.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of swords clustered densely in the celestial vault.</p><p></p><p>Even nearby regions like Youzhou sent divine swords over.</p><p></p><p>The entire celestial vault was blanketed in flying swords, and the Three Powers Great Formation grew larger and larger, enveloping the two elders of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Divine Ship sailed horizontally, its sails billowing as it guided the moonlight, but the void was sealed!</p><p></p><p>The path from Zhangzhou towards Yuzhou, Junzhou, and Qingzhou was completely sealed off in the void!!</p><p></p><p>This was a grand undertaking.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of miles of heaven and earth had the void sealed!</p><p></p><p>There must be more than just three integrated experts behind this to block their return to the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>With the void sealed, even the elders of pure yang could not escape into it.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Divine Ship cannot use the power of the moonlight to flee into the void. Plus, with the ship damaged and the ancient Thunder Pool shattered, it cannot fly to the moon to avoid this tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>"I suspect those two elders of pure yang did this intentionally, to wait for us to refine the Moon Divine Ship!"</p><p></p><p>But they did not expect the divine strike from the Moon Divine Ship to be so powerful!</p><p></p><p>Forcing the Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom to reveal his identity.</p><p></p><p>On the Moon Divine Ship, the sword immortals were pale and colorless, cowed by the might of the elders of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu stood on the divine banner, controlling the Moon Divine Ship's movements across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But the damaged Moon Divine Ship would soon be caught by the pursuing elders of pure yang.</p><p></p><p>Not a single sword immortal responded to Elder Qu, their minds still reeling from the elders' overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qu, we traveled for days from Youzhou into the Zhangzhou region. Why have we not seen anyone from the sect to receive us?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was solemn!</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu turned to see only one disciple still standing by his side.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Cradled in his arms, the Sword Child slept.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Child was already severely injured and had been further battered by the journey, worsening his condition.</p><p></p><p>"You mean to say the sect has also encountered a crisis?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu suddenly realized!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they had traveled across the nine states for so long, news should have reached the Northern Thirteen Cities long ago.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible, but the more likely scenario is that the news never made it to the Northern Thirteen Cities."</p><p></p><p>Someone had sealed off this matter outside the Northern Thirteen Cities!</p><p></p><p>This was the better of the two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>If it was the first...</p><p></p><p>Then this tribulation was likely unimaginably dire, threatening even the Sword Sect itself!</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu's face fell, his aura fluctuating unsteadily. His sword-pearl had been crushed by the Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom, severely depleting his power.</p><p></p><p>The three peak masters had set up the Three Powers Sword Formation, but they could not delay the elders of pure yang for long. Soon, they would catch up!</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu looked at the Sword Child in his arms, then made a hand seal, enveloping the child with divine power.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Child's form dispersed into sword aura!</p><p></p><p>Twenty-two rays of divine light shot out from Elder Qu, entering twenty-two of the disciples.</p><p></p><p>The divine apertures of these twenty-two disciples opened, absorbing the divine lights.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow sword immortals, the final life-or-death battle has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"You are the hope of our Sword Sect, but the Sword Child cannot be allowed to die!"</p><p></p><p>The sword immortals, including Lu Yuan, all looked towards Elder Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I concealed the Sword Child within one of your divine apertures, but even I do not know whose aperture he is hidden in!"</p><p></p><p>This...?</p><p></p><p>The sword immortals, including Lu Yuan, were all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What was the meaning of this?</p><p></p><p>Was he worried there was a traitor among them?</p><p></p><p>So he did not reveal who the Sword Child was hidden within?</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu did not explain further, instead bowing deeply to the sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>"I ask that the sword immortals of my Sword Sect escape back to the sect!"</p><p></p><p>The sword immortals responded with sword chants resounding across the Moon Divine Ship.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, sword aura like clouds burst forth as twenty-one sword-pearls flew out from the Moon Divine Ship, carrying twenty-one sword immortals fleeing into the celestial vault on their flying swords!</p><p></p><p>On the divine ship, only Gu Jiuqing, Lu Yuan, and the distant Si Wuxie remained.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie did not receive any divine light, while Gu Jiuqing had not opened his divine aperture, so he could not conceal anyone either.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Brother, or perhaps in the eyes of these elders from the highest heavens, he is an existence akin to a celestial being. </p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of other disciples of the Sword Sect, this Senior Brother Wuxie, who joined the sect less than a year ago and has not opened his celestial aperture or reached the Imperishable Realm, is normal.</p><p></p><p>So Elder Qu ignored Siwuxie and let him stand on the Moon Divine Ship. </p><p></p><p>Elder Qu looked at Gu Jiuqing with a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>Initially when Gu Jiuqing joined the Sword Sect, he almost killed Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>But because Gu Jiuqing became the leader of the Sword Sect, he hesitated and allowed Gu Jiuqing to join the Mingting Peak!</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to have the Qu family bear the burden of the ancestral temple and pay respects to Gu Jiuqing, only then could the grievances between them be resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Does Elder Qu have something to instruct?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze was equally complicated.</p><p></p><p>"You, you need not be so guarded against this old man."</p><p></p><p>"Then why doesn't the Elder hide the Sword Embryo in Junior Brother Lu's celestial aperture?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was startled and activated his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye to open his celestial aperture.</p><p></p><p>Inside the aperture, there was another divine light, but it was enveloped by a pure yang aura.</p><p></p><p>"Wala!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Divine Eye opened an abnormal vision, the celestial thunder hooked terrestrial fire, mountains and waters met with feng shui, the divine eye pierced through, and in an instant saw through this divine light in the celestial aperture.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing inside the divine light!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Our Sword Sect actually has such a talented genius?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu exclaimed in amazement at Lu Yuan's divine eye.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's a pity that our Sword Sect has met with such a great calamity, otherwise this old man could have accepted you as the true inheritor of the White Jade Peak lineage."</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu sighed endlessly, "Gu Jiuqing ah, it's not that this old man doesn't want to give you the Sword Embryo, but cannot give it to you!"</p><p></p><p>"You are now ranked tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Ranking Board, on your way back to the Sword Sect, you will definitely be ambushed by others."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Embryo will also encounter an ambush from the Pure Yang Ancestral Founder.</p><p></p><p>And as the second person of the Sword Sect, Gu Jiuqing, being ranked tenth on the Dragon and Tiger Board, is the perfect opportunity to have him killed!</p><p></p><p>So the Sword Embryo cannot be given to Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing narrowed his eyes and looked into the distance, "If that's the case, since the Sword Embryo is not given to me, then the remaining twenty-one Sword Immortals don't have the Sword Embryo either!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qu, are you using the lives of these twenty-one Sword Immortals to gamble for the life of the Sword Embryo?"</p><p></p><p>There must be people from other major sects within the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>And among these twenty-one, perhaps one of them has it.</p><p></p><p>So Elder Qu deliberately said this to let the hidden person assassinate these twenty-one Sword Immortals!</p><p></p><p>What a vicious heart!!</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu smiled bitterly, "You've seen through it again."</p><p></p><p>"With your talents and fortunes, you may be able to escape this calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"You should leave quickly! I sense that the Three Talents Sword Formation set up by those three old fellows has been broken."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and leave, this old man can buy you and those Sword Immortals three breaths of time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's feelings towards Elder Qu were very complicated.</p><p></p><p>He thought that after joining the Sword Sect, he would be targeted by Elder Qu.</p><p></p><p>But until the Journey to Chase the Moon, he never received Elder Qu's resentment.</p><p></p><p>And now!</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu is even willing to die for justice!!</p><p></p><p>He did not flee, but stayed behind to seize a thread of life for them.</p><p></p><p>Just like Elder Qu, the Peak Masters of Shanhe Peak, Tianxue Peak, and Jiuyang Peak were the same.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was about to ask where the Sword Embryo was!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura descended from afar, a pure yang practice that shook the vast heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't escape towards the Sword Sect, if the Sword Embryo dies, you will be the hope of our Sword Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>"If you can escape and ascend, please take care of the Qu family for me!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Elder Qu's spiritual power enveloped Gu Jiuqing and pushed him off the Moon Divine Ship!</p><p></p><p>A brilliant pure yang thought flashed and covered Gu Jiuqing's body, transforming into an immense spiritual power that instantly pushed him hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>One breath!</p><p></p><p>Two breaths! </p><p></p><p>Three breaths!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the heavens and earth had collapsed, an ancient divine ship exploded into pieces, the divine banners turned to dust, the thunder pools shattered into fragments, and even the ancient thunder talismans dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Another great vessel capable of ascending to chase the moon was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! Did Elder Qu die?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the abnormal phenomenon hundreds of miles away, Lu Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"He's not dead. Elder Qu, the Peak Masters of Shanhe, Tianxue, and Jiuyang, they are not dead, they will live on in my heart forever!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure did not linger and flew towards the distant realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you're heading towards Yuzhou Prefecture! Are you going back to the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>"But on the way back to the Sword Sect, there will definitely be ambushes from the Buddhist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Yuan believed Gu Jiuqing could sweep away all obstacles, the Buddhist Sect was involved!</p><p></p><p>It took both Senior Liangxiao and Senior Gu to subdue a Buddha.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Pure Yang Ancestral Founders taking action were more than just one!</p><p></p><p>And on the way back to the Sword Sect, the ambushers were unknown, perhaps there were even two unified existences!</p><p></p><p>Escaping from the Sword Sect was the best choice now.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why don't you try persuading Senior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>In the Mud Pill Palace, the Eight Trigrams Ancestral Founder did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"What? You don't believe in your Senior Brother now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan angrily said.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't believe in Senior Brother, but the path to the Sword Sect will definitely be extremely dangerous. The Sword Embryo will surely die, and once the Sword Embryo dies, Senior Brother can ascend to the position of the Sword Embryo!"</p><p></p><p>This was Lu Yuan's thought.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, no need for more words. If I could leave the Sword Sect, I can naturally return to the Sword Sect from the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>"Those twenty-one Sword Immortals cannot have died in vain!"</p><p></p><p>He must bring this news back to the Sword Sect!!</p><p></p><p>And request the Sect Master to take action and purge the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, I need to cultivate for a while, you lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan immediately increased his sword speed, expanding his sword aura to carry Gu Jiuqing in flight.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also closed his eyes, his thoughts touching the Dao Fruit, and his figure appeared on the Blue Star's moon.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I still want to see the limits of the people of the Blue Star!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing appeared on the moon, and in his hand, a pure yang thought condensed into the size of a fingernail.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely the pure yang thought left behind by Elder Qu.</p><p></p><p>This thought had not been fully used, about half of its size remained. It was just enough to suppress the anomalies of the anomalous world.</p><p></p><p>At the Moon Palace Base, arrays had already been set up!</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Jiuqing had given the Blue Star people some of the divine metals from the First Great Villain, and now thirty arrays for forging divine weapons had been completely set up.</p><p></p><p>The nation's major weapons were indeed powerful!</p><p></p><p>With the addition of the previous four major arrays, a total of thirty-four major arrays had been activated, and rolling moonlight surged in from all directions, causing a thick mist to rise on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's sudden appearance did not cause a stir at the Moon Palace Base.</p><p></p><p>Someone came to receive him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a woman appeared before Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This woman, Gu Jiuqing recognized, was none other than Bai Muqian!</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian was cultivating at the Moon Palace Base and had reached the Great Sect Master realm. On her body, there was also a trace of the unique aura of the Supreme Yin Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>This was the Supreme Yin Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>But Bai Muqian's divine body cultivation was clearly not fully accomplished. Why could he see it at a glance?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at Bai Muqian, and Bai Muqian stared back at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, don't look anymore, if word gets out again that Master Gu has feelings for me, this little girl cannot bear it."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian looked at Gu Jiuqing with grievance!</p><p></p><p>She already knew why Hua Yun had to leave her.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who knew about her and Master Gu's affair would react the same!</p><p></p><p>It was already not bad that the Linjiang higher-ups did not immediately tie her up and send her to Master Gu.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>This matter had finally been completely resolved, severing all the lingering matters left behind by his previous incarnation, Gu Zixiu.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, this is the report for the past few months."</p><p></p><p>"It has been two months since Master Gu last came to the moon."  </p><p></p><p>"We have set up thirty-four major arrays on the moon. The first, second, and third arrays have been decommissioned and can no longer capture or refine celestial bodies."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining thirty-one arrays are all over ten kilometers wide. It is estimated that they can capture celestial bodies seven to eight times!"</p><p></p><p>"As of 4 pm today, a total of sixty-five star pearls have been stored at the Moon Palace Base!"</p><p></p><p>"For the Milky Way galaxy, sixty-five small asteroids are insignificant. The researchers have presented their views to Master Gu."</p><p></p><p>"They plan to capture Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf star with a diameter about one-seventh that of the sun and a mass one-eighth that of the sun. To refine this Proxima Centauri into a star pearl would probably take about eight months."</p><p></p><p>"And at least ten arrays would be decommissioned."</p><p></p><p>Bai Muqian asked, "What does Master Gu think? Is it necessary to refine Proxima Centauri?"</p><p></p><p>She was representing the researchers at the Moon Palace Base to ask for Gu Jiuqing's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was expressionless and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>One-eighth of the sun?</p><p></p><p>To be refined into a divine weapon?</p><p></p><p>The moon in the Great Wilderness and the moon of the Blue Star were about the same size, while the sun of the Blue Star was over six million times larger than the moon!</p><p></p><p>One-eighth of the sun?</p><p></p><p>That would be equivalent to eight million times the size of the moon.</p><p></p><p>Eight hundred million or even one million times the size of a star pearl? Keep in mind that star pearls were not as large as the moon.</p><p></p><p>At least eight hundred million times the size of a divine weapon? A divine treasure was an understatement!</p><p></p><p>"Or I could use a celestial body of that size to refine twenty-four star pearls, forming twenty-four celestial realms!"</p><p></p><p>Using the twenty-four celestial realms as implements to certify the Dao!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly realized!</p><p></p><p>This would be his future implement to certify the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>That woman had already been brought in by the housekeeper Xie.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood at the entrance of the main hall. This was his elder sister's friend, so naturally Gu Jiuqing had to get up to welcome her. </p><p></p><p>The woman came alone, without any maidservants or guards. When she saw Gu Jiuqing from afar, a smile appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Linglong's younger brother Gu Jiuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed a handsome and elegant young man, with clear brows and bright eyes, truly a refined appearance."</p><p></p><p>"You are much more handsome than how your sister described you. I didn't expect Gu Linglong's younger brother to be so good-looking."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it seems I'll have to take advantage of you."</p><p></p><p>The woman was in her late twenties, with a soft and alluring figure. Her enticing eyes never stopped seducing Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Half of her sleeve covered half of her fair arm, her legs slightly parted, revealing her exquisite curves.</p><p></p><p>The woman appeared to be in her late twenties, but no woman of that age could possess such enchanting grace.</p><p></p><p>Her flirtatious attire, seductive demeanor, and spring-filled eyes - with just one glance, it made Gu Jiuqing blush.</p><p></p><p>"My boudoir name is Hanxiang, young master, can you smell my fragrance?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper Xie stood by, also at a loss.</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined that Gu Linglong could befriend such a person.</p><p></p><p>Her charming demeanor was unmatched by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just teasing you. Your sister probably didn't introduce me. Well, there's not much for me to introduce about myself either."</p><p></p><p>"I don't often come to the northern lands, but I do have some fame here. They generally call me the Goddess of the Luo River. If you're willing, young master, you can also call me elder sister or aunt."</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper Xie was shocked!</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of the Luo River!</p><p></p><p>She was one of the four greatest celestial maidens of the northern lands. Later, Gu Linglong was named the fifth celestial maiden, the Fairy of the Jade Pool, after leaving the Ancient Tianxuan City.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Linglong emerged too late and could not be compared to those four famous celestial maidens who had already established their reputations long ago.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these four celestial maidens all came from prestigious clans with profound backgrounds that resonated throughout the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Family!</p><p></p><p>An ancient clan deeply rooted in the thirteen ancient cities of the northern lands, with disciples in each city.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that the Luo Family of the northern lands and the Luo Family of the Great Zhou Dynasty were actually from the same lineage, giving the Luo Family the potential to become the number one clan in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Family of Ye Fei, the Xia Family of Xia Qingzhou, the Fan Family of Fan Shaoli, and the Qing Family of Qing Yangbai were all inferior to the Luo Family!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Goddess of the Luo River!</p><p></p><p>She was one of the four greatest celestial maidens of the northern lands. Every movement and smile carried an astonishing seductive charm.</p><p></p><p>If one were to marry such a woman without sufficient capability, there would be nothing but trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing pays respect to Elder Sister, the Goddess of the Luo River!" Gu Jiuqing bowed to the Goddess of the Luo River Hanxiang to show his respect.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, so cautious."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of the Luo River boldly entered the main hall but did not sit down. Instead, she observed the foundations of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family has truly declined. Well, it's not like the Gu Family ever truly rose to prominence. If not for Gu Linglong, I wouldn't even know of the Gu Family's existence in the Ancient Tianxuan City."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the great clans, the Gu Family pales in comparison."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Upon first encountering such beauty, his mind was slightly disturbed.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing had already shed his old skin and been reborn as the peerless celestial prodigy who had undergone eight incarnations and attained enlightenment twice. His state of mind was different from before. In just a moment, Gu Jiuqing regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of the Luo River was startled. Gu Jiuqing actually dared to face her directly!!</p><p></p><p>And there was not a trace of greed in his eyes!</p><p></p><p>To see such a gaze in a mere youth...</p><p></p><p>One must know that upon their first meeting, not only a youth like Gu Jiuqing, even renowned masters would be flustered and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what brings the Goddess Elder Sister to the northern lands?"</p><p></p><p>In recent years, news about the four great celestial maidens of the northern lands had become increasingly scarce.</p><p></p><p>The news about the Goddess of the Luo River had almost completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's to find you!"</p><p></p><p>With a swaying step, the Goddess of the Luo River slipped into Gu Jiuqing's embrace.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess was wearing too little!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could instantly feel the body temperature of the beauty in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Flushed red!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's face was flushed red, already showing a reaction. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to push away the person in his embrace, but the Luoshen beauty didn't budge an inch.</p><p></p><p>This was a powerful cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to steady his mind, but a warm breeze came from beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>"This servant gambled with Linglong, but lost miserably. In the end, this servant could only bet herself, never expecting to still lose."</p><p></p><p>Gambled?</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong gambled with Luoshen?</p><p></p><p>What could Luoshen see in Gu Linglong that made Luoshen lose everything, even herself?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, no no, should be young husband. When will we get married?"</p><p></p><p>Luoshen's eyes were full of laughter as she looked at Gu Jiuqing's restless hands and his averted gaze. Only then did the beauty stand up.</p><p></p><p>The two bodies separated, still carrying each other's warmth on their skin. </p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the butler Xie had sensibly left already.</p><p></p><p>"Get married?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had never considered this.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the young husband wants to cook the rice first before getting married?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, that's also possible."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing hurriedly steadied his mind!</p><p></p><p>He wasn't pretending!</p><p></p><p>If he was a sword immortal now, he would have already taken Luoshen down.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>This woman just talks big but doesn't act. You should make a move instead of just talking.</p><p></p><p>"But before that, can the young husband teach this servant the Three Zhang Golden Body method?"</p><p></p><p>The main hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Luoshen was still smiling at Gu Jiuqing, who had raised his head to look at her.</p><p></p><p>So this was all for the sake of obtaining a Buddhist secret technique!</p><p></p><p>Was the Three Zhang Golden Body method of Buddhism really so powerful? Powerful enough for disciples of great clans to flock to it?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out the golden paper from his embrace.</p><p></p><p>As thin as a cicada's wings, the patterns on the golden paper were clearly visible, with tiny figures seemingly performing secret techniques on it.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a cultivation method. I don't know if Senior Sister Luoshen can tell this brother, what's so extraordinary about this secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a Buddhist secret technique, wasn't she afraid of being hunted down by Buddhists?</p><p></p><p>The four great teachings!</p><p></p><p>Taoism first, Buddhism second! The Sword Gate could only rank third.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist ancestors didn't walk the world, the Buddhist ancestors were number one in the world!</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Luo family behind Luoshen was, they couldn't be a match for Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this page of golden paper, Luoshen smiled charmingly, "Since brother wants to know, this servant will tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Does brother know about Little Western Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Little Western Heaven is the treacherous region of Western Territory, separating it from the Great Wilderness. In this dangerous place, there is a precious monastery called Little Thunder Sound Temple!"</p><p></p><p>"Inside Little Thunder Sound Temple, there is a secret technique called the Horizontal Three Worlds Descent of the Buddha. It is said that by cultivating this method, one can summon the power of three Buddhas and become the most powerful Buddha in history. However, this method was stolen several hundred years ago."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had heard of this!</p><p></p><p>Not just Buddhism's Horizontal Three Worlds Descent of the Buddha, the secret cultivation techniques of other major teachings were also stolen at the same time several hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>But the matter was left unresolved, so Gu Jiuqing had taken it as just a legend.</p><p></p><p>Luoshen smiled charmingly and took the golden paper in her hand.</p><p></p><p>"And now, placed in the position of the Horizontal Three Worlds Descent of the Buddha in Little Thunder Sound Temple, is this Three Zhang Golden Body method!"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated the terror of the Three Zhang Golden Body method!!</p><p></p><p>Although this secret technique couldn't compare to the Horizontal Three Worlds Descent of the Buddha, it was almost on par - this was the ultimate technique of Buddhism!</p><p></p><p>"If one can cultivate the Three Zhang Golden Body, they can summon the Buddha's image, and perhaps find the Horizontal Three Worlds Descent of the Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this servant will cultivate it for a period first. After cleansing myself, I will come find you."</p><p></p><p>Luoshen stood up, holding the golden paper, about to leave the Gu residence.</p>

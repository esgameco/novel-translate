        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Tian Gu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The female form of the Great Power Bodhisattva Guangping swayed, with naked female bodies continuously crawling out from the golden lotus pedestal beneath his feet, surging towards the restrictive spells all around. </p><p></p><p>Although he was a pure yang ancient ancestor who had passed through nine levels of thunder tribulation, completely purifying his primordial spirit into pure yang,</p><p></p><p>There were too many restrictive spells on Tian Gu Mountain. As he forcefully advanced, pushing from the foot of the mountain up to the midway point, he felt a slight strain. </p><p></p><p>His golden body wavered, even showing signs of cracking.</p><p></p><p>"Cracks appearing in the three zhang golden body?"</p><p></p><p>He had been too reckless and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully pushing through the restrictive spells of Tian Gu Mountain, suppressing heaven and earth with his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>But these were restrictive spells left over from ancient times, each containing great terror. Only a bodhisattva who had cultivated the Three Golden Body Dharma could withstand it. Otherwise, the fleshly body of any other pure yang ancient ancestor of unified body would have long been torn apart by the restrictive spells.</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping looked at the dark Tian Gu Mountain!</p><p></p><p>He could sense that aura imbued into the body of the Future Buddha, it was on the mountain!</p><p></p><p>"The Future Buddha is still on the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>The bodhisattva's figure paused, his hands intertwined, one making the orchid finger mudra, the other pushing into the void, his dharma power like silk threads extending towards the restrictive spells.</p><p></p><p>There were many types of restrictive spells, each constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Bodhisattva Guangping could only painstakingly break through the spells one by one, but this was far too inefficient.</p><p></p><p>"Future Buddha! This Buddha shall bestow upon you the uninterrupted hell!"</p><p></p><p>The female bodhisattva revealed a hint of anger.</p><p></p><p>On her orchid finger appeared the image of a bodhisattva, the dharma body of Guangping the Great Power Bodhisattva himself. With focused intention, he began using all his power to decipher the restrictive spells, pure yang interweaving!</p><p></p><p>On the cliff edge, Lu Yuan stood at a distance, not disturbing Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>He was not at the Celestial Realm, one casual touch of the restrictive spells could annihilate him.</p><p></p><p>The eight patriarchs of the Mud Pill Palace did not speak, occasionally glancing at this ancient divine mirror through Lu Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Save me."</p><p></p><p>The voice kept coming from within the divine mirror, but growing weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stood still, not acting recklessly.</p><p></p><p>He was observing this mirror surface intently!</p><p></p><p>The mirror surface was like a wall, bearing the imprints of ages, with strands of restrictive spells scattered across it.</p><p></p><p>He had ascended Tian Gu Mountain via the Xiaoyao Roaming Steps, but if he carelessly touched the restrictive spells, he too would face tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Save me."</p><p></p><p>These cries for help came from only two sources!</p><p></p><p>This meant that of the three ancient fiends from the Primordial Era, only two remained alive now.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the third fiend would also be calling out.</p><p></p><p>"The three ancient fiends were suppressed by the ancient divine mirror, unable to leave this place. But if I employ the Xiaoyao Roaming Steps, I should be able to enter."</p><p></p><p>But then what after entering?</p><p></p><p>Would he be able to come back out?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's three thousand thoughts flowed, myriad divine thoughts flickering as he contemplated this matter.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Jiuqing had made his decision.</p><p></p><p>He transmitted his voice to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Lu, you wait for me here."  </p><p></p><p>"This senior brother shall enter the ancient divine mirror first!"</p><p></p><p>The speed at which the Great Power Bodhisattva Guangping was breaking through had slowed significantly.</p><p></p><p>For this bodhisattva to chase all the way here would still require an unknown amount of time!</p><p></p><p>This period would be enough for Gu Jiuqing to make his moves.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan nodded, not being polite at all as he sat down right there, even taking out some pieces of the Supreme Primordial Divine Gold to examine their patterns.</p><p></p><p>In Lu Yuan's view of the world, it was impossible for Gu Jiuqing to perish.</p><p></p><p>This so-called ancient divine mirror was merely going to become another experience for his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>With a shift of Gu Jiuqing's thoughts, the Xiaoyao Roaming Steps were employed once more.</p><p></p><p>Thoughts, dharma power, spirit soul, fleshly body - everything was infinitely stretched. In an instant, Gu Jiuqing appeared within the ancient divine mirror.</p><p></p><p>The divine mirror!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure re-condensed, materializing out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>A sense of suffocation came over him - pressure!</p><p></p><p>Boundless pressure descended upon his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>The dharma power in his dantian was compressed. Without Gu Jiuqing needing to condense his elixir field, his dharma power shrank into a corner of the dantian, solidifying into a solid elixir field the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>And as the pressure grew greater and greater, this palm-sized solid elixir field continued condensing!</p><p></p><p>Gradually solidifying to the size of a fist, the elixir field finally took its ultimate form.</p><p></p><p>Shua la la -----</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's hair swayed, each strand rippling. His fleshly body was simply too powerful, far surpassing his dharma power.</p><p></p><p>Under such immense pressure, his fleshly body showed no changes at all, still remaining human-sized without being compressed.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the space within the ancient divine mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing narrowed his eyes slightly, opening his left eye's profound pupil.</p><p></p><p>His divine eye illuminated, the profound pupil manifesting as he scanned the space within the ancient divine mirror.</p><p></p><p>This space was filled with an unknown oppressive force - just this force alone could crush the fully realized divine bodies of those not at the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>Here, he saw numerous corpses, reduced to mere white bones with their divine radiances completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Not far away was a slightly more intact corpse.</p><p></p><p>A skeletal figure sat cross-legged, its divine radiance completely gone, the bones riddled with cracks.</p><p></p><p>But some of the bones clearly did not belong to this skeletal figure, having been taken from other white bones and grafted onto it.</p><p></p><p>For example, the skull on this skeletal figure!</p><p></p><p>This skull was too small, having been dug out from the larger skull at Gu Jiuqing's feet and attached to the skeletal figure.</p><p></p><p>His profound pupil illuminated, scanning every corner of the space.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's body shifted, and a large portion of his dharma power dissipated!!</p><p></p><p>Even his profound pupil could not slowly close!</p><p></p><p>"Employing divine abilities and the divine eye within the ancient divine mirror consumes a huge amount of dharma power?"</p><p></p><p>Using the divine eye requires the catalyzing force of dharma power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one could also use the innate power of the spirit reservoir, like the primordial spirit or vital essence.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Jiuqing did not draw upon the power of his fleshly body, which contained the primordial source - he still needed to rely on the Xiaoyao Roaming Steps to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, his fleshly body traversing the space of the divine mirror, arriving at its innermost region.</p><p></p><p>This area was the most chaotic, piled with divine weapons and white bones!</p><p></p><p>The markings on the divine weapons had long lost their spiritual natures, only faint imprints remaining etched upon them, hinting at their former divine might.</p><p></p><p>"Great artifacts!"</p><p></p><p>Among this pile of divine weapons, Gu Jiuqing discovered...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A great artifact. </p><p></p><p>This great artifact took the shape of a large blade, with over four thousand streaks and patterns on its surface, but these streaks had now become dim and extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Even this great artifact had its spiritual essence corroded over the long passage of time.</p><p></p><p>White bones, divine weapons, a mess of rotten objects, and a few bean curd-like stones.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the two venerable elders? This junior heard your calls from the outside world and personally entered this ancient divine mirror, but why can't I see your figures?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing bowed to this pile of miscellaneous objects. </p><p></p><p>His gaze fell upon two desiccated corpses among the mess!</p><p></p><p>The two desiccated corpses were covered by unknown garments, their eye sockets deeply sunken, the two eyeballs having lost their luster, with sparse strands of hair remaining, only a layer of skin wrapped around the flesh.</p><p></p><p>No heartbeat, blood flow or circulation of spiritual power could be detected from these two corpses.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were already dead!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing remained still, staring at the figures of the two corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't the two venerable elders show yourselves?"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't come out, this junior will have to leave."</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>Apart from Gu Jiuqing's voice, there was no other sound in this place.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Jiuqing shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The two faint voices that had sounded earlier finally appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, do you have a way to leave this place?"</p><p></p><p>"Please take us two with you, we can give you all our life's treasures."</p><p></p><p>Weak voices, feeble auras, came from the two desiccated corpses.</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Jiuqing's gaze, the two corpses moved.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the withered strands of hair fell from their heads, and the clothes they wore disintegrated into powder as they shook.</p><p></p><p>The two desiccated corpses, leaning against the wall, straightened their bodies, their eyes turning slightly, looking at Gu Jiuqing with hope.</p><p></p><p>The two great scourges from the Primordial Era had emerged.</p><p></p><p>But were these two desiccated corpses really the great scourges that ran rampant in the Primordial Era?</p><p></p><p>Miserable!</p><p></p><p>Too miserable!</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Jiuqing's scrutiny,</p><p></p><p>the dantians within the two corpses were depleted, all the wondrous gates had long been closed, even fusing with the dantians and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three vertebrae were dim, the thirty-fourth celestial platform was covered in dust, the entire mud pill palace was shrouded in a gloomy substance, all the celestial apertures had shriveled, devoid of the brilliant twinkling of the myriad stars.</p><p></p><p>Their primordial spirits had vanished, their spiritual powers were gone, even the spiritual essences stored in their flesh were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>A celestial being of the tribulation realm, having crossed seven or more levels of great figures, had fallen into such a wretched state.</p><p></p><p>The two great scourges looked at Gu Jiuqing weakly, "Young friend, young friend, we have been trapped here for thousands of years, almost ten thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>One desiccated corpse spoke with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Please, young friend, take us away, we are willing to follow you and protect you on the Way!"</p><p></p><p>The other desiccated corpse also said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled faintly, "Great Scourges, there's no need for such courtesies."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The two desiccated corpses felt a bit awkward, it seemed this person knew their identities.</p><p></p><p>To have the Great Scourges follow him?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he afraid the Great Scourges would turn against him?</p><p></p><p>These Great Scourges rampaged through the Primordial Era, committing all sorts of evils in the Great Wilderness. To have them protect him on the Way, wasn't that just asking for a quicker death?</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, we won't hide anything either."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, since you were able to find this place, you must have powerful backing!"</p><p></p><p>The slightly taller desiccated corpse kicked a stone over.</p><p></p><p>"As long as young friend can rescue us, we will give you all our treasures!"</p><p></p><p>The stone cracked open, revealing a universe bag.</p><p></p><p>The universe bag was ancient, the seals engraved on it already nine-tenths dispelled.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Jiuqing's divine sense entered the universe bag, even his state of mind was shaken.</p><p></p><p>This universe bag was too large, containing universes within, even bigger than all of Gu Jiuqing's combined universe bags.</p><p></p><p>Within the ancient divine mirror, the universe bag had also been corroded.</p><p></p><p>Many of the universes inside had collapsed, but the remaining universe was still quite vast.</p><p></p><p>Divine metals!</p><p></p><p>All of them were divine metal materials!</p><p></p><p>Most were divine metal materials Gu Jiuqing had never seen before, he even saw the complete model of a heavenly palace!</p><p></p><p>That was a heavenly palace from the ancient Celestial Court, plundered by the Great Scourges!!</p><p></p><p>It was unknown where these Great Scourges had excavated the ruins of the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>With so many divine metal materials, enough to forge the three great formations at least thirty times!</p><p></p><p>In other words, Gu Jiuqing now had the basic materials for ninety great formations!</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elders jest."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed the universe bag into his Incomplete Mountain, smiling at the two Great Scourges.</p><p></p><p>"The two Venerable Elders were the great scourges that rampaged through the Primordial Era, this bag of divine metals can hardly live up to your reputations."</p><p></p><p>There was only divine metal left in the universe bag, which did not perplex Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Within the ancient divine mirror, there was a mysterious oppressive force, coupled with the mirror's space corroding everything.</p><p></p><p>For the two Great Scourges to have survived from the Primordial Era until now, they must have consumed all the great medicines they carried long ago.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing even suspected that the white bone skeleton was the third Great Scourge.</p><p></p><p>And the third Great Scourge's strength was lower than the first and second, so the two greater Scourges joined forces to devour the third!</p><p></p><p>The two Great Scourges exchanged a glance, the taller desiccated corpse opened his mouth in a grin.</p><p></p><p>"When we first entered the forbidden grounds, we only brought this much with us. If we had carried our entire fortunes, we would not have ended up in such a state."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the corpses on the ground and sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Scourges of the Primordial Era rampaged through the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because of the expedition of the Ancient Mountain that they were all buried here.</p><p></p><p>The first Great Scourge sighed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, young friend, the divine metals and great medicines we obtained in those years are all buried in an absolutely safe place. As long as you take us out, we will definitely tell you this information."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled, "Can the two Venerable Elders keep your word?"</p><p></p><p>The first and second Great Scourges...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly nodded, "Of course, I'll count it."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's settled like this. I've already notified the elders of our sect. It won't be long before the sect elders come here in person to rescue us!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Sect elders?</p><p></p><p>The two desiccated corpses looked deeply at Gu Jiuqing, then smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, do you have any spirit pills on you?"</p><p></p><p>The two great villains were too weak. They had been trapped here, and the spiritual power within their bodies had long been exhausted. All the wondrous paths were closed. Adding to that, their spirit essences had disappeared. At this moment, they were even weaker than ordinary mortals by several times.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out two bottles of spirit pills openly. "I was in a hurry when I left, so I didn't bring many spirit pills with me."</p><p></p><p>The great villains didn't mind. They swallowed the spirit pills one by one, then sat next to Gu Jiuqing to refine the medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>Soon, rays of light appeared from the two desiccated corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Let them recover a bit of their spiritual power. With the ways of the great villains, they will definitely attack and suppress me here!"</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Jiuqing was like someone carrying gold bricks, flaunting them in the market.</p><p></p><p>The two great villains had been weak for too long. Knowing there was a chance to get out, they couldn't possibly let this opportunity slip by.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Jiuqing had just said that the sect elders would rescue them.</p><p></p><p>The two great villains had no worries, so they would definitely attack him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the two great villains refining the spirit pills and asked them.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, seniors, why did you enter Tiangu Mountain back then?"</p><p></p><p>Tiangu Mountain?</p><p></p><p>The first and second great villains paused. This was the first time they had heard of Tiangu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time we've heard the name of this divine mountain within this ancient ruin."</p><p></p><p>After refining one spirit pill, the first great villain's voice was noticeably stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's quite laughable when you think about it."</p><p></p><p>The first great villain said slowly.</p><p></p><p>During the Primordial Chaos era, the three great villains rampaged through the wilderness and had amassed quite a force.</p><p></p><p>"Once, I excavated a spirit-communicating divine book from an ancient ruin. This divine book recorded the materials for the divine gold of the world."</p><p></p><p>"On that day, I happened to pass by this place. The spirit-communicating divine book emitted a radiance, and that's how we learned that there was a treasure trove on this divine mountain, Tiangu Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>A spirit-communicating divine book?</p><p></p><p>An ancient treasure!</p><p></p><p>The ancient ruin the first great villain mentioned should be the one outside of the Great Zhou region.</p><p></p><p>"So I joined forces with my second and third brothers and entered Tiangu Mountain. Little did we expect to encounter a demon god on Tiangu Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>A demon god?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly realized, "Is the demon god you're referring to the monster trapped by the divine gold chains on the cliff edge?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the one with red fur all over its body!"</p><p></p><p>Not an ancient ancestor!</p><p></p><p>But a demon god!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered.</p><p></p><p>Demons and monsters roamed the wilderness, and these evil beings were born from demon lairs and monster lairs. They were collectively called demons and monsters by the human race.</p><p></p><p>However, there were no records in recent or ancient history of demons or monsters becoming gods.</p><p></p><p>Why was there an ancient demon god suppressed under Tiangu Mountain??</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods had fallen, yet this demon god alone did not die?</p><p></p><p>The first great villain sighed, "That demon god had red fur all over its body and only one leg. It resembled a phoenix to some extent."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>But the monster Gu Jiuqing had just seen clearly had a human body.</p><p></p><p>The first great villain noticed Gu Jiuqing's confusion and explained.</p><p></p><p>"What you saw was the demon god's sealed form. If the demon god awakens, it will be a one-legged, phoenix-like demon god!"</p><p></p><p>It's easy to distinguish demons from monsters.</p><p></p><p>Demons have demonic aura, while monsters have monstrous aura. Monsters have horns.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also beings that are both demon and monster, with demonic and monstrous aura coexisting.</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness, if it's not human, then it's an evil being!</p><p></p><p>Humans must eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't ask the first great villain how he knew this.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that they had angered the demon god back then!</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the divine gold that the spirit-communicating divine book detected was the divine gold chains suppressing the demon god. By the time we realized this, it was too late."</p><p></p><p>The first great villain shook his head and sighed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"That was the most dangerous situation we've ever encountered!"</p><p></p><p>The first and second great villains didn't dwell on reminiscing further.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, we discovered this wall here. Although we escaped the demon god's pursuit, we ended up trapped in this place for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>The first great villain changed the subject and looked at Gu Jiuqing, also asking.</p><p></p><p>"I still don't know what your sect is called."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect? Which person founded that lineage?</p><p></p><p>The two great villains were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The founding patriarch of my Sword Sect is the Primordial Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>The two great villains' expressions changed, and they fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They had also heard of the Primordial Sword Immortal's name.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, and after a long while, the two great villains finished refining the spirit pills. They had recovered a bit of their power, but the two great villains still hadn't made a move.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing simply closed his eyes and touched the Dao fruit with a strand of thought.</p><p></p><p>The remaining 2,999 strands of thought were still in the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was about to enter the Blue Star to deliver this bag of divine gold materials to the Dragon Kingdom, so they could forge the three great formations.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, shall we attack?"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, when should we attack?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect is actually the lineage of the Primordial Sword Immortal. Big brother, if we fall into the Primordial Sword Immortal's hands, we might as well remain trapped here."</p><p></p><p>"This kid was able to enter the ancient ruin, so he must have treasures on him. If we devour and refine him, our cultivation will recover at least fifty or sixty percent!"</p><p></p><p>"Once we recover our cultivation, even those sect elders of his will just be food for us!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can get out, with our strength, we can continue rampaging through the wilderness."</p><p></p><p>The first great villain closed his eyes to cultivate, while the second great villain's voice transmission kept ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is only at the Unitary Realm, but he can withstand the pressure of this place. That's quite extraordinary. However, if we ambush him now, he will definitely die."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, say something."</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait until when? Big brother, are you really going to let someone take away the accumulation of our many years just like that?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The second great villain sighed inwardly and could only continue waiting reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more chapters, there's still one more picture.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

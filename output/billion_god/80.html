        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Sword Palace, inside the main hall. </p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan stood quietly on the main hall, waiting patiently. He occasionally glanced towards Gu Jiuqing who was seated on the hall.</p><p></p><p>This senior brother was amiable and approachable, without the arrogant demeanor of a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Just earlier, a family letter from the northern lands was passed on to Senior Brother Gu by him.</p><p></p><p>This letter was from Gu Linglong.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing thought that today was the day to view the moon by the river, or perhaps the day of the imperial examination by the river. Additionally, with the river blockade lifted, he had to make a trip to the Blue Star to spread the teachings.</p><p></p><p>It was fortuitous that he encountered Lu Yuan delivering the letter.</p><p></p><p>The contents of the letter were simple. Gu Linglong had heard that Gu Jiuqing had joined the Sword Sect and was very happy about it.</p><p></p><p>She also mentioned the matters of the Luo Shen and the Celestial Maiden, and finally brought up the issue of Chu Xiangyu, saying that she would arrange for her husband to come to the Sword Sect to find her as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>[Little brother, the true painting of Buddha is hidden within this letter. If you burn it, you will automatically obtain the true painting of Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Now that you have joined the Sword Sect, you can cultivate the supreme Daming Sword Classic of the Daming Peak. This ultimate technique is no inferior to the Three Zhang Golden Body Art, but the Daming Sword Classic requires observing the celestial realm and tracing the heavenly palace in order to unleash its supreme power.</p><p></p><p>Sister has recently discovered the location where the celestial palace fell during the 18th Celestial Era. It won't be long before sister paints the celestial palace of the 18th Celestial Era for you to observe.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Sword Sect is a great blessing, but the Sword Sect is deep and treacherous. Although the Sect Master is ranked third in the world, that Sect Master walks on thin ice, not just in the Sword Sect, but also in the Celestial Pavilion and Great Zhou. When the Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor seek to achieve deification, the Sword Sect Master will definitely be eliminated by them. The Sword Sect may be good, but you must not linger there, little brother.]</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect may be good, but do not linger?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart stirred. Why would his sister say such a thing?</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong was too mysterious, as if she had obtained an ancient inheritance and soared to great heights, moving between sects and the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>For her to say this, she must have her reasons.</p><p></p><p>"But as long as the world of the Great Wilderness doesn't change within the next ten years, then the Great Wilderness is unlikely to undergo any major changes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing continued reading the letter.</p><p></p><p>[Beware of the madman in the Sword Sect, little brother. This madman even dares to slice up deities.</p><p></p><p>As for the Third Elder who cultivates the Five Elements Sword Intent, this elder has gone insane from cultivating the Five Elements Sword Intent and also practices the Buddha's Silence Meditation, binding his mouth with three words. If you hear him utter the fourth word, you must run. This is a sign that the Third Elder of your Sword Sect has gone insane again.]</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liang Xiao? The secrets of the Second and Third Elders, how does sister know them so clearly?</p><p></p><p>[Your benefactor master's great limit is approaching. You can get close to him. The Daming Peak lineage cannot possibly be passed down to that madman. You are the best candidate. If you can obtain the Sword Furnace, you can conquer this world!</p><p></p><p>You need not associate with the Three Sword Immortals of the Sword Sect. Those three will die sooner or later. The other true transmissions are not worth mentioning. During this period, you should focus on cultivating in the Sword Sect. After some time, sister will send you the painting of the celestial palace!]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing stared at the letter in silence for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong!</p><p></p><p>He was finding it increasingly difficult to understand his sister.</p><p></p><p>The Three Sword Immortals of the Sword Sect will die sooner or later?</p><p></p><p>The Three Sword Immortals - Senior Brother Lieyang of Jiuyang Peak, Senior Brother Feng of Manhuang Peak, and Senior Sister Hanxue of Tianxue Peak - were all Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>These three Sword Immortals would die eventually?</p><p></p><p>Why would they die?</p><p></p><p>It was incomprehensible, truly incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing put away the painting and looked down at Lu Yuan standing below.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sensed it and immediately looked up. "Senior Brother Gu, there have been some disturbances at the ancient ruins in Great Zhou recently."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Do tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan relayed all the information he had obtained from his family.</p><p></p><p>During this period, disciples from major sects, members of the Zhou royal family, prodigies, and experts had gathered outside the ancient tomb of the Immortal Lord. They even employed eight great artifacts to blast open the Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>It was called the Immortal Lord's tomb, but it was actually the place where the Immortal Lord had fallen. This place was quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>It could suppress one's cultivation. It was said that even Celestial Realm cultivators would be suppressed to the Spirit Condensation Realm upon entering the Immortal Lord's tomb.</p><p></p><p>"That Great Celestial Lord was formidable. Wielding a great artifact, he swept away the disciples of major sects, even forcing those few ancient patriarchs to kneel before him."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan became more excited as he spoke. "This Great Celestial Lord painted the scenes of his battle against those ancient patriarchs using great artifacts and compiled them into a painting album, which was then circulated in Great Zhou. Many people paid exorbitant prices to acquire it."</p><p></p><p>That was to be expected. Who wouldn't want to see their sect's ancient patriarch kneeling while wielding a great artifact before a junior?</p><p></p><p>Later, this enraged the ancient patriarchs, who vowed to kill him outside the Immortal Lord's tomb. Only then did the matter subside.</p><p></p><p>Sister!</p><p></p><p>What are you doing?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was completely baffled by Gu Linglong's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Was it for wealth? Spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>Or was it for something else?</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right! It was said that the Seventh Celestial Lord of the Seven Celestial Lords of the Demonic Dao was also spotted outside the Immortal Lord's tomb. However, it seemed that the Seventh Celestial Lord was suppressed by the Great Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Celestial Lords of the Demonic Dao were Tribulation Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>How could the Seventh Celestial Lord be suppressed by his sister?</p><p></p><p>"It was said that the Seventh Celestial Lord was a beauty with a heavenly figure, especially those two... peaks, which were exceptionally magnificent!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan sighed. After being suppressed by the Great Celestial Lord, the Seventh Celestial Lord might have lost her chastity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the matter of the ancient ruins, Gu Jiuqing could not intervene. He could only pray that his sister would not go too far. If she provoked those true ancient monsters, even the restrictive spells within the Immortal Lord's tomb would be destroyed!</p><p></p><p>A Tribulation Realm expert entering the Immortal Lord's tomb would have their cultivation suppressed to the Spirit Condensation Realm. With Gu Linglong possessing a great artifact and perhaps other means, she could indeed suppress the Seventh Celestial Lord when they were both at the Spirit Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan seemed to remember something else and continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"There is another matter to report to Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Earlier, when I went to retrieve the letter, I encountered Si Zhenchuan on the way."</p><p></p><p>Si Zhenchuan?</p><p></p><p>Within the entire sect, or even the entire northern lands, and perhaps even Great Zhou, only Si Wuxie had the surname Si.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan looked puzzled. "He learned that Senior Brother would be going to the moon. Si Zhenchuan asked me to relay a message: Do his eyes resemble the moon of the Great Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie's eyes, do they resemble the moon of the Great Wilderness?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing instantly recalled Si Wuxie's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Eyes like the moon?</p><p></p><p>What was the connection?</p><p></p><p>Were his eyes as bright as the luminous moon?</p><p></p><p>"Previously, at the Sword Tomb, Senior Brother used the Immovable Bright King Eye to compete with Si Wuxie, which allowed us to find all the king-grade flying swords within the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Eyes resembling the moon, is he suggesting that I can cultivate divine eyes on the moon?"</p><p></p><p>Was that the meaning?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt that something was amiss, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Eyes... According to the myths and legends of the Blue Star, Pangu's left eye transformed into the moon. By asking this, is Si Wuxie implying that he is a deity of the Great Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>This thought gradually spread through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie!</p><p></p><p>Could he be a deity??</p><p></p><p>Impossible, this is impossible!</p><p></p><p>If he were truly a deity, why would he join the Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>Even if he were a reincarnated true deity, he would not join another's sect.</p><p></p><p>The deities from before the ancient times have all disappeared. It's impossible for a living deity to suddenly appear.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps I'm overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts dissipated. This idea was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>To divert his thoughts, Gu Jiuqing quickly asked Lu Yuan:</p><p></p><p>"How is the peach seed I asked you to plant doing?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan smiled bitterly. After receiving the peach seed, he had planted it on the True Transmission Island.</p><p></p><p>He nourished it with spiritual liquid!</p><p></p><p>This was the task Gu Jiuqing had assigned him, so he naturally reported it to his family.</p><p></p><p>They then used spiritual liquid to water it!</p><p></p><p>However, after so many days, the peach seed showed no signs of change or sprouting.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the peach seed has not responded yet."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pondered for a moment before saying, "Go dig up the peach seed. I'll try planting it elsewhere."</p><p></p><p>The peach seed was from an ancient peach tree. Ordinary methods could not make it grow.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>So what if it was planted on the moon?</p><p></p><p>Planted on the moon of the blue planet. </p><p></p><p>He was going to the blue planet later to set up the teleportation array in the school, opening the passage to the moon.</p><p></p><p>It would be perfect to plant this peach seed on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang, Jingyang Residential Area, a residential building, Room 1701.</p><p></p><p>The house Gu Zixiu rented was very big. These days, Gu Lao'er had been sleeping here.</p><p></p><p>From the 1st to now the 7th, he had basically explored Linjiang.  </p><p></p><p>The bedroom!</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er looked at the draft notes recorded on the table, detailing the events that happened in Linjiang over the past three months.</p><p></p><p>"Three months ago, Linjiang began to be sealed off. It was also at this time that the Dragon and Elephant Skill and Sword Drawing Technique were fully promoted in Linjiang! Among them, the students of Class 2, Grade 3 of Linjiang High School were the best, and the Dragon and Elephant Skill was passed down from them."</p><p></p><p>A group of high school students could pass down the supreme Dragon and Elephant Skill?</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er had also cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill. On the Linjiang forum, he downloaded the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill, the Sword Drawing Technique, the Divine Body Cultivation Method, and the Divine Aperture Opening Method!</p><p></p><p>He had memorized all these skills.</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, too unbelievable. In this world, there actually exists such an exquisite Dragon and Elephant Skill, as well as cultivation methods for the Immortal realm, yet in Linjiang they are widespread!"</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the divine body is the way of the Earth Immortal, opening the celestial divine apertures is the way of the Land Immortal. This is the path of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>But the entire Dragon Kingdom doesn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>"And these skills, at least the Dragon and Elephant Skill and the Sword Drawing Technique, were spread from the school."</p><p></p><p>The methods of the Earth Immortal and Land Immortal also had a high possibility of being spread from Linjiang High School.</p><p></p><p>And!</p><p></p><p>His grandnephew was a teacher at Linjiang High School, and also the teacher of Class 2, Grade 3.</p><p></p><p>Adding to what he saw on June 1st!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er suspected that these skills!</p><p></p><p>All came from his grandnephew's hands.</p><p></p><p>His blood surged, and he suddenly performed the 22 forms of the Dragon and Elephant Skill. After completing it once, all 206 bones in his body were completely refined!</p><p></p><p>He reached the pinnacle of Bone Refinement in one go, his meridians opened, and his muscles and bones resonated together. He officially entered the Tendon Refinement realm, becoming a great master.</p><p></p><p>"I just became a great master like this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er couldn't believe it about himself.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the Dragon and Elephant Skill for five or six days, and combined with his foundation, he broke through the master realm. Such a skill was dozens or even hundreds of times more powerful than the supreme skills of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>He naturally looked towards the other room.</p><p></p><p>For six days, Gu Lao'er hadn't seen his grandnephew appear.</p><p></p><p>He had also knocked on Gu Jiuqing's bedroom door, but no one answered.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep ----"</p><p>"Beep beep beep ----"</p><p></p><p>The ringtone of his phone sounded with notifications. Gu Lao'er was going to ignore it, but there were too many notification sounds.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his phone to look, "Connected to the signal outside of Linjiang?"</p><p></p><p>The network was restored!</p><p></p><p>Those were messages from relatives and friends, as well as from the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Lao'er left the imperial capital, he had been trapped in Linjiang for many days. For such a long time, the Gu Family had no news of him, so they were naturally anxious.</p><p></p><p>"The network is restored, doesn't that mean the skills from Linjiang will spread to the Dragon Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er's expression changed, and then he was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"No, there are still many foreign spies in the Dragon Kingdom. If these skills also spread overseas..."</p><p></p><p>"I must first notify the family and have the family join forces with other aristocratic families to seal off cultivation in the Dragon Kingdom!!"</p><p></p><p>Close the country and focus on cultivating the Dragon and Elephant Skill!</p><p></p><p>Beep beep beep.</p><p></p><p>Another notification sound came. It was a message from his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in Linjiang, where did you go?"</p><p></p><p>Within these ten days or so, there were quite a few messages his elder brother had sent him.</p><p></p><p>"How did you handle Zixiu's matter?"  </p><p></p><p>"Did you see him?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you run into any trouble? Go to the provincial capital and borrow troops from Jiangnan. I've talked to the head of the Jiangnan Branch."</p><p></p><p>And this last message came at 9:30 am, right when the network had just been restored.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother came to Linjiang?</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er smiled. This was great.</p><p></p><p>With his elder brother in Linjiang, he could quickly inform him about this matter.</p><p></p><p>He called his elder brother's number, but no one answered.</p><p></p><p>"My elder brother is currently in Linjiang. He's going to look for my grandnephew, so he must be going to the school."</p><p></p><p>So!</p><p></p><p>If he went to the school now, he could meet up with his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er hurriedly put on his clothes and was about to walk out of the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>The door to the other bedroom opened, and Gu Jiuqing came out.</p><p></p><p>"Grandnephew!??"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lao'er was both surprised and delighted. His grandnephew finally came out of the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Jiuqing hadn't already cultivated to the master realm, he would have been worried that Gu Jiuqing would starve to death in the room.</p><p></p><p>"En, Uncle?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>His uncle was a relative of this body. When his uncle came to Linjiang, he couldn't just let him stay on the streets, right?</p><p></p><p>So when Gu Jiuqing left the Blue Planet, he arranged for his uncle to stay in the other bedroom.</p><p></p><p>He had just descended from the Sword Gate to the Blue Planet. After opening the bedroom door, he ran into Gu Lao'er.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to the school for a bit now."</p><p></p><p>"Linjiang High School? I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let his grandnephew know that his father had come to Linjiang to look for him yet.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing and Gu Lao'er left the house together.</p><p></p><p>"Bang ---"</p><p></p><p>The door to the house closed. The two took the elevator downstairs and appeared in the residential area.</p><p></p><p>And this scene was also noticed by some people with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Through the huge floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p></p><p>The smiles on the faces of the martial kings quickly disappeared as they watched the school gate in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>"They've come!"</p><p></p><p>"I see the eight patriarchs of the eight great aristocratic families of the imperial capital."</p><p></p><p>"The seventy-two martial sages of the Dragon Kingdom have been missing for a long time, but now the head of the Jiangnan Provincial Branch has appeared."</p><p></p><p>The principal looked towards Elder Wen!</p><p></p><p>Elder Wen's expression was calm! That head was his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the mayor of Metropolis, the mayor of Yangcheng, the mayor of Nancheng. These three have all come."</p><p></p><p>"The presidents of the Dragon Kingdom's Dragon Academy - Wei, Zheng, Yang, and Sima - have also come."</p><p></p><p>After the Martial Head named each of the major figures of the Dragon Kingdom, all the martial artists present were shaken.</p><p></p><p>They were just the upper echelons of Linjiang, but those personages were the ones who dominated the Dragon Kingdom!!</p><p></p><p>"They've entered the school."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Head withdrew his gaze, his heart calm, his face showing no ripples.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the street below this building, the street leading to Linjiang High School.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many people on the street, as they had gone to watch the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>On the street, two figures were walking side-by-side.</p><p></p><p>"According to reports from the Lunar Base, the manned rocket has successfully landed on the moon. There are personnel who have set foot on the moon and are attempting to set up a teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone probably doesn't know what a teleportation array is."</p><p></p><p>"A teleportation array, as the name implies, can teleport. The Ancestral City plans to set up a teleportation array on the moon to connect with Linjiang High School. At that time, if anyone wants to go to the moon to cultivate, they just need to take the teleportation array."</p><p></p><p>"Next, we'll broadcast the latest developments in Linjiang. The Linjiang municipal government has decided to build an Immortal Academy in Linjiang, using Linjiang High School as the base to create the country's first Immortal Academy. Local residents can be selectively admitted, and once admitted, tuition will be free."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The latest news was being broadcast on the outdoor screen of the mall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing turned the corner and could see Linjiang High School in the distance.</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>He was going to do something big.</p><p></p><p>Spread the teachings, spread the teachings. He was going to spread the teachings to all twenty-three provinces and four municipalities of the Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>A chapter of 4,500 words is presented!</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow at noon it will be published. The editor temporarily notified that 20,000 words will be updated at noon, and another 10,000 words will be updated in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>I beg readers for your support.</p><p></p><p>Big Cat thanks you!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

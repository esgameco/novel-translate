        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The skull was crushed and shattered by Yuan Dan's pressure, with fresh red matter scattered on the ground. Demonic aura pervaded, turning into a dark fog enveloping the headless corpse. </p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator, such a great catastrophe would undoubtedly lead to death.</p><p></p><p>But the Eighth Demonic Prince was too powerful, his vitality exceptionally tenacious. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's Yuan Dan crushed his skull, but before it could shatter his spine, the Eighth Demonic Prince had already recovered to the peak of the Refining Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rays of divine light flickered, the 365 celestial apertures throughout the heavens radiated brilliantly, the 33 vertebrae of the primordial mountain source undulated, and the celestial platform shone resplendently.</p><p></p><p>Those fallen celestial palaces flew back up onto the celestial platform again!</p><p></p><p>Five celestial palaces! Emanating a golden radiance, each palace towering nine zhang tall, their gates opening one by one!</p><p></p><p>Shua la la————— </p><p></p><p>The golden brilliance illuminated heaven and earth, as an enormous head took shape, the Eighth Demonic Prince recomposing his true form.</p><p></p><p>His head destroyed, his true form manifested.</p><p></p><p>And this true form resembled his primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the first celestial palace opened, revealing a transparent primordial spirit standing inside!</p><p></p><p>This primordial spirit was nine zhang tall, with strands of elusive aura draping down around it - scattered falling thoughts intertwining, deducing the great Way.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's primordial spirit had three heads and six arms, a three-headed six-armed demonic warrior form!!</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit emanated a golden divine light, as the second, third, fourth, and fifth celestial palaces opened in succession!</p><p></p><p>The five great celestial palaces radiated boundless divine light, instantly illuminating the area within a hundred li radius as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>The celestial luminescence was swallowed and fused into the Eighth Demonic Prince's true form.</p><p></p><p>Kaka kaka————</p><p></p><p>Kaka kaka!</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's human form dispersed, layer by layer cracking like a mirror and then peeling away, as his true form emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>Three heads coalesced at the neck, these three heads abstruse and somewhat dim, as Gu Jiuqing's Yuan Dan had crushed the Eighth Prince's skull, so even though reformed, much of the spiritual essence was lost.  </p><p></p><p>Six arms, the body, solidified into substance.</p><p></p><p>Below the body, demonic aura gathered into a cloudy mist, akin to human feet.</p><p></p><p>"Weng weng weng——————"</p><p></p><p>Thunderous rumbles issued from the Eighth Demonic Prince's fleshly body, as the celestial palace gates closed one by one, the five great palaces taking residence within the three heads.</p><p></p><p>His figure wavered, the true form fully materialized.</p><p></p><p>A three-zhang tall ox-headed demon would already be immense enough. But the Eighth Demonic Prince's true form was even larger!!</p><p></p><p>A five-zhang-two demonic true form stood beneath the primordial moon tree, the aura emanating from his colossal body roiling like billowing smoke and mist.</p><p></p><p>Demon after demon knelt at the Eighth Prince's feet upon witnessing this.</p><p></p><p>Even the ox-headed demon was no exception.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Eighth Prince!"</p><p>"Greetings to the Eighth Prince!" </p><p>"Greetings to the Eighth Prince!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the demons paid obeisance, one of the six heads on the Eighth Demonic Prince's body, the one facing Gu Jiuqing, suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Black divine light pierced the void, that gaze like divine radiance illuminating the azure darkness.</p><p></p><p>Shamelessly falling upon Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>His true strength was tremendously powerful.</p><p></p><p>Far surpassing Senior Martial Brother Feng!</p><p></p><p>Senior Feng had only cultivated his sword intent to one-tenth attainment, possessing the battle power of the Celestial Palace Realm. </p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Palace Realm was divided into ten grades, with each grade adding another celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Jiuqing's understanding, within the Mud Pill Palace, the spirit soul and primordial spirit could activate one's spiritual power, command the fleshly body, and unleash divine weapons and spiritual abilities!</p><p></p><p>The strength of the primordial spirit determined how quickly one could react.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the primordial spirit, the faster one could unleash spiritual abilities, spiritual power, divine weapons and such onto the opponent, before they could make a move!</p><p></p><p>So among experts, a difference of just one celestial palace grade meant a huge gap in the speed of activating spiritual abilities and power.</p><p></p><p>If the Eighth Demonic Prince had not underestimated the situation and sealed away all his celestial palaces, celestial apertures, and primordial mountain source, </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's spiritual power would have been utterly incapable of breaking through his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>"Honghong——————"</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's true form was majestic, the five-zhang-two body towering seventeen meters tall!</p><p></p><p>His every move seemed to shake the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The demonic true form stared at Gu Jiuqing, his gaze unrestrained. The Eighth Prince was still dazed.</p><p></p><p>This was the thing!</p><p></p><p>That had nearly killed him despite the boundary between their realms?</p><p></p><p>Inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Jun Wuyou was an elite disciple of the Xingxian Court, his future cultivation to the Celestial Palace Realm almost a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>With Jun Wuyou's talents, inheriting the Yuefeng and becoming a Peak Master-level elder was his destined achievement!</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to the seven Peak Master Sword Immortals of the Nine Lineage Sword Sects.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of such talents could even step into the Tribulation Realm.</p><p></p><p>For a genius of this caliber, Jun Wuyou was no match for the Eighth Demonic Prince!</p><p></p><p>In the Refining Spirit Realm, he surpassed Jun Wuyou tenfold. The Eighth Prince's future tribulation transcendence could reach even the seventh or eighth grade Lightning Tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Yet such a peerless demonic prince was defeated by this unknown Sword Sect disciple?</p><p></p><p>Anyone would find this fact unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>The ancient demonic aura encircled heaven and earth, enveloping Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan remained calm, without the slightest hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>Every time!</p><p></p><p>Senior Martial Brother Gu could turn danger into safety, suppressing forcefully.</p><p></p><p>What was there to worry about?</p><p></p><p>Just lie back and relax!</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, you were once the Pure Yang Ancestral Being of dual cultivation, why are you so restless?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Gu just defeated the Eighth Demonic Prince in the Spiritual Power Realm, what's so surprising about that?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, what was so surprising?</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, the Eight Trigrams Elder was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for surprise!</p><p></p><p>But he had just discovered that this Gu Jiuqing, comparable to Jiang Buyu, currently only had the cultivation of the Spiritual Power Realm!</p><p></p><p>Well, or perhaps he was a Spiritual Power Realm cultivator who had refined his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had just barely stepped into the Spiritual Power Realm. This Yuan Dan pellet was very powerful, of extremely high quality, but the forging method was too simple.</p><p></p><p>If he was a veteran of the Spiritual Power Realm, he would not forge the Yuan Dan in such a way.</p><p></p><p>This showed that Gu Jiuqing was exploring the forging method of the Yuan Dan on his own!</p><p></p><p>Heavens, the Yuan Dan forging method?</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Spiritual Power Realm, his spiritual power was thin, only able to open his dantian to one zhang two.</p><p></p><p>When he refined the Nine Cycles Yuan Dan, he could only open it to two zhang three!</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the perfected Primordial Mountain Realm, the accumulated spiritual power in his dantian was four zhang eight!</p><p></p><p>After using the Primordial Mountain to open the celestial apertures, he finally evolved a seven zhang dantian!</p><p></p><p>Upon stepping into the Celestial Palace Realm, his dantian reached eight zhang!</p><p></p><p>Only when he opened the ten great celestial palaces, gathered the three souls and seven spirits, and transcended the first Pure Yang Lightning Tribulation, did he open the nine zhang dantian.</p><p></p><p>So, just how many zhang had this stubborn fellow opened his dantian to in the Spiritual Power Realm?!</p><p></p><p>"No, it's how many zhang he opened in the Spiritual Power Realm that allowed him to suppress the Eighth Demonic Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Five zhang? Six zhang? Seven zhang?</p><p></p><p>No, no, a seven zhang dantian couldn't possibly be stronger than the Eighth Demonic Prince.</p><p></p><p>This stubborn fellow had to have opened at least an eight zhang dantian in the Spiritual Power Realm to be able to suppress the Eighth Prince!</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Prince and Jun Wuyou relied on their higher realms to forcibly open their dantians.</p><p></p><p>But this stubborn fellow was different, opening an eight zhang dantian while still in the Spiritual Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had almost been misled by Lu Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Opening an eight zhang dantian in the Spiritual Power Realm, and self-creating the Pangu Divine Soul Art, stubborn one, oh stubborn one, why can't you become this old man's disciple?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder suddenly realized something and hurriedly closed his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I heard everything you just said."</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Elder felt awkward.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, Senior Martial Brother Gu's talents are incomparable to me, and incomparable even to Master. I accepted this long ago."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan wasn't jealous.</p><p></p><p>What was there to be jealous about?</p><p></p><p>His Senior Martial Brother was the strongest!</p><p></p><p>That was his sole belief.</p><p></p><p>"But the Eighth Demonic Prince has opened five celestial palaces and become a True Human. Just now he was caught off guard by the stubborn one's sneak attack, damaging his celestial palaces, but his overall strength still remains in the Celestial Palace Realm."</p><p></p><p>"To surpass the Primordial Mountain Realm, Divine Soul Realm, and Celestial Palace Realm to battle the Eighth Demonic Prince while only in the Spiritual Power Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He must be crazy!</p><p></p><p>Just as the Eight Trigrams Elder's doubts arose, thunderous rumbles exploded from within the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you old thing, you're not comfortable unless I scold you every day, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"You think I don't know Senior Martial Brother is in the Spiritual Power Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Blah blah blah, just wait and watch Senior Martial Brother display his full might!"</p><p></p><p>Stubborn donkey, his own Master was just a stubborn donkey.</p><p></p><p>Now he was still doubting Senior Martial Brother's great talents?</p><p></p><p>He didn't respond to the Eight Trigrams Elder in the Mud Pill Palace, instead looking towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>There, Gu Jiuqing and the Eighth Demonic Prince gazed at each other from afar. </p><p></p><p>The great battle was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing held the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda in one hand, the other arm resting behind his back, a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had nearly killed a Celestial Palace Realm demonic expert, which was quite regrettable!</p><p></p><p>This feeling of casually slaying an opponent far beyond his realm was truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince seemed to sense Gu Jiuqing's thoughts, the three heads all smiling in unison.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you and I tread the same path. I am a demon, you are human, but we are both peerless prodigies of this era. If I could kill you, the pleasure would surpass slaying ten Jun Wuyous!"</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Prince's open eyes flickered, red and black light intertwining, the red and black pupils spinning incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Already contemplating how to subdue Gu Jiuqing!</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Prince, I won our previous battle, correct?"</p><p></p><p>"So Senior Martial Brother Jun should be allowed to leave this place. I assume the Eighth Prince is a demon who honors his word."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing said indifferently, "Why don't we have another match?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Another match?</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demonic Prince's depraved smile never faded.</p><p></p><p>Let Jun Wuyou go?</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, the Moon Demon had already vanished without a trace. Did this naive human really think he would keep his promise?</p><p></p><p>Interesting!</p><p></p><p>Truly interesting.</p><p></p><p>"How shall we compare?"</p><p></p><p>"In the three secret realms of spiritual power, physical body, and primordial spirit, I surpass the Eighth Prince by a sliver in the Spiritual Power Realm."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Eighth Demonic Prince felt utterly uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"I have not cultivated the Primordial Spirit secret realm, so I cannot compare in that aspect."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You may surpass me in cultivation level, but when it comes to the path of the physical body, we can have a contest!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing sealed his spiritual power, his dantian covered in dust. The yuan pill the size of a strand of hair had already been retrieved by him.</p><p></p><p>The three-zhang wide Zhongmiao Gate no longer emanated spiritual power either.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body has undergone countless sheddings of mortality. I've lost count of how many times I've shed my mortal form."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing spoke the truth. </p><p></p><p>After each of the ten sheddings, receiving the Dragon Elephant cultivation and insights from the Blue Star people would strengthen his physical body.</p><p></p><p>With his current physical body, it could be considered the second stage of the Golden Body, but Gu Jiuqing did not know how powerful the second stage truly was.</p><p></p><p>It was an ambiguous comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! This prince has never shed mortality, but when it comes to the path of the physical body, I demons are undoubtedly number one."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Eighth Prince is very confident in his physical body. If I win this contest, please allow me and my master brother to leave."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>"Please seal your spiritual power and cultivation level, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing made a requesting gesture.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince's eyes swirled, his red-black pupils suddenly stopped, revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He agreed.</p><p></p><p>The three heads shook, and the celestial palaces closed one by one, sealing the five great palaces!</p><p></p><p>Then the divine constructions on Mount Buzhou dimmed, dozens of spirit fruits withered, the celestial platform gathered dust, and even the myriad heavenly acupoints closed again.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his dantian also stilled, utterly silent. </p><p></p><p>Only the surging demonic aura remained, ceaselessly bathing the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The demonic figures behind the Demon Eighth Prince dared not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince had lost a round, who would dare speak up at this moment?</p><p></p><p>If the Demon Eighth Prince devoured them, they would have deserved it.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I have now sealed the celestial palaces, celestial platform, Mount Buzhou and acupoints. Let's battle with just our physical bodies."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince's five-zhang tall figure moved, instantly becoming an afterimage flying towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't say much either!</p><p></p><p>His vital energy rippled, golden vital energy gushing from his baihui point, forming a halo encircling his body.</p><p></p><p>On his azure robed figure were droplets of blood from the Panshan spirit, forming plum blossoms.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and struck down, unleashing the power of his physical body!</p><p></p><p>Just one strike!</p><p></p><p>It carried immense weight, ripping through the void and shattering the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The five-zhang demonic true form remained unmoving like a mountain, its six arms swinging out together.</p><p></p><p>One palm collided with the six arms!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was forced back three steps!</p><p></p><p>The five-zhang demonic true form didn't budge an inch!</p><p></p><p>"The Eighth Prince's physical body is indeed formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"I must go all out now."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing raised his hand!</p><p></p><p>The power of thirty thousand Dragon Elephants converged in his palm. As he swung it, even the void rippled.</p><p></p><p>"Wah wah wah -------"</p><p></p><p>The void seemed to burst apart, an explosive sound appearing as he raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince's eyes flickered with a hint of a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Six-Armed Heavenly Demon!!"</p><p></p><p>He roared, his true form swaying as six arms reached for the heavens. Surging demonic aura scattered, the six arms propping up the sky before crashing down.</p><p></p><p>Like an overturned Mount Buzhou, they fell with boundless might. His true form swayed as he raised the six arms to attack.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gathered the power of thirty thousand Dragon Elephants into his single hand!</p><p></p><p>Using one arm to battle against six!</p><p></p><p>Each time the Demon Eighth Prince's arms clashed with Gu Jiuqing's, his arms would tremble.</p><p></p><p>Soon, red marks appeared on all six of his arms.</p><p></p><p>More than half of the black demonic aura had been shattered, and one arm was even deformed.</p><p></p><p>Strength!</p><p></p><p>It was a collision of sheer strength!</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Demon Eighth Prince's physical body was inferior to Gu Jiuqing's.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Demon Eighth Prince's physical body is weaker than this stubborn one?"</p><p></p><p>That was a demonic true form tempered in the Celestial Palace realm, and with the Demon Eighth Prince's bloodline from the Demon Emperor, yet he was still weaker than Gu Jiuqing?</p><p></p><p>The Eight Manifestations Elder Ancestor of the Mud Pill Palace was shocked once.</p><p></p><p>But Luyuan had long since become unsurprised - wasn't this a common occurrence?</p><p></p><p>If Gu Shixiong lost to the Demon Eighth Prince, that would be the real surprise.</p><p></p><p>Those demonic figures watched with furrowed brows, surrounded by swirling demonic clouds. They too were astonished by Gu Jiuqing's powerful physical body.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the Spiritual Power realm had such a formidable physical body?!</p><p></p><p>Combined with that profound spiritual power!!</p><p></p><p>If this person was allowed to live, the Primordial Chaos might gain another peerless expert integrated with the three realms!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince opened his remaining two pairs of eyes. Instead of attacking with all six arms together, he encircled Gu Jiuqing instead.</p><p></p><p>As long as he suppressed this human, there was no need for direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded but not attacked, Gu Jiuqing's strength was clearly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Spots of demonic aura covered that single arm.</p><p></p><p>"It's no use, my physical body is about to explode!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince roared, forcibly supporting his five-zhang true form. Seeing this, the weak human's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Ten moves! Within ten moves, I will defeat you!"</p><p></p><p>The sluggish Demon Eighth Prince moved, his six arms reaching for the heavens in a fierce attack.</p><p></p><p>First move!</p><p>Second move!</p><p>Third move! </p><p>Fourth move!</p><p>On the fifth, Gu Jiuqing's figure faltered as one arm struck him, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Prince is so powerful, I can barely withstand it."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince frowned. </p><p></p><p>Why did he feel that statement was feigned?</p><p></p><p>Was this human still trying to appear weak?</p><p></p><p>Sixth move!</p><p>Seventh move!</p><p>Eighth move!</p><p>Ninth move!</p><p>Tenth move!</p><p></p><p>The six arms reached skyward, and the three heads of the demonic body suddenly swelled. His true form wavered, as if divine light was about to pour forth.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh-----!"</p><p></p><p>After the Demon Eighth Prince's final strike, which Gu Jiuqing blocked by raising his arm, his entire body was smashed into the ground below.</p><p></p><p>Then the Demon Eighth Prince's weary voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"I am depleted. I never imagined a human's physical body could be so powerful. If you weren't human, I would befriend you."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I was thinking the same!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure flew out from the massive crater. </p><p></p><p>His azure robes were tattered, his black hair standing on end wildly.</p><p></p><p>Panting heavily, most of his vital energy had dissipated, his aura withered to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince fared no better - his six arms were mottled blue and red, demonic aura scattered around him, five of his six eyes blackened!</p><p></p><p>Only one eye could still see Gu Jiuqing clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Human brat, I won't accept this!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince's six arms fell from the sky without any spiritual power, descending towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dodge.</p><p></p><p>But just as those six arms dropped down!</p><p></p><p>The divine light that hadn't manifested earlier now poured forth, bathing the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The "dust" on his dantian dispersed, his spiritual power circulating.</p><p></p><p>The demonic spirit body's original form on Mount Buzhou had thirty-three sections connected to the thirty-fourth celestial platform.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred and sixty-five acupoints around his body all opened, radiating brilliant light!</p><p></p><p>Divine light shone everywhere, black radiance enveloping his body.</p><p></p><p>The five celestial palaces on the three heads opened one by one, five yuanshen presiding over the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power gushed forth, spirit abilities blossoming. Spirit fruits swayed without cease, and several figures even appeared on the six arms!!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Demon Eighth Prince recovered to his peak Celestial Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Heh heh!</p><p></p><p>Human! Did you think I was truly depleted?</p><p></p><p>That was just to lull you into dropping your guard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was too bizarre. The Demon Eighth Prince worried he had secret skills from the higher ranks of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>So he battled him physically, repeatedly holding back during their exchanges, even claiming to be defeated!</p><p></p><p>It was all for this moment!</p><p></p><p>The six arms opened spirit wheels one by one - the Yin-Yang Wheel, Five Phases Wheel, Supreme Unity Wheel, Four Symbols Wheel, Mystic Yellow Wheel!</p><p></p><p>The five spirit wheels combined on the sixth arm into the Myriad Existence and Non-Existence Wheel.</p><p></p><p>An incomparable spirit ability, incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eighth Prince grasped the Myriad Wheel, now at his true peak.</p><p></p><p>The five celestial palaces, five yuanshen controlling the Myriad Wheel!!</p><p></p><p>His physical body was flushed with spiritual power, restored to its prime. Six eyes fixed on Gu Jiuqing, the arm holding the Myriad Wheel descended!</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Below, he saw no fear in this human, only the opposite - excitement!</p><p></p><p>Elation!</p><p></p><p>"Demon Eighth Prince, I, Gu, truly did not deceive you. I really wish to be friends with you."</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Humans and demons are incompatible. Even now you seek to corrupt my rebirth?</p><p></p><p>"You share my thoughts, which makes me admire you even more!"</p><p></p><p>"But is this the full extent of your power?"</p><p></p><p>Hm, compared to his full power, it seems a bit lacking!</p><p></p><p>The azure-robed youth grasped the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda, raising his left hand with one finger pointed upwards!</p><p></p><p>The index finger!</p><p></p><p>That single finger commanded the Dragon Elephant dominions!!</p><p></p><p>The two great Dragon Elephant dominions finally appeared, the power of thirty thousand Dragon Elephants swirling around this one finger.</p><p></p><p>Power!</p><p></p><p>Immense power emanated from this single finger.</p><p></p><p>That's over 5,500 words now, exceeding the limit.</p><p></p><p>Begging for monthly votes, pleading for monthly votes! I'm just 200 short of 1,000!</p><p></p><p>I heard 1,000 monthly votes can be redeemed for 200 yuan!</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, I want to buy a new outfit skin.

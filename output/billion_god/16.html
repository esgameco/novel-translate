        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The rising sun filled the sky, and the final day of the Sword Sect's great examination arrived as scheduled. </p><p></p><p>Below the Sword Sect gate, there were far fewer northern youths remaining on the ninth day compared to the first day.</p><p></p><p>On the first day of the great examination, there were thousands of northern youths gathered here. As the examination began, those youths realized their own talents, and those without hope of completing the nine metamorphoses left the Sword Sect gate early.</p><p></p><p>Of the ancient city youths who remained at the Sword Sect gate today, over ninety percent had completed one metamorphosis, while only a few still hoped to complete a metamorphosis on this final day.</p><p></p><p>Below the three-zhang tall stone steles, rows of youths practiced the Dragon and Elephant Skill, making their final sprint.</p><p></p><p>A thin tall youth stood below one of the Dragon and Elephant Skill steles. His figure was upright, his complexion ruddy, giving off a vigorous and handsome air.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood churned within Qu Yaozhu's body, his flesh seeming like a blazing furnace, tempering his five viscera and six bowels, flushing his extraordinary vessels and meridians. His face grew increasingly ruddy.</p><p></p><p>After a full half an hour passed, he finally dispersed the boiling qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth metamorphosis! Without external assistance, I would need at least a month and a half."</p><p></p><p>That was too long.</p><p></p><p>By the time he joined the inner sect of the Sword Sect, the surrounding senior and junior martial brothers would all be overflowing with talent. Among them, he would be merely ordinary.</p><p></p><p>By the time he completed the fourth and fifth metamorphoses, others would have already begun leaking heavenly mysteries and become true cultivators!</p><p></p><p>This would deal an immense blow to his heart of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"However!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu pushed his palms out horizontally, gathering a massive surge of qi that he pushed towards an ominous ding cauldron before him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The ominous ding cauldron shook, emitting a crisp ringing sound.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I kill Gu Jiuqing and trample over his corpse to enter the Sword Sect, my aura will surge unstoppably forward. Borrowing that unseen force of momentum, I can cultivate the fourth metamorphosis in a short time."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu's thoughts had changed.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been thinking of the beauty of the Celestial Pool Fairy, but now he had clearly seen the reality.</p><p></p><p>Talents, talents - without transforming his potential into true strength, he would just be trash.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward. Behind him, Lu Buye hurriedly stood up and followed closely.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qu, are we going to look for Gu Jiuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to follow me now. I'm worried those aristocratic sect disciples will inform Gu Jiuqing about my family's Celestial Stairway Talisman. That bastard Gu is afraid of me, fears me. If he doesn't come out to fight me to the death, it will be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Understood! I'll spread the word to everyone. Gu Jiuqing is still cultivating in his carriage, clearly not wanting to show himself."</p><p></p><p>"Just yesterday he put on an act in front of Young Master Qu, and today he wants to back out entirely? There's no such good deal in this world."</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye's figure vanished as he headed towards the three stone steles.</p><p></p><p>Soon, earth-shaking sounds rang out from the foot of Sword Sect Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"A battle to the death is about to begin! Yesterday in Heavenly Abyss Ancient City, Qu Yaozhu and Gu Jiuqing agreed to a duel to the death at noon today!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Jiuqing completed two metamorphoses by the third day, then the third metamorphosis after. Qu Yaozhu completed his third metamorphosis on the eighth day. Both northern young masters are peerless talents who can join the inner sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The two will engage in the northern life-and-death battle, a fight to the finish!"</p><p></p><p>"It's already almost noon on the ninth examination day, but Gu Jiuqing is still hiding in his flying carriage. Could it be Gu Jiuqing plans to forfeit?"</p><p></p><p>"Look! That's Qu Yaozhu, he's heading straight for the Gu family's flying carriage. He's going to personally seek out Gu Jiuqing."</p><p></p><p>The scene was exciting and stirring.</p><p></p><p>Those were soon-to-be inner sect disciples battling to the death - such an event was exceedingly rare.</p><p></p><p>The youths who had completed one metamorphosis were thrilled, swarming towards the flying carriage to witness this battle of peerless talents.</p><p></p><p>"Ai, Gu Jiuqing spoke so righteously, yet agreed to a death match only to be a no-show? Is he hiding in the carriage because he doesn't want to face it?"</p><p></p><p>Voices rose from the crowd, and many northern youths frowned. If that was truly the case, they would be unable to see this duel between talents.</p><p></p><p>More and more northern youths gathered, surrounding the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>The four aristocratic young masters also arrived - Xia Qingzhou, Ye Fei, Qing Yangbai, and Fan Shaoli, the four peerless talents, stood at the outer edge.</p><p></p><p>"Could Gu Jiuqing really be afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei frowned!</p><p></p><p>As fellow talents, he could not understand Gu Jiuqing's intention to back out at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>Talents, talents - they had absolute confidence in themselves. Even with Qu Yaozhu's Celestial Stairway Talisman, in a life-and-death struggle, the victor would be decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a sliver of a chance, why be afraid?</p><p></p><p>Ye Fei did not understand, nor did Qing Yangbai, Fan Shaoli, or even Xia Qingzhou, who showed a hint of complexity.</p><p></p><p>Although she knew retreating was the best option, she could not accept Gu Jiuqing's actions.</p><p></p><p>She sighed quietly, the complex look in her eyes disappearing as she became an icy beauty once more.</p><p></p><p>The flying carriage was pulled by two precious dragon-horses, their blood-red light flickering. The dragon-horses were proud and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Behind the carriage was a small divine palanquin about a zhang in size. On the carriage, an elderly driver slept soundly, not caring about the surrounding youths.</p><p></p><p>Someone could not hold back, a black hand stretching out from the crowd to yank the driver down.</p><p></p><p>The driver's body rolled, falling to the ground in a cloud of dust from his coarse hempen robe. His graying hair disheveled, he trembled as he stood up to face the northern youths.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"You're examination students, you dare lay hands on an old man?"</p><p></p><p>The steward pointed towards the distant mountain. "At this moment, the high-ranks of the Sword Sect are watching this place. Do you want them to see this?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>After those words, figure after figure retreated several steps back.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only two figures remained near the flying carriage - Qu Yaozhu and Lu Buye.</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu cursed inwardly, but he knew those watching from the sidelines would not act out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye retreated a step behind Qu Yaozhu.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid! He did not want to leave a bad impression on the high-ranks of the Sword Sect either.</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye's foundation allowed joining the outer sect at most. If Qu Yaozhu disregarded their past, he would gain no benefits from him.</p><p></p><p>"Old man!"</p><p></p><p>"The high-ranks watch this place because Gu Jiuqing and I are supposed to fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday Gu Jiuqing agreed to duel me! Everyone present can attest to it!"</p><p></p><p>"Backing out today? Could it be he's afraid?"</p><p></p><p>The steward shook his head at the overbearing youth.</p><p></p><p>"Why bring up yesterday's matters today? Yesterday was yesterday, today is today. Don't make a ruckus here."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu's interest was piqued.</p><p></p><p>"What, you old man want to take me on instead?"</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>A surge of aura suddenly erupted from afar.</p><p></p><p>It came from another flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>An old man stood atop that carriage, observing from a distance. His qi rippled out, the force of his aura locking down the steward.</p><p></p><p>It was the Qu family's protector who appeared!</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu stared at the steward. He knew this was Gu Jiuqing's protector, but could a declining family's protector compare to his Qu family's?</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu let out a cold laugh. "Old man, still not moving aside?"</p><p></p><p>"Not moving!"</p><p></p><p>The steward stood before Qu Yaozhu, not retreating half a step.</p><p></p><p>"You really won't move?"</p><p></p><p>"Not moving!"</p><p></p><p>"Courting death! You've followed the Gu family for many years, you should know their situation. Here's what, you make Gu Jiuqing come out and loudly say three times before us that he is inferior to me, Qu Yaozhu. Then I'll spare his life."</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhu's gaze surged.</p><p></p><p>This old man blocked his path unmoving. If he took the initiative to attack, it would be his own problem.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qu is so magnanimous, sparing Gu Jiuqing's life. Surely Gu will come out now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye quickly chimed in.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qu is only asking Gu Jiuqing to admit the truth, that's not too much to ask, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye looked towards the crowd behind them, finding a few youths he was on good terms with and asking them.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes, they could only reluctantly agree.</p><p></p><p>"Mmhmm, mmhmm."</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you see, everyone agrees it's only right for Gu Jiuqing to admit his inferiority to be spared. Why are you still blocking the way?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Everyone thought Young Master Qu was righteous. If Gu Jiuqing still couldn't figure out the facts and continued to evade, you shouldn't obstruct him anymore."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Countless flying swords were inserted into the Sword Tomb, with numerous sword auras intertwined and various sword lights shining brilliantly. This was the forbidden ground of the Sword Sect, where no one appeared all year round. </p><p></p><p>Every disciple of the Sword Sect who had cultivated the sword aura could enter the Sword Tomb once and choose a flying sword as their life-bound weapon.</p><p></p><p>A young man walked out of the Sword Tomb slowly, his hands empty, having returned empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your sword?"</p><p></p><p>An ancient voice came from the wooden hut, it was the master who accepted him as a true disciple of the Sword Sect elder!</p><p></p><p>"This disciple has not found a satisfactory flying sword."</p><p></p><p>The voice from inside the wooden hut finally appeared after a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat."</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie glanced at the Sword Tomb and was about to leave, when figures appeared below, riding on swords and flying out of the divine mountain, landing in the void and looking towards the gate of the Sword Sect below.</p><p></p><p>Some disciples of the Sword Sect even exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, a life-and-death battle in the northern lands? Before even joining the Sword Sect, these youths are already fighting to the death below the gate of the Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"What audacity, truly lawless! Where exactly is it happening? Let me take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Si Wuxie was also interested. With a thought, his jade sword aura intertwined, and a sword energy horizontally spanned the void. This young man was actually standing in the realm between heaven and earth, treading on the sword energy!</p><p></p><p>The nearby disciples of the Sword Sect simply thought he was an unfamiliar fellow disciple and didn't think too much about it. They just glanced at him and continued watching the gate of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Palace!</p><p></p><p>One illusory figure after another appeared within the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The illusory ripples, terrifying auras piercing through the void, each figure as upright as an unsheathed sharp sword.</p><p></p><p>Various sword auras intersected and verified each other. Even the scattered auras alone were enough to pierce through the Sword Palace, leaving it full of holes.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these illusory figures, there were no other figures within the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This round of trials is quite interesting. Not only did it produce a sword genius like Si Wuxie, even the Three Elders couldn't help but take in a disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Three Elders are still the same, only saying three words. They don't know how difficult it is to teach disciples. I don't believe the Three Elders won't break their vows."</p><p></p><p>"Si Wuxie is a genius, but the Three Elders haven't taught him. When the Three Elders get bored, they'll just let Si Wuxie join my school."</p><p></p><p>"Why should he join your school? My true disciple is the only one, so let Si Wuxie join my school!"</p><p></p><p>"What's there to argue about? If he joins my school, this issue will be resolved."</p><p></p><p>The illusory figures were all vying for Si Wuxie.</p><p></p><p>"There's been quite a commotion caused by the disciples at the gate of the Sword Sect this time. Two young men from the ancient cities of the northern lands want to fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>The illusory figures were startled, then enraged.</p><p></p><p>This was the gate of the Sword Sect, the territory of the Sword Sect. The rules of the northern lands couldn't be applied here!</p><p></p><p>"The talents of those two young men are not bad. They have both completed the third Fen Mortal, and one of them is even a descendant of Elder Qu's lineage."</p><p></p><p>One of the illusory figures looked towards another.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu smiled faintly, "That Qu Yaozhou is indeed a descendant of my lineage, but I left the Qu Family long ago. Fellow Elders, you need not consider me when handling this matter!"</p><p></p><p>The other Elders smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>This was just a side note. Life-and-death battles were the rules of the northern lands, but since these two were not yet disciples of the Sword Sect, the enforcement elders could not intervene.</p><p></p><p>The Elders set this matter aside. "The trials this time are about to end. Send a true disciple to welcome them and have them join the mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's been nine days. We've been watching the gate of the Sword Sect for nine days. Apart from Si Wuxie, the other young men from the northern lands have ordinary talents, none outstanding. We've wasted nine days."</p><p></p><p>One of the illusory figures was about to disperse.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed from the foot of the mountain, reaching the clouds. Even these Elders could hear it.</p><p></p><p>"This is!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qu's expression changed, and his illusory figure wavered as he stepped out of the Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This is the sound of a Dragon Elephant! Someone has condensed the power of a Dragon Elephant!"</p><p></p><p>Voices came from the gate of the Sword Sect. Someone had borrowed the power of the Dragon Elephant Art to complete the fifth Fen Mortal and even cultivated the power of a Dragon Elephant?</p><p></p><p>The Elders revealed looks of great joy.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is another body cultivation genius among the young men from the northern lands this time."</p><p></p><p>The illusory figures stepped out of the Sword Palace, looking towards the gate of the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Two dragon horses pulled down a divine carriage!</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie didn't care about the aura surrounding him and sat back in the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to take action, do it quickly. But you should understand, this is the flying carriage of my Gu Family. Taking action against me is taking action against the Gu Family. If I take action, it will be in self-defense!"</p><p></p><p>Bullying the weak?</p><p></p><p>Or taking advantage of power?</p><p></p><p>Qu Yaozhou sneered and raised his hand towards the flying carriage. He didn't attack Steward Xie but aimed at the carriage itself.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to destroy the carriage and summon Gu Jiuqing out!</p><p></p><p>As his arm descended into the air, Steward Xie's expression changed, and his sharp aura burst forth, only the aura surrounding him wavered.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Unformed Realm! No, no, this is the Spirit Refining Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The protector of Qu Yaozhou was actually a Spirit Refining Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The Unformed Realm was also called the Divine Body Realm, and the next higher realm was the Spirit Refining Realm that could comprehend Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>A mere young man from the northern lands was being protected by a Spirit Refining Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie's expression changed, having lost the initiative. This palm had already descended.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The flying carriage shook, the canopy shattered, and a gust of air gushed out, shattering the divine lights and destroying the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie slowly stood up, enraged.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had been enraged in five years.</p><p></p><p>"The Qu Family! Qu Yaozhou!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Steward Xie's aura paused, and his peripheral vision swept over, seeing the figure sitting cross-legged on the bed amidst the wreckage of the flying carriage.</p><p></p><p>That was Gu Jiuqing's figure!</p><p></p><p>Without the shielding of the flying carriage, strands of vital energy were scattered into the heavens, forming a bloody Dragon Elephant illusion above.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant trod in the void, with various strange lights flickering. The vital energy burst through the Baihui acupoint, continuously flushing Gu Jiuqing's physical body.</p><p></p><p>While others underwent the Fen Mortal by cultivating the Dragon Elephant Art, Gu Jiuqing was undergoing it through meditation.</p><p></p><p>"Dong dong dong——————"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of bronze bells and drums resounded like a heartbeat. The vital energy surged like great waves sweeping across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Then the five viscera resonated, forming musical notes that harmonized with the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>After the last impurity was flushed out, Gu Jiuqing's physical body became perfect, immaculate, complete, and flawless. His body had reached the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>Each Fen Mortal broke through his own shackles, with five times being the limit!</p><p></p><p>"He's not undergoing the fourth Fen Mortal but the fifth Fen Mortal!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Buye was horrified, his hair standing on end as he collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding young men from the northern lands only felt an oppressive aura emanating from the carriage, pressing them down.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred young men who had undergone the Fen Mortal weakened, with only those who had completed two or more Fen Mortals able to stand under this pressure.</p><p></p><p>The rest were all half-kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of the five viscera and vital energy transformed into thunderous roars, as if lightning was forming within Gu Jiuqing's body. The vital energy illusion above his head swelled several times, becoming a primordial Dragon Elephant, its body almost solidifying.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——————"</p><p></p><p>The roar shook the gate of the Sword Sect, causing tremors throughout the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The young man sitting cross-legged slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant illusion above his head, nearly solidified, took a step out of the flying carriage, a faint smile on his face, though this smile seemed a bit cold.</p><p></p><p>With the first step, the Dragon Elephant illusion above his head flowed, and the vital energy returned to his true body!</p><p></p><p>The second step!</p><p></p><p>The strange image of vital energy dissipated!</p><p></p><p>The third step, the thunderous roars faded away!</p><p></p><p>The fourth step, the Dragon Elephant power was formed. Gu Jiuqing had officially completed the fifth Fen Mortal, possessing the power of a Dragon Elephant. The sheer physical strength of his body could withstand the weight of a great mountain!!</p><p></p><p>Strength to lift a tripod, this was described as immense strength in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, immense physical strength meant being able to withstand mountains!</p><p></p><p>"Qu Yaozhou, are you so eager to seek death?"</p><p></p><p>Having completed the fifth Fen Mortal, Gu Jiuqing stood before Qu Yaozhou, who had only completed the third Fen Mortal.</p><p></p><p>One by one, Qu Yaozhou's hairs were blown awry by the formless aura. His facial features distorted, his vital energy sank, and a great terror gripped his heart.</p><p></p><p>The second round of recommendations didn't make it, no worries, it's just a week later than the usual release.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday I made a pitiful plea, and got some more data, so it seems there are still people reading.</p><p></p><p>Big Cat will continue updating, and readers please keep following!</p><p></p><p>Ahem, begging for data!</p>

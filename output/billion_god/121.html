        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The third realm, on a white mountain. </p><p></p><p>The members of the Da Feng clan were all dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>What had they just witnessed?</p><p></p><p>This true inheritor from the Sword Sect, he only used one move to subdue and kill the Demon Emperor of the same realm?</p><p></p><p>That was the peerless Demon Emperor at the peak of the Buzhou realm!</p><p></p><p>The great demon of wilderness, this emperor of the demonic lineage, was a supreme spiritual power integrating three into one. He had imprinted his realm into the great formation, making him tremendously powerful.</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed their fellow clansmen being killed by the Demon Emperor one by one!</p><p></p><p>Most of the clansmen couldn't even withstand his Demonic Devouring of the World technique and were slaughtered by the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This youth!!  </p><p></p><p>This Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>He only used one hand to subdue the Demon Emperor, displaying such magnificence that stunned every Da Feng clansman present.</p><p></p><p>"A divine soul of thirty zhang! That's a thirty zhang divine soul!"</p><p></p><p>They looked at the divine soul behind Gu Jiuqing with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultivators of the Buzhou realm, and some Da Feng clansmen had also cultivated divine souls, but their divine souls were only as tall as a person. To cultivate one as large as a normal human body was already considered extraordinarily talented.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention comparing to Gu Jiuqing's thirty zhang divine soul, even the Demon Emperor's eight zhang divine soul couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One! You've defeated the Demon Emperor, can you now leave the Six Realms Formation?" </p><p></p><p>The slightly aged Da Feng clansman asked in a soft voice.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing withdrew his divine soul and gazed at the disappearing figure of the Demon Emperor with a sense of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>Demons like the Demon Emperor, even in the same realm, couldn't withstand a single move from him.</p><p></p><p>His thirty zhang primordial soul, with the power of a million dragons and elephants, made Gu Jiuqing's strength terrifyingly formidable.  </p><p></p><p>He looked at the dark void in front of him and had a feeling that if he took just one step forward, he could leave the Six Realms Formation.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, if he did leave the Six Realms Formation, would he encounter other demons?</p><p></p><p>That wasn't even the biggest problem!</p><p></p><p>The Da Feng clan of the Celestial Venerable had been invaded by demons, this matter had to be reported to the Sword Sect. Was he supposed to return to the Sword Sect right after leaving the Northern Lands?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the white clouds above as his gaze fell on each of the Da Feng clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Could he break through the Six Realms Formation, rescue all the Da Feng clansmen, and then have them go to the Northern Sword Gate?  </p><p></p><p>With a thought, ripples appeared in his divine soul. Although Gu Jiuqing could see the white clouds above, he could not see through them to the scenery within.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Realms Formation imprisons human cultivators, but if one can defeat the Demon Emperor of the same realm, they can leave the Six Realms Formation!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor was very proud of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Then what if he could break through all the imprints the Demon Emperor left within the Six Realms Formation?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had an inkling. His figure moved, transforming into a rainbow light that pierced through the darkness, flying straight up towards the formation above, trying to enter the fourth realm.</p><p></p><p>His form was subtle, existing between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>But he was still bound by the restrictions of the great formation, unable to step into the white clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can try the Primordial God Body!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Jiuqing unleashed the Primordial God Body of Buzhou Mountain, its primordial origin scattering throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>A primordial aura pervaded his surroundings, making Gu Jiuqing seem like a primordial sacred being walking in the dark sky, just a distance away from the white clouds. </p><p></p><p>The primordial aura mingled with the darkness, gradually dissolving the formation's restrictions, faintly merging with the divine weapon's dao rhymes.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial God within his body stirred, and the entire Primordial God Body origin transformed into a roc!</p><p></p><p>Wandering freely!</p><p></p><p>Why not ride the wind and soar straight up thirty thousand li?</p><p></p><p>The Primordial God Body unleashed the Wandering Freely technique, swaying the heavens and earth, dozens of times more powerful than when Gu Jiuqing had used it back at the Sword Sect, almost entering the moon.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the aid of the Primordial God Body, the profundities of the Yin-Yang Divine Body that he had comprehended were unveiled one by one. With a thought, his true form rippled and disappeared into the formation.</p><p></p><p>Wandering Freely, the divine soul wanders freely while the physical body roams!</p><p></p><p>This was the true meaning of this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Venerable One? The Sword Sect's Venerable One has left!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, the Sword Sect's Venerable One has left the Six Realms Formation, he must have gone to summon help from the Sword Sect. It won't be long before we can also escape from the Six Realms Formation!"</p><p></p><p>On the white mountain, the Da Feng clansmen revealed looks of pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the state of Wandering Freely, Gu Jiuqing only felt his divine soul and physical body being continuously stretched.</p><p></p><p>The great sound is inaudible, the great form is invisible!</p><p></p><p>Sound reaching the extreme becomes inaudible!</p><p></p><p>Physical forms reaching the extreme become invisible!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's current state was precisely this, his physical body stretched infinitely, pervading the entire Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he perceived the scenery within the whole Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The ancient teleportation formation was in the eighth grotto-heaven!</p><p></p><p>In each of the grotto-heavens, there were demonic figures, as well as some Da Feng clansmen struggling and fighting the demons.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the Da Feng clansmen were captured into the Six Realms Formation, while the remaining clansmen are in the first to seventh grotto-heavens."</p><p></p><p>There were only a few hundred demons, most of them at the Fa Li and Buzhou realms, with only three or four at the Tian Gong realm.</p><p></p><p>Plus the Demonic Prince guarding the entrance to the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>As long as one Da Feng clansman at the Catastrophe realm could break free, they could subdue the demons.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wasn't surprised that the demons' strength was so weak. For these demons to infiltrate the Great Zhou was already extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Those more powerful Catastrophe realm demons, trying to sneak into human territory, their demonic aura would be impossible to conceal.</p><p></p><p>Formless and traceless, integrating with heaven and earth, Gu Jiuqing gathered his extended physical body and divine soul back into a single point with a thought.</p><p></p><p>His form intertwined, gradually becoming substantial!</p><p></p><p>In the fourth realm, on a white cloud!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure appeared, having just coalesced his true form. The remaining Da Feng clansmen standing on the white cloud mountain were startled at first, then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"This person is not from our Da Feng clan, an outsider has entered the Six Realms Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"May I ask if the young master is from Qingzhou Prefecture or from the Northern Sword Gate?"</p><p></p><p>A Lianshen realm cultivator inquired.</p><p></p><p>This Lianshen realm cultivator had opened the myriad heavenly apertures, with three hundred and sixty-five halos revolving around him, indicating he was at the peak of the Lianshen realm.</p><p></p><p>This time!</p><p></p><p>It was Feng Buxiu's turn to battle the Lianshen realm imprint left behind by the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Eight peak Lianshen realm experts had already perished at the hands of the Demon Emperor. Now in the fourth realm, there were only about twenty remaining Da Feng clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Feng Buxiu was overjoyed that someone knew the Da Feng clan of the Celestial Venerable had been invaded by demons! This would surely alarm the Great Zhou and the four great sects!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>But why wasn't this cultivator turning around?</p><p></p><p>And he wasn't responding either?</p><p></p><p>The other Lianshen realm Da Feng cultivators looked at this cultivator with displeasure showing on their faces.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Gu Jiuqing had no mind to pay attention to this Da Feng clansman.</p><p></p><p>A surge of cultivation suddenly coalesced within his body!</p><p></p><p>Most notably in his dantian and apertures.</p><p></p><p>His nine zhang dantian rippled, cultivation flowing within and transforming into spiritual power.  This cultivation appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dare try to absorb the spiritual fruits' cultivation at all!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble ——————"  </p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Thunderous sounds kept coming from his physical body, streams of figures washing over it. To Gu Jiuqing's astonishment, he saw the myriad apertures in his body being forcibly opened.</p><p></p><p>His physical apertures opened, spiritual power coalescing within them!</p><p></p><p>The three hundred and sixty-five heavenly apertures, one by one opened, countless spiritual power fusing into the apertures.</p><p></p><p>An aura of the Lianshen realm rippled forth, halos rising from below, ascending to the top of his head, then disappearing, repeating endlessly. The halos of the Lianshen realm manifested behind Gu Jiuqing!!</p><p></p><p>Pure spiritual power, profound apertures!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had stepped into the Lianshen realm, his strength forcibly raised by a great amount.</p><p></p><p>His dantian reached nine zhang nine, his divine soul was washed to thirty-three zhang, and even the thirty-fourth vertebra transformed into a celestial platform, bathed in the heavenly force.</p><p></p><p>"How did I suddenly cultivate to the Lianshen realm?"</p><p></p><p>This was the Lianshen realm!</p><p></p><p>Attained in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"I wandered freely through heaven and earth, entering the fourth realm of the Six Realms Formation. I unexpectedly trespassed here, and the Six Realms Formation mistook me for a Lianshen realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>All this cultivation came from the Six Realms Formation.</p><p></p><p>Since it was an inanimate object, it couldn't discern that Gu Jiuqing was someone who had forcibly trespassed into the formation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it treated Gu Jiuqing as a kind of imprint or program, like the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>It directly elevated Gu Jiuqing's cultivation to the Lianshen realm all at once.</p><p></p><p>"So this is my foundation after stepping into the Lianshen realm?"</p><p></p><p>The myriad heavenly apertures rippled one by one, like stars orbiting around Buzhou Mountain!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's figure moved, but as soon as he took half a step out of the white clouds, the dark void in front of him rippled, and a terrifying demonic figure began to coalesce.</p><p></p><p>Feng Buxiu's expression changed, and he quickly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, you've triggered the program of the fourth realm! This is the Demon Emperor's cultivation from the Lianshen realm!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't bear to see Gu Jiuqing killed by the Demon Emperor, so he revealed everything he knew, hoping Gu Jiuqing could subdue the Demon Emperor and leave the Six Realms Formation.</p><p></p><p>"This program of the Demon Emperor is at the peak of the Lianshen realm, his spiritual power is inexhaustible, three tenths stronger than even the spiritual power of us Da Feng clansmen!"</p><p></p><p>"His myriad heavenly...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The divine aperture, a strand of heavenly energy, can shatter the vacuum in an instant. This force is too terrifying, don't resist it!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Demon Emperor has already refined the Life and Death Wheel of the Realms! Apart from the Life and Death Wheel of the Realms, there are also the Seven Extremes Demon Blades and the Eight Directions Heavenly Talismans!"</p><p></p><p>"The strongest peak Refining Soul cultivator among the top experts of my Great Wind Clan could only resist the Demon Emperor for three breaths."  </p><p></p><p>After three breaths, they were killed by the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Gu Jiuqing shook his head, "No need to say more."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor?</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's eyes, he was no match for Senior Brother Liangxiao and Si Wuxie, already beyond his perception.</p><p></p><p>And now, he had stepped into the Refining Soul Realm. Although he had not laid the foundation of the Elixir Realm, he was still powerfully desperate!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Jiuqing employed the magic powers of the Refining Soul Realm!</p><p></p><p>This was the magic power Gu Jiuqing obtained after stepping into the peak of the Refining Soul Realm with his current foundation.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the great apertures flickered, streams of light flowed, magic power condensed, hanging upside down in the dark sky like a Milky Way descending.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying was Gu Jiuqing's magic power?</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demon Prince's magic power was three times stronger than Jun Wushang's when they were in the Elixir Realm. But in the Refining Soul Realm, this difference had to be multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five times.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Demon Prince's dantian was seven zhang three, while Jun Wushang's was seven zhang. The three-part difference between them was amplified three hundred and sixty-five times by the celestial stars, making the gap between them grow larger and larger!</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Refining Soul Realm, Gu Jiuqing had opened up nine zhang, and at this moment he stepped into nine zhang nine, which meant that his current magic power was three hundred and sixty-five times greater than before!! His magic power far surpassed that of the Eighth Demon Prince, let alone in the Refining Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such vast magic power connected together, forming a stream of energy! The Demon Emperor's voice had just condensed into form!</p><p></p><p>As the magic power descended, the three hundred and sixty-five times amplified magic power of the nine zhang nine instantly reduced the Demon Emperor's voice to dust.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the divine abilities he manifested were also extinguished, and even his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing ignored Feng Buxiu, and Xiaoyao Game was activated again. His figure stepped into the fifth realm!</p><p></p><p>"He left? Just like that?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Great Wind Clan stared blankly into the dark void. </p><p></p><p>Where was the Demon Emperor?</p><p></p><p>He had just condensed his true form, and then was killed just like that??</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this terrifyingly invincible Demon Emperor was killed by this young man?</p><p></p><p>Was this still the undefeated Demon Emperor?</p><p></p><p>The members of the Great Wind Clan doubted whether what they had just witnessed was real.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Realm, Sun and Moon Stars!</p><p></p><p>On the two stars stood the Celestial Immortals of the Great Wind Clan in the Celestial Being Realm, but these Immortals looked quite haggard.</p><p></p><p>They discussed and deduced the Demon Emperor's divine abilities, spiritual soul, magic powers, and physical body, trying to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>But sadly!</p><p></p><p>Even without divine weapons, this Demon Emperor could easily kill them!</p><p></p><p>In the pre-Celestial Realm, the cultivators of the Great Wind Clan could still fight the Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But in the Refining Soul Realm, the gap became wider and wider!</p><p></p><p>And in the Celestial Being Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's magic powers, physical body, divine abilities, had completely surpassed them. Adding the difference in spiritual souls, their strength compared to the Demon Emperor's was simply like a feeble chick.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest Celestial Being Realm elder of the Great Wind Clan was defeated by the Demon Emperor in just two moves!</p><p></p><p>Another Celestial Being Realm elder was instantly killed in one move!</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful! How could there be such a powerful existence in the mortal world? He's only in the Celestial Being Realm, the same as us, why is the gap so huge?"</p><p></p><p>"Unimaginable, the Demon Emperor was so powerful in the Celestial Being Realm. Then how powerful would the number one Dao Ancestor and the number two Buddha Ancestor have been in the Celestial Being Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"They must have been able to transcend realms and slay Catastrophe Realm Immortals when they were in the Celestial Being Realm!"</p><p></p><p>To transcend realms and slay powerful enemies!</p><p></p><p>Such feats were rarely spread throughout the vast wilderness. In the past ten thousand years, these legends were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Those were the true celestial prodigies, riding upon the greatest of talents.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, we are no match for the Celestial Being Realm Demon Emperor. Just his spiritual soul alone, with three souls and seven spirits combined into one, has broken through the limit of nine zhang nine to reach sixty-four zhang!"</p><p></p><p>A sixty-four zhang spiritual soul! Just his spiritual soul techniques alone were unresistable to them.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention his other abilities.</p><p></p><p>Several Celestial Being Realm elders lamented. They had stayed in the Great Wind Clan all this time, where they were seen as supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Within the clan, the members of the Great Wind Clan addressed them as venerable elders, as Celestial Being Realm Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they went out of seclusion, the clan members would kowtow and worship them.</p><p></p><p>They thought!</p><p></p><p>That this world was like the Celestial Realm of the Heavenly Queen.</p><p></p><p>That this world was like the members of the Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>Only now did they realize they had been living in a well, observing the sky.</p><p></p><p>Before the true experts, they were merely ants.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>One of the Celestial Being Realm Immortals moved, and a figure condensed beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Someone else has been absorbed into the Six Realms Diagram!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? The only Celestial Being Realm expert left in our clan is Venerable Changming!"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Immortal has failed to advance?</p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, a Refining Soul Realm cultivator appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? A Refining Soul Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>How could a Refining Soul Realm cultivator appear in the Fifth Realm?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Refining Soul Realm cultivator was not from their Great Wind Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom————"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, this Refining Soul Realm cultivator's aura changed drastically, his figure swaying, with celestial palaces growing out of his head!</p><p></p><p>Three Souls: Taiyang (Heavenly Soul), Shuangling (Earthly Soul), Youjing (Human Soul).</p><p></p><p>Seven Spirits: Shigou, Fuzhi, Queyin, Tunzei, Feidu, Chuhui, Choufei.</p><p></p><p>Ten celestial palaces formed simultaneously, and at the moment of formation, the ten great palaces exploded! Directly breaking through the limit of nine zhang and stepping into nine zhang nine!!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual souls within the ten great palaces all reached nine zhang nine!</p><p></p><p>"What? Is he going to step into the Celestial Being Realm?"</p><p></p><p>But that's not right, even if he wanted to enter the Celestial Being Realm, he couldn't possibly condense ten celestial palaces at once.</p><p></p><p>The Immortals watched with eyes wide open and mouths agape.</p><p></p><p>The three souls and seven spirits walked out of the celestial palaces and merged together! The spiritual souls intertwined, forming the sole main spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual soul could be used to pass the Lightning Tribulation!</p><p></p><p>The ten spiritual souls fused, intertwined, and transformed into the form of a dragon and elephant deity!</p><p></p><p>There was also a canopy, celestial court, and the authority of the Great Way condensing.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual soul held the authority of the Great Way, with thirty-three ripples on the canopy above its head, and the celestial court flickering behind its back.</p><p></p><p>With an elephant head, dragon tail, and human body, it stood on top of Gu Jiuqing's head!</p><p></p><p>Without a word, it stepped out of the moon painting!</p><p></p><p>In front of it, the Celestial Being Realm Demon Emperor condensed!</p><p></p><p>This Demon Emperor took form, intertwining a sixty-four zhang spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Gu Jiuqing's spiritual soul, he looked terrified.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual soul behind Gu Jiuqing was many times larger than his own!!</p><p></p><p>It was a spiritual soul that surpassed ninety-nine zhang, the kind that could only be formed after passing the Lightning Tribulation and condensing pure yang thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Yet it now appeared before this Celestial Being Realm Immortal!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't speak. With a movement of hundreds of zhang, his spiritual soul charged towards the Demon Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The sixty-four zhang spiritual soul had no time to react before being suppressed and killed by this huge dragon and elephant celestial emperor spiritual soul!</p><p></p><p>Too fast, everything happened too fast.</p><p></p><p>From the moment this cultivator appeared on the moon, he stepped into the Celestial Being Realm, entered the dark void, summoned the Demon Emperor!</p><p></p><p>And with just one strike!</p><p></p><p>Just one strike, he killed the Celestial Being Realm Demon Emperor!</p><p></p><p>There was no fancy display of divine abilities, no physical combat, just the spiritual soul striking once to instantly slay the Celestial Being Realm Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Shiii————"</p><p></p><p>"What a terrifyingly powerful expert! Where did this expert come from to be able to instantly kill the Demon Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The figure dissipated, leaving the Fifth Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Being Realm elders of the Great Wind Clan stared blankly at the dark heavens, looking at each other and the two stars beneath their feet.</p><p></p><p>Was what just happened real?</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Realm, the Celestial Court!</p><p></p><p>A figure gathered within one of the celestial palaces in the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Jiuqing, who had used Xiaoyao Game to enter the Sixth Realm. Feeling the cultivation within his body, he couldn't help but sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"So this is how powerful I would be in the Refining Soul Realm and Celestial Being Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if this realm of cultivation would disappear or remain after leaving the Six Realms Diagram!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't dwell on it!</p><p></p><p>Even if it remained, he would cut off this realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because!</p><p></p><p>His Elixir had not yet been perfected, his Sword Intent, divine abilities, physical body, were also not yet perfected.</p><p></p><p>For him to break through to the Refining Soul Realm himself, he would at least have to wait until after receiving the spiritual powers from the twenty-three provinces of the Dragon Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>Now!</p><p></p><p>It was time for him to witness the Catastrophe Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Finally finished writing, getting ready to go home and cook.</p><p></p><p>Begging for more subscriptions, pleading for subscriptions in the next week!</p><p></p><p>The editor said if we get 300 more average subscriptions before the 15th, it's enough!</p><p></p><p>So please, dear readers!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

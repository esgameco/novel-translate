        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Rushing from the Primordial Moon Tree all the way to the Moon God Ship, it took Gu Jiuqing six days on the journey!</p><p></p><p>During this time, Gu Jiuqing's yuan dan was tempered again, with 30,000 dragon-elephants transforming into divine beings. After three strikes, the yuan dan was once again hammered down to the size of a strand of hair. </p><p></p><p>Inside his dantian, a divine weapon in the shape of a divine wheel, from which Gu Jiuqing had wiped away the demonic aura, was refined by him, allowing him to preliminarily control the divine weapon of the Eighth Demonic Prince.</p><p></p><p>The divine wheel rippled, with 999 divine patterns all blossoming, falling onto the peak of Buzhou Mountain. </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not try to assimilate the cultivation of the Blue Star people. The assimilation of the Dragon Elephant Skill allowed him to fully unlock three thousand-pattern divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Sword Drawing Art, the Great Court Sword Classic, or divine abilities, they all had the possibility of exceeding the limits of a single divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The most appropriate method was to assimilate the cultivation of the divine body and embark on the path of verifying the Pangu!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! We're almost there."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan's voice came from behind, but Gu Jiuqing did not continue flying, instead stopping in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Understanding his intention, Lu Yuan hastened to activate his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>The left eye hooked the celestial thunder and terrestrial fire, while the right eye met the mountain wind and water marshes.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Divine Eye illuminated what lay ahead!</p><p></p><p>His two pupils flickered, but under Lu Yuan's gaze, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>That Moon God Ship had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>He closed his Eight Trigrams Divine Eye, his eyes full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the Moon God Ship has disappeared. I saw the corpses of a few sect disciples near the ship!"</p><p></p><p>"One of the corpses was Senior Sister Han Xue!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Han Xue!</p><p></p><p>The Frost Sword Immortal had fallen?</p><p></p><p>"Were there any traces of demonic aura around?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing frowned!</p><p></p><p>He had not yet cultivated the divine eye ability, so he could not compare to Lu Yuan in investigating.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was very certain!</p><p></p><p>The ground was pitted, with sword auras crisscrossing, and the frost sword intent lingering in the void!!</p><p></p><p>That was the yet-to-dissipate frost sword intent.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that this great battle had only just concluded not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Han Xue's white-robed body was stained with blood, with black mist swirling around her. Inside her dantian, demonic aura had gathered and condensed into a palm-sized imprint!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding mountain peaks were shattered, with sword auras destroying the mountaintops, and traces of demonic aura lingering on the peaks.</p><p></p><p>This great battle was completely different from the one at the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Ground.</p><p></p><p>"The battle outside the Eight Trigrams Ridge was the Eighth Demonic Prince slaughtering my sect's disciples and the Star Palace's disciples."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the Moon Mountain range, clearly able to sense that this mountain range had endured far too much impact.</p><p></p><p>He condensed his spiritual power and gently struck out a palm towards the peaks.</p><p></p><p>The entire mountain range immediately collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble————"  </p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble————————"</p><p></p><p>The collapsing peaks buried the corpses of the various disciples deep within.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Han Xue's body was buried in the same manner.</p><p></p><p>He did not want others to see Senior Sister Han Xue's body defiled by demons.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Han Xue, one of the Three Sword Immortals of the sect, pure as frost and jade, had fallen on the moon, similar to what Elder Sister had said.</p><p></p><p>The Three Sword Immortals of the sect would inevitably all die!</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Han Xue was dead, Senior Brother Feng was dead, and now only Senior Brother Lie Yang remained.</p><p></p><p>"So did Senior Brother Lie Yang pilot the Moon God Ship and fly back to the Primordial Chaos?"</p><p></p><p>He looked up, the moon silent, with its glow rippling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the starry void!</p><p></p><p>An enormous ancient life star was right in the very center of the heavens!</p><p></p><p>That was the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>In this vast expanse of stars, he did not see the Moon God Ship!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this divine ship had already flown to an extremely distant place.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan walked over to a fallen giant boulder.  </p><p></p><p>This boulder carried the sword aura of a sect disciple, a profound sword aura imprinted with five types of radiance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this seems to be the Great Five Phase Sword Intent of the Three Elders' lineage!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Great Five Phase Sword Intent, with only the sword aura, and moreover scattered into five sword rays, was rather strange.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent of the unified Five Phase Sword Aura far exceeded its scattered state.</p><p></p><p>To use the Great Five Phase Sword Aura against demons in battle?</p><p></p><p>Five rays of divine light flew out from Gu Jiuqing's body, with the primordial five qi falling onto this Great Five Phase Sword Aura, instantly unifying the five sword rays into one Great Five Phase Sword Intent on this giant boulder.</p><p></p><p>The Great Five Phase Sword Intent wavered, instantly condensing into a sword form and flying into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not move, nor did Lu Yuan dare move on his own.</p><p></p><p>He circled around and not far away, he saw another giant boulder imprinted with the Great Five Phase Sword Aura.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, Junior Brother, did you see the sword trail marks on these boulders?"</p><p></p><p>On one boulder, the sword trail was clearly visible, indicating someone had already activated the Great Five Phase Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be other Senior Brothers or Junior Brothers?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>If it was other Senior or Junior Brothers, that would be fine, but what if it was the true inheritor of the Sword Tomb lineage of the sect employing their methods, which were then broken by the demons?</p><p></p><p>If they were now chasing after the Great Five Phase Sword Intent, wouldn't that be like lambs walking into a tiger's den?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing gazed at the Great Five Phase Sword Intent that was about to disappear, then looked at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Eight Trigrams Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"I know you can hear what I'm saying."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan closed his mouth, and his spiritual soul entered the Mud Pill Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda has its uses for me, at most three years, after which I will relinquish the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was anxious.</p><p></p><p>This was the divine weapon he had gifted to his Senior Brother, what did the Eight Trigrams Venerable have to do with it!</p><p></p><p>"Your inheritance is useless to me, I am still the true inheritor of the Sword Sect, the disciple of the Seal Imprint Daoist."</p><p></p><p>In the Mud Pill Palace, the Eight Trigrams Venerable did not respond.</p><p></p><p>The Seal Imprint Daoist!</p><p></p><p>That was an ancient name, from the same era as him, so this old undying one hadn't died yet?</p><p></p><p>And he had even taken in such a good disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Lu Yuan's cultivation is impressive, with unmatched aptitude. Within these three years, Junior Brother Lu Yuan will have no use for the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan nodded vigorously. "Not to mention three years, perhaps even thirty years I would have no use for the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mud Pill Palace, Lu Yuan's spiritual soul looked at the figure of the Eight Trigrams Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you should just remove the taboos on the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda! Let Senior Brother refine your body, Master, you've seen Senior Brother's great talents!"</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Brother wielding the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda, he will definitely be able to suppress this demonic upheaval!"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, Master, are you worried that your fleshly body will be unable to suppress this rebellion?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable blew out his beard and glared, with an old face actually reflecting on his faceless visage.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, though this old man's fleshly body may not rank in the top ten in the world, it can still make the top twenty!"</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, let me show you just how formidable this old man's divine abilities truly are!"</p><p></p><p>The dual-bodied Eight Trigrams Venerable took action.</p><p></p><p>A divine light flew out of the Mud Pill Palace and entered the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>This pagoda had originally only been emanating faint rays of light, but suddenly the four tiers of the pagoda were illuminated by divine radiance, with the eight trigrams coalescing to unleash the majestic power of the four tiers.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Eight Trigrams Venerable resounded through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn one, with this old man's current primordial Eight Trigrams state, I can only unleash the power of four tiers of the pagoda, equivalent to this old man's four limbs. In using the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda, you can only wield the power of these four tiers!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams Venerable's voice faded away.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Jiuqing bowed to Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the Eight Trigrams Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hastily dodged, how could his Senior Brother bow to him, even if the Eight Trigrams Venerable was in his Mud Pill Palace?</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda shone brilliantly, with the masterless Eight Trigrams power rippling over its tiers.  </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing offered his spiritual power, enveloping the four pagoda tiers with his own power, and in an instant, he had refined these four tiers.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda took its place at the peak of Buzhou Mountain, coiled together with the Divine Wheel Weapon, the Dragon Tiger Bell, the Bronze Cauldron, and the Star Pearl under the Dragon Elephant Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, we can go now!"</p><p></p><p>Two sword rays shot through the sky as Gu Jiuqing and Lu Yuan followed that Great Five Phase Sword Intent, flying towards the depths of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's Mud Pill Palace, his Dragon Elephant spiritual soul coalesced.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at this fruition of the Dao, feeling somewhat pensive.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star was his greatest trump card.</p><p></p><p>But this trump card was far too powerful, to the extent that Gu Jiuqing could not easily unleash it.</p><p></p><p>"With the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda suppressing my fleshly body, I can now try to further assimilate cultivation realms and gain insights."</p><p></p><p>"If I encounter demons, I can also control the four tiers of the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was also very excited.  </p><p></p><p>He did not know to what extent the current fleshly power remained of this former dual-bodied peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>The fruition of the Dao solidified, with various cultivation scenes reflecting upon it.</p><p></p><p>After a breath of contemplation, Gu Jiuqing had his answer.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to assimilate the seven divine abilities, as these were the most basic seven lunar divine abilities. With the blessing of the Blue Star people and various insights, these lower-rank divine abilities might be able to be upgraded, but it was impossible for them to quickly ascend to upper-rank, great divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Let alone supreme divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Drawing Art!</p><p></p><p>This sword art could allow Gu Jiuqing to condense sword intent. Currently at the nine-part sword intent realm, after assimilating the insights of the Sword Drawing Art from the twenty-three provinces and five metropolitan areas of the Dragon Kingdom, breaking through to become a Sword Immortal would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"And then there's the Great Court Sword Classic."</p><p></p><p>The level of the Great Court Sword Classic was very high. In terms of skill levels, it surpassed the sword intent of the Nine Lineages of the Sword Sect. Even the sword intent recorded in the classic could at most be on par with the Great Court Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Tomb, there was a Five Phase Sword Furnace, but that furnace could not compare to the Great Court Sword Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can try assimilating the cultivation of the Great Court Sword Classic!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Jiuqing's fruition displayed ripples in one area, emanating from the cultivation insights of the Great Court Sword Classic from the Dragon Kingdom!!</p><p></p><p>The Great Court Sword Classic, this sword classic required tracing the celestial court, using one's own sword intent, sword aura, sword momentum, or even spiritual power, blood energy, and willpower to forge a celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Taking this celestial court as the foundation, one could then refine one's own Great Court Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Just like Gu Jiuqing, if he were to cultivate the Great Court Sword Intent, he could combine...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With the slashing heavenly sword intent, he constructed the heavenly court. </p><p></p><p>Once the heavenly court took shape, the sword intent displayed was no longer the slashing heavenly sword intent, but rather the great celestial court sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Quite a few people cultivated the great celestial court sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene appeared like flowing water, then disappeared. This sword classic was passed down in the Azure Dragon Kingdom. As long as one was a martial artist, they could cultivate it, using their own vital energy to outline the celestial court.</p><p></p><p>"So many martial artists are cultivating the great celestial court sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>There were too many scenes appearing.</p><p></p><p>However, these martial artists cultivating the great celestial court sword intent had not even entered the door. Fortunately, with the foundation of the Dragon Kingdom's population of 10 billion, even if one was picked out of every 100 li, 1000 li, or even 10,000 li, there were still quite a few people with extraordinary talent in the way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Realm after realm of the celestial court clashed within the Dao fruit, just like the Dragon Elephant Skill and Unsheathing Sword Art inside the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The insights from various great celestial court sword classics mutually verified and were reborn from the cocoon.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly way is not to be feared, the ancestors are not to be followed!</p><p></p><p>Through the mutual fusion, the sword intent most suited for the great celestial court sword classic was born.</p><p></p><p>It was a magnificent celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was stunned just by glancing at it.</p><p></p><p>It was too perfect!</p><p></p><p>Although he had never seen the 18 ancient celestial courts, Gu Jiuqing could confirm that none of those ancient celestial courts could match the one before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Liangxiao Shixiong's great celestial court could not compare to it!</p><p></p><p>It was not even one-tenth as perfect as this celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao fruit, the celestial court formed from the insights of the great celestial court sword classic was immense.</p><p></p><p>Inside the celestial court, 999 majestic palaces stretched endlessly, with four great gates in the east, south, west and north guarding the celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Below the four great gates, the four heavenly kings guarded the lands below the celestial court.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Continent of Superior Body, the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, the Northern Continent of Utmost Bliss, the Southern Continent of Beholding the Multitudes!</p><p></p><p>This was the initial appearance of the celestial court. Above the celestial court were 33 layers of heavenly palaces, each one exquisitely beautiful, where deities and immortals resided.</p><p></p><p>At the highest of these 33 heavens was the Supreme Heaven, also called the Great Red Heaven, the Most Quintessential Heaven, the Heaven of Tushita.</p><p></p><p>Outside the celestial court, myriad stars and constellations revolved around, with deities stationed on these great stars, corresponding to the 365 principal gods.</p><p></p><p>They were also the eight divisions of immortals of the celestial court!</p><p></p><p>"The people of Azure Star even outlined the roster of immortals residing in the celestial court?"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was so similar?</p><p></p><p>Deity after deity resided in the heavenly palaces of the celestial court or on the 365 stars, while outside the celestial court, a river of stars obstructed the brilliance of the surrounding stars.</p><p></p><p>That was the Milky Way!</p><p></p><p>A celestial general led the navy in training within the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>"That is...?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's gaze shifted, and below the celestial court, under the four continents, he also saw the underworld of the Yellow Springs.</p><p></p><p>That was the netherworld, with the six realms of reincarnation!</p><p></p><p>"The world and all living beings, reincarnating through the six realms, never ceasing to be reborn - this is the true celestial court!"</p><p></p><p>Unifying the three realms, the lives and deaths of all beings were under the control of the celestial court.</p><p></p><p>Only such a great celestial court could be considered a great unity, a great perfection.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing eagerly accepted the cultivation and insights of the great celestial court sword classic from the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The great celestial court sword classic had five core truths!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant spirit miniature opened its mouth and swallowed the five core truths of the great celestial court sword classic.</p><p></p><p>Various insights took flight and integrated seamlessly. The methods for outlining the great celestial court appeared one by one, along with the figures from the ancient celestial courts.</p><p></p><p>The underworld Yellow Springs, the 18 levels of hell, the ghostly officials of the underworld, the ox-head and horse-face, the Tower of Beholding, the Ghost City of Youguo, the ten courts of the King of Hell.</p><p></p><p>The eight divisions of the celestial court: Thunder, Martial, Wealth...</p><p></p><p>The four great continents, the surrounding stars, the Milky Way, the figures residing in the 33 heavens.</p><p></p><p>Too many truths converged, and the Dragon Elephant form of the spirit miniature was shattered under the torrent.</p><p></p><p>A new spirit form was born.</p><p></p><p>It was a small Dragon Elephant figure wearing an ornate crown, grasping the supreme authority to rule over the celestial court and the three realms!!</p><p></p><p>After swallowing these five core truths, Gu Jiuqing's comprehension of the great celestial court sword classic soared, and his spirit was tempered and strengthened, the miniature figure growing into a full human form.</p><p></p><p>This was insight. As for the cultivation bases of the Dragon Kingdom's people cultivating the great celestial court sword classic, they were all infused into Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Under the infusion of these cultivation bases, a celestial court slowly took shape, condensing into real heavenly palaces from the illusory celestial court and three realms.</p><p></p><p>Ten heavenly palaces!</p><p></p><p>Twenty heavenly palaces!</p><p></p><p>Thirty, forty, soon there were eighty heavenly palaces formed.</p><p></p><p>The condensation of the remaining palaces slowed considerably. By the end of this infusion of cultivation bases, only 100 real heavenly palaces had condensed within the celestial court.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate the great celestial court sword way, one must first condense 999 heavenly palaces, then the four great gates, followed by the 33 heavens, the Milky Way, the surrounding stars, the four continents, and the underworld Yellow Springs. Only after that comes the Jade Emperor of the celestial court, the Three Pure Ones and Four Illustrious Ones, the deities, celestial generals and soldiers."</p><p></p><p>Without celestial soldiers and generals, the celestial court is incomplete.</p><p></p><p>And in the great celestial court sword classic, the final step is to condense the forms of the celestial soldiers and generals.</p><p></p><p>Only by completing this step can one be considered to have fully cultivated the great celestial court sword classic!</p><p></p><p>As for him now, he could not even be considered to have entered the door.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——————"</p><p></p><p>The illusory image condensed into real heavenly palaces.</p><p></p><p>One hundred heavenly palaces weighed down on the Mud Pill Palace, along with that vast illusory scene. Gu Jiuqing felt his mind sinking.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly moved this celestial court to Mount Buzhou!</p><p></p><p>Only then did that oppressive weight disappear.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can still accept the inheritance of the Unsheathing Sword Art or some divine abilities and divine bodies."</p><p></p><p>With the great celestial court sword classic weighing down on Mount Buzhou, it was probably equivalent to only 30,000 to 40,000 Dragon Elephant heads.</p><p></p><p>The divine wheels and divine armaments could bear that burden without needing to open the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>After suppressing his fleshly body with the divine armaments for so long, Gu Jiuqing had gained some experience.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-streaked divine armament could suppress 10,000 Dragon Elephant heads by opening only 999 Dao traces.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine wheel armaments, these half-step thousand-streaked divine armaments could suppress 30,000 to 40,000 Dragon Elephant heads at full power.</p><p></p><p>And the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda, a transcendent great artifact comparable to a Dao trace from 6,000 years ago...</p><p></p><p>"I can only borrow the power of its four pagoda bodies. The Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda should be comparable to a complete great artifact with 3,000 Dao traces."</p><p></p><p>A great artifact with 999 Dao streaks opened was many times more powerful than an ordinary divine armament with 999 Dao streaks opened!</p><p></p><p>At least four or five times as powerful?</p><p></p><p>So Gu Jiuqing could probably inherit another four or five Dragon Elephant kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Jiuqing was about to accept the cultivation bases from the Dao fruit, he suddenly opened his eyes, and the divine soul of the Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor dispersed from the Mud Pill Palace as his mind sank into his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>"Little Brother Lu, does anyone know that Elder Martial Brother Liangxiao has entered and exited the Primordial Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was stunned. "This? Elder Martial Brother Liangxiao's entries and exits from the Primordial Wilderness have all been in secret, none of us knew."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Peak Master of Mount Celestial Court, that Senior Elder Taishang, has placed Elder Martial Brother Liangxiao under house arrest. So even if Elder Martial Brother Liangxiao enters and exits the Primordial Wilderness, he would conceal his tracks."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a white robe?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan hurriedly took out a white robe.</p><p></p><p>Demonic qi surged skyward from the demons and monsters!</p><p></p><p>On a blood-stained moon ship below, human figures were beheaded, their heads hung on a spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>Three human cultivators hung on each spirit tree, while under another spirit tree, a demon skewered four or five human corpses together and impaled them on the tree.</p><p></p><p>The blood splattered, and their spiritual energy dissipated. Those were five human cultivators not yet dead.</p><p></p><p>They were only sealed, their life force still tenaciously clinging on. But after being impaled, their struggles were insignificant as their bodies sank beneath the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>"Save me!"  </p><p>"Senior Martial Brother! Save me!"</p><p></p><p>Faint voices called out from the spirit trees.</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators cried out with their last strength, but as their blood drained and spiritual energy depleted until their souls scattered, there was still no movement from the distant moon ship.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the demons under the spirit trees burst into raucous laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Prince! There is no movement from the human cultivators of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>A demon came forward to report.</p><p></p><p>This was the firstborn son of the Demon Emperor, the strongest of the ten demon princes.</p><p></p><p>He wore a yellow robe, disguised as a human cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"No movement? Then continue killing more human cultivators until the thunderous might of the moon ship dissipates."</p><p></p><p>The demons beside him shuddered. "There is only one human cultivator left."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>At the demon prince's feet, there was indeed only one human figure left bound.</p><p></p><p>It was a female cultivator, her exquisite face filled with terror as large swaths of her skin were exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Then we shall defile this woman before the human cultivators' eyes. I want to see just what kind of fortitude these Sword Sect disciples have!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the female cultivator's face drained of all color.</p><p></p><p>Demons!</p><p>All who encounter them must slay them!</p><p></p><p>This eight-zhang tall demon raised the woman high with one hand, about to take her into the dense demonic army in the forest behind him.</p><p></p><p>A white-robed figure descended from the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was a white-robed cultivator, treading the void to appear before the demonic army, only a few hundred meters from the moon ship's entrance.</p><p></p><p>He did not fly directly into the moon ship's portal, but instead deliberately stood outside the demonic army.</p><p></p><p>Clad in a white robe, cupping a celestial court in his palms, an exquisite celestial court reminiscent of the ancient celestial courts of myth.</p><p></p><p>He wore a faint smile as he trod alone before the demonic army, then step by step, before the eyes of the demon prince, walked towards the moon ship's entrance.</p><p></p><p>Then he called out loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Now that you've encountered this madman, why don't you demons disperse your thunderous might?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that you think I've colluded with the demons of the Primordial Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Madman!</p><p></p><p>As those two words left his lips, the dense demonic army retreated several steps.</p><p></p><p>Even the flamboyant demon prince who had been standing there retreated half a step before regaining his footing, scrutinizing this white-robed human cultivator!!</p>

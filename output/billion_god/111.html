        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>He had lived for nearly three hundred years. Two hundred years ago, he stepped into the realm of Martial Saint, and only then did Martial Saints appear across the ocean. </p><p></p><p>He was ranked first. In the Dragon Kingdom, his strength was the strongest, having completed three blood condensations!</p><p></p><p>This was his publicly known level of power, but in reality, he had already completed the fourth blood condensation, living out another lifetime, which allowed him to maintain his youthful appearance of forty years old.</p><p></p><p>He was secretly observing these two Martial Saints in the dark.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor of Lijiang!  </p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen!</p><p></p><p>The auras of these two Martial Saints were concealed, impossible to observe.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely this feeling that made the First Martial Saint frown.</p><p></p><p>"Lijiang's Martial Saint is very powerful, is this the power after cultivating the Divine Body? Starting off with two blood condensations!"</p><p></p><p>Not only the Mayor of Lijiang and Secretary Wen, but also the three Martial Saints behind them.  </p><p></p><p>If these five Martial Saints joined forces, even the First Martial Saint felt he might be trapped in the Ancestral City of Lijiang.</p><p></p><p>The three of them simultaneously stopped in their tracks and looked behind them!</p><p></p><p>There, the Principal was fawning over a young teacher in conversation.</p><p></p><p>That teacher was the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"The Crown Prince of the Gu Family! Gu Zixiu!"</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint stepped forward, walking towards Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor and Secretary Wen moved to flank him, sandwiching the First Martial Saint in the middle.</p><p></p><p>If the First Martial Saint made any unusual moves, they would attack him together.</p><p></p><p>The two corporate leaders behind also came forward.</p><p></p><p>"This time it's my turn. There are two matters, the first is to pass down the method to cultivate magical powers."</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint had just walked behind the Principal when he heard Gu Jiuqing's voice.</p><p></p><p>He actually stopped in his tracks, as if he couldn't believe what he had heard!</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Mayor and Secretary Wen surrounding him on both sides and let out a wry laugh.</p><p></p><p>"You two Martial Saints, why are you so tense? The Martial Ancestor is preaching, I'm just curious."</p><p></p><p>"As fellow Earthlings, if I had malicious intentions towards humans, not to mention my Dragon Kingdom, even humans on Earth would have perished when the first interdimensional portal appeared."</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint stated his stance.</p><p></p><p>The several Martial Saints laughed heartily, but did not let down their guard.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint didn't mind, as he looked at this young Martial Ancestor and took the initiative to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu?!!"</p><p></p><p>He inquired tentatively. Gu Jiuqing nodded slightly. Who was this person? </p><p></p><p>Why had he never seen him before?</p><p></p><p>He had met the other high-ranking figures in Lijiang.</p><p></p><p>"I am the First Martial Saint, Teacher Gu must have heard of me, right?"</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Spiritual Qi Renaissance era, his fame could be said to have overshadowed half an era!</p><p></p><p>The one billion people of the Dragon Kingdom were all his followers.</p><p></p><p>If this Martial Ancestor was from the Dragon Kingdom, there was no way he hadn't heard of him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the middle-aged man before him, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly!!</p><p></p><p>The true ruler of the Dragon Kingdom had finally appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-three provinces and five capital cities of the Dragon Kingdom were very different from the regime during the Spiritual Qi Renaissance period. </p><p></p><p>After individual combat abilities reached a certain extreme, one person became an entire nation.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Sword Sect, the Sect Leader was the number one person in the Sword Sect. With him around, the elders of the Sword Sect could not have other intentions.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sect Leader were the two-in-one and three-in-one Celestial Masters at the peak. Under them were the Peak Masters, followed by the Elder Sword Immortals.</p><p></p><p>And in the Dragon Kingdom, with the First Martial Saint being the strongest individual, the entire Dragon Kingdom had to follow his lead.</p><p></p><p>After him were the eight Vice Princes of the eight great families in the imperial capital, the top four and bottom four families.</p><p></p><p>They nominated a Prince to be the open Emperor of the Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After the eight Princes were the Presidents of the Dragon Academy of Sciences, whose status was highly esteemed and did not participate in the regime. They were ranked in the second and third tiers.</p><p></p><p>The third tier consisted of the capital cities of the twenty-three provinces, whose Chairmen could command their own forces.</p><p></p><p>This was how the current Dragon Kingdom was structured in the Spiritual Qi Renaissance era.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Having drawn out the First Martial Saint, Gu Jiuqing didn't need the students of Class 2 Grade 3 to continue relaying his message when he preached in the Dragon Kingdom later. It would only take one sentence.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint smiled, "Teacher Gu just said there is a way to cultivate magical powers? Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Saints frowned.</p><p></p><p>Since the Martial Ancestor said so, it must be true.</p><p></p><p>What was the First Martial Saint doubting?!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not respond, but continued, "The method to cultivate magical powers is very simple, it is called the Root Cultivation Method."</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint frowned!</p><p></p><p>But he did not speak again, and like the other Martial Saints, he listened to Gu Jiuqing's teachings.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the first strand of magical power is most crucial. As long as you cultivate the first strand of magical power, you can open your Dantian, and thereafter refine spiritual qi into magical power to store in your Dantian."</p><p></p><p>"The Root Cultivation Method is to, under specific conditions, perfect yourself and then no longer continue cultivating, but instead stabilize yourself, reaching a state of fullness and overflow."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's explanation was simple, "It's like a bottle. When the bottle is filled with water, if you don't expand the bottle but keep pouring water into it, the water will overflow. This overflowing water is magical power."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing pointed at Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua promptly walked in front of Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"It's like her, Wen Daihua is currently at the Sect Master realm."</p><p></p><p>"After you perfect the Sect Master realm, don't try to break through to the Great Sect Master realm. From the day you perfect it, build up your physical body, elevating your essence, energy and spirit to the utmost. In about one to three months, you will overflow your first strand of essence, energy and spirit. After this strand resonates with heaven and earth, it will become your first strand of magical power!"</p><p></p><p>This method was very simple and easy to practice. It was popular for a period in the ancient Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>But it was not as good as the Heaven-Defying techniques.</p><p></p><p>So in the Primordial Era, this method could not be passed down.</p><p></p><p>Only when the path to Celestial Immortality was blocked did some three-in-one Patriarchs comprehend other Celestial Immortality methods, thereby rediscovering this method.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor and the others looked excited after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Only the First Martial Saint had doubts. Could this really allow one to cultivate magical powers?</p><p></p><p>He had never tried it before, so he didn't know if this method was real or not.</p><p></p><p>If it was real!</p><p></p><p>Just this method alone could allow the Dragon Kingdom to become the number one power on Earth, suppressing the forces across the ocean!</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint couldn't help but speak up, "It's very difficult to cultivate magical powers. Teacher Gu, where does this method come from?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the First Martial Saint again.</p><p></p><p>Where did it come from?</p><p></p><p>This was the first time someone had asked him the origin of this method in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Saint flew in from outside the school.</p><p></p><p>"First Martial Saint, this is the Ancestral City of Lijiang, not the imperial capital or any other capital city. Mind your words."</p><p></p><p>The President of the Martial Arts Association's figure landed in the school.</p><p></p><p>His aura was immense, golden feathered wings condensed on his back. He had already filled in seven vertebrae with the Golden Crow Divine Body technique!</p><p></p><p>After filling three vertebrae, one could complete the first blood condensation!</p><p></p><p>Six vertebrae allowed the second blood condensation.</p><p></p><p>Nine vertebrae, twelve vertebrae, fifteen vertebrae allowed the third, fourth and fifth blood condensations respectively!</p><p></p><p>After cultivating fifteen vertebrae and completing five blood condensations, one could officially step into the Celestial Martial realm and become a Terrestrial Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint sensed the President's aura, his expression changing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>This was a Martial Saint on par with him.</p><p></p><p>"You've also completed four blood condensations?"</p><p></p><p>The President did not respond, but bowed to Gu Jiuqing instead.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Teacher Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Didn't he see?</p><p></p><p>These Martial Saints were so respectful towards Gu Jiuqing. The First Martial Saint was powerful, but if they attacked together, suppressing and killing him would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was their deity.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding their deity was surrounding their own divine authority.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint's tone softened as he looked at the young Gu Jiuqing, finally placing Gu Jiuqing in the position of a "deity".</p><p></p><p>"Mmm, I'm not doubting the method Teacher Gu passed down, but methods to cultivate magical powers are not only rare on Earth, they are also rare in other worlds."</p><p></p><p>Other worlds!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing became interested, hearing about other worlds for the first time when Elder Gu came to see him.</p><p></p><p>Interdimensional portals could lead to other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Other worlds? Can the First Martial Saint elaborate?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was courteous, not using harsh words, but adopting a inquiring tone to ask the First Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint had entered interdimensional portals many times and was the most qualified among the Seventy-Two Sages to comment on other worlds.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint nodded, his voice slightly weighed down, "Over a hundred years ago, the Great Elephant Venerable of the Great Elephant Kingdom across the ocean discovered a crack in a valley, and from there the reason for the Spiritual Qi Renaissance was found!"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Qi leaked out from the interdimensional rift!</p><p></p><p>And by passing through this rift, one could enter another world.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past hundred years, there have been four interdimensional rifts on Earth. The Dragon Kingdom's Shennongjia has one. Over the years, I have entered and exited the Shennongjia interdimensional rift many times."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked curiously, "Are the four interdimensional portals leading to the same world, or different ones?"</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint shook his head, "I'm also not very clear. The world the Shennongjia interdimensional portal leads to is very vast, but also very quiet. Once I walked for three months before reaching a city."</p><p></p><p>The world of the Shennongjia interdimensional portal was like the ancient era!</p><p></p><p>Vast lands with sparse population, cities separated by great distances. There could be a string of cities that were all ruins!</p><p></p><p>"This world is very bizarre. We've coded it as the Bizarre World."</p><p></p><p>The Bizarre World?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"According to the natives there, there are bizarre things outside the cities that appear at night, so they need to take shelter in the cities. Moreover, in every household within the cities of this Bizarre World, they light an oil lamp."</p><p></p><p>"No cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint was very confident!</p><p></p><p>"Once I stayed in a city within the ominous world. That day, an unknown ominous force invaded the city, and a cultivator appeared and drove away the ominous force." </p><p></p><p>That time!</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint truly understood what ominousness really was.</p><p></p><p>Ominous!</p><p>Sinister!</p><p></p><p>That time, he only glanced at the ominous force, and his whole body became sinister. Red hair grew out, the bones inside his body rotted, and his blood turned black.</p><p></p><p>After running out of the ominous world and coming to the Blue Star, the sinister effects finally disappeared. </p><p></p><p>With just one glance at the ominous force, without even seeing it clearly, he was afflicted with sinister effects.</p><p></p><p>And that cultivator was called the Secret Martial Cultivator in the ominous world!</p><p></p><p>Cultivating secret martial arts allowed one to contend against ominous forces.</p><p></p><p>The biggest secret of secret martial arts was cultivating spirit power.</p><p></p><p>So when the First Martial Saint heard that Gu Jiuqing had a method to cultivate spirit power, he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"A world shrouded by ominous forces, according to the First Martial Saint, is a vast world with its own cultivation system, but it rarely spreads outwards."</p><p></p><p>In Gu Jiuqing's eyes, the ominous world and the Blue Star were actually the same. </p><p></p><p>What's so ominous about it!</p><p></p><p>With a pure yang thought, he could set the ominous world ablaze. How could it still be ominous?</p><p></p><p>First spread the dharma to the ominous world, let the people there know the benefits of the dharma transmitted by Gu Jiuqing. Then, after Gu Jiuqing subdues the demonic beasts at the Great Wilderness Tribulation realm, bring a pure yang thought to purify the ominous world. This other realm could also become Gu Jiuqing's backyard!</p><p></p><p>"What about the other three interdimensional portals behind the four portals?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked again.</p><p></p><p>"The other three interdimensional portals, the one in the Elephant Kingdom seems to also lead to the ominous world. Hmm, the Snake Kingdom and the Eagle Kingdom also have interdimensional portals!"</p><p></p><p>"The interdimensional portal of the Snake Kingdom leads to a realm that cannot be confirmed yet. The Martial Saints of the Snake Kingdom who entered this portal have gone missing. For decades, people sent by the Snake Kingdom to enter the interdimensional portal never came back!"</p><p></p><p>"The interdimensional portal of the Eagle Kingdom leads to another realm."</p><p></p><p>Another realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's heart rejoiced. </p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint frowned, "The realm of the Eagle Kingdom is completely different from the Blue Star. In that world, demonic beasts, or to be precise, the demonic race rules the world, and the human race is an inferior race that can only be enslaved by the demonic race."</p><p></p><p>Initially, the First Martial Saint and other Martial Saints joined forces to enter the demonic world, intending to overthrow the demonic race's rule.</p><p></p><p>But in the demonic world, those demonic beings were very powerful. Each had a bloodline inheritance. They lorded over the cities, enslaving the human race.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the demonic world, many Martial Saints were captured. The First Martial Saint hastily escaped from the demonic world, barely surviving.</p><p></p><p>"Based on what you said, if this demonic world is so powerful, why haven't they counterattacked the Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing felt a tinge of anxiety in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the Blue Star was attacked by other worlds, his cultivation speed would greatly slow down.</p><p></p><p>"It should be an issue with the cracks."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief suddenly spoke up, "I've been to the interdimensional portal in Shennongjia before."</p><p></p><p>He was just a Martial King back then, yet he dared to enter Shennongjia alone!</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint nodded, "It's like this, the cracks of the interdimensional portals prevent powerful beings from crossing between realms. But in recent years, we've discovered that these interdimensional cracks are expanding, indicating that in the future, powerful beings from other realms may descend upon the Blue Star!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the First Martial Saint sounded very grave!</p><p></p><p>Not many people knew about this, but those who did would feel weighed down by this matter.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor, the Secretary, and the Martial Chief all felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Gu Jiuqing, as if waiting for his response.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing smiled, "If such a thing really happens in the future, you don't need to worry. I will take action."</p><p></p><p>Yeah, worst case scenario, he could bring a great weapon to the Blue Star. If that's not enough, he could use a supreme weapon!</p><p></p><p>No, no, actually the Blue Star could resolve this issue itself.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing walked towards the playground, where an ancient teleportation array flickered with a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out a spatial bag and tossed it to the Mayor, "There are many spirit stones inside. From now on, you can use this teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>The Mayor was overjoyed and quickly opened the spatial bag. When he saw so many spirit stones, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>The other Martial experts were also excited upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>The Mayor took out a thousand spirit stones and placed them on the ancient teleportation array!</p><p></p><p>This was the second time the Mayor activated the ancient teleportation array since Gu Jiuqing left the Blue Star, as he had used up all the spirit stones the last time he activated it.</p><p></p><p>The moon!</p><p></p><p>Row after row of figures stood on the moon's surface.</p><p></p><p>The current moon was vastly different from when Gu Jiuqing first left it.</p><p></p><p>On the moon, there were now rows of hemispherical fortresses, and the number of people had increased to fifty or sixty.</p><p></p><p>These people were exposed in outer space, cultivating divine abilities and lunar-related divine bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief scattered his vital energy, enveloping Gu Jiuqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint curiously looked at the moon, this was his first time setting foot on it!</p><p></p><p>Just a breath away, forty thousand miles, and he went from the Blue Star to standing on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at that azure celestial body, the First Martial Saint felt Gu Jiuqing's terrifying power for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"This Martial Ancestor is perhaps even more powerful than the ominous forces of the ominous world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the moon and took out the remaining spatial bags.</p><p></p><p>"These are great medicines, including millennium-old Medicine Kings, all contained within these spatial bags."</p><p></p><p>He took out the few spatial bags he had obtained from the moon.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Jiuqing looked at the Mayor of Linji City and solemnly asked, "Do you know why I'm spreading my dharma so widely on the Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>The Martial experts were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>How would they know!</p><p></p><p>They only knew that Gu Jiuqing was spreading his dharma on the Blue Star without asking for anything in return.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you know the reason or not, it's the same."</p><p></p><p>"You only need to know one thing. I want to build up the Blue Star, enhance the cultivation of all of you and all the people of the Blue Star. Of course, if possible, to colonize..."</p><p></p><p>"That should be the word. Yes, to colonize other worlds, spread the dharma to other worlds, that's also possible."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Jiuqing directly stated his intentions.</p><p></p><p>Build up the Blue Star, enhance the cultivation of the Blue Star's people, colonize other worlds!</p><p></p><p>They didn't know why Gu Jiuqing was doing this, and this deity probably wouldn't know either.</p><p></p><p>But this matter!</p><p></p><p>For them, it was an immense blessing.</p><p></p><p>Colonize other worlds??</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint was excited, and the other Martial experts were even more thrilled.</p><p></p><p>Power, it intoxicated them!</p><p></p><p>Just by becoming an independent Dragon Kingdom, the power in their hands had increased many times over.</p><p></p><p>If they could colonize an entire world on their own??</p><p></p><p>"So I don't care what you all do on the Blue Star or what conflicts arise, but there is one point you must ensure."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's voice was icy cold as he looked at the Martial Saints, enunciating each word slowly.</p><p></p><p>"You must ensure that the dharma I have transmitted spreads unobstructed, and you must vigorously promote this matter!"</p><p></p><p>This concerned Gu Jiuqing's cultivation. Regardless of who dared to obstruct this, he would not hesitate to unleash the power of the Great Wilderness!!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saints trembled, repeatedly assuring they would not dare to obstruct.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, now let me tell you the second matter for my visit to the Blue Star this time."</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out the last spatial bag and removed everything inside, piling it all on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I want to capture the celestial bodies in space!"</p><p></p><p>Capture celestial bodies?</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>The Mayor, the Secretary, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"These materials can be used to construct the Lunar Radiance Grand Formation. You can build a few more on the moon."</p><p></p><p>"There are also materials to construct a formation to harvest great stars, to help me refine them into divine weapons!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing didn't hold back this time, directly stating his intentions.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, they would eventually find out, so he might as well say it now.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>The Mayor!</p><p></p><p>The Secretary! </p><p></p><p>The Martial Chief!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Martial experts stared blankly at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Harvest great stars?</p><p></p><p>Was it what they imagined, harvesting stars?</p><p></p><p>Using celestial bodies to refine divine weapons?</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons should refer to armaments.</p><p></p><p>Assisting a deity in refining weapons!!</p><p></p><p>A sense of mission arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The First Martial Saint unnaturally asked, "Master Gu, what kind of formation can harvest great stars and refine them into divine weapons? Do we need to harvest the sun?"</p><p></p><p>Harvest the sun!</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star would perish!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing laughed heartily, it seemed he had just scared them.</p><p></p><p>"You are in the solar system of the Blue Star, which has many asteroids, as well as the other eight major planets."</p><p></p><p>"When you harvest great stars, you can use the asteroids."</p><p></p><p>There were five hundred thousand asteroids in the solar system. Those with a diameter greater than one thousand miles could be refined into divine weapons, and there were many such asteroids!</p><p></p><p>However, what Gu Jiuqing valued most were the eight major planets!</p><p></p><p>If he could refine the eight major planets, hmm, refine seven of them, Gu Jiuqing had a feeling that refining the largest one, Jupiter, into a divine weapon would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Moreover!</p><p></p><p>Outside the solar system, there were many more celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>Stars larger than the sun were innumerable. Refining those celestial bodies would require more time, but once refined into divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Divine armaments?</p><p></p><p>No, they would be the most supreme of divine armaments!</p><p></p><p>I checked the information. If there are any errors, it's about an alternate solar system in another realm.</p><p></p><p>After the protagonist refines divine weapons, completely suppressing the consequences of his soaring power, he will enter a period of explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>So from now on, the story will be the main focus, with cultivation as a secondary element.</p><p></p><p>I beg for the readers' support!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing did not absorb the magical powers of the Dragon Kingdom people, nor did he learn their sword drawing techniques. </p><p></p><p>This was because the power of the Dragon and Elephant Skill came from the most direct enhancement of strength.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power required him to use divine weapons to suppress it, otherwise the rapid increase in strength would cause his mortal body to collapse.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment!</p><p></p><p>After the insights of the Dragon and Elephant Skill transformed the hundreds of thoughts into miniature human soul forms again, the cultivation level of the Dragon and Elephant Skill also rushed in once more. </p><p></p><p>That vast cultivation level washed over his flesh, causing his viscera to disappear. The primordial deities formed from the five primordial qi were gradually solidifying under the repeated battering.</p><p></p><p>Each deity grew larger in size.</p><p></p><p>This was only the cultivation level from absorbing one province of Jiangnan in the Dragon Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>Two months!</p><p></p><p>It was probably the cultivation levels of the Dragon and Elephant Skill from 50 million people over two months that rushed into his flesh in a torrent.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on Gu Jiuqing's flesh, even causing the Pangu deity to tremble from the impact.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>Under the repeated battering, his flesh became indestructible, transforming into a divine treasure comparable to divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>What's more, dragon and elephant forms began coalescing on the third vertebra of Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand heads!  </p><p>Twenty thousand heads!</p><p>Thirty thousand heads!</p><p>Forty thousand heads! </p><p>Fifty thousand heads!</p><p>Sixty thousand heads!</p><p>Seventy thousand heads!</p><p></p><p>Just from absorbing one province of Jiangnan, Gu Jiuqing condensed seventy thousand dragon and elephant power heads. Adding the previous thirty thousand, this allowed Gu Jiuqing to form his third Dragon and Elephant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Wushhhhhh-----"</p><p></p><p>As the divine kingdom formed, the dragons and elephants roared.</p><p></p><p>"Roarrrrrrr----------"</p><p></p><p>His golden blood essence transformed into azure dragons that washed over his flesh, tempering it in the cosmic furnace to become an undying true body. Every drop of his blazing essence blood contained boundless divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>"It still hasn't reached the limit?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's flesh had not yet reached its limit and showed no signs of collapsing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to unleash those divine weapons yet!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Elephant cultivation levels from the second, third and fourth provinces of the Dragon Kingdom were absorbed.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth vertebra, more dragon and elephant heads began condensing.</p><p></p><p>One hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, thirty thousand, fifty thousand, sixty thousand!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying condensing speed shook Gu Jiuqing to the core.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, Gu Jiuqing's spine was suppressed again, forcing his body to bend over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the divine weapons were unleashed!</p><p></p><p>The star pearls formed from the Valley God and Star God weapons rippled, instantly opening 999 dao marks and emanating divine light, like a star hanging over Mount Buzhou.</p><p></p><p>After unleashing the divine weapon, Gu Jiuqing's burden was instantly reduced!</p><p></p><p>But as the cultivation of the third province descended, Gu Jiuqing unleashed his second divine weapon - the Creation Star!</p><p></p><p>999 dao marks rippled and shone, sending down rays of light to suppress the dragons and elephants.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, I need more divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing also opened the coffin of the Longevity Immortal Venerable. Only then did the pressure on his body finally dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Ten provinces! Fifty million dragon and elephant heads condensed on his fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>Five Dragon and Elephant Kingdoms formed. The Longevity Immortal's coffin began to stir, forcing Gu Jiuqing to open all 999 of its dao marks!</p><p></p><p>The eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth provinces...when the Dragon and Elephant cultivation of the seventeenth province was devoured, the Longevity Immortal's coffin emitted creaking sounds.</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on all 999 of its dao marks!</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Jiuqing opened the Yin-Yang Treasure Pagoda, activating the 999 dao marks on each of its four pedestals!!</p><p></p><p>The eighteenth, nineteenth province! All the way to the twenty-second province!</p><p></p><p>Adding Jiangnan, that was a total of twenty-three provinces!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing absorbed all the Dragon and Elephant cultivation from twenty-three provinces of the Dragon Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>His body swelled up, becoming stout and burly, like an inflated balloon - this phenomenon persisted.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, more Dragon and Elephant Kingdoms formed spiraling around his spine!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the three previous ones, eleven more Dragon and Elephant Kingdoms appeared.</p><p></p><p>The four pedestals of the Yin-Yang Pagoda were shaking.</p><p></p><p>Even the Pangu deity cradling Mount Buzhou was bent over!</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>There were still five capital cities left in the Dragon and Elephant cultivation of the Dragon Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The people in these five cities were fewer than a province, but their cultivation was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The combined Dragon and Elephant cultivation from these five cities condensed into dragon and elephant heads on the tenth vertebra.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand heads!</p><p>Twenty thousand heads! </p><p>Thirty thousand heads!</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Pagoda shook violently. The Valley God weapon, Creation Star weapon, Taiyi Divine Sword, star pearls, bronze tripod, dragon-tiger bell, divine wheel weapon, Immortal Venerable's coffin - every single divine weapon and treasure unleashed its 999 dao marks, but still could not suppress the signs of his flesh tearing apart.</p><p></p><p>Cracks even appeared on his spine.</p><p></p><p>Forty thousand heads!</p><p>Fifty thousand heads!</p><p></p><p>Crack------</p><p></p><p>A tearing sound came from Gu Jiuqing's flesh.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Dragon and Elephant Skill thundered into the Pangu deity, solidifying it and causing the deity's figure to expand by three-tenths.</p><p></p><p>The Pangu deity raised its head and puffed out its chest, cradling Mount Buzhou as it instantly suppressed the Dragon and Elephant power.</p><p></p><p>Sixty thousand heads! </p><p>Seventy thousand heads!</p><p>Eighty thousand heads!!</p><p></p><p>On the fifteenth vertebra, eighty thousand dragon and elephant heads coiled around it.</p><p></p><p>In total, Gu Jiuqing's body contained fourteen Dragon and Elephant Kingdoms with a staggering 148 million dragon and elephant power heads.</p><p></p><p>This immense power had reached the apex of might.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could sense it!</p><p></p><p>He stood motionless in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, afraid that even the slightest movement would cause his flesh to explode!</p><p></p><p>The origin force, divine weapons, everything was used to suppress these 148 million dragon and elephant power heads lying dormant within his flesh.</p><p></p><p>If unleashed, Gu Jiuqing could scarcely imagine the divine might it would possess!</p><p></p><p>One day, two days, three days passed before Gu Jiuqing finally took a step out of the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p><p></p><p>That single step created a huge crater in the star-iron floor of the chamber, as if it were made of tofu.</p><p></p><p>And this was with Gu Jiuqing exerting extreme control over his flesh.</p><p></p><p>A single strand of hair fell from his head - it had been shaken loose during the absorption of the Dragon and Elephant cultivation, battered countless times by the qi and power.</p><p></p><p>This single lightweight strand of hair drifted down.</p><p></p><p>The instant it touched the ground -</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The ground caved in, cracks spreading out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble----------"</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber collapsed in that moment, palace after palace of Sword Heaven Palace crumbling into ruins.</p><p></p><p>At the Enforcement Palace, Distant Path was meditating, waiting for Gu Jiuqing to descend the mountain even before he had.</p><p></p><p>"Your mortal flesh is too poor. When you shed your mortal form back then, you failed to fully cast off your remnants. Now your cultivation is twice the effort for half the result."</p><p></p><p>"You've only filled eight nodes of the eight-form origin, unable to even condense the minor eight-form celestial body."</p><p></p><p>Distant Path chuckled, "Master, I've been cultivating very diligently. Filling eight origin nodes - other cultivators would take two to three years, but I only needed a few months!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, cultivating the celestial body and refining the origin to transform the spine into Mount Buzhou may take time, but you did it under my guidance, condensing the eight-form origin!"</p><p></p><p>"I once took in a disciple who completed the Mount Buzhou realm in just one year, filling all thirty-three vertebrae to cultivate the great eight-form origin!"</p><p></p><p>"What happened to that senior martial brother after?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, why do you care! Just keep cultivating."</p><p></p><p>In the Mud Hut Palace, the Eight-Form Ancient One rebuked Distant Path.</p><p></p><p>So it turned out the Eight-Form Ancient One had another disciple.</p><p></p><p>But that disciple must have either died or fallen out with the Eight-Form Ancient One, otherwise he wouldn't have withheld the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Distant Path rested.</p><p></p><p>No need to work so hard at such a tedious cultivation.</p><p></p><p>His path!</p><p></p><p>His path to the Way lay with his senior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>As long as his brother diligently cultivated, that was Distant Path being diligent.</p><p></p><p>If his brother achieved the Way, then so did Distant Path.</p><p></p><p>He could just go through the motions with the Eight-Form Ancient One's teachings.</p><p></p><p>"But the four great sects have been roaming the world for over a month now, right? My senior brother still hasn't descended the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, for a great talent like my brother, he must be making a grand final appearance."</p><p></p><p>There were many storytellers in Great Zhou, and in their tales, the protagonists always appeared at the very end to turn things around.</p><p></p><p>"Ah senior brother, so that's what you're thinking."</p><p></p><p>Realizing Gu Jiuqing's "thoughts", Distant Path was no longer anxious and prepared to rest before continuing his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The ground shook, causing tremors in the Enforcement Palace.</p><p></p><p>Distant Path hurriedly flew out to see clouds of dust billowing from Sword Heaven Palace. As the dust cleared, he saw palace after palace collapsed into rubble, with a blue-robed youth standing amidst the ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was Senior Martial Brother Gu Jiuqing! </p><p></p><p>Sword Heaven Palace had collapsed again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Distant Path was shaken. Could it be that some enemy, fearful of his senior brother's great talent, had infiltrated Sword Heaven Palace to assassinate him?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Jiuqing worried Distant Path would overthink it.</p><p></p><p>"Martial brother, has any news arrived from Ancient Heaven City?"</p><p></p><p>Distant Path hurriedly produced a letter. "This is a letter the steward sent a few days ago, said to be from Senior Martial Sister."</p><p></p><p>Distant Path handed over the letter.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing remained standing in place without moving.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this?</p><p></p><p>Why wasn't Senior Martial Brother coming out of the ruins?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Distant Path flew into the rubble to personally deliver the letter to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>"No need to give it to me, just read it out for me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, tears welled up in Distant Path's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was a family letter!</p><p></p><p>Yet Senior Martial Brother actually asked him to read it aloud - in his heart, Distant Path was considered family!</p><p></p><p>The path to the Way!</p><p></p><p>I have found that path!</p><p></p><p>Distant Path reined in his emotions and began reading:</p><p></p><p>"Sister is out doing business and will be traveling far away for a while. Once sister is free, she will come find you."</p><p></p><p>"These days..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You just stay at the Sword Sect, do not leave the mountain under any circumstances!"]</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had a bad premonition after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong was going on a trip far away?  </p><p></p><p>Where to?</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong, using the identity of the Great Heavenly Venerable, was stirring up trouble outside the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Why would she choose the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal? Moreover, the coffin on Gu Jiuqing's body was most likely that of the Long Life Immortal himself!</p><p></p><p>This indicated that his sister was plotting against the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Has there been any news about the Great Tomb of the Long Life Immortal recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone excavated the Long Life Immortal's treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan said, "These days, it's said that the Withered Mountain of the Long Life Immortal has been found, but the Long Life Immortal's remains have long since perished, and the Withered Mountain has also withered."</p><p></p><p>"Now, those Realized Immortals and Celestials are searching for the Celestial Palace of the Long Life Immortal inside the great tomb!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Palace! It is the mud-bead palace, containing the essence of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The Long Life Immortal was most likely a deity. Although his physical body was destroyed, his Celestial Palace may have been preserved!</p><p></p><p>"Open the letter and let me see!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan unfolded the letter.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Linglong's handwriting, somewhat scribbled.</p><p></p><p>She must have been in a hurry when writing this letter.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even mention the Princess of Great Zhou, let alone anything else.</p><p></p><p>Gu Linglong was in danger!</p><p></p><p>Inside the mud-bead palace, Gu Jiuqing's thoughts flowed, and among the three thousand thoughts, hundreds of thought-souls took form as tiny figures, deducing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>[Gu Linglong is the Great Heavenly Venerable, with at least the Refining Immortal Realm cultivation.]</p><p></p><p>[My Gu family's bloodline is mediocre, among the bottom of the prestigious clans. It's impossible for Gu Linglong to reach the Refining Immortal Realm so quickly relying solely on her own talents.]</p><p></p><p>[Luo Shen is in the Refining Immortal Realm, but sister is stronger than Luo Shen. There was also the previous incarnation of the Celestial Maiden, which had almost the level of the Celestial Palace Realm.]</p><p></p><p>[Among the younger generation, sister's strength is enough to be ranked, at least on par with Senior Martial Brother Lieyang, definitely making the Dragon and Tiger Ranking without issue.]</p><p></p><p>So where did sister's fortuitous opportunity come from?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing has the Blue Star, which allowed his rapid advancement in strength.</p><p></p><p>Then what was the source of sister's fortuitous opportunity?</p><p></p><p>[Sister said the Three Sword Immortals of the Sword Sect would die, and then Senior Martial Sister Hanxue and Senior Martial Brother Feng died on the moon. Sister also knew many secrets of the Sword Sect, and even brought me the secret Buddhist techniques and the Buddha portrait.]</p><p></p><p>[She's familiar with the prohibitions of the Immortal's Great Tomb, and even has the Immortal's coffin.]</p><p></p><p>His thoughts surged, unraveling the threads, allowing Gu Jiuqing to trace back to the origin, pursuing the only truth.</p><p></p><p>[Gu Linglong is very familiar with the Immortal's Great Tomb! And she's also familiar with the Sword Sect! She even knows the life and death of the Sword Sect's disciples! But she doesn't know that I joined the Sword Sect.]</p><p></p><p>Established facts!</p><p></p><p>And the uncertain future!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was as if Gu Jiuqing had been enlightened by the Buddha's wisdom. His three thousand thoughts merged into a thirty-zhang tall Dragon Elephant Celestial Emperor spirit-soul.</p><p></p><p>[Siwuxie's vision is the highest, knowing everything in the heavens and earth. Why would he know all this? The master said Siwuxie is the reincarnation of a celestial being! But sister couldn't possibly be the reincarnation of a celestial being!]</p><p></p><p>Celestial beings know the heavens and earth because they have witnessed the workings of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Their perspective is simply too lofty.</p><p></p><p>Then what about sister? Where did she witness the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>Also, Siwuxie and sister know each other!</p><p></p><p>Siwuxie's vision, sister's vision! Could it be the same?</p><p></p><p>[When I obtained this left eye and activated the Divine Illumination, I clearly felt a force pouring into my eye. That force has the same origin.]</p><p></p><p>[Sister has witnessed the heavens and earth, Siwuxie has witnessed the heavens and earth, and this eye of mine was also obtained because of Siwuxie's words. Then is Siwuxie my brother-in-law?]</p><p></p><p>Ah, this?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, impossible!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's deductions were interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of years ago in the Dragon Kingdom, before the spiritual energy had revived, there was a form of entertainment called novels that was popular."</p><p></p><p>This was something Gu Jiuqing had accidentally learned while browsing the internet.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had posted online about how he would transform the Blue Star if he became a deity, and someone had responded to him.</p><p></p><p>[Are you writing a novel? This premise is too clichéd, it was already overdone hundreds of years ago.]</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing searched for the keyword "novel" and found quite a bit of information.</p><p></p><p>Transmigration! Rebirth!</p><p></p><p>These were the two keywords Gu Jiuqing searched the most.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had transmigrated to the Blue Star, reborn into Gu Zixiu's body!</p><p></p><p>"Then what about sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Transmigration? Or rebirth? It should be rebirth!"</p><p></p><p>"Reborn from the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, this idea is too far-fetched. How could sister have been reborn from the future?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's thoughts dispersed, the thirty-zhang spirit-soul dissolving back into three thousand thoughts, falling into the mud-bead palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan was still standing quietly beside Gu Jiuqing, the letter unfolded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why Senior Martial Brother Gu had been silent for so long.</p><p></p><p>He knew there were some things he shouldn't pry into.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, from day to night, and from night to early morning.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sword Palace had turned into ruins, with several palaces collapsed.</p><p></p><p>At dawn, the law enforcement disciples patrolling the Sword Sect discovered the abnormality at the Celestial Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>Five law enforcement disciples entered the Celestial Sword Palace, and upon seeing the two people standing amidst the ruins, they bowed to one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Law enforcement disciples pay respects to the True Transmitter Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Has something happened at the Celestial Sword Palace? Do we need to report to the Law Enforcement Hall?"</p><p></p><p>The law enforcement disciples cautiously looked at Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This True Transmitter!</p><p></p><p>He was the only True Transmitter currently residing on the sacred mountain of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Very recognizable.</p><p></p><p>These days, there had been many rumors circulating in the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had fought the Demon Prince during the Moon Chasing Journey, shocking the entire Sword Sect. And now, with the True Transmitter Trials commencing and the Four Sects' Great Competition starting, why hadn't this Sword Dao Paramount come down from the mountain?</p><p></p><p>They all suspected that Gu Jiuqing had been severely injured during the Moon Chasing Journey, unable to come down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment!</p><p></p><p>These five law enforcement disciples saw Gu Jiuqing standing motionless amidst the ruins, as if he had gone insane, perfectly confirming this rumor.</p><p></p><p>The sun had just risen, and below on the surrounding mountains, inner sect disciples were exhaling purple mist as they began their daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was time for the morning practice!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened his eyes and took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>With this one step, the ruins beneath his feet stirred.</p><p></p><p>Taking the second step, Gu Jiuqing's figure was already standing in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The third step!</p><p></p><p>He had already walked out of the ruins of the Celestial Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>It took him a day, but he could finally control his physical body, at least not worrying about his physical strength leaking outwards.</p><p></p><p>Hmm!</p><p></p><p>It was the strength of his physical body, not the strength of the Dragon Elephant Skill!</p><p></p><p>In this latest advancement, Gu Jiuqing's physical body had been refined to the level of a thousand-streaked divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>His physical body, comparable to a thousand-streaked divine weapon, could withstand low-grade and mid-grade divine abilities, as well as ordinary techniques of the Refining Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining insights into sword techniques, great formations, and the Three-Zhang Golden Body Method, Gu Jiuqing's physical body could no longer bear their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait until the researchers on the Blue Star's moon harvested the Great Stars to refine divine weapons before resuming his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing happened, I just accidentally damaged the palace during my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Artifact Peak on my behalf and have the disciples there restore the palace to its original state."</p><p></p><p>The five law enforcement disciples immediately nodded, with one of them flying towards the Artifact Peak, while the remaining four continued patrolling the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, let's go down the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing turned to look at Lu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuan promptly stepped into the void, following behind him.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one in front and one behind, stepped down from the Celestial Sword Palace, down from the Celestial Peak, and out of the sacred mountain of the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>And with Gu Jiuqing's descent from the mountain, the Sword Sect was shaken!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the disciples of the Sword Sect gazed at the figures walking down from the heavens, all feeling amazed.</p><p></p><p>"It's that Sword Dao Paramount coming down the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>"Coming down? Could it be that this Sword Dao Paramount has recovered his cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"During the Moon Chasing Journey, this Sword Dao Paramount was able to fight the Demon Prince. There are rumors that he has already cultivated to the Sword Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Reaching the Sword Immortal Realm in half a year? Such talent??"</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Martial Brother Gu coming down the mountain, our Sword Sect has increased its chances of taking first place in the Dragon and Tiger Ranking at this Four Sects' Great Competition and gathering the world's spiritual energy by another three parts."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Inside the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the descending figures, Cunyin Daoren smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior, this old man's disciple has finally come down from the mountain. Now this old man has two disciples, can your Siwuxie compare?"</p><p></p><p>"He can compare!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior uttered three words.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, you're just talking big."</p><p></p><p>"But you and I still need to guard the Sword Sect. With the Demon Prince dead, the Demon Emperor will likely lose his mind!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man is worried that the calamity from three thousand years ago might happen again!"</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago, the Sword Primordial fell, and the Sword Sect was in chaos!</p><p></p><p>And now, the Sword Sect's Sect Master had gone into seclusion!</p><p></p><p>Even they didn't know where Jiang Xingxun was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior smiled but didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing else!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't disturb me!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Senior was dismissing him.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, understood. You'll guard the Sword Sect. This old man will enter the Great Wilderness to be the protector for those two precious junior brothers."</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh heh!"</p><p></p><p>Cunyin Daoren left the thatched hut and flew up to the Celestial Peak.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sword furnace on the Celestial Peak radiated light, illuminating the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>He still didn't feel at ease leaving the Third Senior alone at the Sword Sect, so he took up residence on the Celestial Peak as well.</p><p></p><p>The two Realized Immortal Realm experts, essentially one entity, once again guarded the Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>Seeking more subscriptions, the protagonist has come down the mountain with invincible strength.</p><p></p><p>Flesh body with 148 million Dragon Elephant power. 30-zhang spirit-soul!  </p><p></p><p>Sword intent two-fourths complete, seven great divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Flesh body comparable to a thousand-streaked divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>The protagonist is going to show off, begging for support!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

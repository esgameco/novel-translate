        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom gradually dispersed. </p><p></p><p>They were reluctant to leave, wanting to continue listening to Gu Jiuqing's lecture.</p><p></p><p>"Above the six levels of body cultivation - refining the skin, flesh, bones, tendons, organs, and blood exchange - is the realm of the Earth Immortal. Above the Earth Immortal is the true immortal of the land!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, Teacher Gu taught us the method of cultivating the divine body and opening the divine apertures. This is the true martial art, far more powerful than the Dragon and Elephant Skill."  </p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that in the great era to come, I, Ning Que, will surely have a place."</p><p></p><p>Vice Class Monitor Ning Que, holding his phone, was the last to leave the classroom.</p><p></p><p>They stood outside the corridor of the classroom, lingering without dispersing.</p><p></p><p>Class Monitor Yang Miaoling stood gracefully among the crowd, her qi and blood had already broken through to level three, and she would soon be able to reach level four!</p><p></p><p>With such a qi and blood level, becoming the top scorer in the college entrance exam was almost guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards Ning Que!</p><p></p><p>Ning Que had always been her rival. After Teacher Gu passed down the Dragon and Elephant Skill, Ning Que exhibited a terrifying martial arts talent.</p><p></p><p>He used the elephants in the zoo as a medium to imitate and cultivate the Dragon and Elephant Skill, even swallowing elephant blood to strengthen his own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling relied on nutrient fluids for rapid growth.</p><p></p><p>But Ning Que was actually able to keep up with her.</p><p></p><p>Yang Miaoling then looked towards the quiet girl standing beside her, Wen Daihua.</p><p></p><p>Wen Daihua carried a sword on her back, looking like a sword immortal who had stepped out of a painting. Her qi and blood were almost dissipated, making it impossible to discern her level.</p><p></p><p>But according to Yang Miaoling's father, Wen Daihua had the qualifications to become the sword saint of this era!</p><p></p><p>"What a wonderful era, I wonder if I, Yang Miaoling, can suppress this great era and the other forty-four classmates!"</p><p></p><p>The great era!</p><p></p><p>This was a great era that belonged solely to Class 2 of Grade 3.</p><p></p><p>As long as she could suppress her classmates in Class 2 of Grade 3, she would be the number one person in this great era!</p><p></p><p>The other students also understood this principle. They lingered in the corridor for a long time, and only dispersed when Teacher Gu did not come out.</p><p></p><p>They still had so many things to do!</p><p></p><p>Every minute and second was precious time.</p><p></p><p>In the classroom of Class 2, Grade 3.</p><p></p><p>With the departure of the forty-five students, the classroom suddenly felt spacious.</p><p></p><p>The principal, Old Man Wen, the Martial Chief, the Security Chief, and Secretary Wen - these five martial kings had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>A simple public lecture had revealed the two realms above the Martial Saint from the divine teachings.</p><p></p><p>This had put immense pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>Linjiang had been sealed off for three months. Once Linjiang was unsealed, this information would spread throughout the country and even the world!</p><p></p><p>They would all bear the blame!</p><p></p><p>They had delayed the spread of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing looked at the five elders. He could sense that these five elders were many times stronger than his current physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Wen, what stage is the Moon Project at?"</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Jiuqing's main concern.</p><p></p><p>His physical body would continue to strengthen indefinitely, and he could cultivate his own spiritual power. As for the divine apertures, the people of Planet Blue could help him with that.</p><p></p><p>But what about divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>Protecting the Way was the top priority!</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities were too powerful. Gu Jiuqing wanted to rely on the people of Planet Blue to cultivate divine abilities. The best way was to open the path to the moon, allowing the people of Planet Blue to cultivate divine abilities related to the moon.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Project is mainly the responsibility of the Linjiang Chamber of Commerce."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wen looked towards Secretary Wen. "Secretary Wen, you explain."</p><p></p><p>Secretary Wen was the mayor's secretary and also a martial king.</p><p></p><p>He did not dare to neglect this matter and immediately said, "We are still in the most basic construction stage, but the first manned mission will be completed within two months, without a problem."</p><p></p><p>"I can guarantee this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this elder's firm assurance, Gu Jiuqing felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Have the candidates for flying to the moon been decided?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet. Does Teacher Gu have any recommendations?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing shook his head. He didn't care who flew to the moon.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the basics of the Moon Project, Gu Jiuqing took out a bag.</p><p></p><p>The five elders all looked at this strange bag.</p><p></p><p>The bag was the size of a palm, neither gold nor jade, with complex patterns on it that resembled tadpoles.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing opened the cosmic bag and took out a spirit stone, handing it to Old Man Wen.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wen and the others carefully...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Observe the spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>The spirit stone was only thumb-sized, brilliant like jade, with thin streaks of light flickering within it. </p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wen cupped the jade stone in his hands, feeling a cool energy emanating from the stone and entering his meridians.</p><p></p><p>This cool energy struck his mind and soul, bringing a sense of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>"This is a spirit stone, it can be directly absorbed," Gu Jiuqing explained. "Similar to a nutrient solution."</p><p></p><p>The Qu family had sent over a thousand spirit stones, and various ancient noble families from the great cities had also sent many spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing had refined these spirit stones, allowing them to scatter autonomously across Planet Blue. </p><p></p><p>However, it would be better to bring the spirit stones directly to Planet Blue and let the people actively absorb them, so Gu Jiuqing could gain even more cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit stones?" Elder Wen raised his eyebrows and tried to absorb the spiritual energy from within the stone.</p><p></p><p>With just this attempt, the thin streaks within the spirit stone instantly surged into Elder Wen's body.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual energy was so gentle, dispersing throughout his body and repairing his damaged meridians and bones.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, Elder Wen looked ten years younger!</p><p></p><p>Even his blood and qi had become much more robust, increasing by several levels!!</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet recovered to his peak, by absorbing a few more spirit stones, he would be able to experience a second rebirth like a withered tree meeting spring again.</p><p></p><p>One-third of the spiritual energy within the spirit stone was gone!</p><p></p><p>The four elders standing beside him all widened their eyes, staring at Elder Wen in bewilderment.  </p><p></p><p>The effects of the spirit stones were so powerful. Possessing just one spirit stone could greatly accelerate their cultivation speed and even heal internal injuries.</p><p></p><p>"There are three thousand spirit stones in this bag for you to use in your cultivation. Besides the spirit stones, the qiankun bag also contains many spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>"I have labeled all the spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>Spirit pills?</p><p></p><p>Were those immortal pills or spirit medicines?</p><p></p><p>This god had actually brought out the legendary immortal pills and spirit medicines?</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing took out bottles of spirit pills from the qiankun bag.</p><p></p><p>"Qi replenishing pills, blood strengthening pills, bone strengthening pills, blood refining pills, great rejuvenation pills, dragon blood pills..."</p><p></p><p>Bottle after bottle of spirit pills were placed on the desk.</p><p></p><p>The five elders stared with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>This god!</p><p></p><p>He had given them cultivation methods, spirit stones, and now spirit pills?</p><p></p><p>They were worried that after this, the god might completely leave Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>"You can try to analyze the ingredients of the spirit pills. If you can find the same materials, I can give you the pill formulas."  </p><p></p><p>Spirit pills were consumables.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing could obtain spirit pills from the Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't be the sole provider for all the people of Planet Blue!</p><p></p><p>Hence, this scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing wanted to find materials on Planet Blue that were the same as those in the Great Wilderness, then publicize the pill formulas so the spirit pills could be mass-produced!!</p><p></p><p>Once this idea became a reality, Planet Blue would never lack spirit pill supplies.</p><p></p><p>Gu Jiuqing's strength could then increase by who knows how many times.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" Elder Wen laughed.</p><p></p><p>In martial cultivation, one could rely on external objects.</p><p></p><p>But in their later stages, they mostly relied on nutrient solutions to quickly replenish their strength.</p><p></p><p>Spirit pills were different.</p><p></p><p>Not only could spirit pills replenish strength, but they could also accelerate the refinement of blood and qi, allowing one's strength to increase much faster!</p><p></p><p>Just now, Elder Wen opened a bottle of blood refining pills and swallowed one.</p><p></p><p>Just this single blood refining pill provided greater nourishment than a grade B nutrient solution!</p><p></p><p>And this was just the internal nourishment.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Gu, rest assured, we will definitely find suitable spirit pill ingredients for us!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, rest assured. We have the best research team. Within ten days, we will analyze the ingredients of all the spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>"We will definitely not let Teacher Gu down!"</p><p></p><p>The five elders bowed deeply to Gu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>This bow!</p><p></p><p>They bowed with sincere hearts.</p><p></p><p>The god!</p><p></p><p>Had bestowed great grace upon Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Methods for the Unrivaled and Refining God realms had been passed to Linjiang, and now spirit stones and spirit pills were given to the Linjiang elders.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Jiuqing only needed to wait for the people of Linjiang to digest this bountiful offering.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's consciousness followed the spiritual resonance and entered the gray mist space again, beginning the simulation.</p><p></p><p>"Feasible! According to my current level, as long as I can comprehend the relevant laws of nurturing the sacred spirit and my cultivation path is compatible with these laws, I can simulate my own Supplementing the Heavens technique after reaching the third layer of the Immortal Realm. It will take about 10,000 years?"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the long time span and felt a bit unbelievable. "Am I not a sacred spirit? My spiritual aptitude may not be enough to reach the Dao, but I should still be a talented genius with the potential to become an Emperor, right?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the panel again: [Race: Sacred Spirit - Stone Sacred Spirit]. Not a [Celestial Gold Sacred Spirit], just the most common [Stone Sacred Spirit], and without any accompanying celestial or sacred materials. To be precise, there are no accompanying items at all, except for the accompanying scriptures he will comprehend and simulate. Otherwise, he might not even have any accompanying scriptures.</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation aptitude, if roughly divided by special physique, there are four levels:</p><p></p><p>The first level is the Chaos Body and the Innate Saint Body, which can achieve Dao-Fruition just by being alive.</p><p></p><p>The second level is the Imperial Son who can enter another path of Dao-Fruition, the first generation of Saint Body and Overlord Body, and the Innate Dao Fetus.</p><p></p><p>The third level is the Yin Body, Yang Body, and Elementalist Body, which have the potential to become an Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The fourth level is the Godly King Body, Radiant Body, and Brahma War Body, which can be directly promoted to the Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I can only be considered the bottom of the third level. If I can't achieve perfect birth, I'll have to drop down another level," Xiong Mo murmured. "Do my best and leave it to fate. Hopefully, I can create the Supplementing the Heavens technique before being dug out."</p><p></p><p>After all, 10,000 years of undisturbed cultivation is much more likely to nurture a perfect birth than 1 million years.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo began to sense the compatibility of various Dao with himself, searching for the most suitable cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>"First, the path of Fighting and Battling is excluded, as I've never fought with anyone my whole life. Now that I've become a Sacred Spirit, even if I have talent, it won't be too high." Xiong Mo thought of the Fighting Saint Emperor who had to consume Longevity Immortal Pills to live a second life before achieving Dao-Fruition. "Moreover, the direction of Fighting and Battling may not match the Supplementing the Heavens technique."</p><p></p><p>"What about the path of Transformation?" Transformation is the cultivation direction of Goddess NÃ¼wa, who achieved Dao-Fruition through Transformation and left the legend of Supplementing the Heavens, proving the power of the Transformation Dao. But after sensing the rhythm of the Transformation Dao, Xiong Mo directly gave up. "No, the Transformation Dao is too vast for me at the moment."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about learning the Self-Nature Dao cultivated by Li Ruoyu?" The Self-Nature Dao can also be compatible with the Supplementing the Heavens technique. Xiong Mo expanded his perception to the entire valley, calming his mind and carefully experiencing the rhythm of the Self-Nature Dao.</p><p></p><p>After carefully contemplating the Self-Nature Dao for three days, Xiong Mo had to give up. "Cultivating the Self-Nature Dao is too time-consuming. And without Li Ruoyu's state of mind, the possibility of reaching the Emperor Realm is not very high."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, it's almost impossible to choose an already known path that can directly reach the Emperor Realm," Xiong Mo thought from a different angle. "Now I need to take a path that has a similar effect to the Supplementing the Heavens technique, and then simulate my own Supplementing the Heavens technique. The path doesn't need to be that strong, as it's just for preparing in case I can't achieve perfect birth and continue my cultivation. And in the future, if I have the opportunity, I can still refine my path."</p><p></p><p>"Then, it's decided. You are the one!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Earth. The principle of the Dao of Earth nurturing the vitality of all things should not be a problem. "Xiong Mo felt the rhythmic Dao of Earth around him and began to gain insights into the vitality and nurturing aspects of the Dao of Earth.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years passed, and Xiong Mo created the Wheel Sea Scriptures based on the Dao of Earth as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo used his essence qi to open up the Bitter Sea. Unlike other special constitutions, this Bitter Sea was a deep ochre color, with occasional flashes of brown light, and there were no traces of the Wheel of Life.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a large amount of essence qi flooded into the Bitter Sea, causing its range to continuously expand. Soon, the Source of Life sprang forth, and the Divine Bridge was also erected high, leading to the other shore of the Bitter Sea. Xiong Mo swiftly overcame all the obstacles and rushed towards the gate of the Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>However, Xiong Mo did not rush into the Dao Palace. It was not only because the Dao Palace Scriptures had not yet been created, but also to solidify his foundation, expand the range of the Bitter Sea as much as possible, and break the divine patterns within his Bitter Sea, allowing the Wheel Sea Realm to reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>After another two hundred years, when the Bitter Sea reached its current limit, Xiong Mo stepped into the Dao Palace and, based on the Dao Palace Scriptures he had deduced, began the cultivation of the first Divine Treasure - the Spleen Divine Treasure. In the following fifty years, he successively opened and cultivated the remaining four Divine Treasures using the Five Elements mutual generation method.</p><p></p><p>After the five major Divine Treasures in the Dao Palace were perfected, Xiong Mo did not continue to deduce the scriptures of the Four Extremes Realm, but instead silently looked at the god-like statues in the Dao Palace, which were like clay sculptures.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo did not know where the problem lay. The Dao Palace gods of other people were chanting scriptures, and they could even walk out of the Dao Palace to become avatars when necessary. But Xiong Mo's gods could only be clay statues without any function.</p><p></p><p>"These gods are useless, let's refine them."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo immediately deduced a solution with the highest feasibility and cost-effectiveness: the clay statue gods were beyond saving, but they could be refined into essences and fused into the Dao Palace to enhance its quality.</p><p></p><p>"Really refine them? Okay." Xiong Mo had a headache, and then began to rebuild the Dao Palace Realm. After fusing the gods into the Dao Palace, he carefully sculpted and upgraded the Dao Palace as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>It took a full hundred years for the Dao Palace Realm to finally reach its current limit, and Xiong Mo began to deduce the scriptures of the Four Extremes.</p><p></p><p>Due to the need to take into account the Supplementing the Heavens Technique, the difficulty of the deduction began to soar. Not only did the time become longer, but it also started to stall. Finally, Xiong Mo's comprehension of the Dao principles caught up, allowing him to continue the deduction.</p><p></p><p>It took a full five hundred years, and on this day, the deduction of the Four Extremes Scriptures was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" Four great pillars rose up to support the heavens. That's right, Xiong Mo did not cultivate the Four Extremes separately, but all together. The four pillars supporting the heavens, and the Four Extremes Realm could reach its limit within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years, Xiong Mo began the initial creation of the Transforming into a Dragon Scriptures. The Transforming into a Dragon Realm was different from the Wheel Sea, Dao Palace, and Four Extremes. Its importance was second only to the Immortal Platform. During the Dao Attainment, this great dragon would connect the Wheel Sea, Dao Palace, and Four Extremes, and rush into the Immortal Platform. It can be said that this was the connection point of the five major realms. Whether the five major realms could be unified depended largely on it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

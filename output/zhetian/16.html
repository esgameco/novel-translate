        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for the old Earth Dao, hmm, it also has a mysterious light and Dao rhythm. But compared to the new Earth Dao, it's really not even worth comparing! Xiong Mo looked at the new Earth Dao and the old Earth Dao that had been derived, and was silent for a while, unable to help but curse out loud: "Damn it! No wonder! The difference is too big! No wonder Senior Brother Lingbao said I might not even have reached the first prohibition before. This is really true!"</p><p></p><p>"That little bastard Hu Yuan must have been laughing his ass off in his heart when I was lecturing on the scriptures, right?!" Thinking of this possibility, Xiong Mo wished he could cover his face and find a hole to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>Floating in this gloomy space that seemed like the end of all things were three stars emitting light. They were like normal stars in the universe, forming a small stellar system and bringing a touch of other colors to this space.</p><p></p><p>These stars were the manifestations of Xiong Mo's Dao path.</p><p></p><p>The star at the center of this stellar system, like the sun, was a star of a mysterious yellow color that also flashed with a deep blue luster - this represented the new Earth Dao. The one closest to the mysterious yellow star, constantly revolving around it, was a gray-yellow star continuously murmuring - that was the rather Cthulhu-esque Dao path. The last one, emitting an earthy yellow color, represented the old Earth Dao; its light was relatively dim, far away from the gray-yellow star, orbiting towards the central star.</p><p></p><p>After regaining his senses, Xiong Mo looked at the mysterious yellow star in this small stellar system and sighed, "This Dao is definitely on the same level as Senior Brother Lingbao's current path, and with my cheat, it should be able to pull my combat power up to the eighth prohibition without any problem! Even if it's a divine prohibition, I can still make it through with some effort!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the different Dao rhythms emanating from the three stars, Xiong Mo couldn't help but say, "I have to give these three Dao paths a name. Even though they are all based on the Earth Dao, the differences are now quite large."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the rather Cthulhu-esque gray-yellow star, he sighed and continued, "As for this one..."</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious yellow one can be called the Mysterious Yellow Dao, since the Dao has undergone adjustments. The earthy yellow one can still be called the Earth Dao. This gray-yellow one..."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo was a bit conflicted.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Esoteric Dao for now."</p><p></p><p>"Next is the cultivation of secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Manifest."</p><p></p><p>Everything Xiong Mo knew, had seen, and understood manifested, even the legends and stories from his previous life. They formed a dense swarm of tens of thousands of meteors, ultimately forming a meteor belt at the outermost edge of this stellar system.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start with the Heart Sutra Secret."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a meteor representing the Heart Sutra Secret fell into Xiong Mo's palm, and then he took a deep breath and, wielding the authority of the Creator, once again evolved the Extreme Destitution Version of the Heavenly Heart Imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Add in some calculations from the 'Northern Dipper Sutra' to predict the future."</p><p></p><p>"Also add in some theories from the 'Plum Blossom Easy Numbers'."</p><p></p><p>"Incorporate all the theories of the Five Elements, Six Harmonies, Seven Stars, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces."</p><p></p><p>"Throw in some concepts related to time, space, fate, and causality."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, add in some concepts from 'Below the One' and 'The Great Luo Observation'?"</p><p></p><p>"Also include some from the 'Source Celestial Book'?" Indeed, it was the 'Source Celestial Book'. Xiong Mo was amazed that the Profound Origin Sect had the inheritance of this Arcane Venerable, even if it was only a quarter of the complete version.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, Senior Brother Lingbao's 'Character Sutra'! Although this secret technique hasn't reached the Celestial Venerable level yet, it's enough!"</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Destitution Version of the Heavenly Heart Imprint in his palm began to evolve. First, the main supporting Dao path of the entire secret technique was updated, changing from earthy yellow to mysterious yellow. Then, from...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This path extended and various sacred Dao principles began to intertwine and re-weave the imprint.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the weaving was completed. The new bankruptcy version of the Heavenly Heart Imprint was mainly in a yellowish-black color, with occasional flashes of azure light around it.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the brighter imprint in his palm and said, "The Heart Sutra 2.0 version is complete."</p><p></p><p>Placing this imprint into the Xuanhuang Dao Star, with the fluctuation of consciousness, the imprint at the Immortal Platform of the body was also updated. The utilization capability of the [Gray Mist Space] was further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the cultivation scripture."</p><p></p><p>Under the glow of the small star system, the five major secret realms were fully manifested within him.</p><p></p><p>"With the Xuanhuang Dao as the main trunk, and Elder Lingbao's 'Lingbao Scripture' as a reference, other scriptures will be used as supplements, and the derivation begins."</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The manifested five major secret realms instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, it collapsed already?!" A puzzled expression spread across Xiong Mo's face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the derivation sequence was wrong." After failing a few more times, he finally realized the problem.</p><p></p><p>"The secret realms that manifested were purely of the Earth Dao, so I need to first evolve this pure Earth Dao into the Xuanhuang Dao." As he spoke, the evolution began.</p><p></p><p>"After stabilizing it, I'll refer to Elder Lingbao's scripture to open the 'gates' in my body." Numerous light dots began to appear all over his body, symbolizing the 'gates' being opened, revealing endless light within, as if filled with boundless creation.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, add beneficial elements from other scriptures." The scriptures of the five major secret realms began to take shape.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiong Mo narrowed his eyes, suddenly wanting to add something bold, since the outline of the Xuanhuang Dao scripture was already formed.</p><p></p><p>"First, set the main tone, with the Xuanhuang Dao as the leading principle."</p><p></p><p>"Add in the 'Yinshu', 'Dao De Jing', 'Nanhua Jing', 'Huangting Jing', 'Wenshijing', 'Huangshigong Shu', and other Daoist scriptures I've seen before."</p><p></p><p>"Concepts like Yang Shen, Fragmentation, Nirvana, Reincarnation, Mundane Realm, Light, Feathered Transformation, Longevity, Time, etc. will all be incorporated."</p><p></p><p>"Concepts like the Causes of Fruition, the Foundations of Existence, the Ends of Conclusion, and the Upper Narrative also go in."</p><p></p><p>The meaning and principles of the scripture underwent subtle but important modifications.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the 'Xuanhuang Scripture' was completed.</p><p></p><p>"The scripture of the Xuanhuang Dao, naturally it's called the 'Xuanhuang Scripture', and the previous Earth Dao scripture would be the 'Earth Dao Scripture'."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the 'Xuanhuang Scripture' with a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Although those concepts like the Causes of Fruition, the Foundations of Existence, the Ends of Conclusion, and the Upper Narrative are almost impossible to realize at the Human Dao stage, but with these concepts as ideals, this scripture must have the potential for Dao Attainment!"</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuanhuang-colored star had grown larger after the 'Xuanhuang Scripture' was produced, indicating that the Xuanhuang Dao had been strengthened and perfected.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, it's the Supplementing the Heavens Technique, which is simple."</p><p></p><p>Since he had already derived this scripture using the Earth Dao, he only needed to transform the inherent Earth Dao into the Xuanhuang Dao, and then make some adjustments to the scripture.</p><p></p><p>"But I'll still add some extra ingredients."</p><p></p><p>"Incorporate concepts like Supplementing the Heavens, Rebirth, Restoration, Longevity Extension, Nirvana, Repair, and Incantations."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the meteorite formed from the scripture and said, "The Supplementing the Heavens Technique scripture modification is complete!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, an uncle with slightly chubby cheeks, as if full of experience, walked up to Hu Yuan. This uncle was the appearance of Xiong Mo's past life, a manifestation formed by his primordial spirit and numerical symbols.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation? Didn't Sect Brother Lingbao have a formation? Just use the heart symbol secret to connect to the power of the universe and go into idle cultivation mode.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, can Sect Brother Hu Yuan accompany me on a walk on this life star?" The manifestation of Xiong Mo asked Hu Yuan. According to the seniority, Xiong Mo was the junior disciple of the sixth generation inheritor of the Dongxuan Sect, while Hu Yuan was his senior.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan narrowed his eyes, as if warning Xiong Mo not to cause any more trouble, then said, "Certainly, Junior Sect Brother Shengren, please come with me."</p><p></p><p>He led Xiong Mo out of the forbidden land, and after a distance, they arrived at a huge square. This square was built with massive stone materials, with large and small jade platforms distributed within. From time to time, teams from the sect would step onto the jade platforms and be teleported away, maintaining silence throughout. An indescribable solemn atmosphere permeated the comings and goings.</p><p></p><p>"These are the teleportation platforms leading to the sect's resource points," Hu Yuan stood on a black jade platform and pointed to the ones closer to the center.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the ones on the side?" Xiong Mo asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The one we're standing on now is the teleportation platform to a mortal city on the Dongxuan Star," he pointed directly at the jade platform beneath them, which had the number 'Ding-45' written on it.</p><p></p><p>"The platforms with the 'Jia' character are the dedicated teleportation points to the outer frontiers, which cannot be used without special circumstances or approval. 'Yi' is the resource point on the Dongxuan Star, where some spiritual herbs and sources are teleported back to the sect."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan then pointed to a platform near them.</p><p></p><p>"'Bing' is used to locate and teleport to unexplored areas within the Dongxuan Star, which is how the sect's exploration teams find resources."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the teleportation is about to begin." After briefly introducing the teleportation square, Hu Yuan took a deep breath and began to form hand seals, inputting array patterns into the jade platform beneath them.</p><p></p><p>After a flash of bright light and violent spatial fluctuations, Hu Yuan and Xiong Mo appeared in front of a grand hall. The plaque on the hall read - Dongxuan.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what teleportation feels like?" Xiong Mo was truly fascinated. In his past life, he had taken planes and high-speed trains, but never experienced teleportation. Now, this sensation was quite peculiar to him.</p><p></p><p>"Do people get motion sickness from teleportation?" Xiong Mo couldn't help but think about this. In his past life, there were those who got motion sickness on planes, ships, and cars, so it would be normal to have people who get teleportation sickness as well.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Hu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan: "..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hu Yuan's slightly pale face, Xiong Mo got his answer.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Brother Hu Yuan, is this the sect's foothold in the mortal world?" Xiong Mo tactfully changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Junior Sect Brother Shengren, would you like to go take a look at the mortal city first?" Hu Yuan hurriedly stepped out of the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xiong Mo had no objections, and was even a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the glow of the setting sun, the night market in the city began to light up, with waves of hawking voices ringing out around them. Looking towards a tall, red-lacquered building in the distance, a group of heavily made-up young women started beckoning to passersby.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo, gazing at the bustling city, couldn't help but sigh, "This feels so different from our Dongxuan Sect." He then looked at the red building in the distance and asked Hu Yuan, "Sect Brother Hu Yuan, what is that red building?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what place that is?" Xiong Mo asked Hu Yuan with a pair of clear and simple eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's the 'Crimson Red Pavilion', that's a place for..." Hu Yuan suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p></p><p>The "Crimson Red Pavilion" is a genuine brothel, spread across the cities of various dynasties in the mortal realm, and it also has a certain reputation in the cultivation circle.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xiong Mo's gaze, Hu Yuan had already realized something.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Saint Xiong Mo is a holy spirit, and he hasn't been born yet. So even though his current incarnation is already an uncle, Saint Xiong Mo seems to not have reached adulthood yet? Oh, he hasn't been born yet, after all, he's still in the stone embryo and hasn't come out."</p><p></p><p>"Sss~"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Hu Yuan sucked in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>Uh-oh, now how is he going to explain this to this underage saint?</p><p></p><p>In the place where Hu Yuan couldn't see, Xiong Mo revealed a mischievous smile and said, "What is it used for?"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo naturally guessed what kind of place it was, even though in his previous life he was a good middle-aged man without any bad habits like gambling or drugs, he still had some common sense. But now that he had come to this ancient era, he naturally wanted to see what this brothel was like.</p><p></p><p>However, it would be better for his senior Hu Yuan to say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, it's used for 'enlightenment'." Hu Yuan said with a red face, stammering.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Enlightenment? Then let's go in and take a look." Xiong Mo said happily, and quickly walked towards the Crimson Red Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a young girl heavily made up standing at the entrance of the high-rise building and already starting to chat with his saint junior, Hu Yuan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>If Xiong Mo the saint learned something bad here, he wouldn't be able to take responsibility for it.</p><p></p><p>He immediately rushed up and pulled him away from the Crimson Red Pavilion, and began to explain, "As a saint, your cultivation level has already surpassed the need for enlightenment here."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, your explanation is really a bit far-fetched." Xiong Mo criticized him.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan ignored his criticism and quickly changed the topic, "The 'Food Street' is just ahead, junior can experience the food of the mortals there."</p><p></p><p>As they walked into the street, accompanied by a sea of people, the fragrance of food also wafted into their noses.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the various snack shops lining the street, and his vision became blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, I want to eat this!" A young version of Xiong Mo pulled his mother's hand, pointing to the egg tarts in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Dad will go buy a few for little Mo." The mother said to the middle-aged man behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The father responded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the little Xiong Mo happily exclaimed as he saw his father bring back the egg tarts, and began to eat them. The mother and father stood by, watching the Xiong Mo in front of them eating the egg tarts, and smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the endless stream of adults bringing their children to buy snacks, the beautiful memories of his previous life with his family seemed to be replaying like a black and white movie in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a long dragon with drums and gongs began to weave through the crowd, passing in front of Xiong Mo, and entered the fragrant food street. These people were wearing red robes, holding high lanterns embroidered with the character "Fu" (blessing), and occasionally scattering red papers filled with blessings, letting them fly away with the wind.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

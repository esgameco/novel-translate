        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Xiong Mo junior brother, we should return to the sect now," Ling Bao said after receiving a jade slip that flew down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to learn more, you can ask the people in the sect," Ling Bao said, and then directly used a formation to split open the entire valley.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the underground dragon vein or Xiong Mo's main body, they were all floating in the air, becoming a floating small mountain. Ling Bao directly carried the small mountain and flew towards the Dongxuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a mountain range extending for hundreds of miles appeared before their eyes. Shrouded in mist, with pavilions surrounding the mountains. Occasionally, disciples would rise up on their swords, soaring into the clouds. What a magnificent scene of a sacred immortal land! Ling Bao flew towards the highest peak. There were already people waiting there. Taking a closer look, they were Lü Yao and the others who had discovered the place where Xiong Mo was gestating.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the forbidden area at the mountain top," Ling Bao looked at them, nodded, and then led the way towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the mountain top, one could see a scene of dragon qi rising, source energy condensing, and intersecting formation patterns. It could be guessed that the dragon veins of the Dongxuan Sect and the rare source energy were mostly stored here.</p><p></p><p>"Come!" </p><p></p><p>Ling Bao made a spiritual seal in the center of the forbidden area, instantly grasping the eight small dragon veins of the forbidden area, the small mountain beside him, and a large amount of source energy, condensing them into a sacred formation, and then sinking them underground.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo immediately sensed the influx of powerful earth vein energy and the fusion of various source energies, and his gestating speed increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>If it would have taken about a million years for the natural gestation of a sacred spirit to reach completion, then with Ling Bao's extraordinary formation and Xiong Mo's own cultivation, it would only take five hundred thousand years for Xiong Mo to reach completion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Ling Bao's mastery of formations is truly impressive! No wonder he is the future Ling Bao Venerable who can create one of the Nine Secrets," Xiong Mo thought, amazed by the incredible power of the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I have other matters to attend to, I'll be leaving first," Ling Bao completed the formation and inserted a jade talisman into Xiong Mo's body, then immediately flew away.</p><p></p><p>At this point, only Lü Yao and the others remained in the forbidden area on the mountain top with Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>After a period of silence, Xiong Mo could no longer bear the awkwardness and used the jade talisman to project his spiritual consciousness outward.</p><p></p><p>This jade talisman was the formation control device left by Ling Bao for Xiong Mo. Not only did it have the function of projecting Xiong Mo's spiritual consciousness to communicate with others, but it could also control this entire sacred formation to assist in his cultivation. Of course, this was also a restriction Ling Bao placed on Xiong Mo, to prevent him from causing chaos in the Dongxuan Sect after he was born.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Elders," Xiong Mo greeted them first. Xiong Mo did not want to ruin the relationship, as he still needed to cultivate in the sect in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sacred Spirit," Lü Yao and the others responded. In fact, they also felt quite awkward, after all, they were the culprits behind Xiong Mo being captured by Ling Bao.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the atmosphere becoming increasingly awkward, Xiong Mo quickly found a topic. "You can call me by my name, Xiong Mo. Can you please tell me more about the sect? Ling Bao senior brother only gave me a general overview, mainly about the origin of the corpse calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Xiong Mo Sacred One," Elder Lü Yao began. "Our sect is currently in a state of preparedness, with everything centered around the corpse calamity that you have learned about."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the corpse calamity, the atmosphere immediately became more serious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To guard against the calamity of the undead, we have built a divine city in the outer realm and used it as a wall to defend against them. We generally call this the frontline. Our top combat forces are all stationed there."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the sect is divided into three halls and four peaks, a total of seven lineages. The three halls are the Elixir Hall, the Artifact Hall, and the Formation Hall. These three halls are currently putting in their full effort to collect combat supplies and accumulate foundations, transporting them to the frontline. We elders belong to these three halls," Lü Yao gestured to himself and the people around him.</p><p></p><p>"The four peaks are the Divine Empyrean Peak, the White Cloud Peak, the Thick Mountain Peak, and the Vast Water Peak. These four peaks are specifically responsible for combat. Most of their disciples and all of their elders have gone to the outer realm to defend against the calamity, and those who have returned to the sect are here to recover from their wounds. But, the majority of them have not been able to withstand it and have died in battle directly."  Lü Yao and the group couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Since the sect was rebuilt on the Profound Star, none of us have been able to live out our natural lifespans. Regardless of which lineage."</p><p></p><p>"Because once the frontline is breached, the undead will flood into the Profound Star and slaughter indiscriminately. So, when necessary, the elders from the three halls must also go to the frontline to fight." As he said this, Lü Yao couldn't help but touch the scar on his chest, still fearful.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this, we must also tell the Venerable Xiong Mo about the event thirty-five years ago when the divine city was breached," Fu Li, who was standing next to Lü Yao, suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"The reason was that at that time, there was a corpse of a Xian Five Saint King that attacked the city, and we did not detect it in advance. After fending it off for a day, the city was breached. If it weren't for the Venerable Lingbao breaking through from Xian Three to Xian Four during the battle, the Profound Sect might not even exist now. Of course, many of us sacrificed ourselves to protect the Venerable Lingbao's breakthrough, including but not limited to his own master."</p><p></p><p>"So the combat forces available to the sect have been greatly reduced. And we, the Xian Tai realm elders of the three halls, will soon be heading to the frontline to guard against the next onslaught of the undead." Fu Li pulled Hu Yuan in front of Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Young Hu's cultivation talent is not that great, but his talent in the Dao of Formation is not bad. He has the ability to enter the forbidden land. If the Saint has any matters, he may need to communicate with Young Hu."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xiong Mo, we shall take our leave now." The group bowed to Xiong Mo and quickly left the forbidden land. It was clear that Hu Yuan had been thrown out by the elders to deal with Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>Only one person and one Saint Spirit remained in the place.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xiong Mo, is there anything you would like me to do?" Hu Yuan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo was silent for a while, gazing thoughtfully at this middle-aged uncle who had come with a divination compass to find him. His mood was incomparably complex. "What scriptures would be suitable for me? Tell me."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo had a fairly clear understanding of himself. The Venerable Lingbao, who had just recognized him as a junior, had brought him back to the Profound Sect because he valued Xiong Mo's Xian Four Saint realm cultivation and combat power, which was the only one other than his own.</p><p></p><p>It was foreseeable that in the future, Venerable Lingbao would leave the Profound Star to enhance his own strength and seek a solution to the undead calamity. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, this nascent Saint Spirit that I am nurturing has become a guarantee for Lingbao to protect the Profound Star.</p><p></p><p>So while there are no major events happening, it's best to quickly use the sect's scriptures to supplement my foundations, and then rely on the Saint Formation just laid down in the forbidden land and abundant spiritual resources to strive to improve my cultivation and combat power. When the crisis of the Profound Sect arrives, I will have to break through the stone cocoon and fight the undead calamity myself.</p><p></p><p>As for when I will emerge to fight, that will depend on my luck.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Watching his senior Ling Bao start to cover the entire forbidden land with a layer of spiritual source and begin to set up a formation using the secret of character arrangement, Xiong Mo was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ling Bao, where did you get so many resources?"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual source was so abundant that it dazzled the eyes. The resources in the Mythological Era were more than in the Covering Heaven Era, but it shouldn't be this exaggerated, right?</p><p></p><p>"Shortly after I broke through to the Immortal Saint Realm, I was caught in a spatial turbulence while cultivating in the starry sky, and when I broke free of the turbulence, I accidentally discovered a Chaotic Immortal Land." As Ling Bao spoke, he revealed a quality that Xiong Mo had only ever sensed from wealthy patrons before.</p><p></p><p>This was the aura of a big shot!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ling Bao, can you give your junior some material support as well?" Xiong Mo's instincts from his previous profession were immediately activated, and he almost didn't need to think before voicing his request.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Ling Bao continued his actions, constantly casting array patterns and combining them with the original sacred array in the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ling Bao, can you give me some Xuanhuang Qi?" Xiong Mo immediately stated his need.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the Chaotic Immortal Land is a precious land, a small world that can exist independently in the Chaos. If the land has not been discovered and exploited by previous people, one can find a large amount of immortal gold or first-class immortal resources within, such as Chaotic Stones, Xuanhuang Mother Qi, and even priceless treasures like Immortal Light or Longevity Essence that can extend the lifespan of Dao Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>With enough auspicious fortune, one might even discover an immortal divine medicine in the Chaotic Immortal Land that can let a person be reborn. After all, the Chaotic Immortal Land is the best growth place for many immortal divine medicines.</p><p></p><p>As long as one has enough auspicious fortune and ability to find the Chaotic Immortal Land, and high enough cultivation to extract its resources, one can definitely raise their worth to the ceiling of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, Ling Bao, who had reached the Immortal Saint Realm, had at least excavated half of that Chaotic Immortal Land, if not emptied it completely. Xiong Mo now understood where the four immortal swords and the array diagrams got their immortal materials from.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Qi that Xiong Mo wanted is the first wisp of life energy born at the dawn of heaven and earth, containing the Dao of life and death. It is a material that can be used to forge quasi-emperor weapons. And this material must exist in the Chaotic Immortal Land, as it is also a small world capable of producing immortal materials.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's eyes were practically glowing now. If Senior Ling Bao could give him the Xuanhuang Qi, he would be overjoyed. He could fuse it into his own weapons after his rebirth, greatly increasing their hardness and giving him an advantage in future battles, while also benefiting his own Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Here." After finishing the sacred array, Ling Bao directly gave Xiong Mo an arm-thick strand of Xuanhuang Mother Qi.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's physical body was frantically craving the Xuanhuang-colored, wispy substance, as if it wanted to take root in the space.</p><p></p><p>"This is Xuanhuang Mother Qi! Senior Ling Bao is so generous!" Xiong Mo immediately made the judgment.</p><p></p><p>Due to the shift and change in his Dao, his main cultivation path had now transitioned from the pure Earth Dao to the Xuanhuang Dao. This wispy substance gave him a feeling as if the Xuanhuang Grand Dao was manifesting in the universe. Intuitively, it seemed that as long as he immediately fused this Xuanhuang Mother Qi into his body, he could directly upgrade on the spot to the level of an Immortal Material Saint Spirit!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dark yellow mother qi floating beside the stone body made Xiong Mo involuntarily swallow his saliva. He really wanted to eat that thing.</p><p></p><p>But he restrained himself!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Lingbao, could you please help me again?" He trusted his intuition, but now he trusted his Senior Brother Lingbao even more.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lingbao did not know what Xiong Mo was thinking at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please take a look at the latest scriptures I've created." Suppressing his desire for the dark yellow mother qi, his spiritual body left his physical body and wrote all the new scriptures in the void.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Elder Hu Yuan and Senior Brother Lingbao's attention was immediately focused on the scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Their review of the scriptures was quickly completed.</p><p></p><p>Elder Hu Yuan was dumbfounded, feeling that these scriptures could rival the ones left behind by the Saint of the Lingbao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not as wide and broad as mine, it has already surpassed me in terms of exquisiteness," Senior Brother Lingbao praised.</p><p></p><p>"I understand your current situation, Junior Brother. You now want to merge with this dark yellow mother qi to enhance your physical body, but you're afraid that the merger will create obstacles for your future path, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Brother Lingbao, do you have any solutions?" Xiong Mo nodded immediately, as Lingbao had hit the nail on the head.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it were just this, he might not have forcibly restrained his body's desire for the dark yellow mother qi. But there was a second reason that made Xiong Mo have to hold back.</p><p></p><p>It was undeniable that the Great Dao of the Mythological Era was somewhat lacking compared to the Great Dao of the Chaotic Ancient Era. This was because the will of the Dharma-Ending Age had directly cut off most of the Immortal Dao principles. Nowadays, most materials no longer contain Immortal Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>This is a good thing for those with extraordinary talent and aspirations to walk the Immortal Path in the Mundane World.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Immortal in the Mundane World is to live through one life after another until the ninth life, at which point they will ascend to immortality. According to Xiong Mo's understanding, the main methods for cultivators to live through the second life are to directly consume immortality elixirs or accumulate immortal spiritual essence within their bodies for transformation.</p><p></p><p>Living through the second life by consuming immortality elixirs cannot be repeated. Similarly, in the nine lives of transformation, the same method cannot be used to live through the second life, as this is an inviolable law.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Emperor who cultivated in the Chaotic Ancient Era was transformed from the Chaos Qing Lotus by consuming an immortality elixir. He was also bound by his own footsteps and could not use other immortality elixirs to live through the second life.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo guessed that these methods would all cause some Immortal Dao principles to arise within his body. But since he had not yet ascended to immortality, he could not fully comprehend or control these principles. The failure of some cultivators' transformations might be due to the conflicts of the Immortal Dao principles within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The great emperor in the future, who failed in one of his lives and had his body explode, might have been due to this reason.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this dark yellow mother qi originated from the Immortal Realm of Chaos, and it must contain Immortal Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he greedily merged with this dark yellow mother qi now, it would create obstacles when he tries to live through the second life in the future using his own methods. If he could not live through the second life by consuming immortality elixirs or using some other method, and the Immortal Dao principles conflicted, it would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

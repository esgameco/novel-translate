        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo really didn't expect things to develop this way. He had thought his incubation would be interrupted and he would be forced to be born prematurely. But unexpectedly, the situation took a turn, and suddenly a sage appeared and invited him to join his sect.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I agree." In fact, there was no other choice, as this valley had already been discovered. Now agreeing to the young man's conditions was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, you can call me Xiong Mo. I don't know how Shixiong would like to be addressed?" Xiong Mo was not stupid, since joining this young man's sect was now a fact, he must try to get as many benefits as possible. This young man could let him, a holy spirit, join without going through the approval of the other members of the sect, so his identity must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, looking at this young man's youthful vital energy, his age definitely does not exceed two hundred years! A saint-level cultivator around two hundred years old! He must be a formidable future contender for the Dao Tribulation! The time to latch onto him has come! Thinking about this, Xiong Mo got excited.</p><p></p><p>The young man's mouth twitched, obviously not expecting the wild holy spirit Xiong Mo to say such opportunistic words. The young man thought for a moment, but still decided to accept this holy spirit as his junior brother. After all, he was the only saint-level cultivator in the sect, and his master had passed away long ago, so no one would object.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi Xiong Mo can call me Lingbao, which is my Dao name." Shixiong Lingbao responded, then threw a transmission jade talisman into the air to notify the sect of his decision.</p><p></p><p>"Lingbao? Isn't that the Dao name of a Celestial Lord? Isn't he afraid of offending the taboo by using such a name?" Xiong Mo muttered to himself inwardly. "The era of Celestial Lord Lingbao was very dangerous, although there was no dark turmoil, but there was the Corpse Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong Lingbao, can you tell me what the outside world is like? The laws of heaven and earth have only told me limited information." Xiong Mo continued to verify his inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lingbao did not know what Xiong Mo was thinking in his heart. After all, the people in the sect were still handling affairs, and it would take some time to clean up that forbidden land, so there was no harm in chatting with this Shidi Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first talk about the situation of our sect. Our sect is called the Dongxuan Sect, and it is the only sect on this Life Star. So this Life Star is also called the Dongxuan Star."</p><p></p><p>"Because I recently became a Saint, I am the only Saint-level cultivator on this Dongxuan Star besides you, Shidi." As Lingbao said this, his words also paused for a moment, glancing at the stone cocoon where Xiong Mo was still in.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't manage the sect now, all the sects under the Dongxuan Sect still revere me as their supreme leader." Lingbao truthfully stated the current situation of the sect.</p><p></p><p>"And the Dongxuan Star is located in a remote area of the universe. It can now be said to be one of the few paradises in the universe." As Lingbao said this, his expression began to darken.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you say that?" Xiong Mo quickly asked. The information Lingbao revealed was a bit frightening!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... You'll have to ask the Underworld Emperor and those Supremes!" Lingbao revealed a trace of killing intent when mentioning the Underworld Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of situation would make the remote areas of the universe become a paradise? Of course, it must be that a great crisis threatening the entire universe has occurred!" Lingbao's killing intent kept surging, obviously furious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Underworld Emperor attained the Dao, he has been doing something with those Supremes regarding the method of becoming an immortal. There's nothing wrong with cultivating immortality, but after the Underworld Emperor proposed the theory of burying one's body in a great tomb after death to form a Reincarnation Seal in order to become an immortal, and made some progress in it...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The situation has spiraled out of control." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> "At that time, countless people responded to the Mingzun's immortality technique. They buried themselves in the great tombs before their deaths, using the immortality techniques passed down by Mingzun and those supreme beings, hoping to become immortal after death! The disaster was thus sown! Now, those who used the immortality techniques passed down by Mingzun and those supreme beings, or rather the corpses, have crawled out of the great tombs they built themselves!"</p><p></p><p>"After these corpses crawled out, they instinctively attacked the living, killing them and absorbing their life force to enhance their own cultivation. And because these great tombs were mostly built in places with abundant spiritual energy, most of the life origin stars in the center of the universe have now become wastelands!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, after these corpses have absorbed the life force of an entire life origin star, they will not stop their actions. As long as they have the means or ability to travel to other origin stars, they will go to other realms of life to slaughter and devour the life force of other living beings, becoming even more powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Mingzun and those supreme beings have caused this disaster, but they do not go to quell it, and now they cannot be found. Probably they have retreated into the forbidden lands."</p><p></p><p>"The universe is thus caught in a vicious cycle, with the tide of corpses spreading everywhere. And this disaster is called the Corpse Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Xuanwu Sect comes from the Beidou Star Domain, a life origin star called Kaiyang. Two thousand years ago, our sect on the Kaiyang Origin Star was turned into a wasteland by the corpses. Later, the sages led their disciples to flee here, and established the sect again. But due to the heavy damage from this Corpse Calamity, they all attained the Dao soon after the sect was established."</p><p></p><p>"Corpse Calamity?!" Xiong Mo couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Corpse Calamity!" Lingbao's emotions gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo no longer had any illusions. A Dao cultivator named Lingbao, and a disaster called the Corpse Calamity, were telling Xiong Mo: you are now in the mythological era of Zhetian! The senior Lingbao in front of him is very likely the future Lingbao Heavenly Venerable! Thinking about this, Xiong Mo's stone fetus trembled, and the waves of emotion surged within him.</p><p></p><p>Because of excitement. According to what he knows of the future, Lingbao Heavenly Venerable is the savior who will eventually end this disaster! Xiong Mo is now standing at an important juncture of this history! He can witness this glorious and great epic! But also because of fear. The Corpse Calamity will not spare Xiong Mo just because he is a Saint Spirit, but will instead make him the focus of attention like a spotlight on the stage, as the rich life force of a Saint Spirit in the making is very attractive to those corpses. </p><p></p><p>However, looking at the senior Lingbao in front of him, Xiong Mo calmed down. As long as senior Lingbao is here, his life should be safe for now.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the Corpse Calamity has not spread to the Xuanwu Star yet, right?" Xiong Mo asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe!" Lingbao sneered.</p><p></p><p>"How has it not spread here?"</p><p></p><p>"Now, Saint-level corpses led by their leaders keep surging in from the heavens, trying to invade the Life Origin Stars to slaughter the living and absorb their life force. If it were not for the deep foundation of our sect, allowing the elders to wield Saint Weapons and form a great formation in the heavens to block and annihilate these corpses, this place would have long become a wasteland."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

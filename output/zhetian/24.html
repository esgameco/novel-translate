        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo was actually more afraid of not being able to pass the tribulation of the Dao Crossing. Because the heavenly tribulation will escalate with the rise of one's cultivation, and once the physical body becomes immortal material, the peak of the quasi-emperor stage should be able to rival the great saint body. But looking at the future up to the Covering Heaven era, apart from Ye Fengchu, there are no other Dao Crossing cultivators. It's easy to imagine how difficult this tribulation would be.</p><p></p><p>Although being able to rival the cultivation or combat power of the second or third generation Dao Crossing cultivators after passing the tribulation is very tempting, Xiong Mo currently has no confidence in overcoming the "great saint body Dao Crossing tribulation" kind of ordeal. Even the system is not omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>Now Xiong Mo wants to use the Xuanhuang mother qi to improve the quality of his physical body, but he doesn't want this to hinder his Dao Crossing or transformation. Even if these are just guesses, they are enough to make Xiong Mo hesitate for a long time. Fortunately, he has a senior Spiritual Treasure Cultivator who can provide him with some advice.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Treasure senior pondered for a while and replied, "My current cultivation and Dao attainment are not high enough to judge what specific impact it will have on you after you assimilate it. So my advice is not to integrate the Xuanhuang mother qi into your body to enhance your physique."</p><p></p><p>"Then what if I just integrate it into my Dao weapon? Or refine another Dao weapon with it?" Xiong Mo really didn't want to give up this Xuanhuang mother qi, as it was a great opportunity! Not to mention that Xiong Mo could clearly feel that the laws within it were highly compatible with his Xuanhuang Dao, and it would be an important reference for his future path to the quasi-emperor level.</p><p></p><p>A long silence fell in the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo and the Spiritual Treasure senior began to ponder, trying to find the best way to maximize the enhancement of his physical foundation without any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Refine another Dao weapon with it. This method is the safest now," the Spiritual Treasure senior paused and continued, "This way, it can provide some assistance for your Dao path, without any hidden risks that may constrain your own development."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo nodded, "Okay, then please have the Xuanhuang mother qi infused into my immortal aperture. My companion spirit is currently condensing in the Whirlpool Sea, so it cannot be interfered with for now."</p><p></p><p>After a divine incantation, the floating Xuanhuang mother qi was infused into the center of his immortal aperture. Subsequently, a series of sacred Dao laws formed divine patterns, surrounding the Xuanhuang mother qi, allowing all the laws and Dao rhythms within to gather and form a tower.</p><p></p><p>Yes, Xiong Mo wanted to use this large amount of Xuanhuang mother qi to build a treasure tower, a true Xuanhuang Tower! The inspiration came from the Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang Jadeite Tower, the Godly Weapon of the Dao Virtue Heavenlyå°Š. After all, a great figure has already made the Xuanhuang qi into such a powerful weapon, so the final product he creates should not be weak, right?</p><p></p><p>Well, as for the fact that in the future, Ye Fengchu built the Xuanhuang mother qi into a cauldron, which was also very powerful? Xiong Mo felt that he'd better not learn from the future Ye Fengchu, the Heavenly Emperor. Such a precious treasure instrument is not something that a person like him, who is indifferent to the world, can easily wield.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Xiong Mo watched as the abundant divine patterns converged and intertwined, constantly merging into the condensing Xuanhuang mother qi. He knew that the prototype of the Xuanhuang Tower companion spirit had been completed.</p><p></p><p>[Companion Spirit: Xuanhuang Sword (Material: Xuanhuang Dao Stone, in gestation, progress 10%)</p><p>Companion Spirit: Xuanhuang Tower (Material: Xuanhuang Mother Qi, in gestation, progress 1%)]</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the interface, Xiong Mo looked at the Spiritual Treasure senior again.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo said, "Spiritual Treasure senior, when will you leave the Xuanxing Star?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there are still fifty years. Fifty years from now, my cultivation should have broken through to the Immortal Sixth Saint, and only then will I leave the Dongxuan Star," Lingbao smiled at Hu Yuan and continued, "This is already much better than my original plan. In fact, I had the idea of leaving the Dongxuan Star after breaking through to the Immortal Fourth Saint, after all, the corpse calamity is something that must be solved. But at that time, you hadn't found your junior brother Xiong Mo, and I was still troubled about how to handle the frontline defense of the Dongxuan Star."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan followed up on Lingbao Senior Brother's words: "So after finding the Saint Xiong Mo, Senior Brother Lingbao, you plan to have him take over your frontline responsibilities, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lingbao nodded: "Yes, Junior Brother Xiong Mo is a Saint Spirit, and his combat power will be impressive after his cultivation techniques and weapons are perfected. Moreover, he can be considered a prodigy among the Saint Spirits, as the other Saint Spirits cannot cultivate to the level of a peak Immortal Fifth Saint King even after tens of millions of years."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo said cheerfully, "Elder Hu Yuan, I have already reached the third minor realm of the Immortal Fifth Saint King, and have caught up to Senior Brother Lingbao's level. Moreover, my path has been perfected to the Immortal Sixth Great Saint realm. After fully absorbing the divine source left behind by Senior Brother Lingbao in the forbidden land, directly entering the supreme realm of the Great Saint will be no problem at all, after all, unlike you, I don't have to worry about the Heavenly Tribulation for now."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan was truly shocked this time.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo estimated the time internally and said to Senior Brother Lingbao, "I can reach the peak of the Immortal Fifth Saint King in fifty years, and at that time, if I use my divine soul to leave my body and form a divine avatar to fight, I can hold back the newly ascended Immortal Sixth Great Saint corpses, and at the latest, I can reach the supreme realm of the Immortal Sixth Great Saint in three hundred years. Therefore, my combat power is still sufficient, and protecting the Dongxuan Star should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Lingbao can rest assured about the safety of the Dongxuan Star, even if I cannot stop the Immortal Sixth Great Saint corpses three hundred years from now, I can still lead the lives of the Dongxuan Star to retreat calmly," Xiong Mo assured Lingbao.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao nodded again: "Junior Brother Xiong Mo, don't worry, as soon as I find a solution to the corpse calamity, I will return to the Dongxuan Star."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, even if Senior Brother cannot find a solution to the corpse calamity, as long as Lingbao Dao Lord can ascend to the Celestial Venerable within a thousand years, I believe the future problem of the corpse calamity will be completely solvable." Xiong Mo was constantly hinting that Lingbao Senior Brother should hurry up and cultivate to become a Celestial Venerable. He wanted to rely on an even bigger backer.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo spoke to Lingbao Senior Brother in a serious tone for the first time: "If Senior Brother Lingbao cannot find a solution to the corpse calamity or quickly ascend to the Celestial Venerable within a thousand years, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to withstand the tide of corpses at that time."</p><p></p><p>According to the celestial secrets revealed by Xiong Mo's profound connection with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the corpse calamity will reach a peak about a thousand years from now.</p><p></p><p>In the future he knows, the Celestial Venerable Lingbao is a legendary figure not born from any sect. If there were, there would not be no legends about him left in the Covering Heaven era. So it is very likely that by the time Lingbao Celestial Venerable ascends, the Dongxuan Sect has already been disbanded or destroyed, leaving no legends behind.</p><p></p><p>This time, even if Xiong Mo, this butterfly, flaps its wings and stirs up wave after wave of ripples in history, if Senior Brother Lingbao cannot ascend to the Celestial Venerable within a thousand years, he really cannot guarantee that he can influence the original historical trajectory and preserve the Dongxuan Star.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is now at the time node when the tide of the corpse calamity is gradually rising in the era of mythology, the darkest time before the dawn of the apocalypse. According to the calculations, there will be quasi-Emperor-level corpses appearing in a thousand years, and as for what will happen to the Dongxuan Sect in the future, it is truly impossible to foresee.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had never felt the Dao and the Laws to be so close to himself before. In this state, it seemed that even the Immortal Dao Laws could be touched.</p><p></p><p>While the body was striving to maintain this divine prohibition state, the consciousness quickly ascended into the space again.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!" Xiong Mo activated the essence of space and the authority of the Creator.</p><p></p><p>"Simulate - 'Divine Prohibition' as a permanent state!" At this time, Xiong Mo's face was flushed, and a hint of madness appeared in his eyes. The Divine Prohibition was one of the hidden conditions for achieving Dao Attainment! This might be the only chance to foresee and grasp the Divine Prohibition state. Whether he could cross the Eight Prohibitions and reach the Divine Prohibition again in the future was an unknown.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds, one minute, two minutes, three minutes, "Stop." The Divine Prohibition state was released. Five minutes! Xiong Mo's first time reaching the Divine Prohibition had ended!</p><p></p><p>But the simulation was still ongoing, not stopping! One hour later.</p><p></p><p>"It's done! I've succeeded! I can now assist myself in entering the Divine Prohibition again!" A look of ecstatic joy appeared on Xiong Mo's face.</p><p></p><p>He immediately looked at this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>[Secret Technique: Heart Sutra (3.0)</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Created by the Saint Spirit Xiong Mo for the purpose of learning/enlightening the Dao (1.0), supplemented by incorporating most of the inheritance of the Xuanxuan Sect (2.0), can assist in entering the Divine Prohibition (3.0).</p><p></p><p>Abilities:</p><p>1. Heavenly Heart: Connects the external macrocosm's Dao/Laws (passive)</p><p>2. Enlightenment: Increases thought processing ability tenfold, increases insight by one fold (passive)</p><p>3. Unification: Can integrate the five major secret realms to a certain extent (active)</p><p>4. Gather Spirit: Can condense at least 1 unit of "Divine Essence" per day, "Divine Essence" can be accumulated, the daily condensation units depend on the cultivation level (passive)</p><p>5. Ascend to Divinity: Each unit of "Divine Essence" can assist in entering the Divine Prohibition for one minute, and can continue to consume "Divine Essence" to delve deeper into the Divine Prohibition realm while standing in it (active)</p><p>Level: Supreme Saint Pinnacle Secret Technique</p><p>Evaluation: Due to the lack of contact with the Heavenly Heart imprint, the need to supplement more knowledge, and the Dao Laws not being perfected, the secret technique has not reached its limit. But due to the depth and breadth of the concept, it has the potential to reach the pinnacle of the Human Dao in the future. A bug-level Supreme Saint Pinnacle Secret Technique.]</p><p></p><p>That's right, the secret technique that can assist in entering the Divine Prohibition is the "Heart Sutra (3.0)".</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo had failed countless times in the simulation, but finally found a "path" - the Heavenly Heart imprint! Because there was already a rumor in the Mythological Era that those who had attained Dao Realization with the Heavenly Heart imprint could make the Divine Prohibition permanent.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo knew this was true, so as long as he had the Heavenly Heart imprint, entering the Divine Prohibition would be no problem. </p><p></p><p>But the problem now was that Xiong Mo didn't have the Heavenly Heart imprint. No problem, he had the Heart Sutra, which was an extreme limit-breaking version of the Heavenly Heart imprint. Now he just needed to "copy" the Dao and Laws related to the Divine Prohibition and the Heavenly Heart imprint onto his own secret technique.</p><p></p><p>After a series of simulations, the "Heart Sutra (3.0)" was born.</p><p></p><p>With a joyful mood, he looked at the panel that had already undergone a major transformation.</p><p></p><p>————————————</p><p></p><p>Name: Xiong Mo</p><p>Status: Accelerated Incubation (Estimated Remaining Time: 300,000 years)</p><p>Race: Saint Spirit - Xuanhuang Dao Stone Saint Spirit (Unique)</p><p>Companion Weapon: Xuanhuang Sword (Incubating, Progress 1%)</p><p>Cheat: [Gray Mist Space]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo sighed, "It was worth spending so much effort to push the boundaries."</p><p></p><p>The first harvest was that the time required for his complete transformation was greatly shortened, and his post-transformation body began to nurture a companion artifact. Although he did not know whether the companion artifacts of other saints were condensed according to their own will or directly by heaven and earth, Xiong Mo's companion artifact was condensed according to his own will.</p><p></p><p>As for why the companion artifact was a sword? Well, that's a good question! It's because swords are cool. Moreover, Elder Martial Cultivator's weapon is a sword, so he can learn the sword cultivation method from him, saving countless time.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he has pushed the limits of the main scriptures to the maximum he can reach, so he won't have to worry about the path and scriptures for a long time. At least until he reaches the threshold of the Quasi-Emperor realm, he won't have to worry.</p><p></p><p>The last and greatest harvest was the "Heart Sutra Secret".</p><p></p><p>"From now on, as long as I have enough 'divine nature', I can enter the Divine Prohibition realm! The bottleneck on the way to the Quasi-Emperor should no longer be an obstacle for me!" Xiong Mo said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I'm born prematurely in the future, as long as no powerful expert happens to pass by and take offense at me, I can continue to survive until the peak of the Quasi-Emperor realm! As for achieving the Dao, I may have to ask the future Martial Cultivator Celestial Venerable for help."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo had exhausted all his previous accumulations in this round of cultivation. If he wants to have any progress, he'll have to start over slowly.</p><p></p><p>The current round of cultivation has been successfully completed.</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure behind the stone embryo dissipated, and the dispersed saint energy was reclaimed by Xiong Mo. The grand formation gradually reorganized, returning to its original state. The chaotic aura in the forbidden land gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's divine sense manifested and looked towards the distance, where Hu Yuan was in deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? His fortune is so good? He really grasped the opportunity!" Xiong Mo watched Hu Yuan with astonished eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person who Xiong Mo had found as a source cultivator had actually advanced further! He had stepped onto the Immortal Platform and reached the second minor realm! As long as he leaves the forbidden land and completes the tribulation, he can truly become an elder of the Profound Origin Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Is this for real? Although the forbidden land has abundant resources, without a special constitution or exceptional talent, to cross two major realms in about fifty years, from the Four Extremes to the Immortal Platform, is truly amazing!" After clearly seeing Hu Yuan's realm, the entire saint was shocked. This was similar to the early cultivation speed of Ye Fengxiu! Even if it's temporary, it's still terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, Hu Yuan finished his contemplation and stabilized his realm. Although Xiong Mo did not know the exact level of his battle prowess, based on his foundation, it should be no less than the Fourth Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his cultivation, Hu Yuan slowly opened his eyes and saw Xiong Mo staring directly at him, causing him to be covered in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on the completion of your cultivation, Saint Xiong Mo," Hu Yuan immediately stood up and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

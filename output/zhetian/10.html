        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not Xiong Mo's turn to solve any problems now. His cultivation and combat power are not enough to help the Spiritual Treasure Senior in battle. Besides, with the Spiritual Treasure Senior's current combat power, as long as it's not a Saint-level undead rushing to the frontline, there won't be any issues.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan said, "Saint Xiong Mo, there are a total of six scriptures in the sect that have reached the Saint realm. The most complete one is the Spiritual Treasure Saint's scripture." Hu Yuan is only a Quaternary Cultivator and doesn't know which scripture is most suitable for Xiong Mo now, so he can only mention the Saint-level scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiong Mo reacted. "Bring all those Saint-level scriptures over." After thinking for a moment, he said again, "Wait, bring the basic scriptures as well."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered that the scriptures he cultivated were based on his own insights into the laws of heaven and earth, combined with some known future information using a "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>This is a bit problematic.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the way modern people speak, if he were to write out his own scriptures, it would probably be from start to finish something like "As a Stone Saint Spirit, under the guidance of the laws of heaven and earth, I discovered that there is something called the 'Wheel of Life' below the navel. By concentrating the essence qi gathered from heaven and earth to strike it, and then opening up the Bitter Sea, I can begin the cultivation of the Wheel Sea Secret Realm. The specific steps are as follows..."</p><p></p><p>This kind of plain language, without any of the mysterious and profound terminology like "The Dao of Heaven is to diminish the surplus and supplement the deficiency," or "The Jade Toad is the beginning, fishing with a hook, flowing downstream."</p><p></p><p>And as for the scriptures of this era, he's never even seen them before. Without laying a foundation with the basic scriptures, directly looking at those Saint-level scriptures, if he encounters some professional terms he doesn't understand, he'll have to ask this Uncle Hu in front of him, which would be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>If it gets out that Xiong Mo is a "illiterate" Saint, the prestige of the Saint Spirit will be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>"From the Wheel Sea to the Immortal Platform, give me a complete set of basic scriptural guidance."</p><p></p><p>"En, whether it's for disciples who haven't yet entered the Wheel Sea Secret Realm, or for the incomplete remnant scriptures, bring them all."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's voice carried a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Saint." Hu Yuan left the forbidden land to prepare the things Xiong Mo wanted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xiong Mo say this, he understood very well what to prepare. In addition to those Saint scriptures, he should make a copy of his disciple Lai Xiang's study materials, and also take the common scriptures from the library.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Hu Yuan returned to Xiong Mo's side. With a wave of his hand, a pile of jade slips the size of a small mountain appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Saint, these are the things you need," Hu Yuan responded respectfully again.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at the pile of jade slips piled up like a small mountain, and his brain completely froze.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xiong Mo had not responded for a long time, Hu Yuan carefully observed him and immediately knew what was going on. After all, he had gone through this stage himself.</p><p></p><p>"Saint, I'll take my leave now."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the slight upward curve of Hu Yuan's mouth as he left, Xiong Mo finally snapped out of it.</p><p></p><p>The first reaction was: The prestige of the Saint Spirit is shattered to pieces again.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did was find the jade slip that recorded the Spiritual Treasure Senior's scripture and carefully read through it.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, sure enough. This is a heavenly book! It's even more difficult to understand than classical Chinese!"</p><p></p><p>"Gather the essence qi of the jade palace, the purple mist of the auspicious clouds, the jade radiance shining brilliantly, the golden reflection flowing true, coalescing and containing the exquisite, enveloping and solidifying the divine."</p><p></p><p>"What does this 'purple mist' refer to? Is it the first purple air of the sunrise or the radiance of the solidified divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>"And what does 'the jade radiance shining brilliantly' mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's completely incomprehensible."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand!" </p><p></p><p>After putting down the scriptures of Senior Lingbao, he picked up the scriptures of other saints. "After all, Senior Lingbao will become the future Lingbao Celestial, so it's normal that I can't understand. As for the others, even if I don't understand the full meaning, I can still guess the general idea, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo closed the scriptures.</p><p></p><p>A scent of "academic failure" permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he found a jade slip called "Preliminary Interpretation of the Dongxuan Sect" from the pile of jade slips and started to study it.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Xiong Mo finished reading "Preliminary Interpretation of the Dongxuan Sect". He then glanced at the pile of jade slips nearby and felt exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many things to learn? It seems Ye Fengchu didn't stay in the Lingxu Celestial Realm for long. How did he manage to learn all of this?"</p><p></p><p>"It'll take three to five years to learn all of this, and that's calculated based on my saint-level spiritual power! If I also need to refine my own scriptures and learn some combat techniques, it might take hundreds or even thousands of years! As for deriving combat techniques suitable for myself, that will probably have to wait until I can test them in actual battles."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo sighed. "This is like going back to high school! There's so much to do and so little time! Judging from Senior Lingbao's cultivation, he'll probably leave the Dongxuan Star in at most a hundred years, and that's when I'll have to be ready to face the Corpse Calamity."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiong Mo's sense of crisis was even higher than when he hadn't created the Supplementing the Heavens technique.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, [Gray Mist Space]! Boost!" </p><p></p><p>His consciousness fully entered the [Gray Mist Space], feeling the position of the Creator and beginning to utilize the supreme essence of the space.</p><p></p><p>"Based on all my current knowledge and abilities, I will derive a method to accelerate my mental processing speed."</p><p></p><p>Why derive a method to accelerate mental processing speed? Because that can increase the speed of learning. Moreover, in certain situations, it can also be considered a way to improve one's insight. And in future battles, it can be a useful auxiliary technique.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's spiritual light flashed constantly, and as the supreme essence of the [Gray Mist Space] was consumed, this technique was rapidly formed.</p><p></p><p>After a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, the derivation is successful!" Xiong Mo exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly remembered something. "The consumption! Interface, show me how much time I have left!"</p><p></p><p>[Time until complete space collapse: 1,800,000 years]</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo was stunned. "One acceleration derivation consumes around 200,000 years of time?!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I can accept that. One-time consumption, lifetime benefit." After calming himself down, he began to construct the technique.</p><p></p><p>"Here we go!"</p><p></p><p>First, he used his divine sense as the framework, utilizing the special frequency and vibrations he was currently resonating with the heavens and earth to connect to the Dao and laws. Then, he used his consciousness as the material, completely recording and integrating this frequency and vibration. Finally, he inputted it into the [Gray Mist Space] using the authority of the Creator, weaving it together with his own information into an imprint.</p><p></p><p>As Xiong Mo wrapped this imprint with his consciousness and merged it into his immortal platform, a sense of commanding the great Dao of the world surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"It's complete!"</p><p></p><p>"My own unique technique - the Extreme Depletion Version of the Heart Imprint!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the naming style of this legendary technique, "Decided! I'll call it the Heart Technique!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the moment the [Underworld] was opened, a certain element was satisfied throughout the Spiritual Realm, enough for the essence originally sealed by the "Celestial Sovereign" to break through the cage imprisoning it, allowing its "limbs" to extend beyond the seal.</p><p></p><p>Greylily looked at this dark river, her eyes revealing unparalleled longing. "This is a symbol beyond 'death'! I seem to see further hope, a power that transcends the gods!"</p><p></p><p>The progenitor of the immortal birds unfurled its wings, and pale flames slowly burned on its feathers, like a series of illusory gateways. In an instant, the authority of "death" was dispersed, and a silent resonance was born between the tributary of the [Eternal Dark River] and Greylily.</p><p></p><p>With a completely deranged mental state, the progenitor of the immortal birds disregarded all the irrationalities it should have discovered, and directly plunged into the tranquil river, swimming freely within.</p><p></p><p>Following the rhythm of the resonance, Greylily's "death" authority gradually covered the river, and the faint aura of "ending" and "deep darkness" slowly enveloped the giant bird's body.</p><p></p><p>The exchange began, the progenitor's aura gradually permeating the tributary of the [Eternal Dark River], while the aura of the [Eternal Dark River] also imperceptibly seeped into Greylily's spiritual body, twisting its consciousness and altering its cognition in an extremely slow, irreversible and secretive manner.</p><p></p><p>But the deranged Greylily, even after becoming a deity, was clearly unaware of this hidden and subtle change. It was now striving to spread its "death" throughout the tributary of the [Eternal Dark River], yearning to control this river that had already penetrated the [Underworld].</p><p></p><p>As the progenitor of the immortal birds made its efforts, the symbols related to the [Eternal Dark River], such as "death", "eternal sleep", "ending", "terminus", and "deep darkness", gradually permeated the Spiritual Realm, causing profound anomalies to appear in reality.</p><p></p><p>In the grand palace of the Giant King's court, Ormil dispersed all the extraordinary beings around him, leaving only Bearmink and Ombella.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Giant King who had just ascended to divinity looked indifferently at the encroaching darkness from the Spiritual Realm, and asked Bearmink, "Is this the consequence you mentioned, not a very good one? Greylily becoming a deity is indeed not a good result for the Giant Clan."</p><p></p><p>Bearmink looked at Ormil and shook his head, saying softly, "It's not just this progenitor of the immortal birds becoming a deity. And the 'not-so-good' consequence I mentioned also includes your current mental state."</p><p></p><p>From the ability to contain Sequence Two's extraordinary traits, possessing the angelic position, the "primordial" awakening was already inevitable, no matter how "clean" the mental imprint was cleansed. Therefore, all possessors of the angelic position would have one kind of mental problem or another, the difference being only in the degree of severity.</p><p></p><p>And after ascending to Sequence Zero, this situation would become even more serious. Most Sequence Zeros, at the moment of ascension, would only retain the most ardent emotions in their personal character. The rest would be cold to the point of cruelty, rational to the point of almost lacking any humanity.</p><p></p><p>Ormil's current condition was even worse than the general mental state of Sequence Zeros. Because he did not truly ascend through the "alchemy" system, he was accurately an ancient god who had forcibly swallowed extraordinary traits and ascended to divinity, even though the ascension ritual had stabilized his mental state.</p><p></p><p>What sets Ormil apart from other ancient gods is that the extraordinary traits he swallowed were "purer", not bringing deeper levels of madness, and he could still possess his own rationality and a microscopic trace of humanity.</p><p></p><p>However, the balance between divinity and humanity may still be a minor problem for Ormil. The real big problem is the "primordial" that has already fully awakened within this Giant King.</p><p></p><p>Now Ormil can still maintain a rational state, thanks to Bearmink using the power of the Whispering Robe to pry into the underlying rules of the universe regarding the mind, soothing the madness brought about by the awakening of the "primordial" within him.</p><p></p><p>Facing the gaze of this ancient remnant, the Giant King's expression did not change at all, still as indifferent as before. "But for me, Ombella, and the Giant Clan, this 'not-so-good' consequence may already be the best choice."</p><p></p><p>Bearmink glanced at Ombella, whose body was already covered by the Dusk, and slowly nodded. As Ormil said, this "not-so-good" consequence is indeed the best choice for them now.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the ancient gods is the common will of many ancient remnants. Without the influence of a higher power, this will be an absolute historical turning point, an inevitable fate that no extraordinary being within the Earth can change.</p><p></p><p>However, when the "ancient gods" will appear, and who they are, their mental state and strength, there is more to be said about that.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that all layouts require time to settle, and it is not the case that as soon as one thinks of how to layout, it can be completed in the next instant. There are great sages who can accomplish such feats, but they are called the Pinnacle of the Veiled World, and they can only do so without obstruction from peers of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>And in this mysterious universe, apart from the "Primordial Sovereign" who is an "outsider", no pillar can currently possess the ability to even scratch the surface of such techniques, even with the help of [Position: Ancient Remnant] and "Self-Mastery".</p><p></p><p>Looking at the increasingly darkening sky, Ormil continued indifferently, "Becoming the first extraordinary being to ascend to divinity on this earth, to awe the rest of the extraordinary races."</p><p></p><p>"Use the 'Dusk' authority to 'collapse' the measures from the Fallen Goddess on Ombella, making them completely belong to the earth."</p><p></p><p>"'Consume' the other ancient remnants left behind by the Giant Clan, allowing the Giant Clan a chance to survive this era."</p><p></p><p>"As long as these three goals are achieved, the price I pay is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"And my current state is not irreversible, it just requires a greater price, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Ormil's cold, almost purely divine voice echoed in the Giant King's court, causing Bearmink to also look at his determination with surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this very moment, a feeling of digestion appeared in Bearmink's body, as the "shell" of the "Ancient Scholar" potion was disappearing, and the power inside was rapidly being "stolen" by him, becoming his own.</p><p></p><p>"Crack."</p><p></p><p>The "Diviner" path to Sequence Three "Ancient Scholar" potion had completely "dissolved" within him, causing a slight rise in his spirituality, and a "premonition" of being able to continue ascending.</p><p></p><p>Bearmink</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feeling the stirrings within his body and the "premonition" fed back from the spiritual realm, he silently said in his heart, "The second sequence 'Miracle Worker' is right before my eyes. The time to confront the 'Celestial Lord' is also about to arrive."</p><p></p><p>The first rule of the "Ancient Scholar" role-playing protocol is to come from and study the ancient times, and as an old remnant, he undoubtedly fulfills this. The third rule, to witness fate and influence the present, now that he has witnessed Ormir's ascension to divinity and helped stabilize his reason and humanity, he has also met this requirement.</p><p></p><p>As for the second rule, to research and extract things from history, Xiong Mo chuckled, looking towards the human city gradually taking on a modern urban landscape under the Observation Tower.</p><p></p><p>This requirement, he undoubtedly fulfills as well. Now, all that remains for him to ascend to "Miracle Worker" is the ascension ritual: to bring a forgotten history back to the present era.</p><p></p><p>The well-prepared Xiong Mo directly triggered the "Mysterious Lord's" faith anchor, sending a "divine oracle" to the believers of the "Mysterious Lord" at the church under the Observation Tower.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the sky grew darker.</p><p></p><p>The darkness emanating from the [Eternal Dark River] completely submerged the entire sky in an almost pitch-black darkness that was unimaginably heavy. This oppressive darkness immediately extended an inexplicable fear, plunging the unprotected supernatural beings in the real world into panic.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the entire Earth, only a few places like the Giant King's City, the Elf King's City, the Silver Moon Forest, and the Observation Tower had a faint glow to provide shelter for the existence of life.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the Giant King's Court, Xiong Mo looked up towards the spiritual realm, and Ormir's gaze followed, both looking towards the approaching Destroyer Wolf, Fregra.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo whispered in the Giant King's Court, "More 'gods' are about to appear."</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the terrifying wolf howls echoed across the globe, and the nameless fear, accompanied by the darkness, seeped into the minds of all supernatural beings in a profoundly sinister way.</p><p></p><p>Screams resounded in every corner, the agonized cries of all the invaded beings. Without shelter, one supernatural being after another perished in this extreme terror, and the dense aura of death surrounded the entire Earth.</p><p></p><p>With certain conditions met, the tributaries of the [Eternal Dark River] directly pierced the barrier between the spiritual realm and the physical world, descending to the land, sinking into the depths of the North Continent, hidden in the unknown darkness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Destroyer Wolf, Fregra, who had already arrived near the [Underworld], directly swallowed the extraordinary traits of the "Sleepless" and "Diviner" paths, as well as the uniqueness corresponding to these two paths. Then, in a frenzy, it ascended to become the fourth ancient god.</p><p></p><p>After the ascension, with its own stability not yet secured, Fregra suddenly looked up towards the region above the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>It saw an ancient palace shrouded in a grayish-white mist, seemingly composed of doors tinged with a hint of blue-black, and countless layered light orbs. Beyond this ancient palace was an extremely hazy, boundless gray mist, with deep red "stars" dotting it.</p><p></p><p>As if drawn by something, Fregra let out a roar, "I want to devour more extraordinary traits and uniqueness! No, I want to eat it! It's mine!"</p><p></p><p>Under this frenzied consciousness, the newly ascended body began to shed wriggling worms, which fell from the Destroyer Wolf's body into the spiritual realm. In exchange for this cost, it gained an even more profound darkness and mystery.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the [Source Fortress] above the spiritual realm seemed to be touched by the Destroyer Wolf, and a transparent stream of light that only it and Xiong Mo could perceive fell from the ancient palace, flying towards Fregra.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, a slight fluctuation in one of the fundamental rules of the universe caused the transparent stream of light to suddenly change direction, brushing past the Destroyer Wolf's body and disappearing into the earth without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"No! This is mine! I want to eat it!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the transparent stream of light from the [Source Fortress] pass by its body, an exceptionally violent fury was revealed in its heart. The wolf claws shrouded in darkness attacked everywhere, as if trying to tear something else from the [Source Fortress] based on this connection.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fregra's frenzied state, Angerwild, who was nearby, seemed to think the Destroyer Wolf was going to attack him. Stimulated by this, he also swallowed the extraordinary traits of the "Audience" and "White Tower" paths, as well as the uniqueness corresponding to these two divine paths, and in his frenzy, became the fifth ancient god.</p><p></p><p>But the moment Angerwild became an ancient god, he let out a terrifying scream of pain, as "God" began to stir within him, and a hazy light emanated from the giant dragon's body, as if praising something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the [Source Fortress] seemed to truly respond to Fregra's connection, and its wolf claws did indeed penetrate deep into the ancient palace, grasping something.</p><p></p><p>The Destroyer Wolf roared, "I want to go up! I want to eat you!"</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, its claws only managed to grab a curtain, and the [Source Fortress] vanished into nothingness, returning to the unreachable region above the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Completely severed from the [Source Fortress], Fregra was enraged to the extreme. It roared loudly, manifesting authority powers throughout the spiritual realm, attacking indiscriminately, giving a swipe to any supernatural being it encountered.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, Angerwild was attacked by Fregra at that moment and was knocked back into his own domain, the "Dragon's Nest".</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The violent impact directly caused half of the "Dragon's Nest" to collapse, and the power of Fregra's authority ravaged Angerwild's body, destroying the remaining "Dragon's Nest" as well.</p><p></p><p>However, under the power of Fregra's authority, Angerwild unexpectedly regained a glimmer of reason. He saw the pollution carried by the partially awakened "God".</p><p></p><p>"What is this 'pollution', and why is it so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>In shock, Angerwild activated the "Imagination" authority, creating a book to isolate the pollution he had received and most of his madness.</p><p></p><p>Then, with the reason he had barely recovered, he expelled another portion of the "Writer" extraordinary trait from his body, transforming it into a giant dragon imbued with a nightmarish aura.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

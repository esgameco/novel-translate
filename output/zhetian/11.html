        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Introduction: A secret technique created by Saint Spirit Bear Ink for the purpose of learning and attaining the Dao. It follows the heavens, the heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows nature. Guided by the modern Traditional Chinese Medicine theory of Yin-Yang, Five Elements, and Eight Trigrams, and taking the cosmic imprint of the Heavenly Heart as a reference, it constructs the imprint of the Heavenly Heart within one's own body's microcosm on the immortal platform.</p><p></p><p>Abilities: Can connect to and integrate the great Dao/principles of the external macrocosm, significantly enhancing one's mental processing capabilities and slightly improving one's enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Rank: Saint-level secret technique. Evaluation: Due to lack of exposure to the Heavenly Heart imprint, insufficient knowledge, and the Dao principles not being fully perfected, the technique's rank is not very high. However, the depth and breadth of its concepts hold great potential for future advancement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the information on the panel, Bear Ink smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's only a Saint-level secret technique, it's sufficient for now!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin!"</p><p></p><p>Filled with determination, he used his divine sense to gather all the jade slips and began the rapid absorption of information...</p><p></p><p>In the deep space beyond the Profound Star Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Treasure had arrived outside the star systems, in this vast and empty region with only scattered dust floating about. The surrounding stars were at a distance, ensuring temporary solitude.</p><p></p><p>Facing away from the distant stars, his expression calm, he absorbed the radiance shining from afar, quietly adjusting his state to the optimal condition.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin," Spiritual Treasure said softly.</p><p></p><p>He started to mobilize his cultivation and Dao attainment, opening his body and mind. Strands of sacred power flowed out from within him, divine radiance bursting forth, connecting to the universe and the Heavens. The aura of annihilation rose up, exuding an air as if it could destroy the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a vast ocean of thunder appeared - a sea of thunderstorms!</p><p></p><p>Hidden within were endless thunderbolts and innumerable tribulations. The Great Yin, Great Yang, Five Elements, Chaos, and other heavenly tribulations were intertwined. Countless in type, they were the greatest and most terrifying thunder tribulations.</p><p></p><p>This posed an immense threat, containing not only various great Daos and principles, but also the power to refine the Dao, capable of mercilessly extinguishing all life.</p><p></p><p>This was the tribulation of the Immortal Five Saints and Kings. It could be said to be the most horrifying tribulation in all of history, unrecorded in any annals as having been weathered with composure.</p><p></p><p>The divine punishment raged, its brilliance beyond belief, as if countless star seas were plummeting to submerge this place.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Spiritual Treasure seemed to be buried within, undergoing the interrogation and retribution of the great Daos of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Yet, bolt after bolt of thunderous power like vast rivers and seas struck his body, star after star collided with him, but not even a corner of his robe was harmed!</p><p></p><p>This was a sight that shook the world.</p><p></p><p>A cataclysmic divine punishment, a great annihilation, boundless and immense. Seeing how a single bolt of lightning could destroy a heavenly prodigy, it seemed no one could withstand it. But Spiritual Treasure strolled through it as if in a leisurely garden, comprehending the great Daos and principles within - truly worthy of being the future Spiritual Treasure Venerable!</p><p></p><p>After about a quarter of an hour, Spiritual Treasure seemed to have grown weary of it. He stretched out his hand, grasping a sharp sword forged from immortal gold, and with a single sweep at the thunder sea, the heavens... were rent asunder!</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>This ancient and simple sword, engraved with the character "Zhu", has torn apart all the heavenly tribulations, as well as the great Dao and principles woven within them!</p><p></p><p>After some time, the sea of thunder gathered again. </p><p></p><p>A new calamity had arrived! </p><p></p><p>It was the Calamity of the Opening of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>A divine thunderbolt split open the void, dispersing the chaos. Although it was terrifying, with immense power capable of reducing a person to ashes, it also contained a glimmer of hope for life.</p><p></p><p>This great calamity lasted an exceptionally long time. Unlike the previous sea of lightning, this was truly the opening of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Within the vast sea of thunder, one could clearly see the birth of all things - flowers, birds, fish, insects, celestial bodies, gods, demons, and ghosts. Whatever one could imagine or witness was taking form in that moment. Even though these were composed of thunderbolts and the great Dao and principles within, and not true living beings, the sight was still profoundly awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>Amidst this Calamity of the Opening of Heaven and Earth, even a blade of grass, a worm, or a small bird posed a terrifying threat, capable of unleashing unimaginable destruction. As all things were just beginning to emerge, everything was brand new - plants, animals, sun, moon, stars, immortal phoenixes, and white tigers all appeared, even the howling primal gods and demons!</p><p></p><p>The Peng bird spread its wings, soaring up tens of thousands of miles; the gods and demons roared, carving out immortal lands from the chaos; the true dragon swung its tail, shattering the sun, moon and stars; the immortal phoenix struck with fury, rending the universe. All these grand scenes were formed from the lightning, this was the Calamity of the Opening of Heaven and Earth! Majestic and fierce, enough to make one's soul tremble!</p><p></p><p>But even amidst this terrifying calamity, the Spiritual Treasure remained unfazed. Instead, he wielded four ancient swords and a formation array, charging into the fray. He forcefully sliced apart a nascent world, making it seem as if the end times had arrived! The grasses, insects, and birds formed from lightning were all shattered; the true dragons and immortal phoenixes were cut to pieces; the Peng bird's wings were severed, causing it to plummet from the nine heavens; the gods and demons were reduced to ashes, and the immortal lands were destroyed! Even the sun, moon and stars could not avoid being torn apart! The great Dao and principles within the lightning tribulation were ripped apart once more, and nothing could stop the Spiritual Treasure's earth-shaking slaughter! In the end, only the remnants of a world remained, filled with the aura of calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Treasure then ignited the Sanwei True Flame, refining the remaining ruins and Dao energies into his formation array. The four immortal swords and the formation had become even more terrifying! The aura of destruction and the end times could even be sensed by Xiong Mo, who was in the Profound Star.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the final great calamity arrived. The Spiritual Treasure suddenly looked up, his gaze like swords, peering into the depths of the sea of thunder, where the aura of Dao Actualization Masters was permeating, and a formidable power was gathering.</p><p></p><p>Nine figures emerged one after another from the depths of the sea of thunder, each exuding a pressure that dominated the nine heavens and commanded respect through the ages. This aura was enough to make even great saints tremble.</p><p></p><p>These were the manifestations of the great Dao imprinted upon heaven and earth, displayed within the lightning tribulation!</p><p></p><p>First, a dragon-pearl-bearing torch dragon swooped in, using a shocking grand technique from its dragon claws, directly attacking the Spiritual Treasure's front. Then, a spiritual deer silently approached from behind, raising its long hooves to viciously kick at his back. Finally, a sky-covering divine fire came from above, unleashed by a scarlet-red phoenix. These three young supreme lords combined their forces to attack the Spiritual Treasure!</p><p></p><p>But the Spiritual Treasure remained unmoved. He simply took a step forward, his formation array opening wide, trapping the three young supreme lords within. He then fixed his gaze on a figure that had just appeared.</p><p></p><p>This person exuded an aura of calamity, with a faint hint of the cycle of reincarnation surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>"Mingzun!" The Spiritual Treasure's killing intent surged rapidly! (End of this chapter)</p>

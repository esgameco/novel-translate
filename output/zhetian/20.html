        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on breaking through the bottleneck and entering the Immortal Realm." Xiong Mo put away his scrutinizing gaze and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Elder Hu, you've gained a lot recently, not only with the Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother's sermon, but also the insights from the Saintly Spirit's cultivation. Your cultivation has leaped across two realms, no wonder you were able to find the 'person of great fortune' that I discovered on the way to find the Dragon Vein." Xiong Mo joked.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan was still very happy to hear the first sentence, but when the latter part came out of Xiong Mo's mouth, his expression immediately darkened again.</p><p></p><p>"Where did Saint Xiong Mo hear that from? I don't think I've mentioned that in the Forbidden Land, have I?"</p><p></p><p>He absolutely did not share his "interesting story" in front of Xiong Mo before.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan realized something was off, isn't Xiong Mo a Saint Spirit who hasn't even been born yet? How could he go around like an ordinary cultivator? Where did he hear these things from? His gaze was filled with these doubts as he stared straight at Xiong Mo, almost as if he would go find the Spiritual Treasure Saint if he didn't spill the beans.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hu Yuan looking at him like that, Xiong Mo couldn't help but feel embarrassed. He coughed and replied, "As for how I know about the 'person of great fortune', it's related to the spirit cultivation I did during my refinement."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven days ago.</p><p></p><p>After Xiong Mo had finished marveling at Hu Yuan's cultivation speed, he began to familiarize himself with his own power and prepare to accumulate more insights. Suddenly, the cultivation technique he was running gave him a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual soul could now transform into a Yang Deity! Well, similar to the Yang Deities in the "Beneath the Heavens" world. Of course, Xiong Mo's Yang Deity was far more powerful than those in that world. So naturally, he pulled off a clever move - the Yang Deity's out-of-body experience.</p><p></p><p>That's right, when refining the technique, Xiong Mo had integrated a whole bunch of concepts about Yang Deities into the "Mysterious Yellow Classic"! During the refinement process, his spiritual soul had gone through nine transformations across the other shore, weathered the tribulation of the Dao Spiritual Soul, and then ascended to the Immortal Realm again. Xiong Mo's spiritual soul now possessed a pure Yang Dao rhythm!</p><p></p><p>"I can really go out-of-body now!" A figure emanating a pure Yang Dao rhythm stood before the stone embryo.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, a mirror made of water appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the appearance is still the same as in my previous life." Xiong Mo nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Force in his spiritual soul was resonating, feeling the coolness of the gentle breeze caressing his face.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo murmured to himself, "The Heart Seal Imprint has automatically merged into my spiritual soul after going out-of-body, allowing me to use Dao techniques. My realm hasn't dropped, but my combat power has decreased, probably only at the initial stage of the Six Prohibitions. Well, my body is still in the nurturing stage, so I can't stray too far from it, can't go wandering to the Northern Sea or Cangwu. I haven't gained any great divine abilities, but maintaining myself by dining on the wind and sunlight, and swallowing the radiance of the moon and sun, is still no problem."</p><p></p><p>Now he was so happy, after over ten thousand years, he could finally go anywhere.</p><p></p><p>A short while later, a figure flashed through the exit of the Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe hehe."</p><p></p><p>Five steps, one pavilion; ten steps, one gallery. The waist of the corridor winding, the eaves' teeth high-pecking. Each embracing the terrain, hooking and scheming. Coiled and curled, clustered and crowded, like beehives and water eddies, towering without number.</p><p></p><p>This is a description of the pavilions from the "Apang Palace Rhapsody". But the pavilions and landscapes of the Profound Mystery Sect were far more beautiful than this description! "So beautiful!" Xiong Mo walked slowly on a small path, like a young village child just entering the city, finding everything new and wondrous.</p><p></p><p>As Xiong Mo left the main peak and entered the other mountains, there started to be more people around.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, we're going to be late!"</p><p></p><p>A group of four or five-year-old children in Daoist robes were sprinting like they were in a hundred-meter dash.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Tai ran past Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault, you stayed up so late yesterday," complained one of the leading children to the chubby one following behind.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, but you all enjoyed it so much yesterday, didn't you?" the chubby one chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"It was indeed enjoyable. The elders of our sect are really interesting! Elder Lu Yao's resource exploration team, the great Qi cultivator - Shifu Hu Yuan, the timid Xiong Mo Holy Spirit that was brought back to the sect to be raised, and the Holy Spirit's caretaker - the Lingbao Saint," said a rather tall and simple-looking child.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, that's right! The elders are truly interesting. By the way, when is the Lingbao Daoist who wrote the book 'How Xiong Mo was Cultivated' going to update it? I heard it's been delayed for ten years already," a child said with a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Enough of that! If we're late, the teacher in the academy will punish us!" the leading child interjected.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the group of children ran faster.</p><p></p><p>After hearing these words, Xiong Mo now understood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt like a marmot was screaming in his heart! The grand image of the Holy Spirit had been completely shattered within the Xuanxuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"It must be that group of disrespectful elders, Lu Yao, who directly spread the 'interesting stories' about finding the Holy Spirit, to the point that even a five-year-old child knows about it," Xiong Mo gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>He, Xiong Mo, now wants to seek revenge!</p><p></p><p>Well, why not mention the Lingbao Shixiong who has already published a book? Is it possible that he just couldn't defeat him, so he didn't bring it up.</p><p></p><p>"No, I need to hear the full version," Xiong Mo immediately caught up with the group of children.</p><p></p><p>He instantly arrived in the classroom, wanting to continue eavesdropping. As a Xian Five Saint, he could easily go undetected by anyone below Xian Four Saints.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was now a teacher standing at the podium, ready to start the class, and the children were no longer chatting.</p><p></p><p>The teacher took out a magical artifact and projected a PowerPoint presentation.</p><p></p><p>"How advanced," Xiong Mo inwardly commented.</p><p></p><p>He then began to follow along with the children in this first lesson of the world. Ah, the previous tutoring by Lingbao Shixiong was one-on-one.</p><p></p><p>"Today, we will talk about the history of our Xuanxuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Our sect came to this life-bearing star, Xuanxuan Star, from the starry sky two thousand years ago. We have had six generations of inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"The first generation was the Patriarch Shenxiao Saints, who were the original transmitters of the Dao. After they arrived here, they accepted South Cloud Sect Master as the representative of the second-generation disciples and built a divine city as the frontline. But about a hundred years after the divine city was completed, they gradually passed away."</p><p></p><p>"South Cloud Sect Master then shouldered the burden and accepted Chen Lie Sect Master as the representative of the third-generation disciples."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years later, South Cloud Sect Master passed away due to severe injuries, and Chen Lie Sect Master took over the responsibility of guarding the frontline."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred years later, seven Saint-level undead entities broke through the frontline, wanting to devour the Xuanxuan Star. To eliminate these undead, a large number of sect members sacrificed themselves using Saint-grade artifacts, unleashing a world-shaking strike that destroyed all the undead. However, this also caused a disruption in the inheritance lineage."</p><p></p><p>"Yang Shan Sect Master was the fourth-generation inheritor, the first female Sect Master of Xuanxuan Sect. At the age of less than a hundred, she took on the responsibility of guarding the frontline and overseeing the restoration of the divine city."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

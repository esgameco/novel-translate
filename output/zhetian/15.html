        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo woke up and tidied up his harvests. He couldn't help but think about the days when he cultivated arduously in the stone cocoon, and he smiled self-mockingly. "Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao's three years of preaching have yielded much more than my over ten thousand years of arduous cultivation in the stone cocoon."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it takes the holy spirit nurtured by heaven and earth a hundred thousand years to reach perfection. It's really too difficult to build a path to the peak of the human Dao from scratch without any guidance."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao is right, I need to adjust my path. But I still need to prepare a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xiong Mo began to summon Hu Yuan with a jade talisman: "The one who found the dragon vein, go and make a copy of all the books in the Dong Xuan Sect's library and bring them over."</p><p></p><p>In a certain cave dwelling at the foot of the forbidden land, Hu Yuan was lecturing his disciple Li Xiang. Suddenly, a jade talisman on him lit up and started vibrating. Before Hu Yuan could react, Xiong Mo's voice came through: "The one who found the dragon vein, go and make a copy of all the books in the Dong Xuan Sect's library and bring them over."</p><p></p><p>Li Xiang directly burst out laughing: "Master, the one who found the dragon vein, Xiong Mo the Saint is calling you."</p><p></p><p>More than ten years have passed, and the news of Xiong Mo the holy spirit being dug out and nurtured by Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao has long been spread throughout the sect. At that time, the commotion caused by the elders' mobilization was quite strong. Of course, Hu Yuan, the "person of great fortune" who discovered the saint's stone cocoon, also gained fame throughout the sect.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, some rumors and stories have also spread throughout the sect, such as "Hu Yuan's godly operation", "the story of Ling Bao and Xiong Mo", "the life of Saint Xiong Mo after his appearance in the world", etc. have already been compiled into small stories. Hmm, especially on the front lines, it seems that due to the greater pressure, the attention to this story is even higher than in the sect. In particular, a book called "How Xiong Mo Was Cultivated" has become the most popular.</p><p></p><p>As for how these stories came about? Elder Lu Yao said it's not my business, it was all spread by Shu Li and Zhu Tie.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xiang's forehead was hit by Hu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan said with a gloomy face, "Your master knows. You just continue to cultivate here!"</p><p></p><p>With another "bang", the cave dwelling's door was heavily closed.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan didn't pay attention to Li Xiang, who was still calling out in pain in the cave dwelling, and flew towards the library. Soon, he made copies of the books Xiong Mo needed and flew quickly towards the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hu Yuan come in, Xiong Mo couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, and then scanned him with his divine sense. "Impressive, you're only a step away from the Immortal Platform. Your cultivation speed is quite fast!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan saluted and said, "I'm just benefiting from Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao's preaching."</p><p></p><p>"But why did you come in with a gloomy face?" Xiong Mo asked questioningly.</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan replied with a forced smile, "Your disciple was just having fun with a story, nothing too serious."</p><p></p><p>"What story? Tell me about it," Xiong Mo became a bit curious.</p><p></p><p>"The story of the saint being dug out and nurtured by Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao." Hu Yuan said with a slight upward curve of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo suddenly felt like he had never been so "petrified" before. After all, this news was too... "Does Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao know? This is arranging the saint, do you know that?" Xiong Mo's entire holy spirit was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao naturally knows. The book 'How Xiong Mo Was Cultivated' was written by Senior Martial Brother Ling Bao himself," Hu Yuan said words that shattered Xiong Mo's worldview again, and took out a book with the title "How Xiong Mo Was Cultivated", turning to the last page, where the signature was: Ling Bao Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"This Dong Xuan Sect's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How did the wind suddenly change?" Xiong Mo cried inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xiong Mo, don't worry, this is just how our sect is. It'll be fine in a hundred or two hundred years." Hu Yuan seemed to have perceived what Xiong Mo was thinking. "Hmm, by then, there will be new entertainment." Hu Yuan muttered the last sentence to himself.</p><p></p><p>In silence, Xiong Mo took out the jade slips and placed them to the left of the pile of foundational scriptures. Ah, there were even more of them, probably several times the amount of the foundational scriptures.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, repairing the secret realm is the priority." Xiong Mo temporarily set aside this troubling matter and used his spiritual sense to extract the information contained in the secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Repairing?" Hu Yuan's eyes gleamed, as if he had sensed an opportunity. "Venerable one, may I watch here?" he quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Xiong Mo naturally had no objections.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p>"Good, the information extraction is complete. Fortunately, although the jade slips containing the secret techniques look numerous, the content is not that much. Otherwise, it would have taken more than just this amount of time."  Xiong Mo murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"[Gray Mist Space], come! Add some points!"</p><p></p><p>His consciousness once again fully entered the space.</p><p></p><p>"Path simulation begins."</p><p></p><p>The ultra-high nature of the space began to consume again. This time, not only was his original understanding of the Saint-Dao Law of Earth Cultivation fully manifested in the space, but the fragmented Great Dao and Laws that he had comprehended from his senior Spiritual Treasure's teachings also appeared.</p><p></p><p>This simulation was different from before! With the Heart Sutra Secret, his utilization of the [Gray Mist Space] had become even more wondrous. This space could also be seen as a universe, although its lifespan did not seem to be long.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, just like the wizard brewing potions in fairy tales."</p><p></p><p>"Two parts of the Dao of Destiny's comprehension, plus seven parts of the Dao of Destruction's comprehension, hmm, and a little bit of the vitality of the Dao of Wood and a touch of the rhythm of the Dao of Water, fused into my Dao of Earth Cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Succeeded on the first try?"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at this dark, twisted, filled with grayish-yellow vitality and powerful path, and his brows couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiong Mo was examining it, it also emanated a temptation from the depths of the soul, constantly emitting murmurs that made one feel like sinking into it and becoming a part of it. "Cthulhu?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these murmurs, the corners of Xiong Mo's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>"Why can I simulate such a bizarre path in Tian Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the future Saint Body in his later years will have an ominous full-body red fur? Okay then."</p><p></p><p>"First, preserve it? After all, this path is quite special and powerful, almost on par with the feeling when my senior Spiritual Treasure taught me the Dao. Maybe it'll be useful in the future? Hmm, let's hope so."</p><p></p><p>"First simulation failed."</p><p></p><p>"Try again!"</p><p></p><p>"The comprehension of the Dao of Fire plus a little bit of the vitality of the Dao of Wood, and then add two parts of the comprehension of the Dao of Water. Successful, but not the optimal choice."</p><p></p><p>"Try again!"</p><p></p><p>"...What is this thing again? Failed!"</p><p></p><p>"Try again!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Try again!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Four parts of the comprehension of the Dao of Water, plus three parts of the comprehension of the Dao of Destiny, then fuse in half a part of the comprehension of the Dao of Fire and three parts of the comprehension of the Dao of Destruction, and finally add four parts of the vitality of the Dao of Wood, and integrate them into my Dao of Earth Cultivation. Simulation successful!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

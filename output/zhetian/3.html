        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The specific situation is as follows. One day, while Xiong Mo was on his way home, he was suddenly struck by a beam of light. Then, when Xiong Mo woke up, he had become the stone saint spirit that was being nurtured on this mountain. Why did Xiong Mo know he was the stone saint spirit? Because this was what the natural laws nurturing him told him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How boring... Huh?" Xiong Mo's consciousness suddenly noticed a speck of light and curiously approached it. At that moment, he felt as if time had suddenly stopped, and the speck of light suddenly swallowed up Xiong Mo's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my goodness, what's going on?" Xiong Mo entered a hazy, gray space. This space had nothing, was extremely quiet, and gave one the illusion of the end of all things.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" Xiong Mo's consciousness suddenly shattered. The fragments of consciousness floated irregularly in this space, silently merging into the space.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the fragments began to appear in various corners of the space and coalesced. After the successful coalescence, Xiong Mo slowly regained his ability to think.</p><p></p><p>"What is this all about." At this time, Xiong Mo's mood was extremely complex. He finally knew why he had become a saint spirit.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, Xiong Mo, he had crossed over! And the reason for the crossing over was that beam of light.</p><p></p><p>"Interface, show me my current status." Xiong Mo thought to himself while looking around the quiet, empty, and hazy space.</p><p></p><p>Name: Xiong Mo</p><p>Status: In Gestation</p><p>Race: Saint Spirit - Stone Saint Spirit</p><p>Unique Abilities:</p><p>1. Creator (Low-End Version): In the Hazy Gray Space, he has the authority and status of a creator, but is limited by his own abilities and has limited influence on the outside world.</p><p>2. Eternal Certification (Incomplete Low-End Version): Can only travel within worlds with the same underlying rules.</p><p>3. Data Projection Panel: Can input the rules/essences/Dao he has comprehended to conduct projections. The projection ability is related to his cultivation/comprehension of rules/Dao/laws/essences. Can use the super high-level essence of the space to accelerate the projections.</p><p>4. True Spirit Immortality (Fake): Even if the physical body turns to ash and the soul is extinguished, as long as the consciousness body in the space remains, he can consume the super high-level essence of the space to be reborn.</p><p>5. Crossing Over (Incomplete): Can consume the super high-level essence of the space as consumption to cross over between worlds, can anchor time and space, can conceal/rewrite causality.</p><p></p><p>Negative Conditions:</p><p>1. The space is in the process of collapsing. Due to his fusion with the space, once the space is completely destroyed, it will be irreversible death. Only by comprehending and inputting a trace of a rule/Dao/law with an immortal essence can the collapse be stopped. After inputting a complete and fully self-owned rule/Dao/law with an immortal essence, he can slowly recover the super high-level essence in the space and repair the space.</p><p>2. Due to the insufficient or incomplete level of the inputted rules/Dao/laws, the projections may not be accurate/unable to project/progress will be blocked.</p><p>3. Before the collapse is stopped, each use of the super high-level essence in the space will accelerate the collapse of the space.</p><p>4. Before the space is fully repaired, the crossing over mode will be random crossing over.</p><p></p><p>"How much time do I have left?" Seeing the description on the panel, Xiong Mo's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It fell. He had just experienced death (consciousness shattered) once, and he didn't want to experience it a second time.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xiong Mo began to utilize the super high-level essence within the space, calculating the completely shattered time.</p><p></p><p>"Whew~ Fortunately, there's still about 2 million years left." Xiong Mo's complexion immediately became ruddy again. "I still have time to comprehend and improve my cultivation and laws. Hmm, as a holy spirit nurtured by heaven and earth, the difficulty of improving my cultivation and comprehending the laws shouldn't be too high, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, next..." Xiong Mo's will split off a strand, leaving it in the space. Then, following the sensation, he returned to the body of the holy spirit that was being nurtured.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let me see how to start cultivating!" "According to the guidance of the laws of heaven and earth, cultivation begins with the Revolving Sea. Revolving Sea?" Xiong Mo's expression started to look strange.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the Dao Palace, the Four Extremes, the Dragon Transformation, the Immortal Platform, and finally the fusion of the Five Great Forbidden Realms. The ultimate leap, merging with the imprint of the Heavenly Heart, and one can then attain the Dao."Xiong Mo's expression became increasingly serious.</p><p></p><p>"Holy spirit, Revolving Sea, Dao Palace, Four Extremes, Dragon Transformation, Immortal Platform... Could it be that I've transmigrated to Desolate Era?"Xiong Mo's face became grave.</p><p></p><p>Desolate Era is a high-risk world. The heroes, geniuses, and talents within it are mostly able to rise up and fight beyond their level. Those emperors and overlords even battled to the edge of the universe, eroding the Great Dao itself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this is also a world where the combat power is inverted, but longevity is difficult to achieve. The supreme beings of the ancient times conducted various experiments to achieve immortality.</p><p></p><p>The most effective and common method was to construct forbidden areas, self-inflict a fatal wound, and then seal themselves in using divine sources or other divine objects to enter a state of dormancy. The supreme beings hoped that when the path to immortality opened in the future, they could emerge, traverse the immortal path, and attain immortality.</p><p></p><p>However, self-sealing is not without consumption. The supreme beings in dormancy will slowly consume their own life force. And to replenish their life force, they will destroy life stars or even life galaxies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every few tens of thousands of years, there will be a periodically man-made disaster - the Dark Turmoil.</p><p></p><p>For the current Xiong Mo, the key is not this. It's...</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god! The time for the holy spirit's nurturing to reach completion is around 1 million years, and half of this 2 million years is already gone."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm lucky enough to have the nurturing reach completion, and in an era where no one has attained the Dao, I can then smoothly attain the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"But if the nurturing process is interrupted by external factors, the nurturing will stop. The holy spirit will not be born complete, and without an extraordinary opportunity, the difficulty of breaking through to a certain realm in the future will be unimaginable, let alone attaining the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the place where I'm nurturing myself is not some forbidden land, but just a valley with abundant spiritual energy. The possibility of the nurturing being interrupted and me being dug out is extremely high!"Xiong Mo was a bit frantic.</p><p></p><p>"To make the space's shattering stop, I must reach the realm of the Four Worlds Great Emperor, only then will I have a chance to comprehend a wisp of the immortal essence law, or the Immortal Dao law."Xiong Mo's heart was a bit shaken.</p><p></p><p>"If I reincarnate... No! Reincarnation can only restore my current state, but if I die and then reincarnate, I'll return to the state of being nurtured, and I'll have to be nurtured for another 1 million years before being born."Xiong Mo sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"I can only pray that my luck is good enough, or..." Xiong Mo suddenly remembered something. "There seems to be a scripture called the Supplementary Heavenly Art that can allow an incompletely born holy spirit to be supplemented afterwards."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A year later.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother entered the forbidden land at the mountain peak. Hu Yuan also followed closely behind, after all, it was the Holy Man's sermon. How many elders and disciples of the Profound Origin Sect wanted this opportunity but couldn't get it! Unfortunately, they were either stationed at the frontlines or unable to enter the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Hu Yuan could enter the forbidden land, and his temporary task was to keep an eye on Holy Man Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly lucky! Maybe I'll have the chance to cultivate and become a Xian-level expert after the sermon!" Hu Yuan thought happily in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother." Xiong Mo's divine sense manifested within the formation, greeting Spiritual Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Then Xiong Mo bowed again and said, "Congratulations to Lord Jade Dawn for successfully breaking through the tribulation and getting closer to the position of Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan heard Xiong Mo say this and his mouth opened in surprise. Jade Dawn was the honorific title of Spiritual Treasure, the Holy Man, and in this era, "Lord" often referred to cultivators near the Venerable realm, while "Celestial Venerable" was the exclusive title for those who had attained the Dao. To use the title "Lord" to praise Spiritual Treasure, and say he was getting closer to the Celestial Venerable position, was really flattering! After all, people in the mythological era were relatively more reserved and simple. Shameless slogans like "My son Wang Teng has the potential to become an Emperor!" had not yet appeared. Xiong Mo might be the first to do this.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Treasure looked at Xiong Mo with a slight twitch of the eye. Although he was full of confidence in his path to attainment, he clearly didn't expect this Holy Spirit junior brother to suddenly come out with such a congratulatory statement. This made Spiritual Treasure feel a bit strange inside, and he didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Facing Xiong Mo, he could only reply, "Mm, junior brother as well."</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Treasure came before Xiong Mo and waved his hand, placing down two meditation cushions. Hu Yuan's eyes immediately lit up, and he quickly went to sit on one of the cushions after paying his respects to the two Holy Men. These cushions were good items, woven from the branches of a divine tree, and could assist in enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The remaining one was the one Spiritual Treasure sat down on. As for why Xiong Mo didn't have one? He couldn't move around freely, and in his current state of gestation, he had the natural support of Heaven and Earth, not needing the cushion.</p><p></p><p>"Xiong Mo junior brother, first tell me about your path and scriptures." Spiritual Treasure wanted to understand Xiong Mo's path in more detail before giving a targeted lecture. Through some records of the past, the Profound Origin Sect had some understanding of Holy Spirits, but not much. Moreover, this time he was going to lecture for the Holy Spirit still in gestation, so Spiritual Treasure felt it was better to be more cautious, after all, he was his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo nodded and said, "No problem, Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother. Then let me start from when I first became conscious."</p><p></p><p>"About more than 10,000 years ago, I became conscious. Through the information provided by Heaven and Earth, I knew my identity - a Holy Spirit. Later, through some opportunities, I learned that most Holy Spirits would be interrupted during gestation and then forced to be born. And due to anger and other reasons, they began retaliatory actions, but none of them had a good ending."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the resources and terrain around my gestation, I can feel that I will most likely also be interrupted in my gestation and be born in an imperfect state."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo said this, his gaze lingering on the seated Hu Yuan. This made Hu Yuan feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm not satisfied, because as long as I can gestate fully in the stone embryo, I can become a being at the peak of the Venerable realm. I may even have the chance to attain the Dao. However, I also started to fear, afraid that some powerful experts would see me and directly destroy me."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo glanced at Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother and continued, "In this intertwined state of unwillingness and fear, I thought of a method that might succeed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"That is to create a scripture that can make up for my own shortcomings after my imperfect ascension. In the future, I can continue my cultivation with it."</p><p></p><p>"I have successfully created this scripture. I will name it - the補天術(補Tian Shu, Heavenly Restoration Technique)."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan was stunned, and Ling Bao couldn't help but praise, "Xiong Mo, my junior brother, has great talent. No wonder I didn't resist when I brought you back to the sect, you had a backup plan."</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the Dong Xuan Sect, there is no such heaven-defying scripture in the world that can help an imperfect saint make up for their deficiencies. Unexpectedly, Xiong Mo actually created it.</p><p></p><p>Talking about the Heavenly Restoration Technique, Xiong Mo couldn't help but feel proud. "Ahem. Of course, although I'm not as good as you, Senior Brother Ling Bao, I'm definitely a genius."</p><p></p><p>"But because of this Heavenly Restoration Technique and a series of other reasons, I have only taken the path of the Earth Dao as my fundamental cultivation. Even in the realm of the Immortal Three Slashes, I only cut away the impurities within my body. It is also because of the success of the Heavenly Restoration Technique that I have advanced to the Saint Fourth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo thought for a moment and said again, "I also created a secret technique - the Heart Character Secret, a Saint-level secret technique, used for learning and enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"And my current path is composed of the Earth Dao, the Heavenly Restoration Technique, and the Heart Character Secret."</p><p></p><p>"As for the scripture, well, I haven't refined the knowledge I learned in the sect yet, so you'll have to bear with it, Senior Brothers."</p><p></p><p>"As a Stone Saint Spirit, I..." Xiong Mo explained his scripture in plain language.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the explanation, Hu Yuan and Ling Bao were a bit surprised by Xiong Mo's way of lecturing the scripture in plain language, but there was nothing unusual about it, just a personal preference. However, the more they listened, the more astonished they became. When it came to the problem of the mud sculpture deities Xiong Mo encountered in the Dao Palace and the solution, Hu Yuan was directly stunned! His mouth formed an "O" shape. Ling Bao wasn't much better off either. His mouth kept opening and closing, as if he wanted to say something but didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>From the Wheel Sea to the Immortal Platform, after listening to the entire scripture, Ling Bao and the others were speechless.</p><p></p><p>The sacred and profound Immortal Sea of Suffering was turned into a muddy yellow by cultivation. The mud sculpture deities that popped up in the Dao Palace were directly melted and filled into the Dao Palace. Without the relevant laws, the four pillars of the extremes came without fear of sudden collapse, and then suffered Dao injuries? Why were the great dragons in his body also black and yellow? Shouldn't they be golden? The Immortal Platform had a good Dao rhythm, and the earthy yellow light seemed fine, but it just felt a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>The various thought processes and operations left a deep impression. Compared to the saint scriptures of the Dong Xuan Sect, this was like a mudslide.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xiong Mo also knows the various problems here now, it's not that he didn't have any knowledge at that time. Impatient to wait for the heavens and earth to slowly prepare the scripture for him, he could only rely on external cheats to deduce it. The result, well, fortunately he was dug back to the sect by Senior Brother Ling Bao. Senior Brother Ling Bao is great! In a strange atmosphere, Xiong Mo finished lecturing his own scripture.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Ling Bao paused and said again, "Xiong Mo, my junior brother, has great talent."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan was also frantically nodding. Of course he has great talent, just relying on this mudslide scripture, he could cultivate to the Saint Fourth Realm in more than ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, I would have long since gone mad and died," Hu Yuan silently said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's primordial spirit entered the Transforming Dragon Secret Realm, and he silently looked at the great dragon that connected the five major secret realms. After a while, he activated the incantations from the "Xuanhuang Sutra" to reveal the "gate" of the Transforming Dragon Secret Realm. He then used the word-formation secret technique of his Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother to assemble a dragon gate from all the "gates" he could detect.</p><p></p><p>[Source]: From the "Taiping Guangji" volume 466, "Water Creatures 3. Dragon Gate": "The Xin family's 'Records of the Three Qin' states: The Dragon Gate Mountain is located in the Hedong region. Yu dug through the mountain and opened a gate over a mile wide. The Yellow River flows through the middle, and the two banks are impassable for carts and horses... Every spring season, yellow carp from the sea rush to the streams and rivers to ascend the Dragon Gate. In one year, only seventy-two can succeed in ascending the Dragon Gate. As soon as they ascend the Dragon Gate, clouds and rain will follow, and heavenly fire will burn their tails, transforming them into dragons."</p><p></p><p>This was the record of the Dragon Gate from the previous world. Now, Xiong Mo, in order to achieve a more powerful transformation, has used the potential gates within his body to form a dragon gate, hoping that he too can cross the dragon gate like the seventy-two yellow carp and successfully transform into a dragon. Even though this is extremely dangerous, and the slightest carelessness of his primordial spirit could result in it being shattered and scattered under the backlash of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This will be a tribulation of the primordial spirit, a tribulation that has never been recorded before. A tribulation that originates from the Transforming Dragon Secret Realm within Xiong Mo, a tribulation that even a Saint-Emperor like Xiong Mo cannot avoid during his cultivation. Because most Saint-Emperors do not cultivate during their incubation period, or their cultivation is very slow. Xiong Mo, who has reached the Immortal Saint-Emperor realm within ten thousand years, is truly exceptional, going against the heavenly dao.</p><p></p><p>Since the darling of heaven and earth, the Saint-Emperor, is going against the heavenly dao, a tribulation will inevitably come.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I have reincarnation as a foundation, and the future Dao Tribulation will be much more dangerous than this. Come on!" Xiong Mo encouraged himself.</p><p></p><p>This is a trial, a trial that Xiong Mo has prepared for himself. He wants to experience the tribulation firsthand.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating only the nature and not the life force, this is the primary ailment of cultivation. Cultivating only the ancestral nature and not the elixir, the yin spirit will have difficulty entering the Saint-Realm." Xiong Mo knows the first two lines of this divination song.</p><p></p><p>The tribulation he has summoned is not only to temper his primordial spirit, but more importantly, his Dao heart.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that Xiong Mo's Dao heart is far inferior to his Spiritual Treasure Senior Brother's. If his Dao heart is not strong enough, even if he attains the Immortal Saint-Emperor realm in this era, his Immortal Dao may still be hopeless. This is absolutely not what Xiong Mo wants.</p><p></p><p>"Creaking."</p><p></p><p>The dragon gate opened wide, emanating endless radiance, revealing the profound transformations within.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit flipped and stood atop the black and yellow great dragon, flying towards the dragon gate.</p><p></p><p>Under the feedback of the laws of heaven and earth, this process of ascending the dragon is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, fierce winds blew out from the gate, almost tearing Xiong Mo's primordial spirit apart. Numerous wounds now covered his primordial spirit, and he could only repeatedly use the Mending Heavens Technique to repair them. After a while, it started raining. The wind and rain pierced through his primordial spirit, creating numerous micro-holes, making the Mending Heavens Technique barely able to keep up.</p><p></p><p>The sky grew increasingly gloomy, and a thunderclap rang out. Lightning struck directly at Xiong Mo's primordial spirit, leaving a web of lightning scars all over it, bringing both destructive power and life-giving vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo inevitably let out a agonized scream. This is Xiong Mo's first experience of the tribulation of heaven and earth. When the lightning struck his primordial spirit, the pain was excruciating, and the distance to the dragon gate seemed so hopeless. Bolts of lightning now surrounded Xiong Mo's primordial spirit and the black and yellow great dragon. Now, he can only rely on absorbing the life force within each lightning strike that hits him to maintain his existence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit will not be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>One day, two days, three days...seven days!</p><p></p><p>For a full seven days, Xiong Mo finally broke through the Dragon Gate amidst the wind, rain, and thunder.</p><p></p><p>The calamity of heaven and earth had passed. Boundless colorful clouds gathered before Xiong Mo's primordial spirit. Suddenly, a heavenly fire burst forth from the Dragon Gate, scorching Xiong Mo's primordial spirit and the large black and yellow dragon. This was a gift from heaven. It would further purify the primordial spirit and the great dragon, causing them to ascend.</p><p></p><p>In this sea of flames, Xiong Mo's primordial spirit and the great dragon underwent a rebirth no less magnificent than that of the physical body. The flames roared, as if a divine phoenix was undergoing its nirvana. The impurities in the primordial spirit were gradually refined, and when the transformation was complete, a pure yang-like Tao and principles gushed forth, as if they could depart the physical body and roam the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The great dragon also seemed to have shed its impurities, its entire body a deep yellow, already bearing the traces of the Tao and principles of heaven and earth, truly deserving the title of "true dragon."</p><p></p><p>In the forbidden land outside, a dragon's roar echoed, and then a dragon's shadow circled around the stone embryo, before dispersing with the wind, transforming into a deep yellow golden light that fell into the hand of the Taoist's illusory form, becoming a jade pendant embroidered with a true dragon, which was then worn at the waist.</p><p></p><p>The fourth anomaly, the deep yellow golden dragon, had been formed! Hu Yuan looked deeply at this phenomenon, and after a moment, softly said, "It has become even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's primordial spirit rode the now greatly transformed great dragon and continued to fly outward, seeing a yellow-earth-colored immortal platform.</p><p></p><p>Yes, this was his immortal platform, having been rebuilt to its final stage.</p><p></p><p>He stepped onto the immortal platform, bringing with him the accumulated sacred power and foundation gathered since the Whirlpool Sea, and began to refine the path contained within the platform.</p><p></p><p>The earth-yellow Tao rhythm dispersed and coalesced again. In the end, it transformed into a faint deep yellow Tao rhythm, occasionally flashing with deep blue light, a sense of sacredness and solemnity beginning to spread. This was the vitality that nurtured all things, this was the power that shaped all things, and this was the boundless creation.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, it has taken on the appearance befitting a sacred spirit," Xiong Mo sighed.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit standing on the immortal platform began to ascend, the first step, the second step, the third step, the fourth step. Returning to the peak of its original realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the great formation outside the stone embryo began to operate at its limit, with boundless essence infusing the stone embryo, providing assistance to Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Step!"</p><p></p><p>The fifth step was taken! The light of the immortal platform shone brightly, and the forbidden land also began to change. The night sky was shrouded, and a deep yellow star that also flashed with deep blue light entered Hu Yuan's vision. Yes, Xiong Mo had constructed that "sun" in the spatial realm into reality.</p><p></p><p>The fifth anomaly, the appearance of the day star!</p><p></p><p>This star descended from the sky and collapsed into a hairpin, becoming the hair ornament on the Taoist's head.</p><p></p><p>When the five anomalies had all merged into one, the five great secret realms could be said to have been completely rebuilt. "However, there is still something more important." Xiong Mo's expression was solemn, his near-pure yang primordial spirit gazing at the markings on the immortal platform.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of sacred power began to activate the heart-character secret, the Whirlpool Sea boiled, the chanting in the Tao Palace grew louder, the two-colored sacred power of the four extremes surged, the great dragon soared, and the primordial spirit on the immortal platform erupted with unprecedented power.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The five great secret realms roared, beginning their temporary initial integration. Instantly, the sacred power broke through its limitations, and thoughts and insights constantly increased, as if the constraints of realms had been unlocked! (End of this chapter)</p>

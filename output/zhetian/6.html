        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The creation of the Heavenly Restoration Technique has one final step: to comprehend the laws of nurturing the Sacred Spirit.</p><p></p><p>This step is relatively simple for Xiong Mo, because he is currently in the state of being nurtured as a Sacred Spirit. In this state, it is very easy for him to comprehend the relevant laws of nurturing a Sacred Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Time flies, and over eight thousand years have passed. Now the creation of the Heavenly Restoration Technique has reached its final stage.</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose and the sunlight shone into the valley, a flash of spiritual light suddenly appeared in Xiong Mo's mind. Instantly, all the key points and realizations were connected by this spiritual light. Based on the Earth Dao as the foundation, Xiong Mo's exclusive Heavenly Restoration Technique was successfully created! And because of the successful creation of the Heavenly Restoration Technique, his past accumulations and realizations were rapidly converted into cultivation, surpassing the threshold of becoming a Saint. Finally, he stopped at the third small platform of the Immortal Four Saints, and quickly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Restoration Technique has been successfully created, and my cultivation has reached the third small platform of the Immortal Four Saints! And there are still 1,980,000 years before the complete collapse of space, the situation is very promising!"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Fengchu used 700,000 years to attain the Mundane Immortal, and I've spent more than double the time, so it shouldn't be a problem, right? He Ye Fengchu has his own advantages, and I have mine too!"</p><p></p><p>He was so excited that if he wasn't in the state of being nurtured, Xiong Mo would have set off some firecrackers to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>Since the Heavenly Restoration Technique was successfully created, he temporarily lost the sense of urgency, and Xiong Mo directly returned to his pre-transmigration state - slacking off! "After so many years, no one has come to find me, and no one will come in the future, right?" Xiong Mo thought as he gradually fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiong Mo was dreaming of being able to nurture himself to perfection and then emerge and attain the Dao, an unexpected event arrived as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, about ten miles away from the mountain where Xiong Mo was being nurtured, an exploration team from a sect was resting there.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Master! The Dragon Vein Compass has reacted!" A plump young man holding an object resembling a Bagua compass ran towards the middle-aged uncle sitting in the shade of a tree.</p><p></p><p>"Laixiang, don't get so excited, it's just a reaction, right? Tell me, which direction did it detect a small source vein?" The middle-aged uncle slowly sipped his tea.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's not a small source vein! It's a small dragon vein! We've hit the jackpot! We've hit the jackpot!" Laixiang excitedly waved the Dragon Vein Compass in his hand, already imagining how to use the dragon marrow he would get.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged uncle almost spat out the tea in his mouth upon hearing this. After swallowing the tea, he immediately stood up, snatched the Dragon Vein Compass from Laixiang's hand, and started calculating with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's right in the center of the position! About ten miles from here! Come, follow me!" The middle-aged uncle took out a talisman, activated it, and immediately pulled Laixiang's hand and ran towards the center of the camp.</p><p></p><p>"Master, aren't we going to find the dragon vein? Why are we running towards the center of the camp?" Laixiang looked puzzled at his master.</p><p></p><p>"Fool! Not to mention the consequences if we secretly swallow the dragon vein and get discovered, how can a Fourth Extreme Cultivator and a Dao Palace Cultivator like us go and dig up a dragon vein? And if even you can detect the dragon vein, the others won't be able to find it, right?" The middle-aged uncle directly slapped the back of Laixiang's head in frustration.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Transcendent Cultivator with an immortal-like bearing walked over and smiled, saying, "Huyan, don't keep slapping your disciple's head, or he'll become stupid. What's the matter that you're looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the elder say this, Laixiang immediately glanced at his master, as if saying, "Did you hear that? If you keep slapping me, no one will take care of you when you're old."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan did not pay attention to his disciple, and walked up to the elder, bowing and responding, "Senior Brother Lu Yao, Lai Xiang just used the Dragon Vein Compass and discovered a small dragon vein."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao asked with some confusion, "Wasn't there nothing detected in this location before?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan responded, "No, it's just that we suddenly discovered earth energy fluctuations with the aura of a small dragon vein."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's expression immediately became serious, and Hu Yuan and Lai Xiang also sensed the problem.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, let me first find a few other elders, gather everyone together, and then we'll go take a look, fully equipped. You two wait at the center of the camp," Lu Yao answered after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, several powerful cultivators gathered at the center of the camp after receiving the news. Lu Yao stood before the group and began to explain the situation: "This is how it is. What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>"We must go, the dragon vein can not only produce dragon marrow for cultivation in the Dragon Transformation Forbidden Land, but can also be used for spirit gathering, which can serve as the foundation of our sect," said an elderly-looking middle-aged woman cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, we must go! Even if it's a trap, with so many powerful experts here, even a Monarch would not be our match!" the bear-like old man said while pounding the table.</p><p></p><p>"And you?" Lu Yao looked at the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"No objections."</p><p>"Go, the dragon vein is very important."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's prepare to depart," Lu Yao concluded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Bear Mu was suddenly awakened. He found a middle-aged man holding something resembling a Bagua compass approaching, and it seemed to be pointing directly at him.</p><p></p><p>"Little Hu, is it here?" the white-haired woman asked.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Fu Li, this is the place. This is the source of the earth energy fluctuations and dragon vein aura," Hu Yuan replied, gesturing with his hand seals while observing the Vein Compass.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon vein is right here," Hu Yuan pointed at the location where Bear Mu was.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the targeted Bear Mu immediately understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>"I should have cleaned up the traces of my breakthrough immediately." Bear Mu was filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, don't move. Someone has broken through here, no more than three days ago. And it was most likely a Monarch-level cultivator," Lu Yao said after sensing the surrounding aura.</p><p></p><p>"A Monarch? Breakthrough to Saint-Emperor?!" Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, most likely. Otherwise, the spiritual energy here would not be so concentrated, which fits the records of a Saint-Emperor's breakthrough in the sect," Lu Yao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the earth energy and dragon vein?" the bear-like old man asked, slapping his own forehead.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Lu Yao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know?! Then what do we do now?" The others looked at each other, their eyes filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you don't know! Hurry up and leave! Go back to your sects. Don't just stand here," Bear Mu was anxious, afraid that they would really come and dig up the dragon vein, and uncover him in the process.</p><p></p><p>"The bold will die, the timid will starve! It's just a Saint-Emperor, our sect has them too! Little Hu, tell me how to do it. I'll go dig out the dragon vein!" the bear-like old man suddenly said fiercely.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

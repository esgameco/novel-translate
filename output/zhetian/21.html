        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"400 years later, in a battle, Sect Leader Yang Shan, with her cultivation at the half-Saint level, and over 30 Dao Ancestor Elders, burned their life essence and used a Saint Artifact to slay four Saint-level corpses."</p><p></p><p>"."</p><p></p><p>"After Sect Leader Yang Shan's retirement, Li Xiao became the new Sect Leader, the fifth-generation inheritor. He is the teacher of the Sect's Spiritual Treasure Saint."</p><p></p><p>"."</p><p></p><p>"And 50 years ago, a great calamity occurred. The corpse of a Xian Five Saint-Emperor broke through the frontlines, and six half-Saints, over 70 Dao Ancestor cultivators, all perished, while the rest of the cultivators at lower realms were also heavily injured or killed. In this battle, many of the Sect's mid-to-high-level combat forces and Saint Artifacts were either killed or destroyed."</p><p></p><p>The teacher also revealed a sorrowful expression when recounting this.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Spiritual Treasure Saint breakthrough in the midst of the battle and slew that corpse on the spot, ending the Sect's great disaster. Regrettably, the surviving Elders from that great calamity have still not fully recovered."</p><p></p><p>"The disciples represented by the Spiritual Treasure Saint are the Sect's sixth-generation inheritors. Hmm, your Shibo Hu Yuan is also a sixth-generation inheritor and of the same generation as the Spiritual Treasure Saint."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Spiritual Treasure Saint is the Sect's first Saint in two thousand years, so he was given a Dao title and is addressed as 'Saint', which is both a reverence for his immense power and a respect for his contributions to the Sect."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo was now shocked, not expecting to eavesdrop and end up receiving this history lesson in the lecture hall.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined the cruelty of the corpse calamity.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Tian Xia era, even a Xian Two Grandmaster could live for a thousand years! If they found some longevity resources, living for 1,200 or 1,300 years would be no problem at all!</p><p></p><p>Now in the Mythic Era, resources and the Dao are much better than the Tian Xia era! Yet even half-Saints couldn't live past a thousand years! Previously, Elder Brother Ling Bao and that group of Elders had mentioned the corpse calamity, but seeing the images projected by the teacher and hearing the explanation, Xiong Mo was still deeply shaken from within.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Ling Bao, when will you go and attain Dao Enlightenment to save the world? I don't want to be casually drowned in the corpse calamity!" Xiong Mo cried out in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He swore that he had never wished more for the Venerable Ling Bao to appear immediately!</p><p></p><p>Until the sunset and the lecture hall was dismissed, Xiong Mo's mood finally settled.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go and take a look at other places in the Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So, that's roughly what happened," Xiong Mo explained to Hu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So you just snuck out of the forbidden area and wandered around the Sect?" Hu Yuan's expression grew increasingly dark.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the absence of the Spiritual Treasure Saint, he was Xiong Mo's "second guardian", tasked with watching over and caring for Xiong Mo. And now that Xiong Mo had wandered around the Sect, he only just found out, which he simply could not accept.</p><p></p><p>The key issue now was not this, but the fact that an unknown Saint-level spiritual entity was now roaming the Sect, which could cause unimaginable chaos!</p><p></p><p>The outer disciples knew of Xiong Mo's existence as a Saint Spiritual Embryo, after all, Ling Bao's book "How Xiong Mo was Raised" had been published. But it is common knowledge that a Saint Spiritual Embryo cannot be casually moved around during its incubation stage - this is something the entire Sect knows. They do not know that Xiong Mo can freely move around even in his incubation stage.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Escaping the forbidden area, wandering around the sect.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, it should be fine, I don't think anyone has discovered me. I was just secretly wandering around the living area of the sect disciples, um, and also listening to their interesting life stories," Xiong Mo's expression became increasingly awkward.</p><p></p><p>"There's no way it's fine! Ever since the frontline was torn open last time, and some corpses breached the sect's grand formation, the Sacred Artifact Immortal has directly covered the surrounding hundred miles with sacred formations. Even a Great Saint may not be able to hide! You've definitely been discovered! If it weren't for the jade talisman aura on your spiritual body, you might have already been struck by lightning!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe! Eavesdropping on the disciples' conversations? Do you know how terrifying the formations within the disciples' living area are? Once those formations are activated, even a Great Saint may not be able to escape unharmed!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the Sacred Artifact Immortal reveal the secret of the word-formation in his sermon? How could you not have noticed the dense sacred formations in the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Before Xiong Mo could finish speaking, Hu Yuan suddenly burst out, losing his usual composure, even momentarily forgetting that the person in front of him was a Venerable Five Saints Immortal who could easily slap him to death.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo really wanted to say that he hadn't fully comprehended the word-formation secret yet, and even with external help, it would be impossible to fully grasp it in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>This was a future Celestial Lord-level secret technique, after all. Even though the Sacred Artifact Senior Brother hadn't broken through to the Venerable Six Saints realm yet, the current word-formation secret was absolutely a bug-level Great Saint peak secret technique, on par with his own Heart Talisman secret. One could imagine the difficulty of comprehending the word-formation secret just by considering how much effort he had put into raising his Heart Talisman secret to its current level.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Hu Yuan's reddened face and his trembling finger pointing at him, he couldn't bring himself to say these words. After all, it seemed to be his own fault.</p><p></p><p>"Um, Elder Hu, when are you going to undergo the Tribulation Crossing?" Xiong Mo was trying to change the subject.</p><p></p><p>In the Profound Dao Sect, as long as one's cultivation reached the Immortal Realm, they could become an Elder.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Hu Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, we'll talk about the welcoming later. The Sacred Artifact Immortal should be back soon, since you've triggered the sacred formations. Wait for him," Hu Yuan said and then left the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the sound of thunder echoed, indicating that Hu Yuan had released his divine power and spiritual aura to undergo the Tribulation Crossing.</p><p></p><p>As for Xiong Mo? He was quietly contemplating in the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>"Why does this feel so familiar?" The gradually awakened Xiong Mo felt something was off, as if he had experienced this before.</p><p></p><p>"When did I experience this?" His expression became increasingly strange.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, this is the same feeling I had when I got in trouble in elementary school and the teacher called my parents."</p><p></p><p>The little boy (Xiong Mo) didn't listen, used some methods (astral projection) to escape the elementary school (the forbidden area), and went out to play. During his wanderings, he was directly detected by the monitoring system (the sacred formations). The system detected the little boy (Xiong Mo) and automatically sent a message to the busy parent (the Sacred Artifact Senior Brother). The teacher (Hu Yuan) was furious about some matter (his cultivation) and didn't know about this incident until the little boy (Xiong Mo) returned to the elementary school (the forbidden area) seven days later. Now the parent (the Sacred Artifact Senior Brother) is on their way.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, I should explain and apologize." Xiong Mo now didn't know what to feel, it was just so complicated.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Artifact Senior Brother and Hu Yuan entered the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

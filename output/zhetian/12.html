        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Possibly stimulated by the Xuan Venerable, the five great secret realms within him roared to life, spontaneously combining into the most perfect form. Even if it was temporary, it was still astonishingly impressive.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, boundless divine power surged forth from the Wheel Sea, passing through the Five Dao Palaces, propelled by the power of the Four Extremes, soaring into the sky like a divine dragon. It ascended the Immortal Platform, emitting dazzling radiance! The Numinous Treasure instantly broke through the Divine Prohibition, and on the foundation of the Divine Prohibition, it began to rapidly delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>The Killing Formation in his left hand began its first full-power operation, bestowing his body with unparalleled might in an instant, as if the surrounding world was starting to shatter, with the elements of earth, water, wind, and fire reappearing! In his right hand, he firmly grasped an immortal sword bearing the "Qingping" Dao Seal.</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary immortal sword this was!</p><p></p><p>The mere display of its keen edge caused the surrounding Dao and laws to become unstable!</p><p></p><p>"Please, Xuan Venerable, accept this sword!!" The Numinous Treasure, exuding an extremely cold and murderous intent, directly pointed the Qingping Sword at the Xuan Venerable! Boundless sacred power, accompanied by the chilling killing intent that defied description, like the remnants of a world-ending calamity in the starry sky, merged perfectly with the Qingping Sword as it struck towards the Xuan Venerable, empowered by the terrifying formation of the earth, water, wind, and fire!</p><p></p><p>The power of this strike, primarily based on the Numinous Treasure's sacred Dao laws, directly surpassed the limits of the Immortal Five Saint Kings, reaching the level of the Immortal Six Great Saints in an instant, and the killing force was still frantically advancing towards the threshold of the Quasi-Emperors!</p><p></p><p>Well, in this mythical era, the Quasi-Emperors might be called Quasi-Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But, regardless, the figures of the Dao Seekers rushing towards the Numinous Treasure were directly shredded in the thunderous tribulation. As for the Xuan Emperor, the target of the Qingping Sword? There was no trace of him left in this thunderous tribulation. In other words, the Numinous Treasure would no longer encounter the Xuan Venerable in the upcoming confrontation with these human-shaped Heavenly Tribulations! In just one hour, the entire Heavenly Tribulation had been thoroughly decimated by the Numinous Treasure! Today, the Numinous Treasure had broken through the Immortal Five Saint Kings and taken the first step onto the third small platform of the Immortal Five!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Damn it," Xiong Mo's forehead was covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying is Senior Brother Lingbao?!" </p><p></p><p>"It's just a tribulation of the Immortal Five Saint Kings, but the peak attack power is already approaching that of a Quasi-Emperor!" Xiong Mo was truly unable to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>He had just been diligently studying when a faint aura of world-ending calamity and killing intent suddenly reached him from the distance. He had initially thought it was just a hallucination caused by his tense state of mind, and had just closed his "textbook" to rest for a minute or two. But before he could even adjust his mindset, the profound meaning and killing intent emanating from Senior Brother Lingbao's strike nearly stopped Xiong Mo's heart.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sovereign of the Immortal Three might not have been able to sense that distant, mighty power. But Xiong Mo, as a Saint Spirit still in the incubation stage, had a realm of the Immortal Four Saints!</p><p></p><p>Well, never mind whether Xiong Mo is a true Saint Spirit or not. Now, he has the "Heart Sutra" secret technique, a heavenly gift, constantly operating within him! Not to mention, ever since he had derived the "Heart Sutra" secret technique, it had been running without cease!</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo immediately recognized the nature of that strike.</p><p></p><p>It was a strike with power approaching that of a Quasi-Emperor!</p><p></p><p>That dazzling killing intent, that boundless chill, if he wasn't still in his stone embryo and had nothing in his bladder, he would have definitely wet himself! He was just an incubating Saint Spirit baby, after all!</p><p></p><p>Although he had been cultivating in the womb for over 10,000 years and had a heavenly gift by his side, as someone who had lived in a peaceful environment in his previous life, he had never experienced anything like this before! It was too thrilling!"So this is the power of a Veiled Heaven Immortal?!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly a battle prowess that defies the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"It's simply outrageous, absolutely outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is totally off the charts!" </p><p></p><p>"Not just the Eight Prohibitions, this is at least the Fifteen Prohibitions!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there will be legends of the Zhu Xian Sword Formation slaying immortals in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Lingbao, you definitely opened something up, right?!"</p><p></p><p>"Even I, with my cheats, can't compare to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Freak! Demonic!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiong Mo just wanted to rant furiously.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Exalted Lord Yu Yu of the Immortal Ancient has returned?!"</p><p></p><p>"If it's the Exalted Lord Yu Yu, then that's completely normal, after all, he's an almost-Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xiong Mo's forehead was covered in cold sweat, because the Immortal Treasure Venerable from the Covering Heaven era was quite similar to the Exalted Lord Yu Yu of the Immortal Ancient. Didn't the Exalted Lord Yu Yu also have the Great Formation of Slaying Immortals?  Xiong Mo thought, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his previous life, someone had said online that the Immortal Treasure Venerable was just a similar flower to the Exalted Lord Yu Yu of the Immortal Ancient.</p><p></p><p>The probability of this was quite high. "I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo took a whole day to recover from this.</p><p></p><p>"The Exalted Lord Yu Yu shouldn't have returned, otherwise the future Ye Fengchu wouldn't have failed to notice the Immortal Treasure Venerable. After all, so many years have passed, with his foundation, he should normally have reached the Immortal King realm."</p><p></p><p>"Headache-inducing, I don't want to think about it anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo began to consider some practical issues, such as: "Will all the Dao Attainers in the future Mythical Era be freakish demonic beings like Senior Martial Brother Lingbao? If I have to compete with this kind of person for the position of Dao Attainer, even if I use the rebirth ability of my golden finger to cultivate for another million years, I might still not be their match!"</p><p></p><p>"Unless, during that million years, I have the help of Senior Martial Brother Lingbao... Hmm, and it would have to be the post-Dao Attainment Immortal Treasure Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I should be grateful that multiple Dao Attainers can coexist in the Mythical Era?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xiong Mo's head started to hurt again.</p><p></p><p>"I should just read the book."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo began to re-read the "textbook" given to him by Hu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingbao was returning to the frontlines. He had just finished clearing the corpses that had been drawn to him during his tribulation, and now he just wanted to properly sort out the gains from his tribulation in the divine city on the frontlines.</p><p></p><p>As Lingbao continued to advance, the divine city that defended against the corpse calamity was already within sight.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Treasure Saint." The disciple guarding the city gates immediately responded upon seeing Lingbao.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lingbao nodded and headed towards the central tower. This was the center of the divine city, and also Lingbao's usual cultivation place.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Treasure Saint." Lu Yao came over as Lingbao was about to enter the tower.</p><p></p><p>"Also, Xiong Mo the Saint said he wants you to supplement his Immortal Four Saints studies a year from now." Lu Yao handed Lingbao a jade slip that recorded Xiong Mo's current situation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this matter, in addition to the Profound Mysteries Sect not being very confident in Xiong Mo yet and wanting Lingbao to supervise him, there was also Xiong Mo's own intention.</p><p></p><p>Because after Xiong Mo had derived the Heart Sutra Secret, he could make up the "lessons" for the Immortal Four Saints and below within a year. If he wanted to keep up this speed for the "lessons" above the Immortal Four Saints, he would need his senior martial brother Lingbao to give the lectures. Moreover, a year later, Lingbao's insights from his tribulation should have been fully digested.</p><p></p><p>So after sensing that Lingbao would soon summon Hu Yuan and tell him his own thoughts, Xiong Mo told Hu Yuan his idea. After all, isn't that how one uses one's senior martial brother? Xiong Mo recalled his experiences in college, and nodded. No problem, back then, when there were issues, it was his senior martial brother who helped resolve them.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

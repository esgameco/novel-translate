        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Elder Lingbao's expression became serious as he said, "Now after reading the sacred scriptures of the Xuanxuan Sect, have you realized the problems in your previous cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo nodded, "I have indeed discovered some issues."</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had indeed overlooked some problems.</p><p></p><p>[Data Analysis Panel - Simulation: You can input the rules/essences/Dao that you have comprehended to conduct simulations. The simulation ability is related to your cultivation/comprehension of the rules/Dao/principles/essences. You can use the ultra-high essence of space to accelerate the simulation.</p><p></p><p>Negative State: If the level or completeness of the inputted rules/Dao/principles is insufficient, it may lead to inaccurate simulation results/inability to simulate/progress being stuck.]</p><p></p><p>The key point is - [Simulation results may not be accurate]</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had rushed into the simulations without considering things thoroughly, and he also didn't pay much attention to this negative state, and now he is suffering the consequences. Moreover, most of the simulations were about the feasibility and whether he could break through to the next realm and how to do so.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back on it now, he is covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao opened the Martial Dao Heaven's Eye to take a look at Xiong Mo's condition within the stone embryo.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you did not walk the path chosen by heaven and earth, but instead carved out your own earthly path, and have cultivated to the Immortal Sage Realm. Elder Brother affirms your natural talent."</p><p></p><p>Lingbao once again affirmed Xiong Mo's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"However, because you chose to open up your own path, there are many critical points that you have not perfected. With your current scripture cultivation, whether you have any forbidden battle prowess is questionable."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he continued.</p><p></p><p>"First, you must be clear about what cultivation is."</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing the words of Buddhism, it is 'one flower, one world, one leaf, one Bodhi.' Similarly, our body is also as such. You can't see anything, but it contains endless 'gates,' just like the countless dust particles in the universe. The seemingly insignificant body contains uncountable 'gates.' Continuously opening these gates and discovering the 'true self' is cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"In your secret realm, even at the Immortal Sage Realm, you have not cultivated any extraordinary phenomena or divine form. This means that you have not opened enough of these 'gates.'"</p><p></p><p>"When I was in the Whirlpool Secret Realm, I cultivated according to the scriptures of the predecessors, so the 'sea-ascending clear moon' phenomenon appeared as a starting point. When I reached the Four Extremes Secret Realm, my understanding of the Dao and principles deepened, and this phenomenon naturally took on the rhythm I desired."</p><p></p><p>"At the Dao-Severing stage, I attained insight into my own Dao, saw through my true nature, and my Dao cultivation deepened, so the phenomenon also evolved accordingly."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a wave appeared and covered the surroundings, then slowly receded, revealing a silver moon hidden in the sea swell, with a pure and elegant charm permeating the area. Then the round moon slowly rotated and transformed into a mixed primal qi, which then split into two, becoming the intertwined Yin-Yang fish. After a while, five-colored radiance appeared, and all things were created.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao withdrew the holy power he had emanated and said, "This is my phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>Not only Hu Yuan sitting next to Lingbao was dumbfounded, but Xiong Mo was also stunned. "Elder Brother Lingbao, was the previous one really the 'sea-ascending clear moon' phenomenon of the Whirlpool Secret Realm? And didn't you cultivate destruction?"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo remembered the 'sea-ascending clear moon' phenomenon from the Whirlpool Secret Realm, which he had used when fighting against Yan Ruyu during the battle for the Imperial Weapon at the Four Extremes. But it didn't seem to have the pure Dao rhythm that Lingbao described. Oh, Lingbao must have added that. But the subsequent transformation of the moon into the primal qi and the various phenomena that unfolded from it, Xiong Mo truly did not understand.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao sighed, "Shidi, your understanding of the Dao and principles is still somewhat one-sided."</p><p></p><p>"My Dao is the imminent destruction of all things, this you should be very clear about, Shidi."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But my Dao is the Tao that generates the myriad things. The evolution of the anomalies symbolizes the generation of the Supreme Ultimate from the Limitless, and the Supreme Ultimate forming the Five Phases - this is the process of the Dao. It can be said to be the generation of the Heavenly Dao, from which the heavens and earth have their norms, and all spiritual beings return to their origins."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan interjected at this point: "So, Venerable Lord of the Numinous Treasure, does that mean you have two sacred Dao principles?"</p><p></p><p>The Numinous Treasure responded to Hu Yuan's question: "No, I only have one sacred Dao principle. If this principle were to be named, it would be called the Numinous Treasure Principle. Generation and destruction are just two aspects of my Dao path."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo murmured: "So you're saying the Numinous Treasure Dao is both the Dao of generation and the Dao of destruction?"</p><p></p><p>This conclusion shattered Xiong Mo's worldview that he had cultivated for over ten thousand years - he never imagined that the great Dao and principles in Zhetian could be realized in this way.</p><p></p><p>However, in the Taoist classics of his previous life, the "Numinous Treasure" of the Venerable Lord of the Numinous Treasure seemed to symbolize the generation of the Supreme Ultimate from the Limitless, and the Supreme Ultimate forming the Five Phases - the process of the Dao and the generation of the Heavenly Dao with its norms. Thinking about it this way, it seemed to make sense. If it were only about the "End Times", the Venerable Brother Numinous Treasure would not have been known as one of the Three Pure Ones of the Dao tradition in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Numinous Treasure continued: "We began to comprehend the Dao in the Four Extremes Secret Realm, and the path of the Dao was roughly established when we severed the Dao. After reaching the level of the Four Sacred Persons, we will only absorb other beneficial elements to strengthen our own Dao, and at that time we can also establish our own schools and sects. This is also the origin of the title of 'Sage'."</p><p></p><p>"The main problem with Xiong Mo's Dao path right now is that it is too pure. His path only contains the Earth Dao, without any traces of the other Dao paths. His essence is sufficient, but it lacks breadth, making it easy to be constrained, and it will be difficult to overcome the Heavenly Tribulation in the future."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the Cloud Dao. It at least contains traces of the Water Dao, Wind Dao, and Fire Dao. If one cultivates the Cloud Dao, even if they do not reach mastery in the Water Dao, Wind Dao, and Fire Dao, they must have a corresponding foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Now, Xiong Mo disciple needs to absorb the corresponding great Dao and principles to perfect his Earth Dao. Whether it's the cultivation scriptures, the Supplementing the Heavens technique, or the Heart Seal Secret, they all need to be adjusted."</p><p></p><p>The Numinous Treasure looked at Hu Yuan and said, "And your main task now is to quickly make a choice, whether to continue cultivating the Secret Realm or the Source Technique. Your talent is not enough to allow you to pursue both paths simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan scratched his head, "I understand, I will make a choice quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will lecture on the Dao. Focus your mind."</p><p></p><p>The Numinous Treasure began to expound on his own scriptures, occasionally interspersing the scriptures of other Sages, citing classics and precedents. Soon, the forbidden land was filled with the faint sounds of the Dao, and the scattered golden flowers brought great harvests to Xiong Mo. As for Hu Yuan, as he listened, he fell into a state of breakthrough, absorbing the golden flowers that had condensed during the Numinous Treasure's lecture. If it were not for the array formations covering this forbidden land, temporarily concealing the Heavenly Secrets, the Thunderous Tribulation would have already struck down.</p><p></p><p>One year, two years, three years.</p><p></p><p>Three years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of the Dao gradually faded, and the Numinous Treasure's lecture had ended.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiong Mo and Hu Yuan still in deep contemplation, he extended his hand to add another layer of prohibition, to maintain their state of Dao comprehension as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>He quietly left, leaving only the golden flowers on the ground of the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Hu Yuan was the first to regain consciousness. After all, his cultivation was not high, he was just here to "audit" Xiong Mo's "class". He didn't understand much, at least not as much as Xiong Mo. It didn't take him long to sort out his insights. However, he had already entered the Transforming Dragon Secret Realm, and had even skipped two realms, and until the first layer of the Immortal Platform, there would be no insurmountable obstacles in his realm.</p><p></p><p>Turning around and looking around, he didn't find the Numinous Treasure. He then looked at the forbidden stone chamber covered by the prohibition, and paid his respects towards the direction of the front lines of the sky. He then left the forbidden land to undergo the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The forbidden land became completely quiet, with only the Sage-Immortal Xiong Mo left to continue his Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Reality, the Stargazing Tower.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim, with a body still somewhat weak, gazed at the dusk across the globe, his expression a bit dazed. He sighed softly, "Is this the true 'God'? Such a terrifying power, in the moment of becoming a god, the spiritual essence of the entire world has spontaneously gathered under His authority."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is the true 'God'. Reaching this point, His authority will represent the abstract and the concept. And Ormil's authority is 'Dusk', so He represents 'Dusk' itself, the embodiment of 'Dusk'." The Hidden Sage, who had returned to the stargazing platform unnoticed, explained to the Elven King.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim looked at the figure that had disappeared for a while and then returned, always feeling that there was some subtle change happening on him, but it was difficult to see and describe. Before long, this subtle change could no longer be perceived, as if nothing had happened at all.</p><p></p><p>However, Suniya Soleim knew that something had indeed changed on this former exile. He had great confidence in his own spiritual gifts, otherwise he could not have survived in the forbidden land for so long.</p><p></p><p>But Suniya Soleim directly ignored this discovery. Because the master of this tower, it seems, did not want other extraordinary beings to know that there was such a subtle change happening on him.</p><p></p><p>After being "detoxified" by the sacred flames, this once proud Elven King also became more aware, knowing that certain things could not be mentioned, knowing that certain things had to be pretended to be unknown.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim looked at the giant king, who was walking on the earth wrapped in dusk, returning to the Giant King City amidst the cheers of many giants. He said with a touch of envy and longing, "The Giant King did not chase the demons, nor did he go to deal with the corpse of Farbuti. Is he now returning to the Giant King City to celebrate?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, with such power, the Giant Clan can now occupy the entire continent. Any extraordinary being, before truly becoming a 'God', will face the fate of extinction in the face of that Dusk."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Sage heard this and did not say anything, but his expression became somewhat subtle.</p><p></p><p>[Ritual: Apotheosis Ritual (Dusk Giant Â· Ormil Exclusive) Level: Angel King ~ True God Effect:</p><p></p><p>(1) The only path for the "Warrior" </p><p>(2) Promotion to the "Warrior" path, Sequence Zero, Dusk Giant</p><p></p><p>Requirements:</p><p></p><p>(1) Become the Giant King, and have five or more Angel Rank beings witness the coronation</p><p>(2) Turn the Giant King City and the Giant King Court into the ritual center, and slay one "King" face-to-face within the ritual coverage</p><p></p><p>Special:</p><p></p><p>(1) This Apotheosis Ritual was derived by Ormil, and does not have universal applicability</p><p>(2) This Apotheosis Ritual is rather rough, with multiple errors and optimizable parts]</p><p></p><p>This is the information displayed on the panel, and also the judgment of the "Mysterious Yellow Immortal King".</p><p></p><p>In this era before the Blasphemy Stele has emerged, Ormil, with only the partial mystical knowledge provided by Xiumo, was able to complete such a "Warrior" path Apotheosis Ritual, which is already an extraordinary achievement.</p><p></p><p>If this were in the "Veiled World", it would be equivalent to successfully establishing the Immortal Dao in about three hundred years. Although this "Immortal" has a very high water content, roughly equivalent to swallowing the Celestial Immortal Fruit and entering the Immortal Dao realm, the kind that can still be overthrown by the Supremes, but it is enough to prove His talent.</p><p></p><p>However, the strong always have stronger opponents.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the "Primal Creator", even Ormil, who has already grasped the authority of Dusk, has to be defeated.</p><p></p><p>Now Ormil, this Giant King, has successfully ascended to the status of a deity through the Apotheosis Ritual. But the "Primal" spiritual imprint within Him has also fully awakened, directly affecting His mental state. The Hidden Sage, who is more familiar with Ormil, can already guess the increasingly difficult physical condition He is in.</p><p></p><p>If He can still persevere, this Giant King would not have returned to the Giant King City so hastily, without even dealing with the extraordinary properties extracted from Farbuti. If the condition allowed, with His temperament, He should have directly led the giant army to invade Farbuti's territory and slaughter the demons.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the Hidden Sage, outside the Giant King City, Farbuti's corpse has slowly begun to release its extraordinary properties.</p><p></p><p>Just wait a while, and the two pieces of "Sinner" path Sequence One "Polluted King" extraordinary properties will appear. As long as the "Abyss" uniqueness carried by Farbuti is added, as well as the piece of extraordinary property in His hand, that would be another path to divinity.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this thing is too deeply connected to the Desire Mother Tree. To become the "Sinner" path, Sequence Zero, "Abyss", the end result is to be unconsciously polluted by the Desire Mother Tree, and ultimately be controlled by this Outer God in the end. Until the last moment, even one's own consciousness will be distorted, sincerely and passionately worshiping this "Mother".</p><p></p><p>For this kind of path that can be manipulated by Outer Gods, the Hidden Sage, who has already become Sequence Zero, does not want to directly touch it. Even though the Outer Pantheon outside the barrier poses no threat to the Hidden Sage, who has now become a deity.</p><p></p><p>But their ability to manipulate the rules is like a rotten dog skin plaster, extremely clingy and disgusting. And due to the special nature of the Outer Pantheon, their immortality is extremely exaggerated, especially the three pillars of the universe, which are difficult to truly extinguish within this universe.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Farbuti's corpse, the Hidden Sage's mouth curled up slightly, whispering in his heart, "But I don't look down on this 'dog skin plaster', but there are still people who can appreciate it, and can also divert the attention of those outside the barrier."</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand slightly, gently stroking the empty space, secretly prying open the underlying rules of the universe. And this silent and invisible fluctuation has not even been noticed by the "Celestial Sovereigns", "Gods", or the "Mother Goddess".</p><p></p><p>The "Polluted King" extraordinary property that was originally in His hand has now appeared on Farbuti's body, and is compatible with the two extraordinary properties that are being released, as well as the uniqueness He carries.</p><p></p><p>The condition of Farbuti's corpse outside the Giant King City, naturally caught the attention of all the extraordinary beings with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>After this corpse gained an additional piece of extraordinary property, not only did a stream of murky saliva flow from the mouths of the demons gazing at this corpse. Even Quasitron, the Alien King, who was straining to maintain his own sanity and extremely unwilling to approach the Giant King City, took a small step forward in the restraint of thorns and thorny roses, his eyes revealing a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Madness of Reason.</p><p></p><p>The Destruction Wolf Freygrla, who was already prepared from the beginning, was driven by destruction and madness, shrouding his form in darkness and secrecy, leading his own wolf pack out of their territory, disregarding the power displayed by the Giant King, and approaching this extraordinary and unique quality through the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the entire Eastern Continent seemed to be in turmoil, with almost all the owners of the angelic positions flocking here, driven by the frenzy of the desire to gather the extraordinary qualities.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying divine war broke out again.</p><p></p><p>The scale of this divine war was even larger than the war between Ormil and Fabuti, and although the battle did not take place in the physical realm but in the spiritual realm, the terrifying aftershocks spread from the spiritual realm to the physical realm, like a series of horrific natural disasters, causing the deaths of countless supernatural beings.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim, who maintained his reason on the Observation Tower, saw the frenzied scene in the spiritual realm and his expression showed horror. "They have gone mad. The extraordinary qualities extracted by Fabuti are not suitable for them. Once they swallow that extraordinary quality, they will..."</p><p></p><p>Realizing something, the Elf King immediately fell silent, as if he had never said anything. Only the slight trembling of his body could silently prove that he was aware of the terrifying secrets hidden behind this mad world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Suniya Soleim did not want to say it, but the Hidden Sage calmly revealed the "fate" hidden behind the scenes, "They will become 'gods', following in the footsteps of Ormil, one after another becoming 'gods', only their mental state will no longer be important."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Sage looked at the pale-faced Suniya Soleim with a smile on the corner of his mouth and asked in a low voice, "So, Elf King, Suniya Soleim, when are you going to use the extraordinary quality I gave you to become a 'god'?"</p><p></p><p>The "Celestial Venerable" wants to resurrect, so he must promote the birth of the Ancient Gods to activate the backup plan he laid down before. The "guest" inside the [Source Fortress] is one of them. The "God" also needs to promote the birth of the Ancient Gods to catalyze the birth of the "Ancient Sun God" and resurrect within him.</p><p></p><p>The Desire Mother Tree, the Chaos Son, the Fallen Mother Goddess, and other Outer Gods want to regain the torn source essence, and they also need a "mad god" to achieve the purpose of gathering the extraordinary qualities and source essence. The Superstar Overlord, the Destiny Ring, the Decaying King, and other Old Ones who crave to control more source essence, not to mention, are all quietly laying the groundwork.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the appearance of the Ancient Gods is inevitable. In this regard, whether it is the "Celestial Venerable", the "God", or the Old Ones outside the barrier, they have reached an unspoken consensus. Under their collective will, this is the "fate" that has been determined, and it cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>Now, even the "Mysterious Yellow Immortal King", who specializes in fate, has secretly intervened, making the appearance of the Ancient Gods even more certain.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim realized this, because the ongoing great war seemed to be a carefully prepared "performance", like a "puppet show" with the actors being controlled by strings.</p><p></p><p>If Suniya Soleim was indifferent to Ormil's deification war and did not see anything wrong with it. But after waking up from the madness, standing on the Observation Tower and observing this divine war in the spiritual realm from a "spectator" perspective, he could see a little something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Suniya Soleim looked at the Hidden Sage with a slight bitter smile, his face somewhat pale, "Can I choose not to become a 'god'? Can I take the Elf Clan and leave this continent to go elsewhere?"</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Sage interrupted the Elf King's words, and his cold words came out, "The Elf Clan has already entered the stage, and the audience outside has already taken their seats. The actors are not allowed to be absent."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Sage casually waved his hand, and the three extraordinary qualities and uniqueness that the "Sailor" had passed through automatically floated out from different places and came to Suniya Soleim's face, making the Elf King's face even paler, almost losing all color.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sounds came from the spiritual realm and entered the physical realm, invisible natural disasters ravaging the land, and the thick aura of death began to permeate the Eastern Continent, with tens of thousands of supernatural beings dying one after another. Their spiritual bodies floated from their corpses into the spiritual realm, constantly gathering in a region of desolation, gradually forming a world belonging to the dead.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Giant King, Ormil, the God of Twilight. What a powerful force! The next one to ascend the throne of the gods will be me, the Ancestor of the Phoenix, Greygarly!"</p><p></p><p>A giant bird covered in pale flames and mysterious floral patterns on its feathers slowly unfurled its wings in this rapidly forming world of the dead, and layers of illusory gates began to appear on its feathers.</p><p></p><p>The power of the dead silently and slowly permeated the spiritual realm, directly causing the wandering souls, the deceased, and the natural spirits in the spiritual realm that belonged to "death" to converge on this place and worship.</p><p></p><p>The pale flames on Greygarly's body were ignited at some unknown time, burning away all the "life" within it. In the blink of an eye, it turned to ashes in this nascent world of the dead, and its spiritual body also became a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Under the "death" of this Ancestor of the Phoenix, an even more terrifying aura of death suddenly spread out, causing the beings who were fighting for the "Abyss" to slowly stop their movements and turn their gaze to Greygarly.</p><p></p><p>Because this scene was similar to what had happened to Ormil not long ago, the spiritual essence that Greygarly was refining also gave them a sense of similarity to the Giant King's ascension to godhood.</p><p></p><p>Under the bombardment of the thick death aura, the world opened up by Greygarly was completely formed. And it was reborn in this realm of the dead, successfully taking the authority of "death" and ascending to the status of a god.</p><p></p><p>"In the name of I, the Ancestor of the Phoenix, Greygarly, this realm shall be the [Underworld], the final resting place of all the dead!"</p><p></p><p>The announcement bearing the authority of "death" echoed through the spiritual realm, letting all the existences in the spiritual realm know that a [Underworld] had been added to this world, and even the living in the physical realm could hear its majestic and subtly mad words.</p><p></p><p>And just after this Ancestor of the Phoenix had completed the establishment of this [Underworld] and made the announcement, a straight, wide, illusory, and colorless dark river appeared within the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, one could associate it with "death", "eternal sleep", "the end", "the abyss", and other symbolic things, as if this river was the embodiment of these concepts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

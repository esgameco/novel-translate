        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo began to explore each layer of the heavens, constantly deriving and verifying, trying to find the most stable and powerful cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After a thousand years of continuous derivation, the Dragon Transformation Scriptures were finally completed.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Transformation Realm could now be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>For normal cultivation of the Dragon Transformation Realm, dragon marrow is required. Dragon marrow is the essence nurtured by the dragon vein. The best dragon marrow for cultivating the Dragon Transformation Realm is that nurtured by the great dragon veins. In the central plains of the Buried Emperor Star, or the North Star, there are many divination masters and source technique masters who search for this dragon marrow, providing this cultivation resource to the major powers.</p><p></p><p>As for Xiong Mo, he is now in the nurturing stage and cannot set out to search for the dragon marrow of the great dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there is a hidden small dragon vein with abundant spiritual qi under this valley, which has not been exploited yet, and it is located right under Xiong Mo's feet.</p><p></p><p>The dragon marrow reserves of this small dragon vein are still quite abundant, and he can use the dragon marrow of this small dragon vein for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I hope there won't be any accidents this time. May the Three Pure Ones, the Buddha, and God bless me. Amen!" Xiong Mo swore that he had never been so devout before.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, man proposes, but God disposes, and the unexpected still occurred as expected. While cultivating, the dragon marrow was used up.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo discovered during cultivation that due to the lower grade of the dragon marrow, the tempering effect on his great dragon was not as expected. But he could not compromise, so he could only make up for the quality gap with quantity, and the dragon marrow of the small dragon vein was used up quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the dragon marrow of the small dragon vein was all used up, and he only managed to cultivate up to the eighth layer of the Dragon Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"@#$%*&..." Xiong Mo greeted the ancestral tree of the heavens with a string of profanities full of motherly love, before finally calming down.</p><p></p><p>"There's no other way, I can only wait for the small dragon vein to slowly condense the dragon marrow again," Xiong Mo said.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the small dragon vein to produce dragon marrow, Xiong Mo began to make preliminary derivations and creations of the Immortal Platform Realm scriptures.</p><p></p><p>It took him more than 2,700 years to collect enough dragon vein essence to continue the cultivation of the eighth and ninth layers of the Dragon Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later, the Dragon Transformation Realm reached its limit without any mind-blowing incidents.</p><p></p><p>"It's been so difficult for me, nearly five thousand years! I've finally arrived at the door of the Immortal Platform Realm," said Xiong Mo, who had become a renowned Dragon Transformation cultivator, feeling like he was about to cry from exhaustion.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly five thousand years, the Great Saints of the sixth layer of the Immortal Platform Realm must be almost in their graves by now, right?" Xiong Mo questioned his soul.</p><p></p><p>"How did the other geniuses cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't even mention Ye Fengchu, he's an outlier who's just cheating. But the other geniuses of the Eastern Wilderness, didn't they only need less than five hundred years to cultivate from the Revolving Sea to the Dragon Transformation Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, they have the resources and guidance from their sects or families. I have none of that. Well, that's normal then."</p><p></p><p>"The four essential elements of cultivation are Fa, Cai, LÃ¼, and Di. I only have one of them now. Slow cultivation is normal."</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not because of my poor aptitude. I am a holy spirit nurtured by heaven and earth, after all," Xiong Mo comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>Regaining his focus, Xiong Mo looked at his Immortal Platform and prepared to step onto the first step to become a Half-Step Paragon. The scriptures for the first step were already mostly complete, just needing to be put into practice.</p><p></p><p>"Step."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Platform scriptures activated, and the first step emitted a faint ochre light, permeating the rhythm of the earth nurturing all things.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo successfully stepped onto the first layer of the Immortal Platform, becoming a Half-Step Paragon.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..." Xiong Mo let out a deep sigh of relief, his whole body relaxing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Even though the Holy Spirit in the process of incubation has the external support given by the great Tao of Heaven and Earth, it has still been quite exhausting for it over the past five thousand years. After all, most of the time, the Holy Spirits in the process of incubation have spent in slumber, with very few being active for nearly five thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The relaxed Xiong Mo immediately fell into a deep sleep, and only the various secret realms were operating according to their innate scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years later, on a sunny afternoon after the rain, the sunlight slanted across the clouds that seemed to float in the valley, scattering dazzling light and forming a rainbow over the green mountains.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo woke up.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he noticed was that his cultivation had already reached the ninth small level of the first layer of the Immortal Terrace, standing at the door of the second layer of the Immortal Terrace.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this is cultivating while lying down! Thank the heavens for bestowing me with the status of a Holy Spirit, it's so great!" Xiong Mo recalled the scriptures of the second layer of the Immortal Terrace, and after carefully deducing them and finding no major issues, he began his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Ding."</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the second layer of the Immortal Terrace was successful, and Xiong Mo officially became a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the second layer of the Immortal Terrace is no problem, I can even reach the door of the third level of the Immortal Terrace just by sleeping."</p><p></p><p>"The problem is, how do I break through the third level of the Immortal Terrace?" Xiong Mo recalled the information about the third level of the Immortal Terrace.</p><p></p><p>The third level of the Immortal Terrace is known as the Monarch. This is a very special level, and to break through it, one must cut the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Some people have successfully broken through by severing their past memories. Some have succeeded by cutting off their physique. There are also some extraordinary ones who have broken through by reversing the great Dao, like Ye Fengchu.</p><p></p><p>"Should I sever my past memories? I can't bear to do that. Cut off my physique? As a Holy Spirit in the process of incubation, cutting my physique would be courting death! Reverse the great Dao? I'm not Ye Fengchu, I'm not that strong. And as a Holy Spirit, if I reverse the great Dao, I'll be forced to emerge immediately, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Courting death is not the way to do it..." Xiong Mo's thoughts began to wander. "Cut off emotions? No. Cut off destiny? I don't have the ability. Cut off the impurities or impurities in the body? That might work."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo immediately began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"The feasibility is very high. I am the [Stone Holy Spirit], and now there are some impurities in my body. If I can cut off those impurities, not only can I break through the Monarch level of the Immortal Terrace, but my aptitude and insight will also be improved."</p><p></p><p>"Once my cultivation reaches the Saint level of the Immortal Terrace, I may be able to match those Holy Spirits that are born with the Holy Qi. However, this Dao-cutting will certainly not be as rewarding as those geniuses. Not to mention comparing to Ye Fengchu."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, it's settled then, I'll cut off the impurities and impurities in my body."</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years passed in a flash, and his cultivation had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>"Cut!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's body was like being slashed by an invisible heavenly sword, and the entire Holy Spirit stone fetus was filled with cracks, almost breaking the state of incubation.</p><p></p><p>Quickly glanced at the status:</p><p></p><p>"Phew... just barely made it..." The successful Monarch-level Xiong Mo wiped the cold sweat from his brow. "The injury is not a problem, as long as I'm still in the incubation state, the heavens will help me heal."</p><p></p><p>"But if the incubation state is damaged, it will be disastrous. Not only will I emerge in a severely injured and imperfect state, but I will also face the Dao-cutting tribulation, with almost no chance of survival!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo's heart was still beating rapidly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

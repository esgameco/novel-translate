        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, good junior brother." Lingbao truly felt what it was like to have a junior brother at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lingbao's master only took him as a disciple. Now that Lingbao was accepting disciples on behalf of his master, he had a new and special feeling with the addition of a junior brother.</p><p></p><p>"This is just outwardly fulfilling the responsibilities of an elder brother, while inwardly doing the master's work." Lingbao couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He also thought about the chaos caused by Xiong Mo's spiritual awareness wandering around the sect, which had alarmed the elders who were monitoring the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I shouldn't take on any more disciples in the future, and just leave behind some legacy teachings in the sect or elsewhere. Taking on disciples is really tiring, after all." Lingbao kept muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo, seeing his elder brother Lingbao staring at him without saying anything, also felt a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, I'm sorry." Xiong Mo quickly drew on his past experience and immediately began apologizing.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, no need to be so nervous. After all, you are my junior brother, the sect's second Saint. The issue of your spiritual awareness wandering around the sect has been resolved." Lingbao's expression softened as he responded to Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Brother Lingbao, for handling the trouble I caused." Xiong Mo knew the matter had been resolved, so he quickly expressed his gratitude to Lingbao.</p><p></p><p>"I've been in the stone cocoon for over ten thousand years, and suddenly being able to go out and wander around, I just couldn't resist it." Xiong Mo explained the reason to Lingbao.</p><p></p><p>"Your personality really doesn't seem like that of a Saint." Lingbao sighed.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to apologize to me, you should apologize to those elders who are monitoring the sect's situation. Your sudden spiritual awareness appearance really startled them, they almost thought there was a dead body secretly infiltrating the sect." </p><p></p><p>Lingbao then pointed at Hu Yuan and said, "And him, he was also greatly angered by the trouble you caused."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Lingbao, please convey my apologies to those elders." Xiong Mo felt embarrassed as he apologized to the elders. "I'm sorry, Elder Hu Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan calmly accepted Xiong Mo's apology, saying, "Since you are the junior brother of the Saint and the Saint Lingbao, the matter of you wandering around the sect has been downplayed."</p><p></p><p>Hmm, although he heard Hu Yuan say this, Xiong Mo could tell from the look in his eyes that he wouldn't be able to leave someone's sight for the next period of time.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao spoke in a serious tone, "I will convey your apologies to those elders. Now that your matter has been mostly resolved, it's time for me to deal with my own business."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hu Yuan was a bit stunned. He didn't know what matter the two Saints needed to discuss together. Recently the frontlines had been relatively calm, with the highest-level undead only reaching the half-Saint realm, which Lingbao's Saint-grade artifacts and formations had been able to handle.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo also became serious: "Elder Brother Lingbao is leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Lingbao responded, "Yes, I need to leave this star."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan immediately became anxious: "Why does Saint Lingbao need to leave? The only usable Saint-level combat power right now is him, and the mid-to-high-level forces in the sect haven't fully recovered yet."</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother can't leave, the danger of the undead calamity is only getting greater." Xiong Mo sighed.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't want Lingbao to leave, after all, Lingbao was his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stationed at the frontlines gave a strong sense of security. However, ever since he cultivated to the level of a Saint King and updated his techniques to the pinnacle of the Great Saint, he could sense the crisis coming from the Heavenly Dao. Even with Elder Lingbao stationed at the frontlines, the crisis could not be completely dispelled! Now, the moment Elder Lingbao mentioned leaving, the crisis felt like the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head, as if it could take his life at any moment, and it was getting more and more severe. There was no need to analyze it further, it was definitely the issue of the Corpse Calamity. Xiong Mo was absolutely certain, after all, as a Saint Spirit, this perception from Heaven and Earth would not be wrong. Hmm, at least when there was no powerful expert shielding him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiong Mo is right, it is the issue of the Corpse Calamity," Lingbao's expression also turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of the Dongxuan Sect, two thousand years ago, the Saint Kings could still travel across the starry sky to reach this remote star system at the edge of the universe to avoid the tide of the dead. But now, two thousand years later, the dead that have reached this remote corner of the universe are at the level of Saint Kings."</p><p></p><p>"And ten days ago, when Brother Xiong Mo was wandering around the sect, I used the Saint Formation at the top of the Divine City Tower to calculate the celestial coordinates of other life stars left behind by our ancestors. The results were not optimistic. Except for a few ancient stars like Ziwei, Honghuang, and Beidou that have the Heavenly Venerable lineage, all the other life stars in the universe have turned into wastelands. Even many of the life stars at the edge of the universe are constantly disappearing."</p><p></p><p>"The problems brought by this Corpse Calamity to the universe are getting bigger and bigger, and the tide of the dead is getting more and more severe. If we cannot find a solution, our sect will not be able to hold out for long."</p><p></p><p>Hu Yuan was stunned after hearing this. He had just become an Elder a few days ago, and these secrets that were already public knowledge in the Elder circle were unknown to him. Now, hearing this, he felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Lingbao looked deeply at Xiong Mo and said, "I need to go into the universe to find a solution to the Corpse Calamity, and from now on, the sect will have to rely on you, Brother Xiong Mo."</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Xiong Mo calmly accepted the responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it's time to go out into the world. </p><p></p><p>With the sect gone and the life stars turning into wastelands, even Xiong Mo, a Saint Spirit, would have to advance his cultivation prematurely, and without anyone to help in the tide of the dead, it would be a dead end. It would be better to advance and go to the frontlines, where the survival rate would be higher. Xiong Mo was very clear about this.</p><p></p><p>Now, no matter what, the Dongxuan Sect has done him a favor, and he is not an ungrateful person. Moreover, he has some affection for this place, which can be considered his second home, even though he has only been in the Dongxuan Sect for less than a hundred years. And he knows he has a trump card to reincarnate, although the price is very high.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on Xiong Mo's face, Lingbao patted the stone statue in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiong Mo, you don't need to look like you're about to die. It hasn't reached that point yet."</p><p></p><p>Elder Lingbao took out a scripture and gave it to Xiong Mo.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Numerical Secret!" Xiong Mo was stunned. "Yes, this is the opportunity I recently obtained," Lingbao answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo looked at Lingbao with an incredulous gaze. What kind of luck is this? To obtain the inheritance of a Heavenly Venerable in the remote corner of the universe!</p><p></p><p>"The Numerical Secret is a Heavenly Venerable-level secret art that can create a clone. Since you can project your spiritual consciousness, you can use the Numerical Secret and your spiritual consciousness to create a clone, which should not interrupt your cultivation progress," said Elder Lingbao, who had opened the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye, while looking at Xiong Mo's spiritual consciousness on the immortal platform.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

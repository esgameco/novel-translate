        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhu Iron?" Hu Yuan looked at Uncle Zhu Iron and then at the other uncles, not knowing whether he should listen to his words, after all, this Uncle Zhu Iron is known to be reckless.</p><p></p><p>About two or three hundred years ago, the sect discovered a medium-sized source mine on an island in the sea, which could become a new source mine production site for the sect. But before they even started digging, the various factions within the sect had already started discussing the distribution of the output.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that Uncle Zhu Iron's faction was the one that sent him out.</p><p></p><p>During the discussion process, it was a battle of wits and words. Uncle Zhu Iron couldn't argue with the people from the other factions, and was also provoked by some of the sect elders with whom he had friction. He directly got angry and picked up his big iron hammer to argue with the people he was debating with.</p><p></p><p>Well, Hu Yuan doesn't know what happened in the end. Anyway, the output resources of that medium-sized source mine were eventually taken by half by Uncle Zhu Iron.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Zhu Iron's reputation was also spread throughout the major factions of the sect because of this.</p><p></p><p>"Let the little Hu come, you with your clumsy hands don't move." Lu Yao stopped Zhu Iron's action.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god! It's over!" Xiong Mo heard their conversation and his mind immediately went blank.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo knew that most sacred spirits are interrupted in this way when they are in the state of gestation. He had prepared for this beforehand. The scriptures of the Supplementary Heaven Art, which are used to make up for the imperfect birth, have been comprehended by him as his own accompanying scriptures.</p><p></p><p>He even had the psychological preparation for the possibility that he would be interrupted in the gestation and forced to be born before he could successfully create the Supplementary Heaven Art.</p><p></p><p>But he still wanted to gestate completely and be born. Because at that time, if there is no one to attain the Dao or no great Dao to suppress him, he has a good chance of fusing the Heaven Heart Imprint and directly attaining the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although he has just broken through to the third small level of the Immortal Fourth Saint, the Supplementary Heaven Art has been successfully created, and he has not encountered the worst situation.</p><p></p><p>Now that he is born, he can continue to cultivate with the help of the Supplementary Heaven Art. But he is still unwilling! He could have just lain in the stone embryo until the peak of the Pre-Emperor, or even attained the Dao in an alternative way.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once he is born, with his current qualifications and insights, his cultivation may be limited to the Immortal Fifth Saint King. The Immortal Sixth Great Saint, if he doesn't have the opportunity, will be extremely difficult. As for the Pre-Emperor, without the fortune and fate of a Great Emperor, he won't even be able to touch the threshold.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation path of this life will be cut off!</p><p></p><p>Although Xiong Mo often comforts himself that his insights are not bad and his constitution is good, he is a genius, but he knows very well in his heart. He is a genius, but this genius has some flaws!</p><p></p><p>Among them, his golden finger [Gray Mist Space] and the heaven and earth resonance provided by the heavens during his gestation are important aids that cannot be ignored in his cultivation journey! And knowing some information about the future also provided him with a lot of reference for his path.</p><p></p><p>He cannot be compared to those strong people who can walk to the Great Saint level step by step solely relying on themselves from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo can't do anything now, he can only watch them act, truly "the person is the knife, I am the fish".</p><p></p><p>As Hu Yuan inserted the Dragon Needle into the valley, the shape and direction of the entire dragon vein immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xiong Mo, who was standing on the dragon vein, was also discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Uncles, a stone embryo has been found here! It is connected to the dragon vein!" Hu Yuan's legs were shaking a bit now, after all, he was a professional source technique master, although his heritage was not very profound, but the corresponding information was complete.</p><p></p><p>He knew what a stone embryo was. There was a high probability that a sacred spirit, a being born from the nurturing of heaven and earth, was inside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Once the Holy Spirit is born, it is very likely to trigger a shocking slaughter, with countless casualties and blood flowing for miles! The powerful ones here were all stunned! They had thought this place was a blessed land formed by the creation of heaven and earth, and they had also thought it was a forbidden land that could snatch lives. But they never imagined that there was a Holy Spirit being nurtured here.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Spirit! Achieving perfection at birth can prove its existence! They never dreamed of encountering one here! Even so, all the abnormalities can be explained clearly. They still couldn't believe what was happening before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Please summon the Saint," Lu Yao spoke in the silence, "We can no longer solve this problem."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to summon the Saint."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo in the stone womb heard this and became more and more uneasy, "Summon the Saint?!"</p><p></p><p>After the sound of the vote, Lu Yao crushed a jade talisman he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a young man in a deep blue Taoist robe arrived. His eyes were shining like stars as he looked at the stone womb.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo also sensed the sharp gaze of the young man in the Taoist robe. This gaze scanned his entire body recklessly, making Xiong Mo feel that all his secrets were exposed in that gaze. Although he knew this was impossible, not to mention the shielding of the [Gray Mist Space], the protection of the Heavenly Dao Rhythm alone could block all direct prying below the quasi-emperor level, he still couldn't help but tremble nervously.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the stone womb became quiet. Unbeatable, completely unbeatable, judging from the aura, it has already reached the peak of the Immortal Four Saints, and the Immortal Five Saints King may not be far away. This young man in the Taoist robe seemed to be an extraordinary genius, and if he had the power of the Eight Prohibitions or could rise to the Divine Prohibitions, even the Immortal Five Saints King would not be able to withstand him.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Mo gave up struggling and decided to see what he wanted to do first. If it really doesn't work, he'll forcibly emerge and use self-detonation to drag him down together, then use the golden finger to revive himself. Xiong Mo still had this grasp, although it would cause the time for the space to completely shatter to accelerate rapidly.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the young man spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You all leave first." The young man waved his sleeve and sent Lu Yao and the others out of this green mountain. Then he took out four immortal swords made of immortal gold and a dazzling formation diagram to seal off this valley.</p><p></p><p>The young man approached the stone womb, probed with his divine sense, and after sensing Xiong Mo's existence, said, "Greetings, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"My sect's disciple did not mean to offend, please forgive me." The young man bowed again to apologize.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the great formation that had sealed off the entire valley, Xiong Mo took a deep breath and responded, "No problem, I just want to cultivate peacefully here. Just don't let your sect's people disturb me." He had no choice but to be polite, since the young man had sealed off the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xiong Mo's response, the young man's eyes flashed with light and he said, "I would like to invite the fellow Daoist to return to my sect to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Why do you invite me to your sect?" Xiong Mo asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"I want the fellow Daoist to become the foundation of my sect." The young man answered frankly.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, most Holy Spirits choose to slowly cultivate their cultivation in dormancy, and rarely cultivate within the stone womb. And their scriptures are passively perfected over tens of thousands of years, but I have never heard of a Holy Spirit like the fellow Daoist who can independently perfect the scriptures. This shows the extraordinary talent of the fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hairs stood on end, feeling as if the wind and rain around him had all disappeared, replaced by scorching heat. A massive, wrathful Buddha statue loomed down from the sky above!</p><p></p><p>Gazing at it for too long would cause one's mind and spirit to sway, with sweat pouring down one's back.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, Li Che actively severed the line of sight, and when he opened his eyes again, he had become much calmer.</p><p></p><p>The Zhao Xuanhai sitting in front of the workshop had also risen to his feet, a towering, bear-like figure nearly two meters tall, with a thick beard and knotted muscles.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put down what he was holding and clasped his hands in salute: "The humble Li Che, wood carving master of Xu's Shop, pays respects to the Gentleman."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai, the cousin of Zhao Chuanhong, was one of the three great divine hunters of the inner city... a cultivator of divine nature! What was Zhao Xuanhai doing here? Could it be that he had come to avenge Zhao Chuanhong? But shouldn't he be going after Niu Mo instead? Why come to him, Li Che?! Li Che was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li need not be nervous, for I have come here for two matters..." Zhao Xuanhai said calmly, his imposing presence weighing heavily.</p><p></p><p>The three great divine hunters of Feiluo City were all top-notch experts, with immense strength. Li Che naturally did not wish to provoke any of them directly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, hurried footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>Three figures came walking from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked over, his heart skipping a beat, for the three shop managers of Xu's Outer City Wood Carving Shop had all arrived - the chief manager Xu Huli, the second manager Xu Beihu, and the third manager Xu You.</p><p></p><p>The three Xu brothers had all rushed over together.</p><p></p><p>Even the rarely seen, elusive chief manager Xu Huli had appeared.</p><p></p><p>In all the years Li Che had been at Xu's Wood Carving Shop, he could count on his fingers the number of times he had seen Xu Huli.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a wood carving master, this was the first time he was seeing him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huli had a handsome appearance and an upright bearing. His eyes seemed to contain flowing light, and a precious sword with dangling tassels hung at his waist. He appeared introverted, but in an instant, he could unleash his sharp sword intent, revealing his true might.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huli was also a cultivator of divine nature!</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xu Beihu and Xu You were also cultivators of divine nature, but their divine cultivation was not as high. Their divine nature had not manifested like Xu Huli and Zhao Xuanhai, whose divine nature constantly emanated, captivating the heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of divine cultivation was called "Nourishing the Nature," and even within this realm, there were degrees of attainment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three managers arrive together, Li Che felt somewhat relieved, knowing that he should be safe now.</p><p></p><p>"What a storm has blown the Divine Hunter Zhao here to our humble shop?" Xu Huli lowered his eyelids, a smile on his face, as he clasped his hands towards Zhao Xuanhai.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've only come to find Master Li for two matters. The first is that I've heard Master Li is a talented wood carving master of Xu's Shop, and I have a good job I'd like to offer him," Zhao Xuanhai said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the young master of the Xu family is not far from establishing his divine foundation. Among the three young masters of Feiluo, perhaps young master Huli will take the lead," Zhao Xuanhai said, narrowing his eyes at Xu Huli.</p><p></p><p>"Establishing the divine foundation is no easy feat. It may seem simple, but in reality, it is extremely difficult. You flatter me, Divine Hunter Zhao," Xu Huli said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li is not yet a wood carving master. As a Divine Hunter, you should be seeking the wood carving masters instead..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai waved his hand. "This job does not require the wood carving masters. Strictly speaking, it is a conscription..."</p><p></p><p>Conscription?</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but furrow his brow. Conscription... that would involve even higher-ranking individuals.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's a verbal conscription from the City Lord. We are summoning the skilled masters from the major wood carving shops to complete a task together. The pay is generous - a total of ten golden leaves..."</p><p></p><p>Ten golden leaves?! A thousand taels?! Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask... what is the task?" Xu You took the initiative to inquire on Li Che's behalf.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai glanced at the third young master of the Xu family and said indifferently, "The details cannot be disclosed, but it's essentially carving some wood sculptures for the City Lord. It's not a difficult task, and we don't need the level of artistry of the wood carving masters. However, the City Lord requires a large quantity, and they cannot be of poor quality, so we need to find the skilled masters from the wood carving shops."</p><p></p><p>Xu Huli furrowed his brow slightly. Zhao Xuanhai had come for this matter? He had thought it might be related to Zhao Chuanhong's death. If not for the fact that Li Che was a talented wood carving master with the potential to become a true master, Xu Huli might not have even bothered to listen to Xu You's request.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Heli couldn't help but look towards Li Che: "Master Li, are you willing to take on this job?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his hands and sincerely replied: "To the manager, I am not willing."</p><p></p><p>Working for the city lord? Just the thought of it sounded like a bad deal! The temptation of a thousand taels was great, but for the newly wealthy Li Che, he could still restrain himself.</p><p></p><p>Not willing?</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli paused, seeming not to have expected Li Che to be able to refuse the thousand taels job so decisively, and one that was for the city lord's household at that. Zhao Xuanhai was also speechless, as he had gone to other shops, and those wood carving masters who heard about carving for the city lord were all very enthusiastic, after all, this could connect them to the lord's manor... and leave them with some good will.</p><p></p><p>But they never expected Li Che's attitude to be so different from the others.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, this is a summons from the city lord... the pay is extremely generous!" Zhao Xuanhai frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhao, as you said, it is just an oral summons from the city lord, and it can be refused. Since Master Li is unwilling to take on this job, let the other masters in the shop go instead, and Xu's shop will find someone else." </p><p></p><p>Xu Heli said.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai looked deeply at Li Che, the rumor was that this Xu shop's genius wood carving master was cautious and timid, but now it seems...</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's assessment was quite accurate.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since Master Li is unwilling, then let it be."</p><p></p><p>As Zhao Xuanhai's words fell, he suddenly raised his arm and disappeared from the spot in a flash of lightning, abruptly like a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>He reappeared by Li Che's side, his five fingers like hooks, fiercely grabbing onto Li Che's right shoulder.</p><p></p><p>In Zhao Xuanhai's eyes, a fiery spiritual power seemed to be burning, like a Buddha with billowing hair, he roared upwards!</p><p></p><p>A spiritual power surged from Zhao Xuanhai's palm and quickly circulated through Li Che's body.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change happened too fast! Xu Heli's gaze sharpened, the sword at his waist with hanging tassels let out a sword cry as it was unsheathed, the sword light densely interweaving throughout the entire workshop.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Xu family's 'Suspended Thought Flowing Sword', truly living up to its reputation, so sharp and extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>At the moment Xu Heli drew his sword, Zhao Xuanhai had already released his grip on Li Che's shoulder and retreated back to his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli tightly gripped the long sword, his gaze like lightning: "Captain Zhao... what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai smiled: "I've heard that Master Li is a martial arts prodigy, in just two years of practice, he has already reached the level of bone tempering. I was just curious and wanted to verify it."</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand, "Since Master Li is unwilling to take on this job, I'll take my leave first. It's a pity... Master Li's craftsmanship is so good, yet he doesn't even want the easy wealth."</p><p></p><p>"I'll be going then."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai turned and headed out of the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>He put on his hat and didn't even bother with an umbrella, just plunging straight into the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>The moment Zhao Xuanhai left Xu's wood carving shop, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Not him?"</p><p></p><p>"Some unorthodox martial arts can conceal one's blood qi and hide their abilities, only to suddenly erupt when necessary. The Ox Demon has struck several times, all of which are related to this Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>"Sun Changbiao, Lei Chunlian, and even the disappointing cousin Zhao Chuanxiong... they've all set their sights on Li Che's spiritual daughter."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought Li Che was just pretending to be a fool, but now it seems..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this Li Che truly a fool?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai's towering bear-like figure stood in the wind and rain, letting the raindrops beat against his body, outlining a hazy mist. He turned his head to glance back at Xu's wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... is it really related to the Xu family?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph... it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai let out a faint smile and continued to wander into the rain.</p><p></p><p>But after taking a few steps, his brow couldn't help but furrow again.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... just a quick circulation through Li Che's body, yet my spiritual power was consumed so greatly?"</p><p></p><p>"As if something had taken a big bite out of it?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside Xu's wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who had just rejected Zhao Xuanhai, returned to his own workshop.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the scorching heat in his arm, like an angry snake writhing...</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his fingers, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but curve up into a small arc.</p><p></p><p>Captain, how delicious.</p>

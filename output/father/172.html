            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The City of Jingguan.</p><p></p><p>This night was destined to be tumultuous.</p><p></p><p>The snow in the sky had melted, turning into a torrential downpour, the large raindrops mixed with hail, pounding the ground with a patter.</p><p></p><p>The earth was shrouded in a hazy mist from the splashing water.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Administration Office.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the face of Xie Jing, the Overseer of the Temple Administration, had become extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>The sword at his waist was trembling incessantly, his eyes shining brightly, his heart surging with emotion, his blood and qi constantly churning.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the trembling and longing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The battle of the Grand Masters..."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Masters..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's gaze wavered, he raised his hand, bathing in the torrential winter rain that had been stirred up by the qi and blood of the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>His entire being was enveloped in the hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own hand.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly a longing..."</p><p></p><p>As the Overseer of the Temple Administration stationed in Jingguan City, Xie Jing's strength was not weak. He also greatly yearned for the realm of the Grand Masters, but the Grand Masters were not easy to break through. </p><p></p><p>He was always just a step away.</p><p></p><p>However, in reality, he was already very close to the realm of the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>In his daily battles with others, he only used the cultivation of the Element Manifestation Realm, but in fact, his true strength lay in his Qi and Blood Martial Dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Half-step Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>That was his true foundation.</p><p></p><p>In Jingguan City, only two people knew his true strength - Nan Liihuo and the Monitoring Supervisor, even the City Lord Su Huai did not know the level of his Qi and Blood Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, Xie Jing savored the battle of the Grand Masters tonight, his blood and qi surging with passion.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's Divine Gale, the way it was used and activated, had a great impact on him.</p><p></p><p>After reminiscing for a moment, Xie Jing opened his eyes and returned to the Temple Administration building.</p><p></p><p>"Jingguan City has completely descended into chaos, with the approaching Deity Resonance Assembly, the Grand Masters... the Divine Immortals have successively arrived."</p><p></p><p>"It's much more lively than previous years."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this session is too important, it is the most active time for the Three Crown Princes' Deity Temples... and also the easiest to obtain inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>He sat at the desk, with piles of documents stacked in front of him. He reached out his hand, bypassing the many documents, and picked up a bronze mirror.</p><p></p><p>Opening the bronze mirror, he infused it with qi and blood, breaking the array seal.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, messages emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple Administration of the Lingnan Road, a Grand Master Overseer named Zhu Chaoyang, accompanied by a divine child and an elder from the Qianyuan Divine Sect responsible for transporting the Four Imperial Divine Weapons, are on their way."</p><p></p><p>Closing the message.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Another Grand Master and Divine Immortal have arrived..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect has sent two Divine Immortals, no, Wang Kuyu should have been hidden, he just exposed himself earlier, and then there is the Pacification Prince's side, also a Grand Master and a Divine Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"The Temple Administration, the Imperial Observatory... have all dispatched True Immortal-level experts."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Xie Jing leaned back in his chair.</p><p></p><p>"It's in complete chaos..."</p><p></p><p>"And then there's the Underworld and the Corpse Demon Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The commotion caused by the Deity Resonance Assembly is truly too great..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that..."</p><p></p><p>"There's also the hidden Corpse Demon Sect leader Yan Jingang, the Seven Elements Supreme Corpse Demon Envoy, who is a Cursed Silver Corpse, suspected to have reached the Divine Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing curled his fingers, tapping on the desk.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ox Demon and Horse Face from the Underworld, as well as the sudden appearance of the Divine Monkey tonight, had eliminated many Corpse Demon Sect experts, Yan Jingang had not yet revealed himself!</p><p></p><p>"Where is Yan Jingang hiding?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, who is he exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing clenched his fist.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon or the Underworld forces...</p><p></p><p>They had found so many Corpse Demon Sect experts, even exposing Xu Jiuqing who was hidden within the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>But this Yan Jingang...</p><p></p><p>Can they find him?</p><p></p><p>This person...</p><p></p><p>Is the most terrifying time bomb!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside, the rain was pounding relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth were hazy, the night deep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the room, the oil lamp flickering in the rain-induced mist.</p><p></p><p>The room was eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>The seven avatar manifestations were diligently helping the main body refine their divine nature, working as hard as if they were helping the main body with their summer homework.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his hands, Li Che's eyes shone with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Three Qiankun Jade Spheres were floating in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Two of the Qiankun Jade Spheres were emanating a corpse aura and a death aura, while one was circulating a blood aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had broken through the hidden Corpse Demon Sect experts' Qiankun Jade Spheres.</p><p></p><p>The corpse aura and death aura were ruthlessly and violently torn apart by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Having done this before, Li Che felt no emotion at the sound of the Qiankun Jade Sphere's seals breaking.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to do when opening the jade spheres was to seek the divine nature crystals!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Qiankun Jade Spheres poured out their contents.</p><p></p><p>"Five Seven Elements Divine Nature Crystals! Fifteen Eight Extremes Divine Nature Crystals! The Nine Luminaries and Ten Primes Divine Nature Crystals... are no longer important! But together they are close to five hundred!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>"The Gold Rift Sect is indeed formidable, the Gold Rift Sect Patriarch must have grasped all the resources of the entire sect!"</p><p></p><p>A bountiful harvest! Just the divine nature crystals alone made Li Che's efforts worthwhile! Li Che's smile blossomed, although he didn't quite have the feeling of being suddenly wealthy, because he had experienced it too many times, but the sense of harvest was still very pleasing.</p><p></p><p>It was like planting peanuts in the ground, and then pulling out a bumper crop, feeling content and satisfied.</p><p></p><p>These Corpse Demon Sect experts...</p><p></p><p>What difference were they from the peanuts waiting to be pulled out of the ground?</p><p></p><p>"Or to use a more vivid description..."</p><p></p><p>"The evil ones of the Corpse Demon Sect... are nothing more than power banks."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up.</p><p></p><p>With no more divine nature crystals, slaying a Corpse Demon Sect expert would definitely yield a lot of divine nature crystals.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Demon Sect wanted to deploy in Jingguan City and corrupt many cultivators within the city, but they also needed operating funds.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, these Corpse Demon Sect experts were quite wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"My Unsullied Heart Dao Fruit needs to break through to LV4, and I need enough Seven Elements Divine Nature Crystals, which is indispensable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was burning with intensity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cultivation of the Unsullied Heart cannot be done by the avatar manifestations, it requires him personally.</p><p></p><p>So the higher the quality of the divine nature crystals, the faster his cultivation will progress!</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused for a moment, planning to open Xue Daofu's Qiankun Jade Sphere next, and then summarize his current divine nature crystal assets.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to count the harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Weapons... let me see, there's actually a Seven Elements Divine Weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up. Although he only had one Seven Elements Divine Weapon, it was a great harvest for Li Che! Previously he had obtained the Seven Elements Divine Weapon, the Lü Xuanbing Yang Sword, but that thing was a sword, and Li Che wasn't used to using it.</p><p></p><p>So, he would always pay attention to each Seven Elements Divine Weapon he obtained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fingers, and suddenly a dazzling golden light surged forth, powerful and penetrating, causing the air to emit a humming sound of rupture!</p><p></p><p>It was a long spear! Eighteen feet long, entirely gilded, with unique patterns engraved on it, and a tiger and leopard pattern carved at the spearhead, as if a fierce tiger was spitting out the spearhead.</p><p></p><p>The spearhead was not long, even a bit short, but extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>Making this long spear look like a golden rod overall.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly, immediately captivated by its appearance, unable to look away.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes scanned it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the divine weapon information flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Seven Elements Superior): Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rift Gold Spear]</p><p></p><p>[Craftsmanship: Entirely forged with golden essence, mixed with mysterious silver materials, using the blood of demonic tigers and leopards, smelted with the thunder and lightning of heaven and earth, when the spear moves, it has the sound of tiger and leopard thunder, containing the power of the gold element, able to rift gold and crush stone]</p><p></p><p>[Wielder: Master of the Gold Element Martial Dao and above, Element Manifestation and above]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rift Gold Spear! The information flowed, and Li Che looked at it with great delight, weighing it in his hand...</p><p></p><p>As if he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he tapped it on his brow.</p><p></p><p>Tearing open the flesh and blood, the Plucking Star Eyes opened! Instantly, his entire body's qi and blood erupted!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surged like crimson clouds!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone with golden light, enveloping the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rift Gold Spear, and the qi and blood crimson clouds immediately intertwined and enveloped, merging into the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes scanned the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear, and the qi and blood crimson clouds seemed to come alive, finding the flaws in this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Frantically converging and drilling into the flaws.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, they completely poured into the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>The long spear rumbled, as if the thunder of tigers and leopards had exploded!</p><p></p><p>Muffled thunder rolled, tigers roaring and leopards howling. When everything settled, Li Che saw that there were now crimson patterns like blood mist on the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Intertwined with gold and red, dazzlingly brilliant! [Divine Weapon (Six Realms Lower Grade): Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rift Gold Spear]</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes once again fed back the divine weapon information.</p><p></p><p>And the information had changed! Li Che's eyes flashed with a look of incredulity!</p><p></p><p>This is also possible? No...</p><p></p><p>This qi and blood crimson cloud, also has such an effect?</p><p></p><p>Earlier in the battle with Xue Daofu, the qi and blood crimson cloud enveloping the Startling Spear had temporarily elevated its grade, making it more resilient and harder.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che was inspired to try it.</p><p></p><p>Under the synergy of the two divine arts, it actually caused this divine weapon to ascend in rank? The significance is different!</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out another Seven Elements Divine Weapon, the [Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Divine Bow] he had obtained from the Divine Archer Wen Longshan.</p><p></p><p>Seven Elements Superior, Li Che followed suit.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes and the qi and blood crimson cloud worked in tandem.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood crimson cloud was consumed drastically this time, as if it was consuming Li Che's own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>After the補拙 (補缺補弱, to make up for weaknesses), Li Che gave it a glance, feeling a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>This divine bow did not advance to the Six Realms level.</p><p></p><p>It seems that not all divine weapons have the potential to be upgraded.</p><p></p><p>This qi and blood crimson cloud divine art he had just obtained, in Li Che's understanding, was more of an auxiliary improvement.</p><p></p><p>It could even be understood as a kind of peculiar divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>It can carry Li Che's flight, form a highly defensive armor and robe outside his body, and can also be attached to divine weapons to enhance their quality...</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, as Li Che's qi and blood cultivation improves, the power of this qi and blood crimson cloud will also rise!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the qi and blood crimson cloud... can even be integrated into the Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon rounds, then I can manipulate the artillery shells, improve the accuracy of the cannon bombardment!"</p><p></p><p>"Making the enemy unable to avoid or hide from it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly!</p><p></p><p>Divine arts... need to be developed.</p><p></p><p>Not just simply using their basic functions, that would be a bit of a waste.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the qi and blood crimson cloud is only the first realm of the Crimson Cloud Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied with the collection, he put away the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear and continued to inventory.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs, two superior grade Tiger Blood Treasure Warrior Elixirs, and one middle grade Seven Elements Death Qi Condensed Warrior Elixir... along with other scattered high-quality elixirs, a total of eighteen, not many, but the quality is high!"</p><p></p><p>"In terms of techniques, there is the Gold Rift Sect Patriarch's superior true meaning absolute skill [Gold Element Tiger Roar Spear], which perfectly matches the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rift Gold Spear."</p><p></p><p>Another Grand Master absolute skill, Li Che was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, there is the Gold Rift Sect's Seven Elements Divine Manifestation technique, [Mysterious Startling Rift Gold Mountain Lord Rebuke Divine Manifestation]."</p><p></p><p>The main harvests were actually mostly from the Gold Rift Sect Patriarch's side, while the other Seven Elements Corpse Demon Envoy only had more divine nature crystals.</p><p></p><p>The other things like divine weapons, elixirs, and techniques were all from the Gold Rift Sect Patriarch, after all, it was the foundation of a major city force.</p><p></p><p>Putting away these harvests, Li Che took out the Qiankun Jade Sphere of the Grand Master Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Daofu had not died, the Qiankun Jade Sphere could not be opened, and if forced open, it would self-destruct and shatter.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the opening of this exquisite Qiankun Jade Sphere cost Li Che some effort.</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly used the Unsullied Heart divine nature to refine and absorb this Qiankun Jade Sphere...</p><p></p><p>Silently and imperceptibly, the Qiankun Jade Sphere had changed ownership.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood, as well as the martial dao will attached to it by Xue Daofu, had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che also sensed the treasures it contained.</p><p></p><p>"No divine weapons, which is a pity, that saber that turned into a crescent moon saber... didn't get my hands on it, ah, what a loss."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master absolute skill [Great Desert Lone Smoke Saber], and also..."</p><p></p><p>"A Martial Saint absolute skill!"</p><p></p><p>"[Thousand Mountains Lone Journey Saber]!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che's movements as he counted the harvest froze.</p><p></p><p>His eyes shone brightly, and his breathing quickened slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal?!"</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being struck by overwhelming riches...</p><p></p><p>Li Che experienced it once again.</p><p></p><p>There was no such thing as becoming numb to riches.</p><p></p><p>Numbness only depended on whether the riches struck hard enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Inside the main hall, the candles were lit, illuminating the space.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu sat in a chair, his arms now broken, having become an armless old man, his expression extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>But what made his expression even more unsightly was...</p><p></p><p>His Qiankun Jade had been torn open! His connection to the Qiankun Jade had been severed!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu was furious in his heart, full of distress.</p><p></p><p>He was not worried that the monkey would obtain what was inside the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as Xue Dumu was not dead, the Qiankun Jade would self-destruct if forcibly opened, destroying the Qiankun Jade and its precious contents.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Dumu, you don't need to be too concerned. That Underworld Monkey is no match for you in raw power... He only relied on the power of the temple deity."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince, seeing Xue Dumu's unsightly expression, put on a mature demeanor like an elder, comforting the Grand Master Xue Dumu, trying to win him over.</p><p></p><p>"When we return to the Prince's Manor, I will ask my father to help Grandpa Dumu obtain a Blood and Flesh Rejuvenation Pill, to assist Grandpa Dumu in restoring his arms."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master could not yet achieve the rebirth of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>But at the Martial Saint realm, he could.</p><p></p><p>However, for Xue Dumu to reach the Martial Saint realm, it might be impossible in this lifetime...</p><p></p><p>So he could only rely on external means.</p><p></p><p>The Blood and Flesh Rejuvenation Pill was a top-grade divine elixir of the Six Ministries, not only a divine elixir that could rapidly increase one's blood and qi, but also one that could assist in the regeneration of flesh and blood!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, I am fine, it is just a feeling of being disgusted by that Underworld Monkey."</p><p></p><p>"If there is a next time, I will definitely kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu's murderous intent surged.</p><p></p><p>For a Grand Master, using divine energy to form arms could be used temporarily.</p><p></p><p>"That Underworld Monkey appeared suddenly, he should have just recently arrived at the Jingguan Prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, he came for the mysterious temple of the Third Prince."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Monkey..."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is also doing assassinations, it's a bit like the Huntsmaster Guild..."</p><p></p><p>"The assassins from the Huntsmaster Guild should have also followed us into the Jingguan Prefecture city... Grandpa Dumu, you should contact that assassin from the Huntsmaster Guild, just tell him... We also want to issue an assassination mission, will they accept?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Assassinate who?"</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince bared his teeth in a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Assassinate the Monkey, of course."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Huntsmaster Guild rumored to be expanding their business to the prefecture-level cities?"</p><p></p><p>"Just right, the Underworld is equivalent to stealing the Huntsmaster Guild's business, the Huntsmaster Guild shouldn't let it go easily."</p><p></p><p>"Just right..."</p><p></p><p>"Let them fight each other first!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xue Dumu's expression changed, and he took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai, who was sitting below, paused in his tea-drinking.</p><p></p><p>His expression also revealed surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince...</p><p></p><p>Was starting to resemble the old Prince a bit!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flowed like sand, slipping through the fingers unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the endless winter rain and falling snow, five days quietly passed.</p><p></p><p>Since the last battle between Grand Masters, five days had gone by.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jingguan Prefecture city, from its initial turmoil, gradually regained its calm.</p><p></p><p>But the undercurrents were surging, something that every faction could sense.</p><p></p><p>Originally, some of the smaller factions within the prefecture city had restrained their actions, not daring to be too reckless.</p><p></p><p>One day, the winter rain fell like fine threads.</p><p></p><p>In the Falling Flowers Alley, the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The heat waves rolled, the aura surging.</p><p></p><p>There were tiger roars, leopard howls, and the rumbling of thunder! Powerful air currents shot out, the winter rain unable to fall.</p><p></p><p>The entire courtyard had risen in temperature by too many degrees, scorching hot, like a smelting furnace radiating intense heat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the center of the courtyard, his five fingers gripping a long spear with a gold and red intersection, like a twenty-foot-long staff, powerful and heavy.</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Splitting Spear, perhaps due to the fusion of the blood and qi, had become almost spiritually connected to Li Che, extremely easy to wield.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in place, eyes closed, and the next moment, his eyes suddenly opened, exuding a sense of desolation.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, it was as if countless mountains had been traversed, striding alone through the vast and desolate heavens and earth, walking solitary among the thousand mountains! The surging sense of desolation and loneliness!</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Splitting Spear in Li Che's hand trembled, and the tiger, leopard, and thunder were unleashed, as if transformed into extremely sharp sword beams ruthlessly slashing down! Spanning across thousands of mountains and waters, the impact points!</p><p></p><p>The air even exploded in a ripple of invisible tremors!</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint Profound Art, Thousand Mountains Solitary Blade... Mastered!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire body trembled, the Dragon Elephant Golden Immortal Fruit reaching LV4 had brought him a huge increase in physical strength.</p><p></p><p>After his rebirth, he had broken through from the initial Patriarch realm to the advanced Patriarch realm, and even obtained the level of Innate Spiritual Power in his physical strength!</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary Patriarchs, Li Che could easily crush without relying on the temple deity's chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant Golden Immortal Fruit reaching LV4, the greater improvement... is in the realm of martial dao comprehension! My current comprehension... is almost unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>"Even for a Martial Saint Profound Art, in just five days, I was able to reach the level of mastery..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone, and he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"From Patriarch to Grand Patriarch... the most important thing is the tempering of the five viscera and six bowels, in fact, the key is the five viscera, using true intent to temper, and finally condense the human body's great elixir, fusing it with the martial dao will, to forge the divine energy of a Grand Patriarch..."</p><p></p><p>"If my five viscera and six bowels were all tempered with Martial Saint true intent... how would that be?"</p><p></p><p>"Others use Martial Saint true intent to temper their five viscera and six bowels, each a Martial Saint Profound Art, but I can master multiple, each tempering one viscera!"</p><p></p><p>"However, Martial Saint Profound Arts are difficult to obtain..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had this idea, but the conditions did not seem to allow it.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, the Primordial Heavenly Staff, and the Thousand Mountains Solitary Blade were three Martial Saint Profound Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, that Young Prince also has a Martial Saint Profound Art, the Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Deity!"</p><p></p><p>"Counting this way, there is still one more missing..."</p><p></p><p>Where to obtain this one, Li Che was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Patriarch Profound Art 'Lone Desert Smoke Blade', can barely... serve as a substitute."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, not quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He put away the Tiger Leopard Thunder Splitting Spear.</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly sat down on the ground in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>These five days had been very peaceful.</p><p></p><p>That Young Prince, after being beaten up by Xiu Xiu, seemed to have calmed down, or perhaps to avoid fulfilling the bet of becoming a slave, he started pretending to be dead.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the temple deity's joint conference to begin.</p><p></p><p>Xiu Xiu was extremely dissatisfied, muttering every day, complaining about the useless and playful liar Young Prince Shi Hai.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the precious Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal he had obtained from Xue Dumu's Qiankun Jade!</p><p></p><p>About the size of a duck egg, it shimmered with many milky-white streams of light.</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>[Fruit: Untainted Heart (LV3, 70%)]</p><p></p><p>For five days, Li Che would pick up this Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal every day and absorb a wave of it.</p><p></p><p>About a third of the divine essence within this Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal had been consumed, likely Xue Dumu's own foundation used to break through to the Divine Element realm.</p><p></p><p>Now it had fallen into Li Che's hands.</p><p></p><p>However, the absorption of this Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal was not as smooth as the first time he obtained the Seven Element Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Untainted Heart Fruit was a bit cautious in its absorption.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the pure and powerful divine essence would surge in and harm Li Che.</p><p></p><p>So, he absorbed a little bit each day, slowly refining it.</p><p></p><p>But the speed of improvement was not slow, in five days, it had increased by 40% in maturity!</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in a while, it would reach LV4 level.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>One had to admit, resources were crucial for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Li Che and his painting immortal manifestations were diligently refining the divine essence.</p><p></p><p>The painting immortal's Fruit had also reached LV2 level, and the speed at which the manifestations absorbed divine essence had indeed increased.</p><p></p><p>After reaching LV2, the painting immortal's Fruit, the manifestations it created consumed less divine energy, existed for longer, and were also stronger! Moreover, it gained a new function, where Li Che's consciousness could fully descend into one of the painting immortal manifestations, controlling it just like his own body! Li Che even began to look forward to what kind of divine abilities the painting immortal's Fruit would awaken when it reached LV3 maturity!</p><p></p><p>When the maturity reached 78% and the Six Ministries Divine Essence Crystal dimmed, no longer able to absorb divine essence from it, Li Che gave up on today's divine essence cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He stretched his body and stood up, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"Five days have passed..."</p><p></p><p>"My condition has also recovered to the peak complete state, I can try to venture into the golden divine hall in the God's Altar of the Heaven King Tower."</p><p></p><p>"See if the Heaven King's temper has calmed down..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether he is willing to let me touch it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed his chin, and a faint smile unconsciously appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's open palm, empty just a moment ago, suddenly seemed to have grasped the lingering lightning chess piece within the golden divine hall of the God's Altar in the Heaven King Tower.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che's figure had also shifted to be inside this divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood quietly, pricking up his ears to listen for any movement.</p><p></p><p>If the Heaven King's temper had not yet dissipated, </p><p></p><p>Li Che would come back another day...</p><p></p><p>"Huh? No movement... It seems the Heaven King's temper has subsided."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the divine hall, his ink-black robe swaying without wind, his gaze sweeping over the massive golden statue of the Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven divine physiognomy methods Li Che cultivated, one was obtained from this golden divine hall, the "Six Ministries Suspended Thought Fearless Golden Heaven King Physiognomy".</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che's Thought Deity foundation had already reached perfection, reaching the level of observing divine physiognomy.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che looked at this Heaven King statue, his mind activated the divine physiognomy method, and the Heaven King's form seemed to be gradually outlined in his Thought Deity foundation, like a wood carving technique, first sketching the shape, then carving.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Li Che felt his spiritual sense swell, a sense of dizziness coming over him, due to the massive consumption of spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the divine statue, the greater the consumption of spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of divine essence, my talent is really average, whether it's divine essence techniques or divine essence methods, I'm not a genius."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head slightly, sighing a little.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the martial dao, his comprehension was terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint Profound Arts, he could reach the level of mastery in just five days! In a year, he might even be able to fully master them!</p><p></p><p>If this speed was revealed, it would probably frighten Grand Master Xue Dumu to death.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the divine physiognomy observation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, stood up, and began to freely jump and move around inside the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Loosening his body.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the activity, he gradually approached the majestic golden statue of the Heaven King supporting the Heaven King Tower, pretending to be nonchalant.</p><p></p><p>As if testing the bottom line of the Golden Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>When he was about a foot away.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>Slowly raised his sinful hand.</p><p></p><p>And placed it on the massive shoe surface of the Heaven King statue.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che's palm touched the Heaven King statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense surged.</p><p></p><p>Immediately sensing that the [Chess Saint] Fruit's heavenly earth chessboard, the suspended mythical chess piece [Equaling Heaven's Face], </p><p></p><p>Suddenly began to violently tremble! Countless monkey hairs sprouted from the mask, crawling and intertwining around it...</p><p></p><p>And inside the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also immediately came to his senses, sensing something, and abruptly looked up.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the massive statue of the Heaven King supporting the pagoda, he didn't know when, had leaned forward, its huge head lowering, glaring down at him with bulging eyes.</p><p></p><p>And on Li Che's face.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden monkey hairs had grown out.</p><p></p><p>The Equaling Heaven's Face...</p><p></p><p>Had somehow covered his face.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rain was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>Inside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the divine weapon sword with his five fingers, his powerful blood and qi circulating, cutting through the sixth-grade spiritual wood, with sparks flying and the scent of gunpowder lingering.</p><p></p><p>This "Wrathful Fire God Jiao Wood" was of too high a quality, making it not easy to cut.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che's cultivation had not been elevated, his blood and qi strong, his physical body unparalleled, almost reaching the level of a half-step grand master, he might not have been able to easily move this piece of spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>Carving wood sculptures is ultimately still a physical labor.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paid no heed to the Hunting God Pavilion's master who stood atop the tall building, twisting in the wind and rain, constantly probing his spiritual sense to watch the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The other party wanted to see through the cracks, but in reality, what the Hunting God Pavilion's master saw... was nothing more than the illusion Li Che wanted him to see.</p><p></p><p>Just an illusion drawn on the chessboard of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Unless he acted in person, he would not be able to tear apart this illusion.</p><p></p><p>Merely observing, he could only see the honest and upright Li Che carving wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>And if Huang Xirong chose to make a move, then Li Che would naturally have no need to pretend.</p><p></p><p>For three consecutive days.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's days had become regular.</p><p></p><p>During the day, after clocking in at the Qin Tian Observatory, he would come to the independent workshop courtyard to polish and manufacture the "Wrathful Fire God Jiao Cannon".</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, he would pause to cultivate the martial dao, absorbing the divinity from the six-tier divine essence crystals, steadily advancing the maturity of the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>During this time.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could, through the monitoring of the chessboard of heaven and earth, detect the Hunting God Pavilion's master Huang Xirong's murderous intent, becoming increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, after watching the honest and upright Li Che for three days, Huang Xirong could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Li Che was unrelated to the Ox Demon, he planned to strike and eliminate Li Che.</p><p></p><p>It was to complete the assassination task accepted by the Prince, and to regain his reputation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Hunting God Pavilion's base in the Golden Light Prefecture City had been erased, reduced to flat ground, Huang Xirong, as the Hunting God Pavilion's master, was still alive.</p><p></p><p>And the Hunting God Pavilion was not just him alone now, as members who had gone to explore other cities had gradually returned in recent days.</p><p></p><p>While monitoring Li Che, Huang Xirong also arranged for these people to reopen new bases.</p><p></p><p>This time, he would be more careful, requiring his assassins to be more discreet when receiving the task.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che sensed Huang Xirong's murderous intent, which had become so thick that it was almost turning into black water, he no longer stayed in the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He directly changed the location, moving to the workshop of the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>This really infuriated Huang Xirong.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Tian Observatory was not like the independent workshop courtyard, with the true Celestial Immortal Lü Yao stationed there.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the Monitoring Supervisor Hu Yingue, who liked to play the erhu, was also no simple character.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong's original intention to make a move was thwarted.</p><p></p><p>But he did not give up, still watching Li Che outside.</p><p></p><p>He was gradually losing his patience.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Li Che had no abnormalities and was just an honest and upright person diligently carving wood sculptures to earn money and support his family, Huang Xirong planned to end this honest person's life.</p><p></p><p>His Hunting God Pavilion's master assassin had failed.</p><p></p><p>But with him, a Celestial Immortal, personally taking action, there was no possibility of failure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were tilting, constantly beating on the black eaves, with distinct raindrops splashing at the upturned corners.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was sitting in the courtyard, brewing tea and eating plums in the leisure pavilion.</p><p></p><p>By his side was the Little Prince Xie Haihui, who had been in seclusion for several consecutive days and finally emerged from the room, sitting in the leisure pavilion, feeling the penetrating wind that washed away the tightness in his nerves and emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Little Prince, relax. With the Envoy Guard protecting you, nothing will happen," Su Huai said gently.</p><p></p><p>As a disciple of Xie Molie, Su Huai's talent was naturally not ordinary. He was assigned by Xie Molie to the Golden Light Prefecture to serve as the Prefect, not only to monitor the remnant of Nanlihuo, but also to keep an eye on the mysterious Temple of the Four Deities in this place, paving the way for the Little Prince's Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai had been talking about the Temple God Resonance Assembly in recent days. He had presided over a few sessions, so he knew some details.</p><p></p><p>The Little Prince had changed his clothes, with a bun, wearing a red belly warmer, a golden ring around his neck, and a red sash around his waist.</p><p></p><p>This was the basis for establishing resonance with the Third Prince in terms of appearance.</p><p></p><p>Basically, every spiritual child and divine child would pursue resonance in their attire.</p><p></p><p>Six black-armored blood guards, bearing heavy and massive saber-axes, stood solemnly and coldly around the leisure pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Little Prince's expression relaxed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That Underworld Deity Monkey... threatened to eliminate one by one the people around me, but it seems to be just empty talk. After all this time, there has been no movement."</p><p></p><p>The Little Prince let out a breath, his heart somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>The Temple God Resonance was about to begin. According to the investigation information provided by Su Huai, the caravan from the Dao City would arrive at the Golden Light Prefecture City in two or three days.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guarding Bureau and the Orthodox Sect of the Divine Sect would escort the Four Deities' Divine Weapons "Underworld Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel" here. Once they entered the Golden Light Prefecture City, it would mean that the "Temple God Resonance Assembly" was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally here."</p><p></p><p>The Little Prince's purple eyes shone like mirror surfaces.</p><p></p><p>He was ultimately just a five-year-old child, and the pressure from the Underworld Deities was too great.</p><p></p><p>Especially the death of Grand Master Xue Duxiu, which had greatly impacted him.</p><p></p><p>"Finish the Temple God Resonance as soon as possible, obtain the inheritance, and then... summon my elder brothers to the Golden Light Prefecture, to ferret out the Underworld Deities and punish them all!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Haihui's purple eyes flashed with lightning, saying angrily.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then continued, "And that little girl! I want to take her as my maid!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brothers and sisters will certainly be willing to help the Little Prince with this."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Huai sensed something, and the gentle smile on his face disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>A black shadow appeared behind the Little Prince.</p><p></p><p>It was the hidden Envoy Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Clang, clang, clang! The six black-armored blood guards drew their saber-axes in unison!</p><p></p><p>However, on the towering city wall of the City Lord's Mansion, a figure wearing a golden mask and wrapped in a black robe stood quietly, blending into the heaven and earth as the wind and rain tilted.</p><p></p><p>"Hunting God Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal was shrouded in black mist, his voice faintly indifferent yet solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Duxiu agreed to the assassination task before his death... shall we continue?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He was preparing to kill Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, he wanted to confirm the task issued, which would also add some performance to the currently straitened Hunting God Pavilion in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Little Prince Xie Haihui was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered the task he had let Xue Duxiu issue to the Hunting God Pavilion's assassins to assassinate Xici's parents.</p><p></p><p>Due to Xue Duxiu's death and the threat from the Underworld Deities, he had temporarily forgotten about it.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Hunting God Pavilion, whose base had been erased, to come knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal did not answer, but looked at the Little Prince Xie Haihui.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that the other party was not here to assassinate the Little Prince, the Envoy Immortal relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Haihui was stunned for a moment, but then his eyes, like a purple mirror, reflected a ruthless murderous intent: "Kill! Must kill!"</p><p></p><p>His expression became somewhat ferocious, as if he was venting all the oppression and confinement he had experienced in recent days due to the Underworld threat.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"Assassinate Li Che, ten pieces of seven-element divine essence crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Assassinate Zhang Ya, one piece of seven-element divine essence crystal."</p><p></p><p>"Payment now."</p><p></p><p>"This one will personally take action."</p><p></p><p>Under the golden mask, Huang Xirong's eyes were dim and calm as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal looked at Huang Xirong with a hint of surprise, unable to help but want to laugh.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion was really desperate... After being erased by the Underworld, they couldn't find any trace of the Underworld, and now even Celestial Immortal-level assassins had to take on tasks personally.</p><p></p><p>This was the most miserable Hunting God Pavilion branch the Envoy Immortal had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>But Xie Haihui did not hesitate much, turning to look at Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, make the payment!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>"Little Prince, the Li family is not worth this price."</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion's quoted price was simply that of slaughtering pigs.</p><p></p><p>They purely wanted to dig out some performance from them.</p><p></p><p>"If they can be killed, they are worth it!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Haihui said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai, upon hearing this, no longer said much, not because he cared about the seven-element divine essence crystals, as that was nothing to the Little Prince's wealth.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he felt it was not worth it.</p><p></p><p>If it was to kill that divine child Li Nuan Xi, he would have given it without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>But to kill Li Nuan Xi's parents...</p><p></p><p>What use would that be?</p><p></p><p>Su Huai understood that Xie Haihui had set his sights on Li Nuan Xi, wanting to take her as a maid and subjugate this girl forever.</p><p></p><p>A single failure had ignited the Little Prince's competitive desire.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, this was a bit like the tyrannical and overbearing nature of the Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>Like the Dragon Queen Consort.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his fingers, eleven pieces of seven-element divine essence crystals were immediately shot towards Huang Xirong.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong took them without even looking and stored them in his Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Good..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for my news."</p><p></p><p>With these words, Huang Xirong blended into the air and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God Pavilion's hidden divine essence secret art... is indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The great river flowed ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>The surging river waters slapped against each other, splashing up waves and roaring incessantly!</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragon River stretched for thousands of miles, extending along the Golden Light Prefecture, irrigating millions of acres of farmland.</p><p></p><p>The river waters rushed on without rest, hot and boiling, as if there were countless burning embers at the bottom of the river, causing the waters to churn endlessly!</p><p></p><p>The majestic divine essence accompanied the exploding river waters, permeating the air, as if there were children struggling to break free and roar at the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The waters of the entire Nine Dragon River seemed to be in constant upheaval! Heavy rain poured down, with a curtain of continuous rain lashing down!</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth were shrouded in mist, the smoke and rain obscuring visibility.</p><p></p><p>By the river, the official road was built along the river, the ground washed by the rain into deep mud.</p><p></p><p>On the muddy and uneven official road, there was a caravan of carriages speeding along.</p><p></p><p>The wheels plunged down, accompanied by a thunderous roar, kicking up gray mud and water several feet high!</p><p></p><p>The speed of the caravan was very fast, and the horses pulling the carriages were not ordinary horses, but possessed the bloodline of demonic beasts, able to withstand the wind and rain, traveling thousands of miles in a day, swift as lightning.</p><p></p><p>This was a caravan coming from the Dao City.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure tore through the wind and rain, landing on the carriage canopy.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the uniform of the Temple Guarding Bureau's Supervisory Department, his explosive flesh and blood, surging qi, fluttering like a banner in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The rain had not yet fallen, but it exploded around him.</p><p></p><p>This person was Zhu Chaoyang, the Grand Master sent by the Temple Guarding Bureau of the Dao City.</p><p></p><p>This man had refined eighteen divine roars, one divine roar could refine ten human acupoints, which meant he had penetrated one hundred and eighty meridians.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the realm of the Divine Roar, he had already traversed half the path.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang this time was responsible for accompanying the elder of the Orthodox Sect of the Divine Sect to transport the Four Deities' Divine Weapons to the Golden Light Prefecture City, and to open the mysterious temple of that prefecture city, to hold the Temple God Resonance Assembly!</p><p></p><p>The blood and qi roared, shattering the raindrops.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's gaze was like a tangible sharp blade, cutting through the mist and rain, directly gazing at the surging great river.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, it seemed he could see the phantom of a dragon serpent roaming and churning in the river!</p><p></p><p>"The dragon serpent emerges from the deep river... the eight-armed Underworld Lotus is furiously rebelling against the mysterious temple of the Third Prince, it seems it's about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's eyes shone with brilliance, standing with hands behind his back, watching the dragon serpent that had lashed out a tail and exploded the river flow before retreating into the distance.</p><p></p><p>He stepped out, returning from the carriage canopy to the interior of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, there was a child of about five years old, with a topknot, wearing a red belly warmer, sitting cross-legged, a flame divine spear resting on his lap, the entire person seemingly sitting in the midst of flames.</p><p></p><p>His cheeks were puffed out, with flames flickering in his nostrils, as if he was devouring the flames.</p><p></p><p>"Little Iron Doll, you rushed from the Divine Capital to the Dao City, and the Supervisory Department promised to let you participate in this Temple God Resonance Assembly. You can't come back empty-handed, or else... you'll be embarrassing the face of our Dao City Temple Guarding Bureau Supervisory Department."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang leaned against the carriage wall, arms crossed, looking at the flame-eating child, unable to help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>The little child opened his eyes, his pupils filled with malice. He stared at Zhu Chaoyang for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he opened his mouth and spat out a flame, shooting towards Zhu Chaoyang.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's face darkened, clenching his five fingers to extinguish the flame.</p><p></p><p>"Brat!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>The little child stuck out his tongue, arrogant and malicious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me a brat, don't call me a little..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Iron Boy!"</p><p></p><p>"I have a name!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Iron Shancai!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Tian Observatory, within the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the divine weapon blade with his five fingers, patiently grinding the Fire God Angry Flood Dragon wood, sparks flying and jumping.</p><p></p><p>Six crimson-red cannon barrels were coiled together.</p><p></p><p>On each cannon barrel, Li Che used his blood essence and divine nature to engrave a mechanism seal with the character "Dou". When activated, it could allow the explosive power of the cannon shells to be released to a greater extent! Next to the cannon mechanism, Li Che also placed three "Avalanche Crows", each of which was more than twice the size of the Spiritual Wood Crows, connected in a chain-like manner.</p><p></p><p>When the Fire God Angry Flood Dragon cannon mechanism was activated and rotated at high speed, it would rapidly load the cannon shells from the shell chain and fire them out! In the blink of an eye, it could reach a hundred rotations, firing out hundreds of Avalanche Crows! The Fire God Angry Flood Dragon cannon mechanism was actually an enhanced version of the Immortal Gatling Gun!</p><p></p><p>They were all variations of the revolving cannon technique!</p><p></p><p>On the Avalanche Crows, Li Che carefully engraved the "Bing" character seal within the mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could not engrave two different mechanism seals on the Fire God cannon at the same time. He had tried, but it was easy for the mechanism seals to repel each other, which would instead reduce the power.</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked Old Tang about it, and Old Tang said that this was the next secret technique of the Tang Family's Nine Mechanism Seals that was not passed down.</p><p></p><p>He could not solve it either, because he had been incorporated by the court, and the lineage was cut off.</p><p></p><p>The proper combination and application of the nine mechanism seals was the core secret of the Tang Family's peerless mechanism beasts! This had been a problem troubling him for many years.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt regretful when he heard this, but he didn't mind too much, thinking that perhaps he would have the opportunity to see it in the future? Maybe when he mastered the nine mechanism seals, he would gain some insights? Bare-chested, drenched in sweat, Li Che's veins bulged like an angry flood dragon roaring and surging.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power was released, gripping the just-polished heavy Fire God Angry Flood Dragon cannon mechanism.</p><p></p><p>It's heavy, this was Li Che's first impression.</p><p></p><p>However, he could feel the extremely terrifying destructive power contained within the cannon.</p><p></p><p>With the improved propulsion, it had surpassed the Immortal Gatling Gun's explosive power, and each Avalanche Crow shell contained the explosive power of fifty divine chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that... even most Grand Masters could be suppressed by its firepower.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Element Immortal...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it and see."</p><p></p><p>Gently caressing the Immortal Fire God Angry Flood Dragon cannon mechanism, feeling the power and heat waves contained within it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curved into a slight arc.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, with a thought, the [Painting Immortal] Dao Fruit trembled.</p><p></p><p>Then, the pure heart painting paper fluttered out, continuously duplicating the [Avalanche Crows].</p><p></p><p>When his divine nature and blood essence were consumed by about 70%, Li Che finally replicated a thousand [Avalanche Crows].</p><p></p><p>The consumed blood essence and divine nature caused Li Che to exhale a breath.</p><p></p><p>He took out a martial elixir pill and swallowed it, crushing the elixir shell and greedily absorbing the medicinal power to restore his blood essence.</p><p></p><p>With his current furnace-like physique, even the common Eight Extremes Martial Elixir could only be used as a blood essence restoration pill and could no longer achieve the effect of tempering his body.</p><p></p><p>A point landed on his brow.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chessboard expanded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately located the extremely dense killing intent of the Hunting Divine Hall Master outside the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent was so dense that it was almost like a black tide.</p><p></p><p>Making Li Che's eyes as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill me so much... and even went to the City Lord's Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xilong was monitoring Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was also monitoring him.</p><p></p><p>With his Lv3 Chessmaster Dao Fruit, he had activated the Northern Dipper Chessmaster state, allowing him to overlook from above and lock onto Huang Xilong's movements.</p><p></p><p>He directly activated the Northern Dipper mode, equivalent to opening his Third Eye.</p><p></p><p>So when Huang Xilong went to the City Lord's Mansion, Li Che guessed Huang Xilong's purpose.</p><p></p><p>He was planning to pick up the assassination task issued by that young prince again.</p><p></p><p>Since Huang Xilong wants to kill him,</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally...</p><p></p><p>would not wait to be killed.</p><p></p><p>He must strike first!</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the door, looking at the raging rain outside.</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain, making the world hazy, concealed the intense killing intent, making it less obvious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Underworld Divine Reflection Mirror replicated by the [Painting Immortal] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message to Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"Are you there?"</p><p></p><p>"Warm up for the great fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Hunt the Divine Element Immortal."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was in the courtyard, his whole body steaming with blood essence, tempering his physique, the six-headed crimson blood dragon serpents coiling and roaring.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the Eight Flood Dragon Turning the River, a peerless Grand Master true meaning technique, to the Six Dragon level!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The six blood dragon snakes rolled and surged in the courtyard, causing fierce winds, and the torrential rain was torn apart by the majestic true qi contained in the blood dragon serpents! It was as if there was the true aura of a real dragon, about to overturn the great river!</p><p></p><p>A roar echoed, suddenly spreading, and countless raindrops and tiles were shaken into the clouds above!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom-</p><p></p><p>Then, amid the dragon's roar, it exploded.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan clenched his five fingers into a fist, like a dragon emerging from the river, his phantom trembling! "Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"I've done it!"</p><p></p><p>"Old me has done it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was surrounded by the true meaning of the flood dragon, laughing heartily.</p><p></p><p>At the Six Dragon Realm, he activated the true meaning to temper his five viscera and six bowels, and a faintly sharp and heavy aura began to spread from his viscera!</p><p></p><p>Domineering and heavy! This was his aura, the Eight Flood Dragon Turning the River true meaning condensing the aura, with a style of domineering and heaviness.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a wisp of aura, it meant that Li Qingshan was only a layer away from stepping into the Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>He had been immersed in the Dao for so many years, and finally had the chance to touch the Grand Master realm! "But my aura is too weak, and I haven't yet condensed my own martial Dao will, not allowing the aura to fuse with the martial Dao will and become a divine aura!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was delighted, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Underworld Divine Reflection Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But he saw a message pop up on the mirror's surface.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so there's action already?"</p><p></p><p>"Warm-up before the great fortune?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Hunting the Divine Element Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"You call hunting the Divine Element Immortal a warm-up?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was confused.</p><p></p><p>No, they were going to act on the Divine Element Immortal so soon? Was this going to be a direct attack on the young prince? No...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan felt something was wrong. If they were really going to attack the Shadow Guard Immortal, it shouldn't be a warm-up.</p><p></p><p>"Other Divine Element Immortals in the Golden Light Manor? Wang Kuyu? Lu Yao... Huh? The fugitive Hunting Divine Hall Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's gaze changed.</p><p></p><p>Then he gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Since he had chosen to join the Underworld, he should participate in every battle!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>How could he dare call himself the Underworld's Cat Face in front of others? The Demon Subduing Mace slid down from his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He used the Underworld Divine Reflection Mirror to reply to Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan put on the Cat Face mask and rushed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Wait...</p><p></p><p>Of course, they wouldn't wait.</p><p></p><p>After all, the opportunity was fleeting and couldn't wait for anyone.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che didn't act immediately either.</p><p></p><p>He sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, the Heaven and Earth Chessboard expanded in his mind...</p><p></p><p>A Divine Element Immortal...</p><p></p><p>Would be more difficult to deal with than a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che needed to be fully prepared.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't act hastily, everything had to be pursued in a stable manner.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting Divine Hall Master wanted to kill him, this was a done deal.</p><p></p><p>The crisis was imminent!</p><p></p><p>Even, the Hunting Divine Hall Master wanted to kill not only him, but also Zhang Ya, as he had accepted the task to kill Xixia's parents.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>A life-and-death grudge!</p><p></p><p>Li Che should act as well.</p><p></p><p>His eyes opened.</p><p></p><p>The plan to hunt the Divine Element Immortal was already in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He stood up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che waved his sleeve, and the [Painting Immortal] painting paper fluttered out, a Li Che clone slowly walking out.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a gentle smile, looking at the main body, the clone nodded to the main Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Flying Thunder Chess Pieces were immediately grasped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>And he returned to the small courtyard in Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>"Restrain the divine."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's five fingers clenched like hooks.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gray mist rolled in front of him, condensing into the figure of Xue Dumu.</p><p></p><p>And it was the Xue Dumu before his arm was severed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che threw the Crescent Moon Sword divine weapon to Xue Dumu, and the Crescent Moon Sword transformed into a chopping knife, which Xue Dumu hung at his waist.</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Dumu could only exert 70% of his strength, but... 70% strength of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Is still a Grand Master! "My lord."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu, with the knife at his waist, had a bit more radiance in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a piece of spiritual wood, his index and middle fingers together, as if there was a sword light flowing, cutting out a ferocious-looking ox-head mask.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Corpse God Sect's Corpse God Envoys.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lightly drew a "One" on the ox-head mask with his index finger.</p><p></p><p>Mask, Ox One.</p><p></p><p>He tossed the mask to Xue Dumu.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu immediately put it on.</p><p></p><p>"Under the Ox Demon's banner... Ox Demon General Ox One."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking forward to the day when he could establish an Ox Demon army! He grabbed with his five fingers, and a cute ox-face mask was immediately covered on his face.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>The mask merged with his face, and his aura completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Cold, violent, and reckless emotions surged out.</p><p></p><p>Divine Element Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Wanting to kill me and Zhang Ya...</p><p></p><p>Must die as well!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open, the black robe billowing, the sleeves flying in the gale!</p><p></p><p>The scarlet-red, two-meter-long six-barreled cannon, the heavy Immortal Fire God Angry Flood Dragon cannon mechanism, was raised high by the Ox Demon's arm covered in dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>The rain pounded on the scarlet-red cannon barrels, instantly evaporating into rising steam!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao Fruit pounded!</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Ox Demon instantly disappeared, along with the silent Ox One, Xue Dumu, following behind him.</p><p></p><p>After the Ox Demon and Ox One left the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>The [Painting Immortal] clone Mian Face made an agile leap, bursting out of the courtyard and rushing towards another end of the city, shattering the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Seeking the best sniper position!

        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine essence within the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal was rapidly extracted, like a torrent of water bursting through a dam, rushing madly into Li Che's Mud Pill Palace inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt a slight trembling throughout his body, and the Mud Pill inner realm suddenly felt swollen, as if it could not withstand the high-speed turbulence of the divine essence.</p><p></p><p>The Mud Pill inner realm, located between the eyebrows, is a mysterious place in the human body.</p><p></p><p>Even when cultivating divine essence, one dares not be too reckless, as the inner realm is embedded in the mind. If it is damaged, the impact on the mind would be too great.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Che... had little fear.</p><p></p><p>He reveled in the exhilarating sensation of rapid absorption and advancement. The Untainted Heart could absorb, so he let it absorb.</p><p></p><p>If it could no longer absorb, the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit would automatically stop, so considerate of it.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the continuously rising maturity, Li Che's mind was clear, his gaze brilliant.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged, the Chess Saint Dao Fruit unfurling the heavenly and earthly chessboard, shielding his divine essence aura to avoid exposure.</p><p></p><p>Gathering his vital energy and spirit, he focused intently on refining the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal!</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart Dao Fruit pounded frantically, absorbing madly. Before long, Li Che found that the maturity of the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit had reached 50%!</p><p></p><p>Over half mature! Too fast! Too crazy!</p><p></p><p>The dense white divine essence was frantically extracted and fused into the Mud Pill inner realm, merging into the nourishing Untainted Heart divine essence river.</p><p></p><p>The river was growing stronger, undulating continuously, its grandeur rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It even surpassed the [Angry Cry Subdues Ghosts], [Heart Startled and Stern], and [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword] divine essence rivers that had already reached the level of a nourishing river! Even the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation seemed to be slightly shaken by the surging Untainted Heart river! Fortunately, the Untainted Heart divine essence had always been isolating the connections between the various divine essences, so even though it was shaking and impacting them, it did not cause an imbalance and collapse of the divine essences.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed the various divine essences in the inner realm...</p><p></p><p>His heart stirred, it seems he should hurry and forge the other divine essence foundations.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the increasingly majestic and substantial Untainted Heart divine essence, the white divine essence extracted from the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal was even purer than the divine essence extracted from the Ten Primes Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart only needed a short time to cleanse and purify, retaining about 80% of the divine essence! The Untainted divine essence grew increasingly majestic, converging into a divine essence river that was almost like a surging great river, completely overshadowing the other divine essence rivers, as if occupying the dominant position in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation seemed to gradually lose the ability to contend with the Untainted Heart divine essence river.</p><p></p><p>The power of position seemed to be ineffective at this moment! Suddenly - Li Che only felt as if his mind was about to explode, and the Mud Pill inner realm space instantly erupted with dazzling and white-shrouded light!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed slightly, could something go wrong?</p><p></p><p>Was the divine essence of the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal too majestic, causing the inner realm to burst? If that were the case, Li Che feared he would be at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his mind remained agile and clear, even... more so than before.</p><p></p><p>Countless white divine essences seemed to be boiling, obscuring all of Li Che's perceptions.</p><p></p><p>But he could feel an incredibly powerful compressive force erupting in the inner realm space.</p><p></p><p>A sudden chill made Li Che shiver from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat unbelievable. With his current tempering of his physical body, not to mention the cold, even if he were thrown into an ice cave, his surging and boiling blood would, if he wished, be able to boil the water! But in his current state...</p><p></p><p>Something was wrong! It was the cold coming from the inner realm space, a chill on the soul level!</p><p></p><p>As if an internal fusion was taking place, absorbing the surrounding heat, causing the temperature to plummet rapidly.</p><p></p><p>When the white haze disappeared,</p><p></p><p>Li Che saw the scene of the Mud Pill inner realm reappearing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Three divine essence rivers meandered, and the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation, suspended among them, was freely releasing divine essence.</p><p></p><p>But beside this divine foundation, another one had emerged, exuding a warm white luster as it released.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation was thick, like an enlarged and rounded cylinder of rock candy.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a divine foundation?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned, and then his expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>Forging a divine foundation... is it really that simple? Smooth and effortless! The forging of the Untainted Heart divine foundation was even completed without him realizing it, as he absorbed the divine essence from the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's second divine foundation was now suspended in the inner realm space.</p><p></p><p>It did not have the terrifying and oppressive divine foundation aura of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord, nor the kind of aura that could affect people's emotions and make them uncontrollably angry.</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart divine foundation... pure and white, seemingly without any aura, making the mind clear and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, what function does this Untainted Heart divine foundation have? Other than increasing the content of Untainted Heart divine essence, does it have any other uses? Suddenly, Li Che thought of something and manipulated the Untainted Heart divine foundation to approach the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The moment he drew near, a powerful suction force erupted.</p><p></p><p>Just like two round magnets, they snapped together with a click! Instantly -</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the aura of the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation suddenly surge, rising far, far beyond what it was before...</p><p></p><p>It was a breakthrough that shattered the bottleneck barrier! As if...</p><p></p><p>It had been directly elevated an entire level! The [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation that Li Che had cultivated was originally at the Upper Realm of the Eight Extremes level.</p><p></p><p>Now... it seemed to have directly advanced to the Lower Realm of the Seven Primes level! A Seven Primes divine foundation!</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just an illusion...</p><p></p><p>Li Che could not help but raise the corners of his lips, unable to suppress his smile any longer.</p><p></p><p>"The Untainted Heart divine foundation... actually has this kind of effect."</p><p></p><p>"If I later obtain the Four Sovereigns Divine Foundation Technique and refine new divine foundations with it, and then combine them with the Untainted Heart divine foundation... could I directly elevate them to the 'Three Purities' level?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone with excitement, just thinking about it was thrilling.</p><p></p><p>However, divine foundations are not necessarily better the higher the level. As Li Qingshan said, the higher the divine foundation level, the stronger the physical body required to support it...</p><p></p><p>If the physical body is not strong enough, the inner realm may collapse, the physical body may be destroyed, and in the end... be controlled by the divine foundation, becoming a mindless monster, slowly exhausting the vitality of the physical body until death.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt he should take it slow.</p><p></p><p>"But after reaching the Divine Appearance, I will no longer be able to modify the divine foundations, so I should lay a solid divine foundation base before that."</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his mind withdrawing from the Mud Pill inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful blood qi permeated the entire workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, it seems that unbeknownst to him, at the moment the Seven Primes divine foundation power erupted, his physical body had uncontrollably activated the Golden Armor Transformation to withstand the force of the Seven Primes divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the blood qi and divine essence pervading the entire room...</p><p></p><p>Inhale...</p><p>Exhale...</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>A massive suction force erupted from the Mud Pill, absorbing all the scattered divine essences back in.</p><p></p><p>This caused the workshop to no longer have the slightest divine essence aura, and the blood qi was also devoured back into his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a light prompt appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (LV3, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal in his hand, which still had about a third of its divine essence remaining, yet it had already pushed the Untainted Heart to LV3!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light flashed! [Dao Fruit LV3, further evolution, obtains the divine ability embryo "Untainted Heart·Subdue Spirits"]</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing became slightly rapid.</p><p></p><p>It's done!</p><p></p><p>The third Dao Fruit has given birth to the third divine ability embryo! After [Immortal Craftsman·Thousand Analyses] and [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor·Ascend Tower], the [Untainted Heart·Subdue Spirits] divine ability embryo has officially emerged! Li Che's heart was burning with excitement, his emotions surging! In his chest, the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit was thunderously pounding, and with each beat, it seemed countless divine essences were erupting, twisting into root-like divine essence tentacles! They were frantically whipping about in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>[Divine Ability Embryo (Untainted Heart·Subdue Spirits): True clarity and purity, can fathom all things, subdue spirits and command armies, all deities revere me]</p><p></p><p>The golden introduction flowed across his vision.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood gradually calmed down as he carefully pondered the introduction.</p><p></p><p>It's a bit like Ascend Tower, at first... he still couldn't quite grasp this introduction.</p><p></p><p>But as he slowly sensed it, his heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling those divine essence tentacles growing from the Untainted Heart divine foundation...</p><p></p><p>It's like an evil god controlling its subjects with tentacles...</p><p>A puppeteer manipulating his marionettes with strings...</p><p></p><p>He somehow felt... this was not a good thing!</p><p></p><p>"You call this 'Untainted Heart'? Purity and innocence, so white it becomes black?"</p><p></p><p>"How does this feel like a black heart?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but mutter.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and began to understand the function of the [Untainted Heart·Subdue Spirits] divine ability embryo, gradually becoming clear.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes and let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, a gray-black divine essence chess piece appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>It was condensed from the divine essence he had absorbed from the body of the Corpse God Sect's Ten Primes Corpse God Envoy after killing him.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Analyses had absorbed it, the Heavenly and Earthly Chessboard had stored it, and now...</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart would use it? The divine ability embryo, Untainted Heart·Subdue Spirits! After suddenly activating it, a majestic divine essence erupted from the Untainted Heart divine essence!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Li Che felt his eyes turn completely white, as if he had</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The white smoke was faintly swirling.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the golden smoke from when he ascended the tower, the white wispy smoke made Li Che's temperament seem lofty and indifferent... as if he was apathetic to all life in the world, as if everything was just cold chess pieces on the board.</p><p></p><p>The untainted divine spiritual tentacles of the Unsullied Heart Divine Foundation touched upon the divine chess pieces of the Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>On the chessboard, the divine chess pieces belonging solely to the Corpse Deity Envoy all shot out, piling up endlessly in front of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Gradually...</p><p></p><p>They actually transformed into the twisted and ugly appearance of the Corpse Deity Envoy, except the entire skin was dull and lifeless, appearing a grayish-black.</p><p></p><p>No breath of life, no pulsing of a heartbeat... it was just a lifeless object, completely condensed from divine energy.</p><p></p><p>And with just a thought from him, he could completely control this Corpse Deity Envoy, it would obey his commands completely...</p><p></p><p>As if it had become his... soldier!</p><p></p><p>Restraining the divine... transforming divine energy into divine generals under his command?! Li Che took a deep breath, this was going to completely drain the cultivators who died at his hands.</p><p></p><p>"It seems only cultivators at the Divine Foundation Realm are qualified to be 'restrained' by me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine thoughts stirred, and the Unsullied Heart Divine tentacles condensed another divine general.</p><p></p><p>It was the second-in-command of the Ten Million Gambling Den, Lin Da, at the initial Divine Foundation Realm.</p><p></p><p>That Corpse Deity Envoy had the cultivation of the late Divine Foundation Realm, but its main strength was in the cursed iron body, not easily defeated even by a Sect Master warrior, combined with the Divine Foundation cultivation, it could be said to be extremely difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it encountered Li Che who had activated the Tower Ascension state...</p><p></p><p>Directly crushing the Temple God chess pieces, like the Temple God himself descending, directly undefeatable at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how you curse the iron corpse, in the face of the unparalleled tempering, it would still be smashed to pieces! "Restraining two divine generals is already somewhat taxing, now I... can barely restrain three Divine Foundation Realm divine generals!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the burden on his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that his Divine Foundation cultivation was not strong enough, he was only at the initial Divine Foundation Realm, his divine sense strength was limited.</p><p></p><p>"It's enough... in battle, suddenly releasing three helpers, it's simply... terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>The vicious and cunning Ox Demon, he had to raise it another level.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Raising his five fingers, an extremely dark divine chess piece floated in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple God chess piece..."</p><p></p><p>"Can I restrain the Temple God as a general?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Knock, knock, knock."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, your customer has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Outside, Shangguan Qinghong lightly knocked on the door and called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suppressed the urge to restrain the Temple God, his divine thoughts stirring, and the two divine generals he had restrained appeared in his inner spiritual space.</p><p></p><p>Under the Unsullied Heart Divine tentacles, they hung like puppets, swaying with the movement of the tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The scene... was quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>Li Che withdrew his divine thoughts, his eyes shining, took out the Zhong Kui statue, and placed it on the desk.</p><p></p><p>Then he opened the door.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong stood coquettishly at the door, and beside her was a young Samanera monk wearing a blue-green robe.</p><p></p><p>With six ordination scars on his head, his expression was gentle.</p><p></p><p>"This is Dharma Master Kong from the Heart Monkey Temple, the one who ordered the [Fierce-Eyed Demon-Subduing] statue."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong said to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The monk saw Li Che, palms together in greeting, his expression as gentle as ever.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the monk, his overwhelming divine energy burning like flames, impossible to suppress, seeming to distort the air around him.</p><p></p><p>"I am Dharma Master Kong, pleased to meet you, Master Li."</p><p></p><p>The monk in the blue-green robe said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned the greeting and invited the two into the workshop.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, Dharma Master Kong's gaze changed slightly, his sight falling on the blood-colored wood carving, as if he saw a vast and majestic divine energy surging and entwining.</p><p></p><p>Any evil or ghostly aura could not approach it at all, the entire workshop had a brilliant and bright atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>"This wood carving..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong was obviously a man of discernment, his heart greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>With such a majestic aura, subduing ghosts would be easy for this carving.</p><p></p><p>He took three steps and covered two, walking up to the Zhong Kui statue, looking at the fierce-eyed and bushy-bearded Zhong Kui statue, as if seeing an angry divine being glaring at the mortal world, dispelling evil spirits and subduing all the demonic and ominous forces in heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Good... good..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong was greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen this kind of statue before, but it had an extremely intense ghost-subduing power! The power to exorcise evil was extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>Although it did not match the Buddha statues of the Heart Monkey Temple, that overwhelming ghost-subduing power was no less.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a Buddhist monk, when it came to divine statues, there was not much concern, it did not necessarily have to be a Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Like many temples, worshiping strange and mysterious temple gods, which were not the Buddhas of Buddhism, but it did not prevent the temple from obtaining power through worshiping the statues.</p><p></p><p>What power is obtained and what is done with it is the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why Dharma Master Kong did not restrict the carving type, otherwise he would have mentioned the need for a Buddha statue in the requirements.</p><p></p><p>"Good, Master Li's craftsmanship is excellent!" </p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong exclaimed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Is Dharma Master Kong satisfied? Is this Zhong Kui statue sufficient?" Li Che asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong nodded: "Not to mention the exquisite craftsmanship, just the overwhelming divine energy possessed by this statue, a hundred ghosts will fear it, ten thousand demons will kowtow!"</p><p></p><p>"The Fierce-Eyed Demon-Subduing, truly a perfect match."</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Kui God', Brother Li... have you seen the Kui God before? It seems there is a similar mysterious temple of the Kui God in the Qingzhou region, and the temple god there is also fierce-eyed and bushy-bearded, with a terrifying gaze."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was surprised, her eyes revealing a strange color.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly taken aback, the Kui God?</p><p></p><p>This world really has the Kui God?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord and the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Wrathful Third Prince, the existence of the Kui God is normal.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the ancient records, I felt a resonance, and hearing that the Kui God is good at subduing ghosts, I carved it accordingly, but unfortunately I have never seen it in person, so I could only rely on my imagination."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong was reluctant to part with it, immediately taking out two ten-do divine energy crystals and handing them to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Li, for your craftsmanship, I will take this statue, the quality of this statue has reached the pinnacle of ten-do, but due to Master Li's cultivation, it cannot be upgraded to nine-star... it's a pity."</p><p></p><p>"If it was nine-star, the price would not be this." Shangguan Qinghong quickly added.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Dharma Master Kong thought for a moment, then took out a string of prayer beads from his Qiankun Jade and handed it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, two divine energy crystals in exchange for this statue with such divine charm, I do feel a bit guilty, so I offer this Buddha bead bracelet as a gift, also to make a friend."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, you can come to the Heart Monkey Temple for a visit whenever you have time."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong palms together, bowing in courtesy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not refuse, taking the Buddha bead bracelet and glancing at it, nine beads on the bracelet, the simple rope strung them up, each bead had a monkey face carved on it.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Thousand Analysis, analyzing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Non-Divine Weapon: Heart Monkey Buddha Bead Bracelet】</p><p></p><p>【Origin: Ordinary bodhi wood polished into beads, containing a trace of Heart Monkey Fire Wrath divine energy, can dispel heart demons】</p><p></p><p>【Wielding: None】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Huh? Li Che was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Monkey Buddha Bead Bracelet was not a divine weapon, Li Che didn't really mind, but was more focused on its introduction.</p><p></p><p>Heart Monkey Fire Wrath divine energy? Fire Wrath... Wrath of the Seven Emotions? The combination of Five Elements and Seven Emotions divine energy? This was the first time Li Che encountered it, his heart slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>However, this was clearly not the time to study, suppressing his thoughts, he stored the Buddha bead bracelet away.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Kong did not put the Zhong Kui statue back into the Qiankun Jade, but directly hugged it and left the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong and Li Che saw him off.</p><p></p><p>Watching the monk carrying the Kui God statue disappear into the spring breeze, the expressions of the two were somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Monkey Temple has deep heritage, they have their own wood carving hall, but Dharma Master Kong often comes to our Astronomical Observatory to take on tasks, letting our Observatory's masters earn the hard-earned divine energy crystals... he can be considered an oddity of the Heart Monkey Temple."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong, not knowing where she got a handful of melon seeds, started cracking them.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Monkey Temple has deep heritage?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che was curious.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Monkey Temple is one of the five major sects in the Golden Light Prefecture, although not as powerful as the Divine Sect branches, but the Heart Monkey Temple's origins are not simple."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that its Dao lineage is not ordinary, the Heart Monkey Temple is an ancient remnant of the Divine Sect, dating back three thousand years, its Divine Sect orthodox lineage was once powerful, occupying the six realms and twelve states, suppressing the contemporary dynasties, only to have its Dao lineage fallen into decline now."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago, the mysterious temple it suppressed erupted in a world-shocking calamity, and that extremely terrifying 'Three Pure Level' temple god was revived, with no one able to subdue it, plus other forces intervening, this ancient Divine Sect Dao lineage was completely shattered, fragmented into four."</p><p></p><p>"Later, the remaining Divine Sect Dao lineage monks fled and came to the Golden Light Prefecture, and they established the Heart Monkey Temple while carrying part of the Dao lineage."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly shaken upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Divine Sect Dao lineage, that was truly not ordinary, after all, to reach the level of the Divine Sect orthodox lineage, it was certainly not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"What was the name of the Divine Sect that the Heart Monkey Temple's orthodox lineage belonged to?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong cracked a melon seed, chewing on it with her small mouth while tilting her head and thinking for a while, "The name of the destroyed Divine Sect was extremely arrogant... I think it was called..."</p><p></p><p>"Qitian Temple."</p><p></p><p>Seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes, seeking support for continued reading!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

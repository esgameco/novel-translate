        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the chilly snowflakes were quietly falling.</p><p></p><p>They gently covered the earth with a pure white coat.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Li Che's lips, and his mind sank deep.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw that on the towering Dao tree in the vast land, a seven-colored jade-like Dao fruit had formed once again.</p><p></p><p>The third Dao fruit! After [Immortal Craft] and [Dragon Elephant Vajra], this was the third one! [Immortal Craft] had improved Li Che's craftsmanship, and [Dragon Elephant Vajra] had enhanced his tempering strength, making his physical body unparalleled and his martial arts talent soar. However, despite this, Li Che still could not infer what the third Dao fruit would be.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of expectation and excitement, like opening a blind box.</p><p></p><p>[Untainted Heart (Dao Fruit): The mind is pure and clear, like the Bodhi, untainted by dust, cultivating an untainted nature]</p><p></p><p>Along with the fluctuations of his mind, the introduction and description of [Untainted Heart] appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The mind is pure and clear... like the Bodhi."</p><p></p><p>"Untainted by dust, cultivating an untainted nature..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured the introduction, and his breathing gradually became a little more rapid.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the nature... cultivating the spiritual nature?"</p><p></p><p>In this realm, cultivation is divided into three types: refining the body, inner strength, and spiritual nature. Spiritual nature is the most difficult, but also the most extraordinary, with immense power.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate spiritual nature, in addition to the spiritual nature cultivation method, one must also cultivate the body and inner strength to a powerful degree. In other words, refining the body and inner strength... are preparations for cultivating the spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had once curiously asked Xu You about the content of spiritual nature cultivation, and Xu You did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"The body must reach the level of blood replacement, only at the blood replacement realm can one stimulate the five viscera and six bowels to absorb and store spiritual nature. And the inner strength must reach the Third Heaven, only then can one cultivate the spiritual nature."</p><p></p><p>"What is spiritual nature? All things in heaven and earth have spirits, but only humans have the divine charm, which is the spiritual nature. Absorbing and cultivating the spiritual nature, transcending the mundane, is the root source of humans being the most spiritually advanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu You explained to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual nature of humans can be divided into seven emotions and six desires: joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and surprise. The seven emotions can each be a major category of spiritual nature, and the six desires can also be differentiated, but the seven emotional spiritual natures are more common."</p><p></p><p>"Each major category of spiritual nature can be further divided into veins, and each vein can be the foundation for a divine base. For example, the [Sorrow Cry Subdue Demon] divine base of the Si family is in the vein of [Sorrow Spiritual Nature], and the [Awe Trace Light] divine base of the city guard Zhang Xiangyang is in the vein of [Fear Spiritual Nature]."</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, and the bitter winter chill lingered.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that with the stimulation of the newly obtained Dao fruit [Untainted Heart], his six senses seemed to have become more acute, able to capture the spiritual nature floating in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, many spiritual natures were emitting faint light, like fireflies in the night sky, drifting unceasingly, slowly gathering one by one around him and entering his body, finally accumulating within the [Untainted Heart].</p><p></p><p>"The Dao fruit [Untainted Heart], can it help me cultivate the spiritual nature?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xu You had said that the combat power of spiritual nature cultivators is far superior to those who only refine the body and inner strength, and if they establish a divine base, they would be terrifyingly powerful. Unless one is a Meridian Master, they would be easily crushed by a divine base cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual nature method is extremely precious, the foundation of a clan. Even the Xu family, although Li Che had become a master wood carver, could only obtain the most basic spiritual nature method.</p><p></p><p>"Xu You has explained to me the levels of spiritual nature cultivation. The first realm is cultivating the nature, reaching one-time nature cultivation, not weaker than blood replacement, and perfecting the nature can even rival Meridian Masters. The second realm is establishing the divine base, forging the foundation of the spiritual nature, shedding the mortal nature, and can even suppress Meridian Masters!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, recalling the information about spiritual nature that Xu You had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Name: Li Che]</p><p>[Bonds: Li Nuanxi (daughter)]</p><p>[Dao Fruits: Immortal Craft (lv3, 5%), Dragon Elephant Vajra (lv1, 70%), Untainted Heart (lv1, 0%)]</p><p>[Nascent Divine Ability: Immortal Craft Â· Thousand Separation Hand]</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The panel appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, the advancement of the Dao fruit [Immortal Craft] had become increasingly slow after reaching lv3, of course, also because Li Che had spent more time on martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, the main reason was that Li Che had...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The difficulty in manufacturing the mechanisms he planned to create was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The "Compendium of Tang Mechanisms" recorded twelve types of mechanisms, of which three were relatively basic, and Li Che had already completed the manufacture of those. The remaining nine were all closely related to qi, blood, and inner strength, and even... involved divinity.</p><p></p><p>So the difficulty skyrocketed. Li Che spent a year on it, but fortunately he had the help of a Lv.3 "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit. Along with the collection of materials, he finally managed to manufacture the mechanism that was ranked seventh in the Compendium of Tang Mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>The "Wooden Crow", ranked seventh in the Compendium of Tang Mechanisms, was a mechanism beast that Li Che had painstakingly created.</p><p></p><p>As for his physical cultivation, the martial talent enhanced by the "Dragon Elephant Golden Ape" Dao fruit had allowed Li Che to successfully advance to the Tempering Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tempering Bone realm was a polishing technique. In addition to daily cultivation and refining, it also required a large amount of dietary supplementation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Tempering Bone cultivation method was something he had obtained from the market, called the "Eighteen Tiger Bone Simmering and Tempering Method". He had spent eight hundred taels on it, from the same merchant who had sold him the "Xu Family Nine Tendons Method".</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the merchant did not have the ability to provide a superior inner strength method.</p><p></p><p>Rising in the snow and wind, his entire skeleton cracked and popped like firecrackers exploding. Swinging a punch, it was like a long spear thrusting, seeming to split the very air. The martial technique "White Tiger Raging Wind Fist" had already been mastered by Li Che to the Grand Master level, just a step away from reaching the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Any martial technique could be divided into levels of Initiation, Minor Accomplishment, Great Accomplishment, Grand Master, and Transformation Realm, according to the degree of mastery.</p><p></p><p>Once achieving the Transformation Realm, one could even stir the divine nature between heaven and earth, greatly enhancing the power of the martial technique.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering Bone at the Great Accomplishment, Grand Master Fist, as well as Grand Master-level Shattering Bone Spear..."</p><p></p><p>"Now, even without activating the "Dragon Elephant Golden Ape", my cultivation in the Outer City of Feilei is already at the top level..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che revealed a faint smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>However, this was only true in the Outer City. In the Inner City, even the scions of the great families had been nurtured with superior supplements and cultivated higher-level methods, both in physical refinement and inner strength.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Outer City martial artists, they were far superior. After all, only upon reaching the Blood Transformation realm could one nurture the divine nature and become a divine cultivator of the Nourishing Nature realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to activate the Golden Ape Transformation, I wonder if I could crush the Blood Transformation martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered, as he had never actually fought against them before and was unsure of their true strength.</p><p></p><p>The explosive increase in physical strength from the Golden Ape Transformation should be able to reach the level of "breaking a myriad techniques with a single strike".</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the advancement of the Dragon Elephant Golden Ape is too slow. To reach Lv.2, I might need my base martial cultivation to break through to the Blood Transformation realm first..."</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Xu Family Eight-Section Shattering Bone Spear in the courtyard for a while, Li Che finally sat down cross-legged, calming his mind and preparing to try the effects of the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the ground, allowing the falling snow to accumulate around him.</p><p></p><p>His mind sank deep, merging into the pulsing Dao fruit, the "Untainted Heart".</p><p></p><p>It was as if an additional heart had appeared within his body, its faint beating connecting to the divine nature between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>One moment, two moments, three moments...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was clear and tranquil, like an old monk in deep meditation.</p><p></p><p>The snow piled up thickly around his unmoving body.</p><p></p><p>After an hour had passed, Li Che finally opened his eyes, a faint white light flickering within them.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (Lv.1, 1%)]</p><p></p><p>Although he had not cultivated any divine nature techniques, the Untainted Heart could still help Li Che absorb the divine nature between heaven and earth, similar to the effects of a divine cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The divine nature I have cultivated is pure and untainted, not belonging to any particular divine lineage..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then, how should I consider this?"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, what kind of divine foundation shall I forge?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che seemed to have thought of something, his gaze flickering...</p><p></p><p>His heart pounded, and ambition surged wildly!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

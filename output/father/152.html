            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flowing light gradually unfurled before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The falling snow instantly evaporated, which was a surge of tremendous heat from the depths of Li Che's heart, causing the flow of his qi and blood to accelerate and erupt.</p><p></p><p>"It has transformed..."</p><p></p><p>"LV4!"</p><p></p><p>"The first Dao fruit that has transformed to LV4 level!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>His voice was calm, but there was an irrepressible excitement surging within.</p><p></p><p>Then, it settled into a calm breathing.</p><p></p><p>"Exhale—"</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—"</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were silent, with flurries of snow falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, calming his emotions, gazing at the flowing light before him.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (LV4, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit LV4, second transformation, the embryonic form of divine abilities (Immortal Craftsman·Thousand Analyses) has been promoted, obtaining the divine ability (Immortal Craftsman·Plucking the Stars)]</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit has undergone a second transformation!</p><p></p><p>The embryonic form of divine abilities... has been promoted to a divine ability! Even though Li Che had calmed his emotions, he could not help but be stirred up.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities...</p><p></p><p>Plucking the Stars!</p><p></p><p>[Plucking the Stars (Divine Ability): Plucking the stars from the sky, fully entering my divine self, embracing the untainted body, all spirits come to pay homage]</p><p></p><p>[First Realm: Plucking Stars Eyes]</p><p></p><p>[Infinitely analyzing, absorbing spiritual essence, fathoming the void and returning to the true, shaking evil and eliminating the wicked]</p><p></p><p>[Second Realm: ???]</p><p></p><p>[???]</p><p></p><p>As the embryonic form of the divine ability was promoted, an introduction to the newly obtained divine ability spontaneously arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of the divine ability... the second realm!</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he was unable to activate the second realm of the divine ability, and he realized that his spiritual awareness was too weak to bear it.</p><p></p><p>He could not even forcibly activate the second realm of the divine ability. It was as if there was a door standing before him, and no matter how much he tried to push, he might not be able to move it.</p><p></p><p>In short, it boiled down to one word: weak. The insufficiency of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He did not pay attention to the effects of the second realm Plucking the Stars divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immersed his mind in the ability of the first realm [Plucking Stars Eyes].</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a powerful suction force erupted before him.</p><p></p><p>He only felt his soul whirling.</p><p></p><p>On his forehead, it was as if a third eye had emerged, its pupils shining with profound divine light.</p><p></p><p>Gently opening and closing, he opened the vertical eye in the middle of his brow.</p><p></p><p>After the world had spun, the scene before him underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p></p><p>The vast, boundless, and majestic heavens and earth appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, there was also a Dao tree that had grown from the boundless earth, soaring up to the sky, shattering the clouds.</p><p></p><p>On the Dao tree, the branches were drooping, and there were five colorful, glowing fruits suspended.</p><p></p><p>Those were the Dao Fruits! Among them, the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit seemed to have become heavier, slightly bending the branches.</p><p></p><p>The degree of the bend was very small, but in Li Che's eyes... it was extremely obvious! As if it was engraved in the depths of his soul, he could instantly capture that arc.</p><p></p><p>Then, his gaze swept over the other four Dao Fruits, which were [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], [Untainted Heart], [Chess Sage], and [Immortal in a Painting]! And as soon as he looked at them, he felt that the Plucking Stars Eyes in his brow seemed to have become extremely scorching.</p><p></p><p>It emitted endless, dazzling brilliance! Extremely resplendent, as if the filament of an incandescent lamp was sublimated under billions of watts of power! The vertical pupil spread out energy like strange floral patterns, entwining and covering Li Che's arms.</p><p></p><p>His hand, unable to resist, rose up, the five fingers spreading open, as if the void itself was being stretched open by his palm! Slowly reaching towards the Dao tree, towards the four Dao Fruits other than [Immortal Craftsman], as if...</p><p></p><p>Like an immortal reaching up to pluck the stars from the night sky! However, the scene in front of him soon blurred.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness returned to his physical body.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, his heavy breathing was like a bellows, constantly pulsing.</p><p></p><p>Each inhale and exhale stirred up turbulent airflows! Wood chips flew, in constant turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the seven [Immortal in a Painting] projections in the room, which had somehow dispersed, leaving only the partially refined Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt his greatly strengthened seven Spiritual Foundations, exhaling a turbid breath.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and wiped the sweat on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Even his back was drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>As if he had experienced some arduous task, just like truly ascending to the heavens, trying to pluck those distant stars.</p><p></p><p>"The [Immortal in a Painting] projections have automatically dispersed... was it because of the disturbance from the Dao Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"Was I just trying to reach out my hand to pluck the Dao Fruits hanging on the Dao tree?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a turbid breath, his eyes flickering with different colors.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and touched his brow, only to find that the vertical eye had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The first realm divine ability [Plucking Stars Eyes] had been deactivated.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che felt that his vital energy had been greatly consumed, especially his spiritual power, which had been drained, leaving him with a hazy and disoriented perception.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual awareness was nearly depleted, as if it had been sucked dry.</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood that this was the tremendous consumption brought about by his previous experimentation with the divine ability.</p><p></p><p>While sitting in meditation to recover, he carefully contemplated.</p><p></p><p>"Plucking the stars... so-called 'stars' are the Dao Fruits?"</p><p></p><p>"But what is the meaning of plucking the Dao Fruits?"</p><p></p><p>"For now, I cannot pluck the Dao Fruits, and I will have to wait until my cultivation is strong enough to formally pluck the Dao Fruits to understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could simply consider that the Immortal Craftsman divine ability and the Plucking Stars Eyes were an upgraded version of the Thousand Analyses, possessing the ability to analyze divine weapons, absorb divine essence, and more.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, it seems to have gained effects like "absorbing spiritual essence, fathoming the void and returning to the true, shaking evil and eliminating the wicked".</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing spiritual essence..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, and the essence of the divine ability seemed to flow and bloom in his mind, informing him of what "absorbing spiritual essence" meant.</p><p></p><p>"Refining spiritual nature?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, a hint of a different color flashing in them.</p><p></p><p>"Fathoming the void and returning to the true means that I can ignore any illusions or falsehoods, including mind-controlling formations and the like."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a breath, and as for shaking evil and eliminating the wicked, the meaning was quite self-explanatory.</p><p></p><p>The development of the divine ability still requires gradual progress, but overall, he was satisfied with the effects.</p><p></p><p>However, to wield the divine ability... requires strength.</p><p></p><p>He is still too weak at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The snow began to fall again, fluttering down onto his hair, shoulders, and the book he was holding.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not use his qi and blood to evaporate the snow.</p><p></p><p>He continued to read the "True Transmission of the Tang Clan Mechanisms".</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell upon it, and after the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit reached LV4, his understanding and insights into the mechanisms increased by another level.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the more obscure and difficult "True Transmission of the Tang Clan Mechanisms" than the "Compendium of the Tang Clan Mechanisms", it suddenly became much clearer and easier to understand in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carefully studied it, and in his mind, he seemed to be constantly deducing and calculating, constructing mechanical models.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanical beasts... the 'True Transmission of the Tang Clan Mechanisms' records the details of the creation of mechanical beasts and the accompanying... mechanical techniques."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the golden book of the "True Transmission of the Tang Clan Mechanisms" in his hand slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>The words on it seemed to come alive.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, they transformed into a scripture in Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was surprised, but after the surprise, he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Tang Clan's secret art, the 'Nine Seals of Mechanisms', the key and essence of creating mechanical beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Only with sufficient comprehension can one extract the essence from the 'True Transmission of the Tang Clan Mechanisms' and refine this secret art!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who are about to go into battle array themselves in front, the Nine Seals of Mechanisms is a secret art that the ancestors of the Tang Clan developed from the mysterious temple they subdued."</p><p></p><p>"Mechanical beasts require the imprinting of seals, and the more seals a mechanical beast can bear, the stronger it will become!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten-Tailed Mechanical Beasts bear one seal, Nine-Luminaries Mechanical Beasts bear two seals..."</p><p></p><p>"The four supreme-grade mechanical beasts of the Tang Clan bear seven seals!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, radiating a brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>So that's how it is...</p><p></p><p>This is the true core of the Tang Clan's mechanisms!</p><p></p><p>His heart surged with excitement as he began to carefully study the "Nine Seals of Mechanisms", which belonged to the realm of secret arts.</p><p></p><p>He was very interested in any secret arts and wanted to see if he could integrate them into the [Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant].</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che soon frowned at the "Nine Seals of Mechanisms". It was clearly a level higher than the secret arts he had encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending it was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was quite patient.</p><p></p><p>While recovering his vital energy, he studied the secret art "Nine Seals of Mechanisms".</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard during high noon.</p><p></p><p>Cuicui, with her pigtails, poked her small head out from the big red cotton jacket, occasionally popping up next to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, is it done yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, have you finished making it? Cuicui is so impatient!"</p><p></p><p>Cuicui kept chirping and muttering.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang didn't dare to get close, as they were a bit afraid of Cuicui's father.</p><p></p><p>They always felt that Cuicui's father's gaze was so sharp, as if he could crush their heads.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Lü Chi was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>After enduring it so much, his psychological tolerance had gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>Since Fei Lei City, Lü Chi had withstood Li Che's gaze, so this was nothing. Lü Chi grunted as he practiced his martial arts, disdainfully snorting at Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang.</p><p></p><p>A couple of weaklings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Che paid no attention to the thoughts of the three little rascals.</p><p></p><p>He was carving a small object.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife kept flashing in his hands, and the glowing wood chips fell like snow.</p><p></p><p>After the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit advanced again, Li Che's carving skills had almost reached a realm, forming his own unique style.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the carving knife and gently rubbed Cuicui's exploring little head.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Daddy, where's the little crow you mentioned? What's this ugly thing?"</p><p></p><p>Cuicui bared her teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>The little butterfly on her shoulder was also curiously flapping its wings.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu, Gong Yuanliang, and Lü Chi couldn't help but be curious, coming over.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and assembled the scattered components, using a mortise and tenon structure without even using a single nail.</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Che opened his mouth, and a powerful airflow gushed out from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the assembled wooden crane was blown away by the wood chips, revealing its streamlined mechanical beast body.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The big-headed Lü Chi, his eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A mechanical beast?! This is a mechanical beast! Uncle Li actually made a mechanical beast? Although it only has the appearance of a mechanical beast, this is already an extremely remarkable feat.</p><p></p><p>However, what shocked Lü Chi even more happened soon after.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, amidst the "wow" exclamations of the three little brats, was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, his five fingers moved like hooks, drawing a "Xing" character seal in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then, he embedded this mechanism seal into the body of the wooden crane using his divine essence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che released his hand.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack—</p><p></p><p>The wooden crane immediately began to twist and turn, its wooden wings flapping restlessly.</p><p></p><p>As if it was getting used to this body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat quietly on the ground, and a faint divine pattern seemed to appear on his brow.</p><p></p><p>Then it flashed and disappeared in an instant - the divine ability, Plucking Stars Eyes! Absorbing Spiritual Essence!</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shot out from the vertical pupil, merging into the core of the wooden crane where the "Xing" character seal was engraved.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the originally clumsy and awkward wooden crane became agile and nimble.</p><p></p><p>It hopped around the courtyard, then went to Cuicui's side, nuzzling her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha! Daddy is so amazing! This big bird is so fun to play with!"</p><p></p><p>The butterfly on Cuicui's shoulder also flapped its wings, challenging the wooden crane.</p><p></p><p>The wooden crane raised its neck, and Cuicui climbed onto its back, and with a flap of its wings, it took flight into the sky, gliding and soaring in the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Cuicui was overjoyed, her little face flushed, this big crane was much more fun than the wobble car! "Daddy, I'm flying!"</p><p></p><p>Cuicui's laughter and the sound of silver bells kept coming from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The playful Empress Cuicui was ecstatic!</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched Cuicui laughing brilliantly, brushing the wood chips off his black robe, standing up.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were gentle, and a smile lingered on his lips.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Seals of Mechanisms, an introductory level! Mastering one seal counts as an introductory level.</p><p></p><p>This secret art of mechanisms was extremely difficult, and Li Che had spent three days just barely reaching the introductory level and grasping the first seal. The more seals he mastered, the more difficult it would become.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the rank of this Nine Seals of Mechanisms even surpassed that of secret arts.</p><p></p><p>"A drone... a good hand at aerial bombing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, quite satisfied with the wooden crane.</p><p></p><p>And furthermore...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...the mechanical beasts he created were imbued with spirituality...</p><p></p><p>Because they were infused with the illuminating light of his divine ability [Plucking the Stars], they were lifelike and very human-like.</p><p></p><p>Just like real spiritual cranes.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang's eyes were shining with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Curly's father is so amazing.</p><p></p><p>The wooden bird he made can actually fly.</p><p></p><p>Unlike their father, who can only listen to music in brothels.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Qi's shock was the greatest, as he understood what this meant - Li Che had grasped the core of the Tong clan's mechanical techniques! Not only could he create the outward appearance of mechanical beasts, but he could also imbue them with abilities!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lü Qi felt a chill down his spine. Because he found that Li Che was looking at him with a faint smile, a gaze that made him feel a shudder of terror.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi felt that his shock was a bit out of place for a child of this age.</p><p></p><p>Like Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang, who felt their father was useless in comparison, that would be the proper mindset.</p><p></p><p>Li Che averted his gaze from Lü Qi.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi's identity seemed a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't bother to investigate further, since even Lü Qi's master Li Qingshan didn't pursue it, so why should he care? Considering Lü Qi's performance so far, as long as he didn't try to harm Curly, Li Che wouldn't be tempted to test the feel of throwing a big head.</p><p></p><p>He clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>The wooden spiritual crane immediately descended, and Curly embraced the wooden crane.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, father... let Curly play with the big crane a little more!"</p><p></p><p>Curly raised a chubby finger, arched her eyebrows, and pleaded with Li Che with her small nose.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che frowned.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Have you finished the writing assignment Elder Zhang gave you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>"I finished the assignment, so can I play? The big crane is right here, I can play with it anytime. If you haven't finished, you'll get hit by Elder Zhang's ruler tomorrow, and don't cry with a red nose again."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was impartial.</p><p></p><p>After all, this girl had been hit by the ruler countless times.</p><p></p><p>"Look, Xiu and Liang have finished their assignments, and you only know how to play!"</p><p></p><p>Curly was struck by lightning, dazed and confused as she climbed down from the back of the big crane.</p><p></p><p>The spiritually sensitive big crane nuzzled Curly's face, as if comforting her.</p><p></p><p>Curly looked at Li Che in despair.</p><p></p><p>"Father..."</p><p></p><p>"Flattery won't work." Li Che crossed his arms.</p><p></p><p>Curly's small face flushed bright red.</p><p></p><p>She was utterly aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Liang and Xiu, their names only have a few strokes, but my name has so many strokes..."</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang Qingzheng had assigned them the task of copying their names.</p><p></p><p>Each person needed to copy their name a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't finish, they had to add another hundred the next day.</p><p></p><p>Curly...</p><p></p><p>There was not a single day she had completed it.</p><p></p><p>Now, she had accumulated the record to eight hundred times.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang Qingzheng's face was twisted with anger.</p><p></p><p>He loved Curly's talent, but... he still had to get angry when she didn't do her work.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and couldn't help but feel guilty, rubbing Curly's head.</p><p></p><p>"Father, who gave Curly her name? Doesn't he do his homework?! </p><p></p><p>Can't you give me a name like Li Yiyi?"</p><p></p><p>Curly put her hands on her hips, very angry.</p><p></p><p>Empress Curly wants to change her name!</p><p></p><p>Empress Curly likes fighting and playing with fireworks, and hates writing her name the most.</p><p></p><p>If only her name could be a little simpler.</p><p></p><p>But if she changed her name... Empress Curly wouldn't feel like Empress Curly anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's so conflicting.</p><p></p><p>Curly's two eyebrows were knitted together.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, your name was given by your grandfather." Li Che joined the criticism, speaking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Curly stomped her foot: "Grandpa doesn't do homework, I hate it!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go on, finish your name, and father will bring you some delicious food back, candied hawthorn? Sweet and sour pork ribs? Braised pork?"</p><p></p><p>"Curly wants it all!" Curly's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed her head: "Okay, then go."</p><p></p><p>Although the motivation of delicious food was there.</p><p></p><p>Curly still walked heavily towards the study.</p><p></p><p>In the study, Li Che had prepared desks and chairs for the children, with writing brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones arranged on them.</p><p></p><p>The wooden spiritual crane and small butterfly were watching Curly do her homework.</p><p></p><p>Curly sat on the small chair Li Che had carefully made for her, her trembling heart, trembling hands, and trembling brush in hand, began to write her name...</p><p></p><p>Li Nuan Curly... finished one.</p><p></p><p>There were still 799 left.</p><p></p><p>It's over.</p><p></p><p>Empress Curly's world...</p><p></p><p>Has lost its light.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Curly still couldn't finish writing her own name.</p><p></p><p>She owed another hundred names.</p><p></p><p>The record reached nine hundred.</p><p></p><p>Curly, feeling lifeless, was taken by Li Che to Jinguang Peak.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at Jinguang Peak, Li Che was a bit surprised, as he sensed that the peak was much livelier than usual.</p><p></p><p>On the big platform, there was a group of unfamiliar children, not like the new disciples from the divine sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carried Curly, whose eyes were still glistening with tears, and she also seemed to be attracted by the scene.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Sang Guanyin, dressed in a yellow robe, walked over gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Curly, what's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Curly hugged Li Che's neck with both hands and blinked her big eyes curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's the divine children and spiritual children from Daocheng Qianyuan Sect officially coming to pay respects to the mountain, to warm up for the upcoming temple deity resonance."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin said softly and calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Among them, there are a few who are divine children like Curly... Father Curly, would you like to stay and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"They may challenge Curly, and you can also see the progress of Curly's cultivation these days."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin invited.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was tempted, but still shook his head: "I still have matters to attend to at the Qingtian Observatory, the Supervisor has arranged for the wood carving masters to go to the 'Fire-Eyed Mysterious Startling Ape' mysterious temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been looking forward to the new mysterious temple for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't want to miss it.</p><p></p><p>Besides...</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to be close to observe. </p><p></p><p>He had left a flying thunder chess piece on Curly, so he could always monitor her situation.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin, upon hearing this, did not invite him again.</p><p></p><p>She also knew that for a wood carving master, entering a mysterious temple to observe the temple deity was an extremely important matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, such opportunities were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>The challenge and sparring of the Daocheng divine children was just a casual matter, not as important as the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin took Curly in her arms and used a silk scarf from her person to wipe Curly's tears.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with Curly? Why are you crying?"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin asked gently.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yin, please save Curly..." Curly suddenly hugged Sang Guanyin and wailed.</p><p></p><p>"Curly's name is too hard to write!"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin: "..."</p><p></p><p>Oh dear, poor Curly.</p><p></p><p>This... Sister is also powerless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Phew--"</p><p></p><p>With a long exhale, as if a giant whale swallowing and exhaling, slowly stirring the airflow, rustling the wind, snow, and wood chips.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's whole body was steaming with sweat, the scorching temperature causing the courtyard's temperature to rise considerably.</p><p></p><p>He stood still, his five fingers like hooks, suddenly grabbing out, the airflow exploding, as if there were roaring dragon cries rolling!</p><p></p><p>Two streams of dragon-like vital energy surged out, undulating and impacting, like divine whips cracking, tearing the air and emitting explosive booms!</p><p></p><p>"The eighth dragon turning the river, the second vital energy dragon... Coalesce!"</p><p></p><p>"Three vital energy dragons, that is the completion! Almost there!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's movements suddenly changed again, countless lightning arcs darting and jumping, the entire person in the courtyard becoming a flash of lightning!</p><p></p><p>"Low-grade ultimate skill, the Azure Thunder Body is completely perfected!"</p><p></p><p>"Azure Thunder True Form!"</p><p></p><p>Upon completion, one can manifest the true form, at the master level one can manifest the ultimate skill's true meaning, reaching the realm, one can manifest the true meaning domain!</p><p></p><p>This is the level of mastery of ultimate skills!</p><p></p><p>With the true form formed, the Azure Thunder Body outside Li Che's body seemed to form an interwoven thunder armor, greatly enhancing his speed, strength, and explosive power!</p><p></p><p>Li Che dispersed the Azure Thunder Body, index and middle fingers together, suddenly pointing out, instantly, the courtyard was filled with rampaging sword qi with a clang!

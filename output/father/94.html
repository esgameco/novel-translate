        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sharp crimson spear had already pierced through the body of Old Master Xu, nailing him firmly to the ground! It entered from the top of his head and went straight through in an instant! With immense penetrating power, it even cracked the brick floor into a spider web-like pattern, the spearhead deeply embedded within.</p><p></p><p>"Your Ox Demon Grandpa has come to kill!"</p><p></p><p>At this, a thunderous roar echoed through the entire hall, causing countless candle flames to flicker and be extinguished in large swaths.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's eyes were about to burst, and Xu Heliao's hair stood on end!</p><p></p><p>The hot pot was boiling, the water bubbling.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the bone-carving knife, Xu Heliao's inner turmoil and fear had suddenly vanished due to the abrupt turn of events. "Ox Demon—!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heliao cried out in both shock and anger! No... how come this guy hasn't left the city yet? Everyone knows who the Ox Demon is now.</p><p></p><p>But didn't the Li Che family already move out of the city today? Boom boom—</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming and Xu Heliao's divine natures suddenly erupted, two river-like divine natures surging ceaselessly, like two long dragons coiling around the two of them.</p><p></p><p>But they felt a chill throughout their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's appearance... was too sudden! When did he sneak into the Xu family hall?</p><p></p><p>And he had burst out from the darkness, striking within ten steps of Old Master Xu, undetected until then!</p><p></p><p>If Old Master Xu hadn't been prepared to act, the eruption of his vital energy allowing him to react, the Ox Demon might have already severed their heads before they could respond.</p><p></p><p>"How treacherous, how malicious! To actually carry out such a sneak attack! Demon, demon!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's eyes were about to burst, and at this moment, he no longer had the composure of a family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>There was more a sense of shame and anger at being caught in wrongdoing.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds shot through the room, and the Ox Demon's brow furrowed slightly, as the piercing spear that had penetrated Old Master Xu's body did not bring the feedback of death...</p><p></p><p>This Old Master Xu, something's not right! "No blood..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes beneath the mask swept over the scene, and he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"A false body?" </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think back to when he first saw Old Master Xu, that wooden statue imbued with divine nature, able to speak.</p><p></p><p>Divine nature secret art! Sure enough, as the startling spear pierced through the "Old Master Xu", the divine nature within Old Master Xu was stimulated and erupted, causing the clothed figure to transform into a wooden statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fingers trembled, and countless unseen silver threads suddenly shot out, in an instant shattering the wooden statue of Old Master Xu into countless fragments.</p><p></p><p>The startling spear was also wrapped in the spider silk threads, suddenly changing trajectory and hurtling towards the nearest Xu Nanming.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The spider silk threads bound the blood-drenched startling spear, abruptly changing its arc, letting out a wailing sound like the cry of a blood python rushing towards him!</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's hair stood on end, feeling the grip of death enveloping him!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine foundation and divine nature did not match the startling spear, but...</p><p></p><p>Even without using divine nature, just wielding the startling spear as a sharp weapon, its inherent toughness was extremely formidable! Too fast! Everything was happening too fast!</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming clenched his fingers, his divine nature surging, and a sword song instantly burst forth with dazzling light, which he gripped tightly and brought down with great force. Clang! The sound of metal clashing echoed. Xu Nanming's face flushed red, the terrifying force seeming to surge out from the crimson spear.</p><p></p><p>He looked up in disbelief, feeling a sense of suffocation, only to meet the dazzling gaze like the brilliant sun beneath the Ox Demon's mask! The sword... shattered instantly! How could an ordinary iron sword withstand the Nine Sun Divine Weapon?</p><p></p><p>With just one round of collision, Xu Nanming, a martial artist at the Qi Vein Realm, was trembling, feeling the overwhelming, unmatched might. The arm that had gripped the long sword and struck the startling spear was shattered, the bones and flesh exploding open!</p><p></p><p>A dense mist of blood spurted from his arm! "Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's mind trembled, the blood-drenched startling spear had shattered his sword, crushed his arm, and then struck hard against his chest.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was flung into the air, the shattered flesh and blood scattered.</p><p></p><p>A mist of blood filled the room, drifting about.</p><p></p><p>"I can't even block a single strike?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming thought this as he was suspended in the air. Although he had not fought anyone for a long time, and had focused all his attention on the family business, he was still a cultivator who had once reached the divine foundation realm! In his prime, his divine nature had not weakened, and his vital energy was at its peak...</p><p></p><p>Yet he was crushed by the Ox Demon in a single strike! His flesh shattered, the shockwave of his broken iron sword still echoing!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's towering figure had already gripped the blood-drenched startling spear, and this divine weapon suddenly expanded, automatically adapting to the Ox Demon at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The spear shaft became thicker and larger, its bloody patterns extremely ferocious! The Ox Demon's physique... was too formidable! To ensure a decisive kill, Li Che had directly activated the Wrathful Golden Vajra, Peerless Tempering, reaching the pinnacle of the Qi Vein Realm, capable of easily crushing even ordinary Profound Vein cultivators! How could Xu Nanming possibly withstand such power? The Ox Demon had no unnecessary words, in fact, the moment he chose to strike, he had only one thought.</p><p></p><p>Kill! Kill everything! Outside, there was the roar of swords and furious shouts, rolling towards them.</p><p></p><p>[Suspended Thought Flowing Sword] Divine foundation divine nature, overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>"Wretched thing!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you?!"</p><p></p><p>That was the true form of Old Master Xu, and he never imagined that the Ox Demon would dare to appear in the Xu family courtyard and commit this outrage! Hum—</p><p></p><p>A divine foundation like a millstone rose up!</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Initial Realm! </p><p></p><p>Having already cultivated his divine foundation and pushed it to a perfect state, preparing to use this Thousand Infant Sculpture Banquet to advance to the Intermediate Realm! A trembling pattern steel sword, carrying Old Master Xu's [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword] divine nature, in an instant broke through the air, wielding divine nature to command the sword, flying to take the head!</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced over.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the Suspended Thought Flowing Sword's divine foundation realm suddenly bore down, intending to restrict his movements! But Li Che was completely unaffected, not caring at all, the spear trembling, and with a snap, it stabbed towards the pattern steel sword flying through the air.</p><p></p><p>Ding, a crisp sound, and the pattern steel sword was knocked flying!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xu's eyes narrowed, his heart startled. Impossible! How could this Ox Demon disregard his divine foundation realm? Rumor had it that this Ox Demon had an extremely high natural talent in the martial dao, and in just three years, he had achieved a breakthrough, becoming a Qi Vein martial artist, but his divine nature talent was said to be average.</p><p></p><p>A mere Qi Vein martial artist, under the suppression of the divine foundation realm, would not even be able to circulate their vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Unless he was a Qi Vein Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Ox Demon's erupting vital energy, his body had been tempered to the extreme, but he was not a Grandmaster...</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, could the Ox Demon be a divine foundation cultivator? Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Li Che struck down Old Master Xu's flying sword with a single spear, but he paid no heed to the glaring divine foundation, taking a large stride forward, as if the ground had shrunk!</p><p></p><p>Towering and massive like a mountain, the python-like muscles flexing like a dragon, he had already appeared before the grip-holding Xu Heliao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heliao felt a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to move...</p><p></p><p>But he simply couldn't, he wanted to activate his divine nature, but he couldn't do that at all.</p><p></p><p>It was like a small river in the depths of winter, frozen into ice! This feeling...</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heliao trembled all over, how could it be... how could it be...</p><p></p><p>How could the Ox Demon be a divine foundation cultivator? Isn't the Ox Demon Li Che? Li Che... how could he be a divine foundation cultivator?! "Move, damn it—!" Xu Heliao roared.</p><p></p><p>He viciously stabbed the bone-carving knife into his own thigh, trying to use the pain to break free from the suppression of the divine foundation realm.</p><p></p><p>Who does he think he is? Li Che glanced at him indifferently, not saying a word, the trembling spear suddenly descending towards Xu Heliao, like a peacock spreading its tail, the dazzling spear shadows bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>The air wailed, emitting an explosive sound, being pierced one by one! In an instant, it enveloped the Xu Heliao who had stabbed his own thigh, and Xu Heliao didn't even have a chance to let out a agonized scream before being skewered with countless holes!</p><p></p><p>Every spear thrust completely penetrated, spraying out a mist of blood! When the spear was withdrawn, drops of blood fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heliao directly collapsed to the ground as a pile of rotten flesh, the bone-carving knife slipping from his hand and falling far away.</p><p></p><p>"Heliao—!"</p><p></p><p>The rushing Old Master Xu, his eyes about to burst.</p><p></p><p>The most promising scion of the Xu family to step into the divine foundation realm! Just like this... dying a tragic death before his eyes! "Ox Demon—you are so malicious, so malicious!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xu's eyes were bloodshot, at this moment, his emotions were in turmoil, even feeling a sense of losing control of his divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he suddenly awakened, forcefully suppressing the turbulent divine nature, his five fingers clawing fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The pattern steel sword that Li Che had knocked away suddenly shot back, grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Malicious? I'm malicious?"</p><p></p><p>"You all eat people, you know..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che held the startling spear diagonally, his voice muffled from behind the mask.</p><p></p><p>You all sharpen your knives, ready to eat people, yet you call the Ox Demon who eliminates evil as malicious? Old Master Xu didn't even care about the Ox Demon, people are always hypocritical, their own children and grandchildren dying tragically at the Ox Demon's hands, and he just calls the Ox Demon malicious, so what?!</p><p></p><p>Casting a sorrowful glance at the blood-soaked and permeating hall, he immediately dashed out of the hall without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... is actually a divine foundation cultivator!</p><p></p><p>No fighting!</p><p></p><p>First, escape! After fully enjoying the benefits of the Thousand Buddha Sculpture Banquet, digesting them, when he breaks through to the divine foundation Intermediate Realm! Then he'll dismember this Ox Demon a thousand times! Since Li Che has already made his move, how could he possibly let this old man escape?</p><p></p><p>The soles of his feet pounded the ground as he fled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The floor of the entire hall suddenly sank in, countless blue bricks twisted and shattered, kicking up a violent cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's burly figure had already shot out, his eyes burning with the fury of a golden Buddha, his flesh and blood refined to unparalleled strength!</p><p></p><p>His arms suddenly stretched out, like a soaring hawk!</p><p></p><p>The divine martial arts techniques obtained from the Yang family's treasure vault...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Hawk Treads the Clouds! His blood and qi congealed into a blood mist under his feet, as if a blood cloud had gathered and was being stepped on, propelling his body upwards.</p><p></p><p>His speed surged, chasing after Old Master Xu!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The newly formed divine foundation suddenly emerged from behind him!</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord! Supreme Grade Eight!</p><p></p><p>As the divine foundation appeared, it was wrapped in sword light and burst out of the Xu family estate, causing the swiftly fleeing Old Master Xu to suddenly sink in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He glanced back, greatly alarmed!</p><p></p><p>"This divine foundation... this divine foundation... of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord?!"</p><p></p><p>"Cao Guang?!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xu roared. Could it be that Cao Guang was the Ox Demon? In the entire Flying Thunder City, only Cao Guang had obtained this divine foundation technique from the mysterious temple!</p><p></p><p>"No... "</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Master Xu was jolted awake, the pressure of the rank was wrong...</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation of this Ox Demon was stronger, fiercer, and more powerful than Cao Guang's divine foundation! Boom - in that brief moment of distraction,</p><p></p><p>the Ox Demon had already caught up. Old Master Xu knew he couldn't escape, because under the suppression of the Ox Demon's divine foundation, his speed had slowed down!</p><p></p><p>He could only turn around and fight. The Ox Demon's divine foundation should have just been forged and not yet stabilized. If he seized the opportunity to shatter its divine foundation, it would be a chance to turn the tables!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face was cold, but he also knew what Old Master Xu was thinking.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation was not yet stabilized, this was indeed his weakness.</p><p></p><p>But it's not a big problem...</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che never planned to use the power of the divine foundation to kill him! It must be said that this Old Master Xu was more difficult to kill than the Yang family's divine foundation and the Horse-Faced divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the Dripping Blood Shocking Spear, the qi and blood in Li Che's meridians roared with fury.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the Dao fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] was pounding violently... pounding... </p><p></p><p>Boom boom... boom boom - Li Che unhesitatingly stimulated the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao fruit! The embryonic form of the divine ability...</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra · Ascend the Tower!</p><p></p><p>In an instant!</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that the blood in his body seemed to have come alive, as if it had turned into countless boiling fish, wanting to leap over the flesh and blood shell, this dragon gate, and ascend the high tower! [Boiling divine nature, blood and flesh ascending, perfect refinement, the gods see me]</p><p></p><p>This is Ascend the Tower!</p><p></p><p>Boom - Li Che's eyes under the ox-faced mask suddenly burst forth with dazzling golden light, which was the wisps of golden smoke that seeped out from his pupils, drifting and scattering as his head moved...</p><p></p><p>The jet-black and vigorous hair began to grow frantically, gradually falling to his waist, like a thick black cloak, fluttering with the gale-like airflow! Rip...</p><p></p><p>His limbs swelled, one after another like thick dragon snakes under the almost scarlet skin, crawling and writhing, but his whole body did not swell too much, but rather a kind of refined perfection after being hammered a thousand times, like a true indestructible golden vajra! Only his qi and blood became more and more violent and terrifying, the speed of circulation around the body tripled! The inner qi was even tinged with a layer of scarlet, like boiling and bubbling!</p><p></p><p>I'm stronger - </p><p></p><p>Li Che's consciousness was extremely clear, even too calm, he knew that by activating such a brutal divine ability embryo, it did not confuse his will and make him a slave to power.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it made his consciousness even clearer and his divine sense grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>So strong...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that now, whoever came, he could pound them to death! But a strong desire burst forth from his pounding heart.</p><p></p><p>The extremely clear and calm Li Che clenched his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The [Chessboard] Dao fruit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then it spat out a black as ink divine chess piece.</p><p></p><p>It was the divine chess piece extracted from the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Infant Temple God]! "I need this chess piece..."</p><p></p><p>"No, it's the 'Ascend the Tower' state that needs this chess piece."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought.</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>He opened his five fingers, and the scarlet inner qi gushed out of his flesh, almost forming a distorted air-burning qi robe outside his body.</p><p></p><p>The black chess piece floated in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly clenched his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it exploded into a black mist, the divine nature boiling to the extreme, turning into divine mist! In an instant, the mist completely merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly raised his head, the black long hair that had grown down to his waist whirling like a cloak.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that in front of his eyes, there seemed to be a scene flashing by.</p><p></p><p>In the scene...</p><p></p><p>The Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Infant Temple God in the mysterious temple seemed to come alive, casting a gaze, and Li Che's gaze fell, as if looking down from above.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Spiritual Infant Temple God screamed, his face twisted and angry, yet with a touch of... terror! The scene disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The cold rain and snow poured down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's consciousness returned, all of this had happened in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xu was completely soaked by the rain, lying on the ground, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He watched in horror as the Ox Demon underwent a transformation, becoming... even more terrifying, that overwhelming divine pressure... that terrible rank...</p><p></p><p>made him, a mere cultivator who had just forged a tenth-grade divine foundation, lose the courage to escape.</p><p></p><p>His divine foundation... was trembling!</p><p></p><p>His divine nature... was in fear!</p><p></p><p>The cold rain was soaking him, lashing his face.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>As if... seeing a temple god.</p><p></p><p>He had a bitter smile on his face, opening his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Uttering the last words before leaving the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"You are killing a chicken..."</p><p></p><p>"But using an ox knife."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In front of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Blood and carnage everywhere...</p><p></p><p>Numerous broken corpses were scattered on the ground, blooming like blood-red plum blossoms in the pouring rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing a cat-faced mask, stood upright, gripping the Ram's Horn Hammer, his spirit and energy completely different.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Ram's Horn Hammer was still dripping with a mixture of blood and rain.</p><p></p><p>Under the cat-faced mask, his dim eyes looked towards the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>It was as if mocking, as if indifferent.</p><p></p><p>As if saying, is this all you've got?</p><p></p><p>On the eight-cornered eaves tower above, Cao Guang's figure was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>His target was there, to go in and hammer Cao Guang to death... the mission would be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>As for Cao Guang being a court official, if he hammered him, the Temple Inquisition would come after him, bringing bad luck? Li Qingshan didn't care at all, he was in the right.</p><p></p><p>This Cao Guang, who had sacrificed over a thousand spiritual infants and held the Thousand Infant Carving Feast, was such a scum, if he was hammered to death by the court, would they still have the face to come after him for bad luck?</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang shook his head and stepped down heavily.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless raindrops parted around him, like tidal waves crashing, rushing towards the direction of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he saw three figures of different appearances, wearing strange masks, around the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Their strangeness was reflected in the distorted facial features carved on the masks.</p><p></p><p>Huge noses, huge eyes.</p><p></p><p>The proportions were completely out of whack, just looking at them gave a strange illusion of swollen noses and bulging eyes.</p><p></p><p>There was also one wearing a smiling spiritual infant mask, a small one, wrapped in a vermilion red robe.</p><p></p><p>Those two figures had extremely burly bodies, with thick and dense corpse qi, appearing in a grayish-black color, and even the pouring rain could not wash it away.</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting... the Corpse God Sect's hand has indeed reached the Jin Guang Prefecture, even the City Lord has been bewitched by you."</p><p></p><p>"And you... you must be the Spiritual Infant Sect's Spiritual Infant Patriarch, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan gripped the Ram's Horn Hammer, his eyes under the cat-faced mask gleaming.</p><p></p><p>The child-faced mask with a smile on it tilted its head, and a voice that was neither male nor female suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan... I've long heard of your reputation."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes: "I thought the Spiritual Infant Sect was just a pretext for Cao Guang to collect spiritual infants, but now it seems... it's not quite like that..."</p><p></p><p>"A newly developed sect? It seems to have a close relationship with the Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan twirled the Ram's Horn Hammer in his hand, and he suddenly took a step forward, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Qingshan, but also the Spiritual Infant Patriarch and the two figures with burly bodies and intertwined corpse qi, all raised their masked faces and looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions all changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Temple God?"</p><p></p><p>But soon, they all turned their heads, looking towards the direction of the eight-cornered eaves tower of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The waves of energy violently lashed out, intertwining like dancing pythons, as if an endless fury was being vented.</p><p></p><p>The five people facing off in the rain, their expressions under the masks changed again.</p><p></p><p>Because, from within the eight-cornered eaves tower...</p><p></p><p>Another Temple God aura rose.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>"Two Temple Gods?"</p>

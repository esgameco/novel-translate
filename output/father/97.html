        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind howled and the rain poured down.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, dark clouds piled up, bringing endless darkness, accompanied by the rolling electric snakes that flashed, causing the world to be illuminated at times.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the figure standing at the door, wearing a Niu Mo mask, Xu You's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to draw his sword, but at the moment, he had no strength.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo... </p><p></p><p>That Niu Mo who had caused such a commotion in Feilei City, ruthless and merciless, killing without blinking an eye! However, Xu You did not feel the slightest fear or terror.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing this terrifying existence that was so widely publicized as being able to make even children stop crying.</p><p></p><p>There was not a trace of panic in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu You understood Niu Mo's deeds, the people he had killed, the things he had done...</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the methods, which of them did not deserve to be called a hero?</p><p></p><p>Even if he had killed the imperial official and divine hunter Zhao Xuanhai, it was because Zhao Xuanhai was a member of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>And Xu You knew very well what kind of organization the Lingying Sect was.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a breath, Xu You's pale face cupped his fists: "Thank you, sir, for saving my life."</p><p></p><p>However, Niu Mo only glanced at him indifferently: "City Lord Cao Guang has sacrificed the entire city to the strange temple, wanting to let the strange temple ascend to the Nine Luminaries. Feilei City is doomed, you should hurry and leave."</p><p></p><p>"Take care."</p><p></p><p>This news, like a thunderbolt, left Xu You completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>To the extent that he didn't even hear Niu Mo's "take care".</p><p></p><p>City Lord Cao Guang has sacrificed the entire city?</p><p></p><p>What is this world coming to? Xu You drew his sword, feeling lost.</p><p></p><p>"Niu... hero... senior..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You wanted to call out something, but Niu Mo only lightly tapped his toes and disappeared into the wind and rain. By the time Xu You ran out, the towering figure had vanished from the world.</p><p></p><p>The cold rain, mixed with snowflakes, fell on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Xu You panted slightly, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to have also understood something.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family was colluding with the City Lord's Mansion, and the City Lord Cao Guang wanted to sacrifice the entire city. His grandfather Xu Laoye, his father Xu Nanming, and the others must have all known about this.</p><p></p><p>His body swayed, the biting rain making his heart sink into the cold.</p><p></p><p>"How could they do this..." </p><p></p><p>Outrageous and extremely evil! After a long while, Xu You sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the house, seeing the bodies of his father Xu Nanming and Xu Heli...</p><p></p><p>There was no sadness on his face.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Niu Mo's help, the one who died could have been him.</p><p></p><p>"You even wanted to... eat my flesh?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You suddenly felt like laughing madly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging divine power within him, it was constantly pushing his divine nature to boil, even vaguely making his river-like divine nature seem to be condensing into a divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a blessing in disguise?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You raised his hand, looking at the intertwined blood-colored divine power in his palm, these divine powers were slowly merging into his body.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the temple god, although not much...</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was the energy of the temple god in the strange temple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli, perhaps was planning to use this method to devour him and obtain the power of the temple god? "Why didn't Xu Heli use his own body to bear it? Probably because there are some side effects... Using the method of eating people can avoid this side effect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the hazy wind and rain, Niu Mo's figure had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The other party was not as ruthless and merciless as the rumors said.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Niu Mo's words, Xu You slung his sword and plunged into the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Xu Laoye must also be dead, the mainstay of the Xu family, completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo said that City Lord Cao Guang had moved the strange temple to the city, and if the citizens of the entire city did not leave, in a few days, they would be eroded by the divine power of the temple god and become evil and strange.</p><p></p><p>As the direct descendant of the Xu family, he must officially take over the Xu family, support the Xu family, and lead the Xu family to leave Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>As for the citizens in the city...</p><p></p><p>He could save as many as he could, and after leaving Feilei City, they would become refugees and wanderers, drifting to other cities, and it would be difficult for them to live peacefully, as other cities' forces would likely devour a lot of them.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it was better than losing their lives.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wearing a cat-faced mask, Li Qingshan, the Goat Horn Hammer rose and fell again, the small hammer face stained with blood threads and shredded flesh, washed away by the rain.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, two bodies that had been smashed by the hammer had completely lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>In front of the City Lord's Mansion, the ground had become a ruin, with densely packed deep craters blooming like plum blossoms.</p><p></p><p>That was the scene of destruction left by Li Qingshan's battle with two high-level Corpse God Sect experts.</p><p></p><p>"The iron corpses of the Corpse God Sect are really stinky and tough..."</p><p></p><p>With a shake of true qi, the filth on the Goat Horn Hammer was instantly cleaned, and with a retraction of his sleeve, the hammer was stored away.</p><p></p><p>The fierce blood and qi in his body subsided, and his spirit and vitality quickly returned to a calm state.</p><p></p><p>The whole person stooped down again, resuming the appearance of an old man, and with a tap of his toes, he darted into the strange temple.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, he shot out again, with a look of astonishment under the cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"The statue of the temple god has been destroyed... Who was it? So fierce? Fortunately, I didn't try to break the temple, otherwise, with the temple god's curse, it would have been disastrous."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>His body darted towards the position where the two temple god auras had collided before.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the finely shredded corpses all over the ground...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qingshan had a solemn expression: "How tragic... This is Cao Guang's body, right? He tried to draw the temple god into his body, wanting to use the temple god's power to transform."</p><p></p><p>"But he was killed and shredded..."</p><p></p><p>"The other temple god, so cruel, such a cruel temple god... It's not often seen."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan murmured.</p><p></p><p>"But it's a good thing, Cao Guang's plan has been shattered, the temple god has fallen into a deep slumber, giving the citizens of Feilei City a chance to catch their breath..."</p><p></p><p>"With the City Lord dead, this news will soon be known to the Temple Guardianship Bureau, and they will send people here."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stretched, feeling relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The only surprise left was that temple god who had torn Cao Guang to shreds...</p><p></p><p>What the hell was it? So cruel!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, has that Niu kid come? I didn't see him? Never mind..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's body trembled, shattering the raindrops with countless true qi, the whole person like an arrow released from the bowstring, rushing towards the City Lord's Mansion's treasury.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, that kid must have been here, cleaned it out, not leaving a single thing for the old man!"</p><p></p><p>"What an ungrateful brat!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che observed Xu You's situation for a while in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that he was unharmed, he then slipped into the alleys.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the chess piece marker on the official road outside the city, which was rushing through the snow and rain, appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che himself, also returned to the carriage outside the city from Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>His whole body circulating with qi and blood, drying his clothes and hair, taking off his mask, he was leaning on the soft carriage chair.</p><p></p><p>The tense nerves gradually relaxed, smelling the scent of the wood piled up in the carriage, becoming somewhat lazy.</p><p></p><p>This trip back to Feilei City can be considered to have handled everything well, saving old Xu, preventing him from becoming food for his own kin, resolving the Qianfo Feast matter, and crushing the City Lord's ambition to sacrifice the entire city.</p><p></p><p>If there is any regret, there is also one.</p><p></p><p>For example, that divine hunter Zhang Xiangyang, when Li Che used the Heaven and Earth Chessboard of the Great Dao Chess Sage to inquire about him, he also took care of him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he did not find any trace of him, so Li Che did not have the opportunity to learn Zhang Xiangyang's "Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light" divine power.</p><p></p><p>The impact is not too great, there will be more opportunities when he reaches the capital city, and there should also be corresponding methods within the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the rest is just harvest.</p><p></p><p>He not only tested the "Ascending the Tower Stance", but also received generous gifts from many people.</p><p></p><p>The jade of the three divine foundation cultivators, Xu Laoye, Cao Guang, and Cao Qingyuan, must have a lot of good things, and Cao Qingyuan even took away all the good things in the City Lord's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Now they all belong to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Che's current self-control, he couldn't help but be stirred up.</p><p></p><p>"Please hit me hard with your worldly affairs..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pursed his lips, taking out the jade that Cao Qingyuan treasured even in death, gripping it in his palm.</p><p></p><p>A mid-grade jade, with excellent quality, much larger than Cao He's, the "Untainted Heart" Dao Fruit unhesitatingly devoured and replaced the original space.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he tore open the space like a zipper.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual sense moved, entering it.</p><p></p><p>There were dozens of gold bars, a pile of gold leaves, a stack of silver ingots, and besides that, there were also silver notes, house deeds, and land deeds, etc.</p><p></p><p>Wow, this is the entire fiscal revenue of Feilei City, right? Even richer than the long-established Yang family, and this is after Cao Guang spent a lot of money to hire many wood carvers to carve wooden sculptures.</p><p></p><p>These are all just material wealth, external things, added to the original gains, enough to let them live comfortably in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Li Che continued to inventory, but suddenly, his gaze was attracted.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spirit stirred, and in the next moment, a yellow wooden block about the size of a person fell into the carriage with a loud thud.</p><p></p><p>Creaking...</p><p></p><p>The heavy feeling even made the carriage cabin seem about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the carriage immediately slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che quickly stored the wooden block back into the spatial dimension.</p><p></p><p>"Wow... Spiritual wood!"</p><p></p><p>"Grade Seven spiritual wood!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing couldn't help but quicken, his eyes shining, mainly because... such a large piece of Grade Seven spiritual wood!</p><p></p><p>The value is incalculable! Just now when he touched it, he had already learned the information of this spiritual wood through the "Thousand Analysis Hands".</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Spiritual Wood (Grade Seven Low-Grade): Dragon Tooth Huangyang]</p><p></p><p>[Origin: Yellow hard spiritual wood, as hard as precision steel, the texture is like dragon teeth, the material is tough and dense, the grain is even, difficult to process, handle with care]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wow! Dragon Tooth Huangyang! Harder than precision steel!</p><p></p><p>Li Che marveled in his heart, the City Lord's Mansion actually had such a precious treasure, just this one wooden block alone, its price might even exceed the entire fiscal revenue of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Where did Cao Guang get this good thing from?</p><p></p><p>"Grade Seven spiritual wood... Even ordinary wood carving masters may not be able to carve it, and ordinary carving knives can't even outline it, the carving knife must be a divine weapon material, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, this wooden block is probably the thing that Cao Qingyuan coveted.</p><p></p><p>Take it to the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The value is too great, the divinity contained within the spiritual wood, if carved into a divine wooden sculpture, it would be enough for Cao Qingyuan to cultivate until death.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are many ninth-tier and tenth-tier spiritual woods, which are considered ordinary, among which there are many "blood-red" needed to make the Bodhi Blood Tears.</p><p></p><p>As a master wood carver, Li Che was truly delighted with this harvest.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that he had closed Cao Qingyuan's eyes and let him rest in peace.</p><p></p><p>Li Che continued to count, but there were not too many surprises.</p><p></p><p>Two bottles of elixir, each containing two low-grade ninth-tier "Great View Revere Heaven Angry Mysterious Bluefish Blood Martial Elixir", should have been purchased from the Qin Tian Monitoring.</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, it was also a good harvest, at least he would not be short of cultivation elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when counting the harvest, it could wash away all the fatigue on one's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che happily counted, various martial arts methods, although the ranks were not high, but the quantity was large, counting them was very happy.</p><p></p><p>It was just like counting banknotes, even if they were five-dollar bills, counting them would make one's heart bloom, after all, they were all money.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden leather book appeared in Li Che's hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Lotus Meridian Law of the Great View Temple"! Li Che could no longer suppress the smile at the corners of his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Meridian Law, Divine Meridian Law... Now I have collected them all!"</p><p></p><p>Putting away the book, Li Che's mind stirred, and in the Void Space, another treasure was spat out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Divine Weapon (Low-Grade of the Eight Extremes): Mysterious Thunder Bluefish Angry Bow】</p><p></p><p>【Craftsmanship: Hundred-year Mysterious Iron forged and tempered a thousand times, mixed with the blood of the Mysterious Thunder Bluefish and the divine nature of Anger, and then tempered in the fierce fire for a thousand times, can be used to cultivate the "Divine Nature of Anger", a powerful bow, the arrows fly like the Thunder Bluefish!】</p><p></p><p>【Mastery: Divine Nature of Anger Law, Divine Foundation Realm and above】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Divine Weapon of the Eight Extremes? It is worthy of being the lord of a city, the foundation is really deep. Backed by the court, it is indeed different."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed with amazement.</p><p></p><p>His Bloody Shocking Spear was only at the Ninth Brilliance Grade, but Cao Guang actually kept a Divine Weapon of the Eight Extremes level!</p><p></p><p>"Then why didn't he use the Divine Weapon before?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh... He didn't have time to use it, and was killed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched the black Mysterious Thunder Bluefish Angry Bow in his five fingers, and there were faint electric arcs flickering on it, as if it was an abyss, wanting to draw the divine nature in the Nirvana Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Archery... I have learned the 'Hundred Ghosts Angry Crying Wind and Thunder Arrows', but it is not very compatible with the divine nature, maybe I should find another archery technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought to himself, and then put away the big bow.</p><p></p><p>Continuing the count, the Void Jade of Elder Xu and Cao Qingyuan were also counted, but there was not much harvest.</p><p></p><p>Although Cao Qingyuan was a Divine Foundation cultivator, he did not have much "pocket money", which was the poorest Divine Foundation cultivator Li Che had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che found a pile of letters in Cao Qingyuan's Void Jade.</p><p></p><p>Glancing through them, he became more and more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Jin Guang Prefecture... Qin Family? Jin Lie Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Cao Qingyuan actually has a mother in the prefecture city? And she is also a young lady from a prestigious family in the city?"</p><p></p><p>"Jin Lie Gate? Besides the Sect of the Divine Ancestor, there are other sect forces in the prefecture city?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled slightly as he carefully read the letters.</p><p></p><p>Most of the letters were sent by Cao Qingyuan's mother, and there were also some that Cao Qingyuan had written but not sent out.</p><p></p><p>After reading through the content, he found that Cao Qingyuan's mother was full of concern in her words.</p><p></p><p>"If I killed Cao Qingyuan, will his mother come to trouble me?"</p><p></p><p>"But Cao Qingyuan was killed by the Ox Demon, and has nothing to do with me Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath and put away the letters, continuing the count.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xu was richer, overall not much different from Old Man Yang, but he did not have any Divine Weapons.</p><p></p><p>There were a few bottles of Bluefish Martial Elixir, a total of more than thirty pills, a large quantity.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Brilliance Suspended Thought Sword Divine Foundation Law", "Suspended Thought Sword Technique", "Suspended Thought Willow Body"...</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the three classic law books with shining eyes.</p><p></p><p>The "Thought Divine Foundation Law" he had been longing for was finally in his hands.</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Foundation of Anger and the Divine Foundation of Shock, he could now forge another kind of Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The four great families of the Flying Thunder, the An family has fled en masse, the 'Hundred Transformations Sorrowful Dream' Divine Foundation Law is gone, but the Divine Foundation Law of the Si family... I don't have it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly thought, he still did not have the mastery of the "Crying Demon Subduing" Divine Nature Divine Foundation Law.</p><p></p><p>It seems that to gather the seven emotions Divine Foundations, the road ahead is still long.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, cheer up, there are many big and small families in the prefecture city..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che encouraged the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the count of the harvest, Li Che took a piece of wood and began to grip the carving knife and start carving, while carving, he also calmed down the restlessness in his heart due to the abundant harvest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following days, the journey became more stable.</p><p></p><p>Because they had contacted the caravan to travel together, Qian He as the escort was very responsible, and he also had some reputation on the roads he had dealt with, the safety of the roads he had handled would be much higher than the ordinary wild roads.</p><p></p><p>The journey of the trip was very boring and tedious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not feel that way, because he had too many things to do.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had harvested too many divine nature chess pieces this time, the divine natures of Cao Guang and Cao Qingyuan were both the divine nature of Anger, and Li Che's "Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Divine Foundation" would swallow them all in a higher position, cultivating the foundation and stabilizing the wheel.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Li Che was also studying the Mysterious Meridian Law from the Great View official.</p><p></p><p>After the qi and blood were nourished to the peak, he would start the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he would cultivate the divine nature on the carriage, and when he got off the carriage, he would practice martial arts, practicing with Xixia and Zhang Ya to temper their physique.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's martial arts practice in this period had already reached the peak of skin refinement, her martial arts talent was not bad, Li Che estimated that she might be able to reach the perfection of skin refinement before they arrived at the prefecture city, and start the sinew refinement.</p><p></p><p>As for Xixia, it seemed that she never felt bored, and every day she had new curiosity about things.</p><p></p><p>Qian He the escort and many of the fellow merchants in the caravan were also very good with Xixia, and they all liked this lively and cute little girl.</p><p></p><p>"The Jin Guang Prefecture is located in the Yun State, the Yun State has four prefectures, and the Qianyuan Divine Sect Proper is stationed in the Lingnan Road, the Jin Guang Prefecture is under the management of the Divine Sect Branch."</p><p></p><p>"There are many forces in the Jin Guang Prefecture, but the most famous are the Five Great Divine Sage Families and the Five Great Prefecture City Sects!"</p><p></p><p>The bonfire flickered, reflecting the sky-high flames.</p><p></p><p>During the rest break of the caravan, the people gathered around the bonfire and talked.</p><p></p><p>Qian He, a local of the prefecture city, was drinking while telling the others about the situation of the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask Qian Escort, which are the five great families?" Old Chen asked Qian He after drinking with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hugged Xixia and listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"Qin, Gong, Hai, Shangguan and Gongyang, are the five great divine sage families of the Jin Guang Prefecture City, each of their families has a divine sage ancestor as the pillar, and their ancestors have once been in a high position and powerful in the Qianyuan Divine Sect Proper, they are extremely formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the five major sects, they are also closely related to these five great families."</p><p></p><p>Qian He drank and ate heartily, while eating and drinking, he said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Xixia's head, his gaze focused: "Qian Escort, isn't the Jin Guang Prefecture under the management of the Qianyuan Divine Sect Branch? How come there are other sect forces?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, many people have asked this question before, the Divine Sect Branch is indeed powerful, but the Divine Sect Proper is located in the Lingnan Road, that is the area where the Divine Sect's power is dominant, for the prefectures under it, although there are branches set up, but they are more for the face..."</p><p></p><p>"A prefecture is not a small place, how can the Divine Sect Branch swallow it all? So they will dispatch some out, let other forces also have a share, only by sharing can there be harmony."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, these sects all have the hands of the court behind them, pushing and helping, just to contain the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>Qian He had traveled south and north, so he knew quite a few inside stories.</p><p></p><p>He talked on and on, and Li Che also had a general impression of the Jin Guang Prefecture, it seems that the Jin Guang Prefecture is not entirely dominated by the Sect Branch.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family, the Jin Lie Gate, and the Corpse Divine Sect...</p><p></p><p>Especially the Corpse Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath, the Jin Guang Prefecture is not too safe for their family.</p><p></p><p>The carriage kept bumping, but as they got closer to the prefecture city, the road also became smoother.</p><p></p><p>On the official road, there were more and more carriages.</p><p></p><p>They even occasionally encountered multiple merchant caravans crossing paths.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat quietly with his eyes closed, his whole body's qi and blood spraying out and forming a layer of flowing clothes-like, his inner body like a furnace, refining the last bit of medicinal power of the Great View Qin Tian Monitoring's Angry Mysterious Bluefish Blood Martial Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Boom! When the medicinal power was completely refined.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Meridian Law was activated, the qi and blood surging in the meridians, forming a more complex meridian network than the Small Heavenly Cycle.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly opened his eyes, the elastic clothes on his body suddenly swelled up, like a balloon.</p><p></p><p>Countless qi and blood spurted out, the qi and blood robe originally attached to his body, bloomed open like lotus petals.</p><p></p><p>The Jail Lotus Mysterious Meridian...</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's inner qi and blood returned to calm, the Supreme Jail Lotus Mysterious Meridian Law...</p><p></p><p>The refined Mysterious Meridian inner qi was indeed much more robust!</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che was about to experience the Mysterious Meridian inner qi well, the originally calm caravan suddenly became restless, the neighing of the spirited horses echoed incessantly, the previously smooth-running carriages even started to shake.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lifted the curtain and went to the carriage pole.</p><p></p><p>The coachmen and escorts were trying their best to calm the horses.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, normally the terrifying temple in front is the most terrible, the horses are always frightened when passing this section, after calming them down for a while, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Qian He saw Li Che come out of the carriage and quickly said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and his heart moved.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw in the distance, several majestic mountains towering, the surging river waters flowing through the mountains and extending towards the distant prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>And in the middle of that great river, the water flows parted.</p><p></p><p>A majestic temple stood there, as if obscuring the sun and moon, making the heavens and earth lose their color! Li Che just glanced at it from afar, and he felt the "Chess Saint" Dao fruit in his chest trembling violently.</p><p></p><p>The eight temple deity divine nature chess pieces refined from the Flying Thunder Mysterious Temple were shaking frantically.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's toes touched the ground, his arms stretched high, his qi and blood spurting out, like a falcon leaping in an instant, running continuously for several miles on the river bank.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he stood on a rock.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the mysterious temple in the middle of the raging river!</p><p></p><p>His hand suddenly turned jade-colored.</p><p></p><p>Gently dipping into the turbulent river water.</p><p></p><p>The divine water splashing against the palm exploded into flying water droplets.</p><p></p><p>But there was feedback of the information of the Thousand Fingers Hand.</p><p></p><p>【Mysterious Temple (Four Guardians)】</p><p></p><p>【Eight-Armed Jail Lotus Furious Third Prince Mysterious Temple】</p><p></p><p>6,000 words!

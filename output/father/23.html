        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Puff puff puff! Densely packed, as fine as a cow's hair, yet incredibly sharp wooden needles rained down like a storm, blanketing the entire area! Zhao Chuanxiong's long blade was stained with blood as he swung it forcefully. Seeing this, his hair stood on end and his pupils constricted. He had no choice but to whirl his long blade, stirring up a violent gale to fend off the densely packed hidden projectiles!</p><p></p><p>But there were too many. The blood lotus exploded, and the dense wooden needles poured down like a torrential downpour, ultimately piercing his body!</p><p></p><p>A mist of blood rose up, and Zhao Chuanxiong's leaping figure heavily crashed back into the snow-covered courtyard, with fine droplets of blood oozing from his pores, instantly dyeing the white snow a large expanse of red.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong let out a furious roar, his hair and beard disheveled. He quickly circulated his inner energy to resist the flow of qi and blood in his meridians, his face flushing red with rage. "How treacherous, how malicious! What a vicious Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong continued to shout angrily.</p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff warrior wearing a young girl's mask leaped up onto the wall, but in this brief delay, the Ox Demon's figure had already vanished into the hazy wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Turning back to look, the Bagua staff warrior couldn't help but shudder at the sight of the densely pitted snow, pierced by the fine wooden needles.</p><p></p><p>"Protect me for a moment, this Ox Demon is truly malicious. These wooden needles are extremely fine, even my hardened body and skin could not block them. They have entered my meridians and are trying to pierce my heart. I must use my inner energy to expel these needles!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong panted heavily, immediately sitting cross-legged in the snow, speaking a sentence to the Bagua staff warrior before seriously circulating his inner energy.</p><p></p><p>Scorching heat began to radiate from every inch of his skin.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Zhao Chuanxiong's entire body shuddered violently, and he opened his mouth wide, spitting out a mouthful of coagulated blood.</p><p></p><p>Embedded in the coagulated blood were numerous fine wooden needles, all dyed red.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" </p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff warrior, standing with his staff, asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just injured my meridians. I'll need to recuperate for a while. That Ox Demon... truly malicious."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's expression was unsightly. He had set a trap, intending to capture and slay this Ox Demon, but unexpectedly suffered a heavy loss.</p><p></p><p>"At least, he didn't poison the wooden needles..." the Bagua staff warrior remarked with a smile as he glanced over.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's mouth twitched, not bothering to respond, but inwardly feeling somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon was malicious, but not poisonous enough...</p><p></p><p>"Wearing an Ox Demon mask, with a towering and bulky figure, possessing bone-refining cultivation... Such a conspicuous physique, he should not be able to hide in the outer city."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong exhaled: "Could it be someone from the inner city?"</p><p></p><p>"Most likely. The inner city's aristocratic families have superior inheritances, and their martial arts are extremely profound. Their diet is also rich in nutrition, with robust qi and blood, resulting in their towering statures. Just look at the Yang family, they are all as sturdy as oxen. Almost every major aristocratic family has such powerfully built warriors."</p><p></p><p>"And that Ox Demon's strength seems even greater than a warrior who has just reached the bone-refining realm. It seems his martial arts are quite extraordinary, definitely from an aristocratic family."</p><p></p><p>"And those wooden needles... They are likely related to the wood carvers under those aristocratic families. Such craftsmanship may be the work of a master wood carver."</p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff warrior nodded and said, "The Sect Master went to the inner city and contended with those aristocratic families, occupying many of their interests... Those families are not to be trifled with, and their counterattack is understandable."</p><p></p><p>"The Yang family? The Xu family, the An family... or the Si family?" Zhao Chuanxiong slowly rose from the snow, carefully extracting the fine, hair-like wooden needles.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing the needles with his calloused fingers, the killing intent in his eyes grew increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who it is, this Ox Demon... must be killed eventually!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a loose robe, returned to the rented small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His figure immediately deflated like a punctured balloon, returning to his normal size.</p><p></p><p>"Escaping from the two bone-refining warriors... was still manageable, but my trump cards have all been revealed."</p><p></p><p>"The sleeve crossbow, the thousand spider silk, and the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus, all three of my mechanisms have been fully displayed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, what a pity, my inner strength is not yet fully developed. Otherwise, by forcefully activating it, the eruption of the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus could have doubled in power, and Zhao Chuanxiong would not have just died, but been severely injured."</p><p></p><p>"Now, at most he can only receive some minor injuries that are not too serious."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... If I were to dip some poison onto the wooden needles to form the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus and stab it into his meridians, the toxicity would double the destructive power..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath, his eyes lighting up as he clapped his hands together, feeling a sense of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>What a missed opportunity, otherwise he could have killed Zhao Chuanxiong this time.</p><p></p><p>"Excluding that staff-wielding martial artist, one-on-one, even if I activate the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], I would still not be Zhao Chuanxiong's match. Zhao Chuanxiong's inner strength has reached the Third Heavenly Realm, surpassing mine, and he also cultivates martial arts techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che reviewed the brief clash he just had with Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't rely on the immortal mechanical devices, he would surely be defeated and suffer heavy losses in a prolonged battle.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts techniques... I need to acquire some martial arts techniques. I have the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao fruit, and my martial arts cultivation progresses extremely quickly. If I intensively train in martial arts techniques, I will surely master them even faster, perhaps even gaining additional enhancements."</p><p></p><p>"Will the Second Shopkeeper teach me martial arts techniques? Hmm, even if he does, it will likely be heavily influenced by the Xu family style... Looks like I'll have to go search for them myself, or perhaps try asking Old Chen."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched, his bones cracking.</p><p></p><p>This battle has allowed him to estimate Zhao Chuanxiong's strength and gain some confidence in killing him.</p><p></p><p>Shedding his clothes, he tidied up his attire.</p><p></p><p>Li Che leisurely went out, heading to the West City Braised Meat Shop to buy a catty of braised beef and half a catty of pig's ears, as well as a jar of old yellow wine and a box of osmanthus cakes, before strolling back to the Xu Family Wood Carving Workshop.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he pushed open the courtyard gate, Xixia, with her nose reddened by the cold, came stumbling towards him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing her call, Li Che's heart warmed, and he quickly put down the braised meat and wine to scoop up the chubby Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The little girl, delicate as jade and porcelain, with her red lips so adorable, wrapped her small hands around Li Che's neck as he lifted her up.</p><p></p><p>"Father... Hug me."</p><p></p><p>The little girl was very intelligent. Although she was just over a year old, she had already displayed exceptional abilities compared to others.</p><p></p><p>She could now walk smoothly without even needing a walker.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, sitting under the eaves, was sipping wine from a gourd, and seeing Li Che and Xixia's intimate interaction, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of sourness at the corners of his mouth: "This little stinky Xixia, she must have heard your footsteps from far away..."</p><p></p><p>"She is truly an Enlightened Infant."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya came out from the house and, seeing the items Li Che had left on the ground, hurriedly went over to pick them up and bring them inside.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, there are osmanthus cakes again today. Isn't this a bit too extravagant?" Zhang Ya smiled sweetly. Since moving to the Xu Family, their life had truly become better and more hopeful.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "If my wife wants to eat them, she can have them every day."</p><p></p><p>In their family, they could now truly afford it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's woodcarving skills were extremely lucrative, with each piece earning him at least fifty taels, ensuring they were well-provided for.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya took the items inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, carrying Xixia, sat down next to Old Chen, bringing the jar of old yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, this Enlightened Infant... What does it mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightened Infant doctrine had determined that Xixia was an Enlightened Infant... But Li Che was still unclear about the true meaning of this.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen put down his gourd, gesturing for Li Che to pour the wine. After Li Che filled a full cup, Old Chen took a sip, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xixia, a hint of tenderness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, do you know about the Divinity Cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>"So-called Enlightened Infants... are those born with innate divine nature, the best seedlings for cultivating the Divinity Cultivation method!"</p><p></p><p>PS: Please vote for monthly tickets and continue reading!

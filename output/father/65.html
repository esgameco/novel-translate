        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force exploded in midair, the surging airflow causing the snowflakes to shatter and disintegrate into countless snow powder!</p><p></p><p>The massive bear-like figure came crashing down, slamming onto the bare stone ground.</p><p></p><p>The gushing blood spread out like a puddle, constantly expanding.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai knelt on one knee on the ground, a long iron spear piercing through his chest, shredding the flesh and bone in front of his chest. Countless shattered flesh and bone fragments flew about.</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family's Bone-Shattering Spear... </p><p></p><p>One strike had shattered Zhao Xuanhai's flesh and bones!</p><p></p><p>His prized python sinews and tiger bones were ruthlessly torn apart. The terrifying force unleashed by this Ox Demon was even more horrifying than this martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>Unstoppable...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai knew he had fallen.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he stepped into the alley, the instant that arrow locked onto him, he knew... he had fallen.</p><p></p><p>One misstep, and there was no coming back.</p><p></p><p>The blood kept dripping out, and Zhao Xuanhai raised his hand to grip the long iron spear. His mask had already shattered, his lips, teeth and nose all oozing blood, his heavy breathing constantly gushing out.</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon's powerful and domineering vital energy had invaded his body, ravaging and disrupting his meridians and internal organs...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even activate the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power.</p><p></p><p>The divine fragment... the old master of the Si family's divine fragment!</p><p></p><p>That higher-level divine power completely suppressed him.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, it was as if it was leading him into the abyss of death.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai gritted his teeth, staring intently at the Ox Demon, trying to see through the face behind the ox mask.</p><p></p><p>"You... who... are you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai's voice was hoarse and heavy, using his last bit of strength to ask.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ox Demon was utterly cold.</p><p></p><p>"Hell will tell you the answer."</p><p></p><p>Poof! The long iron spear was suddenly pulled out, spraying a mist of blood, with countless blood spattering about wildly.</p><p></p><p>With a crisp sound, the spear in the Ox Demon's hand swept across, and Zhao Xuanhai's massive, unblinking head was mercilessly severed.</p><p></p><p>It rolled on the ground several times, like a ball, still connected by the dark strands of hair.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the dead Zhao Xuanhai indifferently, his heart completely unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Xuanhai was a court official, one of the three great divine hunters of the government office, but... so what? He was also an expert of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Li Che killed him without any burden, even feeling an unprecedented sense of ease! Penetrating the vital energy! Cultivating the nature like a river! The mighty Zhao Xuanhai, who had been pressing down on Li Che's head like a towering mountain since that day when he was forcibly conscripted, was now...</p><p></p><p>The mountain had been cut down, and Li Che felt incredibly light and refreshed, his bones and muscles resonating with delight.</p><p></p><p>This was all achieved solely through his own martial arts cultivation and divine power, without even needing to use his trump card of six thousand rounds of the Namo Gatling Gun, the poisonous Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus, or the treacherous sleeve crossbow.</p><p></p><p>Delightful.</p><p></p><p>Squatting down, Li Che's large hands skillfully rummaged through Zhao Xuanhai's corpse.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he found a Qiankun Jade from Zhao Xuanhai's body, the same one he had previously taken from Simo Bai.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up, greatly delighted, and with a thought, the Qiankun Jade was directly absorbed into the Qiankun space of his [Unsullied Heart].</p><p></p><p>They say that one Qiankun Jade cannot contain another, but Li Che's space, which had been improved by the Unsullied Heart, did not have this limitation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhao Xuanhai's corpse, as if recalling the wonderful taste of the first time he absorbed a divine hunter's divine power, Li Che raised his hand, and his arm immediately began to flow with jade-colored energy.</p><p></p><p>He placed it on Zhao Xuanhai's forehead.</p><p></p><p>His Nirvana Cavity suddenly pounded, and a mighty divine power gushed out from it, like a river bursting through a dam, frantically surging forth!</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Suddenly, Li Che's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit began to pulsate, as if forming a special connection with the nascent divine technique, the Thousand Slicer Hand.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Che could only extract divine power through the Thousand Slicer Hand, but it had its limits. Exceeding too much would exceed the Thousand Slicer Hand's load-bearing capacity.</p><p></p><p>However, with the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit's intervention...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai's [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power, which was like a flowing river, was being continuously extracted by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>When the Thousand Slicer Hand reached its limit, it would be transformed by the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit into a black divine power chess piece, placed on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Each chess piece contained the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power.</p><p></p><p>Li Che never imagined... the [Chess Saint] would have such an effect! It doesn't seem like a normal Dao Fruit at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fingers grasped the air.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a black chess piece appeared between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Countless streams of energy surged, ruffling his dark hair.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist tightly, and the black chess piece was crushed to pieces in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! A surge of heat suddenly rushed through his entire body...</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a flash of scarlet light in Li Che's eyes!</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of [Wrathful Amitabha]... erupted with a thunderous roar! He only needed to think... and he could disperse the chess pieces, turning the divine nature of [Wrathful Amitabha] to his own use! What a [Chess Sage]! This was tantamount to saying that any cultivator of divine nature could become his power bank! Li Che was in an excellent mood as he continued to draw divine nature with the Thousand Analysis Technique, the river-like divine nature... was the divine nature that Zhao Xuanhai had cultivated for decades, quite majestic, Li Che accelerated the absorption speed, and in about an hour's time, he had drained all of its divine nature.</p><p></p><p>In total, it formed eighteen black chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>"A river-like cultivation... only managed to condense eighteen chess pieces?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps the other "river-like cultivation" cultivators could condense more divine nature chess pieces? "Depending on the divine cultivation method, even though they are all 'river-like cultivation', the size of the river can still vary..."</p><p></p><p>After reforming the dispersed divine nature back into chess pieces and concealing them, Li Che pressed down on the straw hat on his head, and the next moment, his five fingers grasped Zhao Xuanhai's corpse and severed head.</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the snowy and windy alley entrance, the corner of Li Che's lips curled up.</p><p></p><p>With a heavy step forward, the nine great tendons on his back roared like dragons, the surging powerful force erupting, and in the turbulent airflow, he flung Zhao Xuanhai's burly bear-like corpse...</p><p></p><p>Forcefully hurling it out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Xu family's carriage was quietly parked in a corner of the long street, this position was about thirty zhang away from the alley where Li Che's independent workshop was located.</p><p></p><p>A distance that the divine nature of a "river-like cultivation" cultivator could not detect, and would not arouse Zhao Xuanhai's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>The snow falling from the sky made rustling sounds on the roof of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli and Xu Beihu were sitting in the carriage, brewing and drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>The water on the charcoal stove was gradually boiling, the green tea leaves were poured into it, the steam rising, the roasted tea leaves unfurling in it, the tea water turning into a verdant green color.</p><p></p><p>The boiling water poured into the tea cups, swirling along the cup walls.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, a warm atmosphere surged.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu was somewhat restless, occasionally lifting the curtain to look outside.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli, on the other hand, was quite calm, leaning back on the soft goose down-filled backrest, reading a book.</p><p></p><p>Reading, drinking tea, waiting for the outcome, everything was so pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Beihu's breathing stilled, the movement of lifting the curtain freezing, looking at the body that was flung out from the alley, arcing through the air, and crashing onto the bluestone ground, kicking up snow dust, with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu stiffly turned his head, letting the curtain fall back down, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xuanhai... Dead, thrown out as a corpse... Lying on the long street, already attracting onlookers, causing an uproar."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's voice was hoarse and extremely bitter.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai had gone to that alley after receiving his information, intending to kidnap this newly emerged wood carving master, Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But the wood carving master didn't get kidnapped.</p><p></p><p>He lost his own life instead.</p><p></p><p>A divine constable had died! This matter...</p><p></p><p>Was a big deal! Xu Heli's expression changed slightly, abruptly throwing down the book, his waist sword drawn, his figure instantly rushing out of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Divine nature overflowing around him, leaving no footprints in the snow, in a few steps he crossed the thirty zhang distance, passing over Zhao Xuanhai's severed-headed, chest-pierced corpse.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the entrance of the alley, the wind and snow swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's five fingers gripped the sword hilt, staring intently into the depths of the alley.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the alley.</p><p></p><p>A burly figure, dressed in black, wearing a straw hat, covered by a bovine mask! Calmly looking at him, as if...</p><p></p><p>Knowing he was waiting in the distance to observe.</p><p></p><p>So, quietly...</p><p></p><p>Waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... Ox Demon... Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's calmness and composure were gone, his eyes narrowing, suddenly taking a step forward.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ox Demon stepped forward with one foot, and instantly a thunderous snowfall erupted, forming a snow waterfall, obscuring the vision.</p><p></p><p>When the snow waterfall finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... had vanished into thin air!</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Heli's divine nature could not sense the Ox Demon's disappearance!</p><p></p><p>Disappeared again?! Xu Heli's palm gripped the sword hilt, his eyes fixed, his body crouching, the surrounding wind howling.</p><p></p><p>Frantically rushing towards Li Che's independent workshop courtyard!</p><p></p><p>Is it him?</p><p></p><p>Is it him?!</p><p></p><p>PS: Please continue reading!

        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The space between his eyebrows kept burning, and the [Plucking the Stars Pupils] divine ability was unconsciously activated.</p><p></p><p>Plucking the Stars Pupils - [Dissecting the Boundless, Absorbing Spiritual Essence, Probing the Void and Returning to the True, Shocking the Evil and Executing the Wicked]! In Li Che's eyes, any evil could not escape or hide, and could all be seen by the Plucking the Stars Pupils.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che had never doubted the judgment of the Plucking the Stars Pupils.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the calm Xinyuan Temple in the wind and snow suddenly became eerie and ghostly.</p><p></p><p>This absolutely could not be a problem with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It must be that there is something wrong with the Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Eerie and ghostly, with an overwhelming aura of death, this Xinyuan Temple... is actually a ghost temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, the Xinyuan Temple harbors some ghostly creatures?</p><p></p><p>Apart from that...</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to doubt this, and to verify it would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao fruit in his chest pounded violently, and the next moment, his mind sank into the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The crisscrossing net of the chessboard instantly enveloped the heavens and the earth, covering the eerie and ghostly Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Che's consciousness hovered in the heavenly and earthly chessboard, lightly tapping his fingers towards the half-refined Seven-Element Corpse Curse letter seal.</p><p></p><p>A pure Dao fruit suddenly collided with it and exploded!</p><p></p><p>Then a second one...</p><p></p><p>It was like an ancient bell being struck forcefully! Instantly, invisible black ripples, like the sound waves of a bell, kept expanding outward from Li Che's body...</p><p></p><p>Like a black tide, it kept spreading towards the Xinyuan Temple, under Li Che's strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>Under the envelopment of the heavenly and earthly might, the Xinyuan Temple, one, two, three...</p><p></p><p>Numerous Corpse Curse seal auras burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che could not help but stare in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly realized where those Corpse God Sect experts who had withdrawn from the city had hidden.</p><p></p><p>It turns out...</p><p></p><p>They were hiding in this temple? Of course...</p><p></p><p>This Xinyuan Temple may only be one of the Corpse God Sect's strongholds outside the city.</p><p></p><p>But, how convenient is this?</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>He was not frightened, but instead became increasingly excited.</p><p></p><p>His inner self couldn't help but rub his hands together.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, when you think you've searched everywhere and found nothing, you accidentally stumble upon it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gradually dispersed the heavenly and earthly chessboard, withdrawing his consciousness, and the burning between his eyebrows also returned to silence.</p><p></p><p>"Chamberlain Gong, I heard that this Xinyuan Temple... was once a branch of the glorious Qitian Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked, shifting the topic to the Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli snorted disdainfully, "The Xinyuan Temple is just boasting about itself. The Qitian Temple in its heyday was a massive presence, occupying the Six Realms and Twelve States, and could even be called the number one sect in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Although due to the mysterious temple riot and human factors, the Qitian Temple declined and split, and now it has split into three major sects..."</p><p></p><p>"But in reality, the temple buildings of the three major sects are only superficially related to the Qitian Temple."</p><p></p><p>"The Qitian Temple was too strong, while the three major sects... are too weak."</p><p></p><p>"This contrast alone can tell you... the loss of the Dao lineage is too severe."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said.</p><p></p><p>"Sects and the court are not the same, sects attach great importance to the Dao lineage, a Dao lineage passed down for a thousand years is no simple matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Qitian Temple encompassed the Six Realms and Twelve States, while the Xinyuan Temple is what? Just a small sect under the jurisdiction of the Yun State's Jinguang Prefecture in the south.</p><p></p><p>The weak have their own sorrows.</p><p></p><p>If the Xinyuan Temple is not colluding with the Corpse God Sect, then there is only one possibility, which is that the Corpse God Sect has completely invaded the weak Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of which it is, it is not good news.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Gong Yunli did not continue their conversation, the caravan broke through the wind and snow and slowly entered the vast temple complex of the Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Gong Yunli got off the carriage, the wind and snow howling.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng came over and joined Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and several other wood carving masters quietly stood in the queue, waiting for Gongyang Liancheng and Gong Yunli's arrangements.</p><p></p><p>To go to the Fire-Eye Mysterious Startling Ape Temple, they still needed two guides.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Four-Guardian-Level Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple in Jinguang Prefecture, there are two other Eight-Extremes Mysterious Temples, which are the [Fire-Eye Mysterious Startling Ape Temple] and the [Iron Crutch Joyful Ascetic Temple].</p><p></p><p>They are both Eight-Extremes Mysterious Temples, suppressed by the court, and are now under the jurisdiction of the Temple Guard Office.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Mysterious Temples, a temple entry permit is required.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli had already applied for the entry permit from the Temple Guard Office a few days earlier.</p><p></p><p>However, the chief envoy stationed at the [Fire-Eye Mysterious Startling Ape Temple] in the Temple Guard Office had reported back that the Mysterious Temple had been shaking for some time.</p><p></p><p>So the day to observe the temple deity had been postponed. Now, the permission has finally been granted.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng's face was solemn as he checked the list and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is here, prepare yourselves, we are about to go to the Mysterious Temple to observe the temple deity."</p><p></p><p>"This is a rare opportunity for all of you, so you must seize it well."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng did not have the fawning attitude he had towards Supervisor Lin Xiu when facing these Third-Grade Clientele, but instead brought out a considerable official aura.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, two old monks slowly walked out of the Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>Kind-faced and white-browed and white-bearded, they were elderly monks.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanli, Master Xuanyuan..."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng clasped his hands and greeted the two monks with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanli is the abbot of the Xinyuan Temple. The Xinyuan Temple has assisted the Temple Guard Office in guarding the Mysterious Temple, and Master Xuanli's help has been indispensable."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng introduced to Li Che and the other Third-Grade Clientele.</p><p></p><p>The many clientele also clasped their hands and greeted them in turn.</p><p></p><p>The old monks clasped their hands together with a kind smile: "You are all masters in the wood carving field. If you can gain something from observing the temple deity, it will not be in vain for our Xinyuan Temple and the Temple Guard Office to have worked hard to suppress the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, mixed among the many clientele, also greeted them.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's heart stirred, stimulating the Seven-Element Corpse Curse seal, probing whether these two Xinyuan Temple spiritual masters have any connection to the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? However, as soon as Li Che stimulated it, the Seven-Element Corpse Curse seal suppressed in the heavenly and earthly chessboard began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyebrows raised, directly bringing out the dark golden Heavenly King Spirit Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully suppressing the seal.</p><p></p><p>And through the heavenly and earthly chessboard, Li Che saw that Master Xuanli and Master Xuanyuan, these two Xinyuan Temple masters...</p><p></p><p>Exuded a death aura and corpse aura so thick that it was almost as if evil ghosts were about to emerge from the underworld!</p><p></p><p>Wow! Li Che was stunned, inwardly exclaiming "Wow".</p><p></p><p>These are Corpse God Sect evil people disguised in monk's robes! Li Che's heart stirred, but his expression remained calm, a skill he had honed over the years.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could not detect the Corpse Curse seal, which is why the Corpse God Sect's evil people could recklessly invade the upper echelons of many powers in Jinguang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Because even if they were imprinted, they would not be discovered, and they could hide their evil in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>So what if they were imprinted? </p><p></p><p>But ever since the Ox Demon appeared in the Jinguang Prefecture city, everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was actually able to discover those Corpse God Sect evil people who had been imprinted, which was an extremely heavy blow to these evil people.</p><p></p><p>The two masters naturally did not know that Li Che had discovered their kind faces hiding their true identities.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not expose them.</p><p></p><p>To expose them now would be extremely unwise. He had the Flying Thunder Chess Piece, so he could leave safely.</p><p></p><p>But the others might not be so lucky.</p><p></p><p>Even Gongyang Liancheng and Gong Yunli, these two pseudo-immortal cultivators...</p><p></p><p>They might be kept behind.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che did not plan to expose them, first leaving a Flying Thunder Chess Piece, laying down a coordinate point, planning to later contact Li Qingshan, and find an opportunity...</p><p></p><p>To destroy this stronghold of the Corpse God Sect together!</p><p></p><p>Towards the Corpse God Sect, Li Che has always been deeply resentful.</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the principle of "better to kill wrongly than let go".</p><p></p><p>Since he has discovered the Corpse God Sect's stronghold, how could Li Che easily let them go? Perhaps the Corpse God Sect is still plotting how to capture Xixia... Just thinking about it makes Li Che feel that the Corpse God Sect deserves to be torn to shreds.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanli and Master Xuanyuan, with warm smiles on their faces, watched as Gongyang Liancheng and Gong Yunli led the group of wood carving masters towards the temple deep behind the Xinyuan Temple.</p><p></p><p>The two monks exchanged a glance, and the laughter in their eyes disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanli's figure suddenly straightened up, and the age in his eyes was completely gone, becoming extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>"Just now... my [Thousand-Mile Spirit Communication Mirror] seemed to have reacted..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like Xuanniu is nearby!"</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanyuan's bald head was bright, wiping his head, asking in surprise: "Xuanniu... is he still not dead?"</p><p></p><p>"How could he die? He was just injured by that old man from the Heavenly Monitor, it's not that easy to kill him... after all, he is a half-step Curse Silver Corpse."</p><p></p><p>Xuanniu had refined a trace of silver qi into a half-step Curse Silver Corpse.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanli felt that Xuanniu definitely would not die so easily.</p><p></p><p>"So, you suspect that Xuanniu has hidden his identity and is hiding among that group of Heavenly Monitor's Third-Grade Clientele?"</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanyuan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanli nodded, looking at the gradually blurring figures of the group disappearing into the mountain path in the snowstorm.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanniu, don't ruin our plan."</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanyuan's brows relaxed: "Perhaps Xuanniu intends to use the protective corpses in the Mysterious Temple to restore his silver qi... you can send him a message to tell him not to disrupt our plan."</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanli nodded, thinking it made sense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the biting and sudden snowstorm, after walking for a while on the mountain path, the group arrived in front of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Eye Mysterious Startling Ape Mysterious Temple! Situated on the middle of the mountain, it actually covered the entire half of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Here, Li Che even saw the ruins of some old villages.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, this Mysterious Temple originally grew from the village, and now that the village has been destroyed, the Mysterious Temple has expanded to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The thick gray mist was swirling, accompanied by the wind and snow, making the temple look like it was situated in another dimension, shrouded in mist.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guard Office's envoys had set up fences on the outer perimeter.</p><p></p><p>Prohibiting cultivators without a temple entry permit from entering.</p><p></p><p>The defense was naturally much weaker compared to the Four-Guardian Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Extremes Mysterious Temples had already bred Mysterious Veils, and Li Che curiously observed the Mysterious Veil. The city lord of Flying Thunder City, Cao Guang, had planned to hold a Thousand Infant Feast to allow the Mysterious Temple to advance in rank and give birth to a Mysterious Veil.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was disrupted by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Since they had the temple entry permit, and the Heavenly Monitor was bringing the wood carving masters to observe the temple deity, this was not the first time.</p><p></p><p>So the chief envoy stationed at the Temple Guard Office simply checked briefly before letting them pass.</p><p></p><p>The chief envoy produced an incense burner, lit three sticks of incense, and then carried the incense burner towards the front.</p><p></p><p>The mist of the Mysterious Veil parted like a curtain, revealing a wide open path leading directly to the towering temple.</p><p></p><p>The temple had carved beams and painted eaves, with upturned corners on the black tiles covered in thick white snow, looking quite dilapidated, and the walls were engraved with various poses of ape images.</p><p></p><p>Just like the first time he saw the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>A mighty suction force suddenly erupted from the temple, but now the Li Che before them was no longer the same as the first time he encountered the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mischievous Lad of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that he has now reached the level of a Furnace Sect Master in terms of physique.</p><p></p><p>Just the powerful divine consciousness refined from the seven celestial bases is enough for him to easily break free from the mysterious allure of this mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Obelisk is the most dangerous part of the Mysterious Temple, it is generally believed to be the self-defense mechanism of the Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Mysterious Obelisk is broken, one can part the mysterious mist and see the Divine Temple."</p><p></p><p>The leading Custodian of the Temple said indifferently while holding an incense burner.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Obelisk is very dangerous. If one has not conquered the Mysterious Temple and gets dragged into the Obelisk, they will be pulled into the illusory realm of the Temple Deity and easily become lost in it, and will also encounter attacks from the Temple's Guardian Cursed Corpses..."</p><p></p><p>"The Guardian Cursed Corpses of the Eight Extremes Mysterious Temple can even rival the Cursed Bronze Corpses of the Corpse Deity Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Cursing Art of the Corpse Deity Sect seems to have originated from the Guardian Cursed Corpses of the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>After a brief introduction,</p><p></p><p>The group walked for about a kilometer along the path of mysterious mist and arrived in front of the temple.</p><p></p><p>"This is as far as I can escort you, the rest is up to you to step into the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>"Observe the Temple Deity, observe the Temple Deity... but know your limits."</p><p></p><p>"If your divine consciousness cannot bear it, if your divine nature cannot withstand it... then retreat in time."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if your consciousness is taken over by the Temple Deity, and you become a Guardian Cursed Corpse, it will be too late to regret."</p><p></p><p>The Custodian placed the incense burner burning three sticks of incense at the entrance of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Enter, but you must leave before the three sticks of incense are burned out!"</p><p></p><p>The Custodian Qi Yanghao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Many Third-Class Guest Lords solemnly acknowledged and responded one by one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also responded along with the rest of the Third-Class Guest Lords.</p><p></p><p>Then, they all crossed over the incense burner and stepped into the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Custodian Qi Yanghao stood still in front of the temple, his hands crossed on his chest, a saber hanging at his waist.</p><p></p><p>Once the three sticks of incense were burned out, he would immediately pick up the incense burner and leave.</p><p></p><p>At that time... the Mysterious Obelisk would close, and these Third-Class Guest Lords would have to rely on their own abilities to leave the temple.</p><p></p><p>The first principle in guarding the Mysterious Temple is to avoid engaging with the Guardian Cursed Corpses and Guardian Demonic Beasts if possible...</p><p></p><p>Once they engage too much, it is easy to provoke the awakening of the Temple Deity, and incite a disturbance in the Mysterious Temple! As for the life and death of these Third-Class Guest Lords...</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't care, because the time limit has already been set.</p><p></p><p>These guests are greedy to observe the Temple Deity for longer, so they will pay the price for their greed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the other Third-Class Guest Lords stepped into the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Spiritual Infant Temple outside Flying Thunder City, this Spiritual Ape Temple was much larger.</p><p></p><p>White candles were lit around, simply for illumination, lighting up the darkness inside the temple.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, this Spiritual Ape Temple was not that large.</p><p></p><p>With the influx of many guests, it felt a bit crowded.</p><p></p><p>In the small temple, there were three statues placed on the altar.</p><p></p><p>A towering statue of the Temple Deity, and two smaller ones.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they were all in the form of apes.</p><p></p><p>The statue of the Spiritual Ape Temple Deity was wearing armor, with golden eyes that seemed to have flowing fire, sitting cross-legged on a lotus pedestal.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, one could feel the liveliness and spirituality emanating from the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>Li Che found a spot and sat down cross-legged, releasing his divine consciousness to observe the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>Through observing the divine aura embodied in the Temple Deity statue, he could simulate the carving in his mind to improve his own carving skills.</p><p></p><p>Some guests raised their hands and performed the Great Landscape Revere Heaven Seven Element Thousand Hand Divine Carving Art.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became lively, as everyone was seriously observing the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only looked for a while and understood the theory of observing the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>It is about comprehending and capturing the essence of the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Deity wooden carvings... it is said that they appeared out of nowhere along with the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>They contain unique carving techniques.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the profession of Wood Carving Masters exists is that they imitate the Temple Deity wooden carvings, and by capturing and imitating the essence of the Temple Deity carvings, they can accelerate the cultivation of divine nature in Spiritual Children and Divine Children.</p><p></p><p>This is how the path of divine cultivation has developed and flourished in this world, in addition to the original way of Qi and Blood Martial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With his Plucking Star Eyes, Li Che basically mastered the carving technique of the Spiritual Ape Temple Deity at a glance.</p><p></p><p>This kind of imitation is effortless for him.</p><p></p><p>However, things with technical complexity and research, such as the Great Snow Avalanche Observe Avalanche Lotus Bullet and the Observe Avalanche Lotus Main Battle Formation, even with the Plucking Star Eyes, still require step-by-step research and trial-and-error.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings gradually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Exhale..."</p><p>"Inhale..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone seemed to have fallen into contemplation of the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Che's mind was extremely active.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that everyone was in a state of silence, Li Che stood up, dusted off his black robe, and raised his hand to his brow.</p><p></p><p>Gently drawing a line downward.</p><p></p><p>"Plucking Star Eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Infinitely analyzing, absorbing spiritual essence! The brow split open, the flesh and blood seemingly torn apart in two directions.</p><p></p><p>One eyeball rotated, with a faint golden mist emanating from the pupil.</p><p></p><p>With the Plucking Star Eyes upgraded from the Thousand Shattering Hands, he did not even need to personally jump onto the altar and reach out to touch it.</p><p></p><p>Just by gazing into the eyes of the Temple Deity statue was enough.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>The light projection fell upon the fiery-eyed mysterious spiritual ape.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Che saw the Temple Deity statue seemingly come alive.</p><p></p><p>The fiery eyes of the spiritual ape swept across, and in the heavens and earth, it seemed to resonate with the roar of the spiritual ape! Li Che's vision blurred.</p><p></p><p>As if the surroundings had undergone a change.</p><p></p><p>It felt like his mind had shifted from the outside world to the heavenly and earthly chessboard! In an instant, the colors of the heavens and earth changed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Outside the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The incense burner stood quietly, the three sticks of incense burning calmly, the smoke rising vertically.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yanghao opened his eyes wide. With his arms crossed, his gaze was sharp.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the rising smoke column from the three sticks of incense.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that the rising smoke column first swayed to the left, and then tilted to the right.</p><p></p><p>As if it was being torn apart by the airflows coming from both sides!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yanghao's hairs stood on end, and he turned his head to look left and right, only to find that the parted Mysterious Obelisk mist was slowly closing!</p><p></p><p>He could even see the faint outlines of the Guardian Cursed Corpses within the Mysterious Obelisk... and various illusions that could confuse the mind!</p><p></p><p>"This is not right!"</p><p></p><p>"Why is the Mysterious Obelisk closing prematurely?!"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it supposed to wait until the three sticks of incense were burned out?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yanghao was shocked.</p><p></p><p>His heart was greatly shaken!</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple has erupted into disturbance! Unexpectedly! After all, in previous years, the guests of the Heavenly Mandate Observatory have always followed this procedure when entering the temple!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yanghao rushed to the incense burner.</p><p></p><p>He shouted towards the many guests who were still inside the Mysterious Temple, lost in contemplation of the Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up!"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>But the guests seemed to be completely trapped in a strange illusion.</p><p></p><p>His cries did not have the slightest effect!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it... what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Custodian Qi Yanghao's face looked grim.</p><p></p><p>But he had no time to worry about that.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to grab the incense burner, directly stepping forward, his blood and qi surging, and rushed madly towards the outside of the rapidly closing Mysterious Obelisk.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>At the very last moment when the two sides of the Mysterious Obelisk were closing like a falling curtain, </p><p></p><p>Custodian Qi Yanghao managed to dash out.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Gongyang Liancheng and Gong Yunli immediately changed their expressions and hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?!"</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>After landing, Qi Yanghao stood up, patting the dust off his uniform, his hand resting on the saber at his waist.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"What else could have happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"Has erupted into disturbance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cries of slaughter, sounds of raging fire, explosions!</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes and saw a scene of ruins, a palace collapsing, countless shattered stones flying.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, densely packed, were the corpses of apes...</p><p></p><p>Scattered all over, the thick stench of blood permeated the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che uncontrollably tilted his head up and saw a figure in a great red cloak rolling in the sky, with two long feathers fluttering, wearing golden divine armor, grasping a golden divine spear, with an awe-inspiring presence that could overturn the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Facing this figure was a mass of black clouds rolling, with countless figures standing on top, their majestic presence shaking the heavens.</p><p></p><p>They were too far away.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hear the conversation between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>Only the sound of the heavens and earth laughing mournfully in sorrow and grief echoed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che just raised his head to look for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to look more.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't, not because he couldn't, but because the perspective he currently occupied began to turn and flee at lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>As if it was following the will of the figure holding the golden spear, facing the endless mysterious and powerful spiritual ape.</p><p></p><p>To survive...</p><p></p><p>A great sense of desolation spread, his vision blurred, the scene shattered.</p><p></p><p>Countless raging fires burned, turning into dripping fiery tears! Like a weeping spiritual ape, leaping and running wildly in the mountains and forests.</p><p></p><p>"Qitian—"</p><p>"Qitian!!!"</p><p></p><p>In his ears, endless cries of frenzy, excitement, and roars of the spiritual ape suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>All the endless perspectives shattered.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a sharp pain.</p><p></p><p>The possessed spiritual ape, its perspective spinning wildly, finally crashed heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He struggled to shakily crawl towards a standing...</p><p></p><p>A stone stele that was badly burned and cracked.</p><p></p><p>He painfully raised his hand, his blood-stained palm struggling to trace a bloody mark on the stele...</p><p></p><p>As if etching the deepest belonging in the soul of the spiritual ape.</p><p></p><p>Because, three words were written on the stele:</p><p></p><p>"Flower Fruit Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip...</p><p></p><p>Fiery tears dripped from the fiery eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But from now on..."</p><p>"There will be no more Flower Fruit Mountain."</p><p>"No more Qitian."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes in Li Che's brow emitted endless heat.</p><p></p><p>His eyes opened and closed, slowly opening.</p><p></p><p>At some point, his cheeks had been dampened by tears.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was still stunned.</p><p></p><p>He touched his wet cheeks.</p><p></p><p>He still hadn't recovered from the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>What was that? The Temple Deity's obsession?

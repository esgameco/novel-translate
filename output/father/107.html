        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night was hazy, and the moonlight cascaded down from the high heavens.</p><p></p><p>Within the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow and put down the wine cup in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Sister-in-law Liu Chunming's face looked somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"It's been two days since he last returned home, which has never happened before, so I'm worried that something has happened to him..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hurriedly came over, pulled Liu Chunming to sit in a chair, comforted her, and poured her tea.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the others, Liu Chunming's pent-up grievances and anxiety could no longer be suppressed, and she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sister-in-law, don't worry too much. Perhaps the elder brother was delayed by some matter? Do you know what he went to do before not returning home?" Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>"He said he went to the market district to look for work. The silver he brought back from Feilei City has almost all been spent, so he also wanted to find a livelihood, not relying on your support forever."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Li Che's current identity and status were different from the past, so Liu Chunming's heart was somewhat calmed.</p><p></p><p>"Looking for work in the market district?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, sister-in-law. Finding work in the market district is not easy. Perhaps the elder brother found a job and didn't have time to notify you. You go back first and take care of the children. I'll go look for the elder brother and see what has delayed him."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said gently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Chunming couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>"Sister-in-law, have a meal before going back?" Zhang Ya hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chunming waved her hands repeatedly, as she really had no appetite.</p><p></p><p>After Liu Chunming left, Zhang Ya couldn't help but look at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, the elder brother won't really be in trouble, will he?"</p><p></p><p>The uncle and elder brother's family had helped them a lot, so Zhang Ya also didn't want anything to happen, hoping that everyone would be fine.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be anything serious. And... the sister-in-law and the uncle may have some guesses."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said softly, "If the elder brother was really involved in something dangerous, the uncle should have come earlier."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the sister-in-law has come... it's very likely... the uncle feels it's not quite right to come in person, or feels it's embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite familiar with the uncle's temperament - this old scholar... cared about face.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother Li Zhengran not returning home for two days might be because he did something that made the old man feel embarrassed, so he was unwilling to come to Li Che, and it was the sister-in-law who couldn't sit still and came to solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zhang Ya was stunned, not having thought there were so many intricacies.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at his lovely wife's adorable appearance and couldn't help but pinch her little face.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, Xixia, and Lu Daotou on the side had long been accustomed to Li Che and Zhang Ya's occasional public displays of affection.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Li Che returned to the study.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, his expression didn't change much.</p><p></p><p>[Chess Saint] Daoguo's heartbeat suddenly quickened, and the next moment, a small celestial chessboard floated in front of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he tapped a finger, and a chess piece began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>That was the spiritual chess piece Li Che had left on his elder brother Li Zhengran.</p><p></p><p>Flicking his fingers, the image began to zoom out, the coverage of the high-level chess saint, directly locking onto the spiritual chess piece on Li Zhengran's body.</p><p></p><p>"A gambling den?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, and his brow furrowed even tighter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che still understood his elder brother Li Zhengran's temperament. How could he have gone to a gambling den, a place that ruins families! Flicking his fingers again, the image expanded further, and he saw Li Zhengran in the gambling den, flushed and red-eyed, crowding around the gambling table, shouting, "Big, big, big!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, it naturally couldn't be false.</p><p></p><p>"Someone deliberately led the elder brother Li Zhengran astray..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this idea flashed through Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>First, Uncle Li Liang's family discipline was strict, and he had never allowed gambling or debauchery. Elder brother Li Zhengran had also been upright since he was young. Although he didn't have any great achievements, he had never strayed from the right path.</p><p></p><p>It had only been half a month since they arrived in Jingguan Prefecture, and Li Zhengran had already gotten involved in gambling.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, if Li Zhengran was truly a gambling addict, he should have been frequenting the gambling dens even when he was in Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath, no wonder the uncle didn't come to him for help in person. Perhaps the uncle... had already known about this situation.</p><p></p><p>He just kept it from the sister-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"The environment can change a person, but it can't change so drastically in such a short time... so, was someone deliberately guiding him?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although what Li Che cared most about was his wife and daughter, the uncle and elder brother's family had not treated him poorly, and they had the grace of raising him, so they were also very important in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>They can come after him, but using despicable means to affect the people around him is a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>"After I became a third-rank guest official in the Qingtian Monitoring Bureau, the Qin family and the Zhenmiao Supervisorate have been more wary of me, and according to what Lu Chi said, the Jinclie Gate also has no motivation to deal with me..."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, they only have guesses and suspicions about my identity, without any conclusive evidence. Because of my status as a third-rank guest official in the Qingtian Monitoring Bureau, and Xixia's identity as the predestined spiritual child of the Divine Ancestor, they naturally don't dare to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought carefully, slowly unraveling the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang did provide the Zhenmiao Supervisorate with information that could influence him, but the impact was not that great.</p><p></p><p>Because even the Zhenmiao Supervisorate's chief agent Zhang Lianhao could not really confirm whether Li Che was truly the Ox Demon or the mysterious cultivator who had shot and killed Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Although they still had doubts, they could not determine it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have sent two divine agents to secretly monitor him.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, they don't care who the Ox Demon is... what they care about is that mysterious cultivator who shot and killed Qin Yuqing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze opened and closed. Whether it was the Qin family, the Zhenmiao Supervisorate, or the Jinclie Gate, what they cared about was not Qin Yuqing's death, but avenging her.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, they were wary of that mysterious cultivator who could shoot and kill a strong cultivator from tens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Ox Demon's identity remained hidden, many people would be restless, fearing that one day they might become the target of the hunt.</p><p></p><p>Who would want to constantly taste the bitterness of living in fear?</p><p></p><p>"So, they want to make a move on the people around me? Force me to act, and then frame my identity?"</p><p></p><p>"Now, they will be more restrained because of my status as a Qingtian Monitoring Bureau guest official, but if I am confirmed to be the Ox Demon, or if my identity as the Ox Demon is exposed, I will surely face thunderous retaliation and be attacked from all sides."</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The candle flames flickered, casting a glow on Li Che's suddenly smiling face.</p><p></p><p>"Today, they made a move on the elder brother Li Zhengran. Tomorrow... will they move against my uncle, my wife, and then my daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Step by step, encroaching inch by inch..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, then opened them again, his expression now cold and devoid of color.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all really want to see the Ox Demon so badly?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Ox Demon doesn't show up... are you not satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>"As you wish."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was a low-key and introverted person who just wanted to live peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon was not.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the long street, in the Liuxiang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In a private room, Qin Haonang sat quietly, sipping the best wine of the Liuxiang Pavilion, one cup after another entering his mouth and stomach.</p><p></p><p>In the opposite private room, there sat two divine agents dressed in the red cloud-patterned robes of the Zhenmiao Supervisorate. They were the same two divine agents who had come to escort Li Che to the Zhenmiao Supervisorate before.</p><p></p><p>The two parties were quite in sync and had not met face to face, even though their work seemed to be the same - monitoring Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But there was no verbal exchange between them.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonang's gaze flickered, he had been watching Li Che for half a month, but he had not caught the slightest clue.</p><p></p><p>"How boring... His life is so regular, going to the Qingtian Monitoring Bureau for work during the day, and then going to the small courtyard workshop to make wood carvings after work..."</p><p></p><p>"For half a month, it's been the same routine every day, dull and monotonous to the extreme!"</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't go to the Yunfang Pavilion, just staying home with his wife and children every day..."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of person, could he be the ruthless and cold-blooded Ox Demon described in the intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonang held the wine cup, feeling somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen such a pure and upright cultivator, self-disciplined and stable, never causing trouble, fixed in a three-point routine.</p><p></p><p>"That old bastard of the Jinclie Gate... he profited so much from Qin Yuqing, and now that Yuqing is dead, he doesn't have a single thought of revenge!"</p><p></p><p>"Yuqing's eye for men has always been poor."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Haonang drained the cup of wine in one gulp, slowly exhaling a breath.</p><p></p><p>"This Li Che... now it seems, there's an 80% chance he's not the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon is likely Li Nuanxi's master, which is why he has such a close relationship with the Li family."</p><p></p><p>"But Li Nuanxi can't be touched... the Divine Ancestor's predestined excellent spiritual child, untouchable."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"A virtual cultivator, yet he was smashed to pieces by Li Qingshan's ram's horn hammer, what a waste." Qin Haonang's eyes flashed with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Black Snake Gang... it seems they want to make a move on the Li family."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonang narrowed his eyes, having noticed the changes among the merchants and customers in Huaijie over the past half month.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Qin family and the Jinclie Gate, there were other forces wanting to make a move?</p><p></p><p>"The Black Snake Gang... is not a subordinate force of the Five Great Families, but a gang from the Fishermen's Guild..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonang poured himself another drink while pondering.</p><p></p><p>"The Fishermen's Guild, the Black Serpent Gang, and the Beggar's Guild, the three major gangs in Jingguan Prefecture, their overall strength is not as strong as the Five Great Families and the Five Great Sects, belonging to the third echelon of forces."</p><p></p><p>"But we can't interfere in their internal affairs... the Fishermen's Guild, why would they set up a regional gang to keep an eye on the Li family?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the reason?"</p><p></p><p>As the next potential heir to the Qin family, Qin Haonang was very familiar with the backgrounds of the various forces.</p><p></p><p>He had already had someone investigate the details of the Black Snake Gang, and the force above them was not the similarly named Black Serpent Gang, but the Fishermen's Guild.</p><p></p><p>The Fishermen's Guild was adjacent to the Nine Dragon River, and most of the aquatic products were inseparable from the Fishermen's Guild, whose influence was the highest among the three major gangs.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't figure out the specific reason why the Fishermen's Guild had sent the Black Snake Gang to keep an eye on the Li family.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A gleam of insight flashed in Qin Haonang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if he had thought of something...</p><p></p><p>The wine cup swayed slightly, spilling some of the wine.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was deep, and the moon hung high.</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze rippling in the night caressed the willow branches.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhenmiao Supervisorate, in the tea room.</p><p></p><p>Under the fragrant tea haze, the divine agent Stone Lei was reporting the situation to the chief agent Zhang Lianhao.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che today, as usual, went to work during the day, carved wood carvings after work, and returned home in the evening... the routine is as regular as ever," Stone Lei said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>They say the guest officials of the Qingtian Monitoring Bureau like to frequent brothels and listen to music, but this Li Che is clearly not that kind of person, pure and upright, with only his wife and daughter in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao raised his eyebrows in surprise: "Oh? It's been like this for half a month? He's really such a self-disciplined person who restrains himself. If he weren't the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Those who are truly righteous are the most terrifying ones."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, shall we continue the surveillance?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Lei asked.</p><p></p><p>It's been half a month... Repeating the same routine every day, Li Che didn't feel tired, he was almost bored to death.</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep an eye on him for another half month. Although Zhang Xiangyang's words are just one person's opinion and cannot be fully trusted, the feedback from the people who went to investigate Feilei City is mostly consistent with what Zhang Xiangyang said..."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully, we'll get some results in the next few days."</p><p></p><p>"Also, the faction that has been tailing Li Che is the Black Snake Gang. As a fishing gang, why did they suddenly focus on the Li family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sipped his tea, squinting his eyes in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The fishing gang and the Li family... They were completely unrelated. The fishing gang was not under the influence of the Qin family or the Jin Lie Gate, so there was no reason for them to take action. That meant there must be other forces involved.</p><p></p><p>Shi Lei was also completely puzzled. Over the past half month, he felt that Li Che was a truly good man, making him, who occasionally indulged in entertainment, feel ashamed of himself.</p><p></p><p>Diligent at work, loving his family, and not indulging in entertainment! Wasn't this exactly what Shi Lei dreamed of himself? Unfortunately... he had been corrupted by society.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go now. Continue the surveillance and report to me if there's any abnormality."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Shi Lei subconsciously cupped his fists and immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao narrowed his eyes, raising his hand, revealing two bloodstained Bodhi wood threads in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"One of these threads appeared in Feilei City, the victim was Cao Hetu, the second master of Cao Qingyuan. As for the other one... it was the method used to assassinate Qin Yuqing."</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo, was he the one who killed Qin Yuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't... done by two people, could it be... some unknown force?"</p><p></p><p>"The mechanism technique... Could it be that the remnants of the Tang clan are trying to make a comeback?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of how it is, Niu Mo and the one who killed Qin Yuqing are certainly related."</p><p></p><p>"By finding Niu Mo, we can naturally find the murderer of Qin Yuqing."</p><p></p><p>"That terrifying mechanism that can summon someone from afar, if it can be used by the Zhenmiao Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, a fine drizzle, spring is a rainy season.</p><p></p><p>The vast clouds in the sky were like a water-soaked sponge, and the sky would occasionally squeeze a little, dripping endlessly.</p><p></p><p>After having breakfast and supervising Xixia and Zhang Ya's martial arts practice, Li Che opened his umbrella and left home.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out, the various forces that had been secretly tailing him immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan, Hong Yong, and Shi Lei, as well as members of the Black Snake Gang, finally showed some interest. Today, Li Che... seemed to have a new move.</p><p></p><p>Following Li Che, they saw him, dressed in black, walking in the spring rain, and after several inquiries, he arrived at the "Bai Wan Gambling House".</p><p></p><p>After the announcement, after waiting for a while, his cousin Li Zhengran came out from the gambling house, escorted by several burly men, with a dejected look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che..." Li Zhengran saw Li Che and immediately felt ashamed, his unkempt appearance no longer had the previous spirit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Zhengran, his expression slightly changing, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, you're like this... Sigh."</p><p></p><p>"Come back with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran nodded numbly, not daring to look at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists, his emotions towards Li Che were very complex. He never thought that the former carpenter's apprentice cousin would grow to this extent.</p><p></p><p>Now at home, whether it was his father Li Liang or his wife Liu Chunmeng, nine out of ten sentences were praising Li Che, saying how excellent Li Che was, becoming a guest scholar at the Qingtian Mansion, and how he brought glory to the family.</p><p></p><p>But Li Zhengran, who had been in the capital city for so long, had not even found a job.</p><p></p><p>Listening to these words, he felt uncomfortable in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to become rich and powerful, so that his family would look up to him.</p><p></p><p>When he came to the market to look for a job, he met an old fellow villager from Feilei City and was taken to the "Bai Wan Gambling House". Li Zhengran originally refused, as Li Liang had taught him, and he remembered it deeply.</p><p></p><p>But the old fellow told him that if he wanted to become rich and powerful, he could only try his luck, and a normal job... how could he become rich and powerful? So, Li Zhengran stepped into the gambling house, he just wanted... to try it once and then withdraw.</p><p></p><p>But this one try, he couldn't get out of it.</p><p></p><p>"What? This guy owes our gambling house five hundred taels, it's not as simple as just leaving!"</p><p></p><p>A burly man with blood-modified cultivation coldly sneered at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran shrank his head, indignant and sorrowful: "I only borrowed fifty taels!"</p><p></p><p>"It turned into five hundred taels in just two days... There's no justice!"</p><p></p><p>"The loan contract clearly states it, did we force you to put your fingerprint on it?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man's face full of scars twitched.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran was suddenly at a loss for words, intimidated by his imposing manner, and could only look at him with increasing sorrow and indignation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed: "I'll pay it, the debt is on me."</p><p></p><p>He then took out five one-hundred-tael silver notes and handed them to the gambling house's henchmen.</p><p></p><p>Redeeming the debt, it was that simple.</p><p></p><p>There were no other twists and turns, everything seemed to indicate that Li Zhengran had truly entered the gambling house and was cheated out of some money.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit in Li Che's chest was constantly trembling, and the remnant of the corpse curse that he had suppressed on the celestial chessboard was violently shaking, as if it was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che also felt the remnant of the corpse curse on Li Zhengran.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che also understood that Li Zhengran had indeed been affected.</p><p></p><p>The other party... came for him!</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, it's alright now, go home... Your aunt and uncle are waiting for you at home."</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted Li Zhengran.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran dejectedly lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>"These past few days... I lost one hundred and seventy taels of silver, which is almost all the savings of our family."</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran grabbed his own head, his eyes bloodshot, his emotions seemingly a bit agitated.</p><p></p><p>"I just need to win two hands, no... one hand to break even, to win back the savings!"</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, gambling harms people, don't do it again, quit it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted Li Zhengran's shoulder, his divine nature surging, soothing his emotions.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I'll take you to the Qingtian Mansion and see if there's a suitable job I can introduce to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile, his voice very gentle.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Zhengyang's agitated emotions gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain was hazy and slanted like a curtain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che led Li Zhengran back to his uncle's house.</p><p></p><p>In a hidden corner, the disguised Hong Yong and Shi Lei emerged.</p><p></p><p>They had heard Li Che's words clearly as he comforted Li Zhengran.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li is really a good person, his temperament is so gentle. Gamblers are the most detestable, those gamblers who squander their family's fortune are like maggots."</p><p></p><p>"Only Master Li is so patient..."</p><p></p><p>The disguised Shi Lei shook his head.</p><p></p><p>How could such a good-tempered and gentle person be the ruthless and merciless Niu Mo described in the intelligence report, who kills without blinking an eye and crushes the heads of his victims? Shi Lei felt that his speculation about Li Che was an insult to this noble master.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, continue to follow him."</p><p></p><p>The disguised Hong Yong glanced over, seemingly annoyed by Shi Lei's infatuation with Li Che, and sneered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che sent Li Zhengran back home.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that he owed the gambling house five hundred taels, the uncle angrily grabbed his tobacco pipe and started beating him, and Li Zhengran didn't dare to dodge.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chunmeng was standing by, shedding tears, but she didn't know what to say, only feeling disappointed in her husband.</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted them for a while and said that he would take Li Zhengran to the Qingtian Mansion later to see if there was a suitable job, which helped to ease the atmosphere a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, thank you so much..." Uncle Li Liang held Li Che's hand and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>It was his, Li Liang's, failure in educating his son.</p><p></p><p>Declining the invitation to stay for a meal, Li Che left, citing the need to go to the Qingtian Mansion for work.</p><p></p><p>After leaving his uncle's house, Li Che's expression became cold.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow relaxed, he could feel the remnant of the corpse curse suppressed by the celestial chessboard, as well as the corpse curse on Li Zhengran's body, and there seemed to be murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The "Desire to Surpass Corpse Avalokitesvara" that Cao Hetu had previously held contained a remnant of the corpse curse, targeting his daughter, which he had intercepted.</p><p></p><p>And now, they've come again...</p><p></p><p>Li Che even sensed that the target of the Corpse God Sect might be his daughter.</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Light Capital, the major families and sects might be wary of the Divine Sect and not dare to make a move against Xixia.</p><p></p><p>But the Corpse God Sect wouldn't...</p><p></p><p>Because the Corpse God Sect itself is a formidable force.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that in the remote regions of the Great Jing Dynasty, the Corpse God Sect has almost swept and occupied an entire province!</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath and slowly headed towards the Qingtian Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Around him, Qin Haonan, the disguised Hong Yong and Shi Lei, as well as the spy who followed from the Bai Wan Gambling House, were all secretly following and tracking his movements.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't go anywhere else, but headed straight for the Treasure Pavilion of the Qingtian Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the bank of the river, the fine rain was beating on the calm river surface, rippling in circles.</p><p></p><p>Shrouded in the misty rain, the multi-arched, multi-eaved Treasure Pavilion stood majestically on the cliff by the river.</p><p></p><p>In the poetic and picturesque scene, the figure of Li Che in black robes stepped into the Treasure Pavilion of the Qingtian Mansion, under the melancholy gaze of Qin Haonan, Hong Yong, and Shi Lei.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan: "..."</p><p></p><p>The disguised Hong Yong sneered: "Boring."</p><p></p><p>Shi Lei praised: "Master Li... is so punctual in coming to work, he is really self-disciplined."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped into the Qingtian Mansion, Li Che fully activated the concealment ability of the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], gripping the divine chess pieces without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>The Chess Saint of Feilei.</p><p></p><p>Shift and transform!</p><p></p><p>In a narrow alley outside the Bai Wan Gambling House, the sound of the spring rain pattering echoed.</p><p></p><p>The chess piece he had left behind earlier transformed into his own figure.</p><p></p><p>Bringing two fingers together, he tore open the air.</p><p></p><p>Straw hat, black robe.</p><p></p><p>A muffled "boom" sound.</p><p></p><p>His physical body suddenly swelled, becoming more muscular and robust, the large tendons on his back trembling like thunder, the knotted muscles like tempered steel.</p><p></p><p>"Since you all want to see me so much..."</p><p></p><p>"Then your Niu Mo Grandpa..."</p><p></p><p>"Is here!"</p><p></p><p>His fan-like five fingers slowly slid down, and his cheeks were already covered by the cute ox-faced mask that had been sealed for some time.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a sense of unbridled, manic, domineering, and restless emotions burst forth from his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, with the mask on, seemed to... have liberated his true self!</p><p></p><p>Like a wild beast unleashed!</p><p></p><p>Bad news, the strong push has been announced, the new book period has officially ended, and the naked running life has begun. I don't know when the recommendation will come, everyone, don't stop reading, reading is related to the PK, Old Li needs everyone's support!

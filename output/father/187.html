            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the Nine Dragons River.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the angry cliff stones.</p><p></p><p>It was completely quiet, so quiet that one could even hear the sound of the wind and rain howling outside the isolation.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo stood with his hands behind his back, his white robes fluttering, his white hair swaying in the ceaseless wind, each strand clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were deep and gazing at the mysterious mist-shrouded river surface.</p><p></p><p>The river surface was completely obscured, as if a thick river mist had risen, suppressing the surging waves, not even a single rolling wave could be stirred up.</p><p></p><p>By his side, Wang Daoren's palm was curved, holding a fly whisk, his gaze also solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, what are you worrying about?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren turned his head to look at him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you worried that Xixie won't be able to obtain the temple god inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo shook his head slightly when he heard this: "There's no need to worry about that. That girl Xixie, even if she doesn't get the temple god inheritance this time, with her talent, her future potential is definitely not just a Shenyuan level."</p><p></p><p>"She has such good talent that she has the hope of stepping into the Shentai Great God realm."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren was dumbfounded: "You have too much confidence in your little disciple, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>He turned around and looked at the rolling mist-shrouded river, his gaze deep: "The Shentai realm... how many people want to step into it, but how many can succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"The Shenyuan True Person has three molts, the Yuanshen molt, the Jinshen molt, and the Taishi molt, each step is a life-and-death crisis, one misstep and you will fall into the endless abyss."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there are so many Shenyuan, but how many can truly become Shentai?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren was somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"You and I were also once called the cream of the crop, but now... you are not even a Shenyuan, and I... whether I can condense the Jinshen is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren never thought of things in a positive way.</p><p></p><p>He would be prepared for the worst, and would lower his own expectations, so that... when disappointment came, he would not be overwhelmed by it.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"No... Xixie is different."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo still said so.</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren flicked his fly whisk and laughed: "Shidi, then let's make a bet. I also like that girl Xixie..."</p><p></p><p>"If she can obtain the temple god inheritance in this temple god resonance assembly, even if it's just one cultivation method for cultivating one's nature, one divine foundation method, or even a common secret technique, I'll admit it."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo heard this and looked at Wang Daoren strangely: "What to bet on?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren looked at the mysterious mist-rolling Jueque, unable to see the situation of the children who had entered it.</p><p></p><p>He softly said, "Bet on... before the Sect Master Grand Deity calls the last of his personal disciples, I will send this girl Xixie to the Sect Master to let the Sect Master see her."</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo suddenly turned around, his gaze burning hot and scorching.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong! You agreed?!"</p><p></p><p>In these days, Nan Lihuo had been begging Wang Daoren.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that Wang Daoren could do it, but Wang Daoren had never agreed before, but why was he willing to agree this time in the form of a bet? In Nan Lihuo's eyes, Wang Daoren had agreed...</p><p></p><p>After all, with Xixie's talent, obtaining the temple god inheritance was not a problem at all, the only thing to consider was the quality of the inheritance she obtained.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Wang Ayu's bet was equivalent to a roundabout agreement.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ayu bitterly smiled: "I didn't agree, this is just a bet, isn't it?!"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, Shidi, if you just go back to the Sect directly and ask your Master, Xixie's future would be more stable."</p><p></p><p>However, when Nan Lihuo heard this, his gaze dimmed a bit.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go back."</p><p></p><p>"I can't go back anymore."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Long is cultivating in the Sect... you help me take care of him a bit, this child's brain doesn't work well... I'm afraid he will be bullied."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren laughed: "I know, this little Bianyu Long... simple and honest, although his brain is a bit stupid, but he makes up for it in sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to worry, this little guy's simple nature has touched an inner sect elder, and now he doesn't lack resources... in terms of cultivation, he has already surpassed you, his teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Bianyu Long is currently ranked among the top ten in the inner sect, and the Sect also values him highly. In the next 'Peach Blossom Victory Assembly' held in the Three Pure Mysterious Temple in the Great Capital... this little guy will become our Qianyuan Sect's powerful assistant."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Bianyu Long was Nan Lihuo's second disciple.</p><p></p><p>He was sent to the Qianyuan Sect to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... fools have fool's luck."</p><p></p><p>"After this temple god resonance assembly, I plan to send both Guanyin and Xixie to the Sect's main school as well."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's gaze flickered as he looked at Wang Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"Sang Guanyin and Li Nuanxi?"</p><p></p><p>"What about Liu Yangyuan? Your third disciple... you don't care about him?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo paused for a moment and slowly exhaled a breath: "Yangyuan... can be the Vice Sect Master of the Branch Sect."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren shook his head and snorted.</p><p></p><p>"This way of yours will hurt your third disciple's heart..."</p><p></p><p>"The eldest senior brother, the second senior brother, and the fourth senior sister have already sent the newly entered junior sister to the main school, but he... is left to guard the Branch Sect alone."</p><p></p><p>"He needs to take over the mess you left behind."</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren sighed and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo stood with his hands behind his back, no longer speaking, his gaze fixed on the Jueque.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion area.</p><p></p><p>A luxurious carriage was parked.</p><p></p><p>Six black-armored blood guards stood in an orderly manner, leading the Jiaolong horses.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was sitting in the carriage, and the Shadow Cultivator True Person was also sitting cross-legged, quietly drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Cultivator True Person's figure was completely indistinct, shrouded in black mist, and he glanced at Su Huai: "Old Wang wants you to wait until this matter is over and then return to Jizhou together."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's movement of brewing tea paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Return to Jizhou?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai continued to brew tea, the corners of his mouth slightly smoothing out.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back after I've taken care of the things in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said gently.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Cultivator True Person nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang said that your senior brothers and sisters have all stepped into the Shenyuan realm, and your cultivation is too far behind. After returning to Jizhou, you will be given enough resources to properly improve your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Three years from now, the 'Peach Blossom Victory Assembly' of the Western Queen Mother in that Three Pure Mysterious Temple outside the Great Capital will be opened, and the Wang wants you to prepare well."</p><p></p><p>"If you can win a peach, the Wang says you will have a chance to achieve the Taishi molt."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Cultivator True Person's words floated in the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai paused his movements and chuckled lightly: "Master... do you have so little confidence in me?"</p><p></p><p>"Can I only have a chance to achieve the Shentai if I win a peach?"</p><p></p><p>"Do I have no chance to form the Shentai?"</p><p></p><p>The black mist-rolling Shadow Cultivator True Person glanced at Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>He did not respond, this was a question he could not answer.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai, however, did not seem to mind, and continued to brew tea.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Shangguan Qinghong returned to the carriage, while Li Che sat on the carriage pole, his face as calm as a deep pool, his expression unreadable.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain blew, the ink-black robe sleeves fluttering and whipping the air.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his eyes, the black and white chess pieces intertwined, the chessboard lines rising and falling in waves.</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's eyes, the untainted spiritual chess piece left in Xixie's hand had already fully fed back the situation of Xixie entering the Jueque.</p><p></p><p>It was like a mirror reflecting the light.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual sense was seated on the heavenly and earthly chessboard, the hair formed by his spiritual sense flying, his eyes opening and closing, golden light flashing, facing the scene.</p><p></p><p>His face was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>In the scene...</p><p></p><p>Xixie entered the Jueque, the purple flame snake spear and fire spear trembling, emitting purple flames that coiled and pulled Xixie, guiding her forward, all of this was presented.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, it wasn't really anything.</p><p></p><p>But when Xixie came to the front of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the "Xixie" sitting on the steps, Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Carve the bones to return to the father-"</p><p></p><p>"Cut the flesh to return to the mother-"</p><p></p><p>"Come-"</p><p></p><p>That "Xixie" grabbed the divine sword and suddenly cut off her own flesh and blood, spraying blood mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's five fingers suddenly clenched, and a murderous aura burst forth from him.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? Who is this Xixie...? Is it the reflection and manifestation of the temple god?</p><p></p><p>Is it trying to corrupt my Xixie?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned.</p><p></p><p>He was about to grip the Flying Thunder chess piece and appear there.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hand movement paused, and the chessboard lines in his gaze intertwined.</p><p></p><p>But he saw that the "Xixie" who was carving the bones and cutting the flesh suddenly raised her head, her evil gaze seeming to penetrate the Flying Thunder chess piece and collide with the Li Che who was monitoring in the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie" slowly raised the corners of her mouth into a reckless and arrogant arc.</p><p></p><p>"Dead monkey..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious."</p><p></p><p>The lips and teeth came together.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not speak, Li Che understood.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's movement of grasping the Flying Thunder chess piece paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>On the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>【The Face of the Sage】 trembled slightly, and then returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>As if saying...</p><p></p><p>Silly child, you cursed the wrong monkey.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"This temple god... is a bit demonic."</p><p></p><p>Prodigy?</p><p></p><p>Demon child?! Li Che tapped his fingers, holding the Flying Thunder chess piece at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Net is deployed, the chess piece is placed on me.</p><p></p><p>Just a thought.</p><p></p><p>And he could take Xixie out of danger.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The mist rolled.</p><p></p><p>Creak creak...</p><p></p><p>That was the sound of a dull knife cutting flesh, too clear and harsh, making the hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Xixie felt that the little hairs on her arms had all stood up.</p><p></p><p>She heard the "Xixie" sitting on the stone steps in front of her calling out, summoning her.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's chubby little face kept trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Fake!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm Xixie, Li Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie was a little angry!</p><p></p><p>She stared wide-eyed, not afraid, not frightened.</p><p></p><p>Why do this?!</p><p></p><p>Daddy and Mommy gave Xixie a body, and when Xixie's hand got a little scrape, Daddy and Mommy were worried and concerned.</p><p></p><p>How could Xixie carve the flesh to return to Mommy, carve the bones to return to Daddy?</p><p></p><p>This way...</p><p></p><p>Daddy and Mommy will be very, very sad!</p><p></p><p>Xixie doesn't want Daddy and Mommy to be sad!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie put her hands on her hips, glaring with her little eyes, and shouted in a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>The "Xixie" sitting on the steps suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Poof-</p><p></p><p>The sword in her hand, the action still did not stop.</p><p></p><p>"Why not?"</p><p></p><p>"Daddy doesn't love Xixie, when Xixie made a mistake, everyone always says it's Xixie's fault... Xixie has to apologize, Xixie has to kowtow..."</p><p></p><p>"How could Xixie be wrong? Even if Xixie was wrong... why did Daddy help others bully Xixie?"</p><p></p><p>The hoarse voice, accompanied by a sobbing cry, along with the sound of cutting flesh.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the gates of the underworld had opened, and countless wailing ghost winds and ghost qi were howling.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to freeze everything.</p><p></p><p>Freeze everything! The "Xixie" sitting on the steps stood up, her face full of sad tears, tears streaming down her face.</p><p></p><p>Crying so sadly, so bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Xixie just looked at it for a moment, and she felt it too, unable to hold back the urge to cry.</p><p></p><p>But Xixie suddenly sniffed her nose, forcibly holding back the tears.</p><p></p><p>"You're lying! Daddy is not like what you said!"</p><p></p><p>"Daddy loves Xixie the most, likes Xixie the most, he won't help others bully Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie put her hands on her hips and said defiantly.</p><p></p><p>The "Xixie" standing on the steps let out a puff of laughter, the sharp sword scraping off a piece of crimson flesh, falling to the ground with a boom, igniting a blood-red flame!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Daddy is just helping others bully Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>"He wants Xixie's bones, Xixie's flesh, Xixie will give it back to him! Give it back to him-!!!"</p><p></p><p>The screaming voice exploded, the entire Jueque seemed to be stirred up in waves!</p><p></p><p>"Daddy won't force Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>"Daddy loves Xixie the most!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie did not back down, shouting back loudly.</p><p></p><p>Her childish voice lingered in the Jueque.</p><p></p><p>She was not at all tempted by the scene reflected by the temple god, her heart firm and unwavering!</p><p></p><p>The wind and waves were turbulent, the rolling mist surging endlessly! But the "Xixie" standing on the steps twisted and then turned into a brilliant black lotus flower.</p><p></p><p>The black lotus flower pedestal slowly rotated.</p><p></p><p>Blooming in full.</p><p></p><p>Then, a child sat on that lotus pedestal.</p><p></p><p>The child wore a black belly band, with two pigtails sticking up, with black circles around the eyes, the whole body burning with thick black flames.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at Xixie calmly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't believe?"</p><p></p><p>The child asked Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Xixie raised her chin and shook her head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"You believe."</p><p></p><p>"Carve the bones to return to the father, cut the flesh to return to the mother, and you can obtain the true inheritance of the Zhi..."</p><p></p><p>"You can get the Zhi's four divine weapon sets, can obtain the Zhi's divine cultivation method... can step into the Shentai, and even pass through the divine tribulation, become a carefree divine spirit..."</p><p></p><p>The bewitching voice echoed through the mist.</p><p></p><p>Xixie immediately gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>Liar!</p><p></p><p>If Xixie loses Daddy and Mommy, what's the use of divine weapons? What's the use of</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, she lifted her head.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha—"</p><p></p><p>"You said your father loves you..."</p><p></p><p>"Then just try it—"</p><p></p><p>"When you get in trouble, will your father still love you?"</p><p></p><p>"He will make you apologize, kowtow, kneel down, and suffer humiliation..."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone will slander you, curse you, criticize you, rebuke you, and then... no one will be on your side, you will stand there all alone."</p><p></p><p>"Abandoned by the whole world!"</p><p></p><p>"Just try it..."</p><p></p><p>The children on the black lotus were laughing heartily, rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then, they jumped down from the black lotus.</p><p></p><p>The black flames were burning fiercely, constantly approaching Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia became alert immediately.</p><p></p><p>She started with the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, the first technique Li Che taught her.</p><p></p><p>The black-flamed Third Prince walked up to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>He extended a finger and pointed it at the center of Xixia's brow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the endless flames converged.</p><p></p><p>The children also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"My father won't do that!"</p><p></p><p>"My father is the best in the world, unlike your stinky father!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia puffed out her chest defiantly: "Just try it if you dare!"</p><p></p><p>The children disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious mist began to slowly unfurl.</p><p></p><p>The black lotus platform, burning with black flames, still stood there.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The small gun in her hand suddenly started to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Xixia took small steps and cautiously approached the black lotus platform.</p><p></p><p>She peeked over and saw...</p><p></p><p>In the center of the black lotus platform,</p><p></p><p>there was a gleaming golden brick.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Wow~"</p><p></p><p>"Such a big gold brick!"</p><p></p><p>"I can buy so many braised pork knuckles with it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze swayed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly opened his eyes, and a trace of speechlessness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's dispute with the incarnation of the Third Prince was just like two children bickering and arguing.</p><p></p><p>Except that the Third Prince didn't seem to have won the argument.</p><p></p><p>Xixia stood with her neck raised, hands on her hips, chest puffed out, still unwilling to be swayed by the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>But despite the smile,</p><p></p><p>Li Che also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince said to "just try it"... what did that mean? Li Che pondered carefully, but he had no clue, as he knew too little about the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Especially this mysterious temple, which was at the Fourth Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>It was something that the current Li Che could not even approach. Hearing about the Fourth Sovereign mysterious temples, once the Mysterious Abyss erupted, only Godly Embryo Great Immortals could have a chance to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che greatly enjoyed absorbing the divine nature of the temples, this Third Prince temple deity might not be easy to absorb.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince temple deity who just conversed with Xixia was probably just a projection.</p><p></p><p>Yet even just a projection could see through the chessboard of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally knew that the temple deities in this world were all fallen gods, and their strength was naturally not as strong as when they were alive.</p><p></p><p>But it also depends on who they are compared to.</p><p></p><p>At least, compared to the powers of this world, even the fallen temple deities are terrifyingly powerful existences.</p><p></p><p>"A test given by the temple deity to Xixia?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's not some kind of nonsense test."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed something and looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the dense mist shrouding the Nine Dragon River had been slowly torn open again.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus Fiery Gold Light Wheel was spinning at high speed.</p><p></p><p>The flames were turning, sparks were flying! Gradually, a great path emerged.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Che, but all the cultivators on the Angry Cliff also couldn't help but turn their gaze towards it.</p><p></p><p>Although the distance was far, for many of the powerful cultivators present, this distance was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity's resonance is about to come out!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing, with a bitter lotus-like expression, said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Standing with him were the Immortal Elders Li Qingshan, Zhu Hongdou, and Weng Wuyu, all of whom narrowed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were eagerly looking towards it.</p><p></p><p>Not only them.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful cultivators who had retreated into their carriages also came out.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of numerous powerful cultivators were all focused there.</p><p></p><p>They saw that in front of the "Eight-Armed Infernal Lotus Wrathful Third Prince" Mysterious Temple, about three hundred zhang away,</p><p></p><p>the figures of children stood clearly.</p><p></p><p>The children all had their eyes closed, and a mysterious mist shrouded them.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Xixia, Jie Haihuai, Tie Shancai, and other children, they all had their eyes closed, as if they had fallen into a coma.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>After the mist dissipated,</p><p></p><p>the children began to take steps.</p><p></p><p>From three hundred zhang away from the Mysterious Temple, they walked towards the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The distance they could approach the Mysterious Temple would indicate the degree of their temple deity resonance...</p><p></p><p>After waking up, the children would receive the temple deity's gifts and rewards.</p><p></p><p>The world's first divine nature cultivation method was obtained through the temple deity's bestowal.</p><p></p><p>That was the origin of divine nature cultivation, and gradually it developed into the grand and magnificent Dao of Divine Nature.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also became alert.</p><p></p><p>What he saw in front of him was different from the scene he saw through Xixia's perspective on the Chessboard of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Che quite surprised, the Fourth Sovereign Mysterious Temple... was indeed quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Xixia had her eyes closed, a small figure, unable to take a single step, standing in place, trembling all over, her expression full of struggle.</p><p></p><p>While the other spiritual children and divine children had already started walking.</p><p></p><p>They stepped into the three hundred zhang range and walked towards the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Clamorous voices rang out from the cliff.</p><p></p><p>The local cultivators of the Golden Light Mansion all had extremely unsightly expressions.</p><p></p><p>The divine children from the Divine Capital, the Dao City, the Prince of Pacification's offspring...</p><p></p><p>Were they really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>Li Nuanxi, the divine child of the Golden Light Mansion...</p><p></p><p>Couldn't even take a step.</p><p></p><p>She was left far behind.</p><p></p><p>But Jie Haihuai, Gong Yuanxiang, Gongyang Yu, and Huang Sixiang and others had taken steps.</p><p></p><p>Their speed was not slow either, but compared to Jie Haihuai and the others, they were far inferior.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly,</p><p></p><p>in this temple deity resonance...</p><p></p><p>the divine children and spiritual children of the Golden Light Mansion...</p><p></p><p>were completely crushed! Leading the way was not Jie Haihuai, but the divine child from the Divine Capital, Tie Shancai, who was walking with his eyes closed, his body enveloped in three-colored flames.</p><p></p><p>Unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>Following him was not Jie Haihuai, but an unexpected person... the chubby Zhou Peng! After him was Yun'e.</p><p></p><p>Next was Jie Haihuai, the young prince surrounded by the dragon god's phantom.</p><p></p><p>After him was Tao Ren, brought by the Dao City Heavenly Monitor.</p><p></p><p>And after Tao Ren...</p><p></p><p>were the children of the Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>However, many of the Golden Light Mansion's local cultivators, upon seeing this figure, were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the genius spiritual child of the Qin family?!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire! Chasing after Tao Ren, his temple deity resonance was only slightly inferior to the child brought by the Dao City Heavenly Monitor.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual child of the Qin family?!</p><p></p><p>Not only the cultivators of the Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sect Master of the Separate Sect, Nan Liihuo, felt quite surprised, a puzzled look flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire... an ordinary spiritual child with average divine nature talent, actually stood out in this temple deity resonance? Many people turned their gaze towards the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>However, they found that the Qin family's Patriarch, Qin Diku, was sitting in the carriage, the curtain drawn, without any movement.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he was not at all delighted by the fact that the Qin family's spiritual child was about to achieve good results in the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>Many people suddenly couldn't understand the Qin family anymore.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze opened and closed, his vision falling on the carriage where Qin Diku, the Qin family's Patriarch, was sitting.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the Dao Fruit in his chest was slightly pulsing.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing a certain threat.</p><p></p><p>"Threat?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, his thoughts moving.</p><p></p><p>The Chessboard of Heaven and Earth unfolded, and the Seven Elemental Corpse Curse Mother-Child Seal was activated by his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, formless black qi rapidly spread, enveloping the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The imagined corpse qi and death qi did not surge up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the warning from the Dao Fruit...</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, pointing to his brow, and in an instant, the flesh and blood split open, and a rolling eyeball emerged.</p><p></p><p>Technique, Plucking Star Eyes! Instantly, as if there was a sharp and scorching gaze, it shot out from the center of Li Che's brow, landing on the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Under the "Able to Discern the True from the False" Plucking Star Eyes,</p><p></p><p>in the carriage of the Qin family,</p><p></p><p>there was an unstoppable corpse qi and death qi, churning and rolling within!</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Jingang?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire, among the many temple deity resonating children, unexpectedly ranked quite high, much to everyone's surprise.</p><p></p><p>After Qin Huofire was Lü Chi, the disciple of Li Qingshan. This was Lü Chi's second time participating in the temple deity resonance, so his level could be understood.</p><p></p><p>After Lü Chi was Zhong Liushou, the divine child of the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect.</p><p></p><p>And Li Nuanxi, the local Jiazihen divine child of the Golden Light Mansion who everyone had high hopes for, couldn't even take a single step.</p><p></p><p>This was a complete failure in the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Shangguan Qinghong also heard the news. Their vision was blurred, but there were people around them explaining it clearly, so they heard it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's face turned deathly pale: "Xixia actually doesn't resonate with the temple deity at all?"</p><p></p><p>They had expected it for so long, prepared for so long.</p><p></p><p>But when the result came out, they still felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"If Xixia knows this result... she must be so heartbroken." Zhang Ya sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xixia... such a strong-willed child.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't just Xixia who couldn't take a single step. There were many spiritual children who, like Xixia, couldn't even take a step.</p><p></p><p>Many spiritual children were sweating profusely, exerting their utmost effort, but still couldn't take a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Their appearance was exactly the same as the trembling Xixia at the moment.</p><p></p><p>On the cliff.</p><p></p><p>The wind whistled through the void.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liihuo's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned to see the stationary Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liihuo frowned, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>How could Xixia possibly have...</p><p></p><p>no resonance with the temple deity at all?! Wang Daoren also felt surprised, pausing the stroking of his beard.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>the bet he made with Nan Liihuo... he could still win?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! Unreasonable! "It shouldn't be, with Xixia's talent... how could she not be able to take a single step in the three hundred zhang distance?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liihuo clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>Something's wrong! Xixia must have encountered some kind of accident! The Golden Light Wheel roared.</p><p></p><p>The drifting mist began to churn again, not allowing the crowd to see too much.</p><p></p><p>The mist floating on the river slowly surged again, obscuring everyone's vision.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The mist rolled.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihuai's purple eyes flickered constantly, seeing through the mysterious objects, locking onto the location of the Mysterious Temple, and continuing to take steps.</p><p></p><p>In his ears, there was a voice echoing.</p><p></p><p>It was like a low hum, yet also like the dull sound of a knife cutting flesh.</p><p></p><p>That voice was guiding him forward.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihuai followed the voice's guidance, his purple eyes shimmering, the dragon god bloodline in his body boiling and restless.</p><p></p><p>Then it transformed into a purple dragon phantom around his body.</p><p></p><p>Like a purple dragon, it tore and undulated through the mist.</p><p></p><p>His expression was a bit nervous, a bit confused. The temple deity resonance... each test was different.</p><p></p><p>What he could gain, he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>But his father King Jie Moili had instructed him to go to the Mysterious Temple, so that he could obtain the Fourth Sovereign inheritance!</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihuai didn't want to disappoint his father's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He held a sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Ink-black, as if it would swallow all the light.</p><p></p><p>This was the trump card given to him by his father King Jie Moili, the one to be used during the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Sword of the Four Sovereign Divine Weapons, the Infernal Lotus Yin-Yang Divine Sword! Jie Haihuai naturally could not wield it.</p><p></p><p>But just bringing it out would be enough.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough...</p><p></p><p>When Jie Haihuai took out this sword, the mist seemed to tremble and tear open, and a guiding melody-like sound echoed in his ears.</p><p></p><p>This made Jie Haihuai overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This voice had been guiding him forward the whole time.</p><p></p><p>He trusted this voice completely, knowing that he had gained the temple deity's attention and achieved an extremely high resonance! He would step into the Mysterious Temple and obtain the Four Sovereign Temple Deity's inheritance!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihuai stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>His hair flew, his purple eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>He saw a figure he would never forget for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>The one who made him feel unprecedented humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihuai's dragon god purple pupils glowed.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>And Jie Haihuai...</p><p></p><p>finally heard the vague voice that had been guiding him all along.</p><p></p><p>"Kill her."</p><p></p><p>"Kill her!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill her!!!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan almost laughed out loud. He could already feel Zhu Hongdou's eagerness and longing.</p><p></p><p>This woman rarely showed such enthusiasm. Her appreciation for Xixia and the desire to take her as a true disciple to inherit the legacy were almost reflected on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Go tell Xixia's father."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou crossed her arms, pushing her ample bosom into an astonishing curve, but turned her head away without even looking at Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>She could almost guess the mocking smile on Li Qingshan's face.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention why Li Qingshan dared to mock her, although she was a Shenxiang cultivator, their relationship was quite good. When she was still a Xuxiang cultivator, she had even teamed up with Li Qingshan on missions.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Qingshan was about to break through to the Shenxiang realm, being on the same level, their relationship was no longer constrained by hierarchical differences.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhu, are you begging?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the attitude one should have when begging?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan became smug, his aged face blossoming with a radiant smile like a chrysanthemum.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou was annoyed: "Will you go or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll take care of it, but... Xixia's talent of reaching the Meaning Realm at the age of three is extremely sought after."</p><p></p><p>"Look at that Zhang Qingzheng, although he has a sour expression like he's eaten bitter gourd, he's actually smiling brighter than a chrysanthemum, it's just that his face is too sour, canceling out his smile."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan frowned, saying with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's eyes narrowed, and she suddenly became nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention Zhang Qingzheng, look at Elder Xu Jiuqing and Elder Weng Wuyu, their eyes are all so bright, eager to snatch her away."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He also knew that Xixia would not be able to join his sect, with such talent, she was naturally destined to become a true disciple of an elder. He had not yet broken through to the Shenxiang realm and was not an elder of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the elders' eager expressions, wanting to snatch her away, he also found it quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou was obviously anxious, her brows furrowed as she stared at Li Qingshan: "My Redcloud Peak is definitely suitable for Xixia. You go talk to her parents, and after you break through to the Shenxiang realm, I'll help you with the Dharma protection!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan squinted: "Alright, it's a deal then."</p><p></p><p>This also gave Zhu Hongdou a way out.</p><p></p><p>Although many people would not want him to succeed in breaking through to the Shenxiang realm, and might even try to disrupt and obstruct him, he was breaking through in the Zhenglie Peak, next to the Jinguang Peak of the Divine Sect, so the other party would not dare to act so blatantly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sect Master Nanlihuo would personally provide Dharma protection for his breakthrough, and Li Qingshan naturally did not mind having another Shenxiang expert.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Qingshan's agreement, Zhu Hongdou proudly raised her head, her red dress blooming like a red flower, and returned to the armchair, sitting down.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nanlihuo glanced at the two of them, he was fully aware of their little movements, the corners of his lips curling up slightly, as if he had thought of something, shaking his head imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The fine rain was hazy and slanting, the spring rain was pouring down.</p><p></p><p>The chill brought by the late spring was particularly obvious at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Many people had even put on more clothes, shivering from the cold.</p><p></p><p>Xixia huddled next to Zhang Ya, and Zhang Ya stroked her head, asking her what she wanted to eat for dinner.</p><p></p><p>Xixia tilted her head, repeatedly listing the dishes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat nearby, looking at his wife and daughter with a gentle gaze, everything was peaceful and stable, blissfully happy.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>The other arena battles had also come to an end, the first round of the competition had officially concluded.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's Confucian robe fluttered, with the wind hidden in his sleeves, standing on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>"The final defending champions of the five arenas have been determined: Haichao Sheng, Qin Fenghuо, Gong Yuanliang, Jin Ao, and Li Nuanxi, all scoring top-grade in the first round!"</p><p></p><p>"They can be considered reserve candidates for true disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Take a fifteen-minute break, the second round will begin, using the complete Wangxing Formation to observe the Zihui Qi of the true disciples, those whose Zihui Qi column exceeds fifty feet will score top-grade."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng spoke indifferently, his voice resounding throughout the venue, reaching every person's ears.</p><p></p><p>The Wangxing technique of the Divine Sect was a unique divine spiritual secret art, not only for detecting divine spirituality, but also having many other uses.</p><p></p><p>The Wangxing Formation assembled from this could be more accurate than Li Qingshan's solo Wangxing technique.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng finished speaking, then lightly tapped his toes and floated back up to the high platform, steadily sitting down on the armchair, his face as sour as vinegar.</p><p></p><p>With the end of the first round, the surroundings suddenly became lively, with endless whispers.</p><p></p><p>Many people began to talk boldly.</p><p></p><p>This was just the true disciple assessment for the top-grade spirit children, after this there would be assessments for the spirit children below top-grade, which would decide the quotas for inner and outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the true disciple assessment, it would not be as complicated.</p><p></p><p>For any sect, the status of a true disciple is extremely important, becoming a true disciple will receive the sect's concentrated resources, and they are the backbone of the sect's future.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the assessment has to be more rigorous.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sect's assessment is considered quite fair, looking at strength in competition, and also divine spiritual talent, even if they are not from the five great families or sects of the capital city, they still have the opportunity to stand out!</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took Xixia from Zhang Ya's arms, the little girl was still thinking of the dishes she hadn't mentioned, frowning in distress.</p><p></p><p>Li Che chuckled, this greedy little thing, raising his hand and using the [Untainted Heart] divine spirituality to groom Xixia's body.</p><p></p><p>The first round was combat, the second round was detection, the third round... was the Temple God Resonance? Li Che turned his head to look at the side at Lü Chi: "Little Chi, can you secretly tell me, is the third round of the Divine Sect's true disciple assessment the Temple God Resonance?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi smiled and shook his head: "No, the Temple God Resonance... requires a specific time point, using the divine weapon [Infernal Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel] to temporarily break through the Mysterious Hall, paving a path directly to the hundred-foot area in front of the Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"The specific time point... depends on the situation of the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"So the 'Temple God Resonance' is not today?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi tilted his head: "Probably not, when I entered the sect, I also had the Temple God Resonance, it seems to have been postponed by about six months."</p><p></p><p>"Six months?" Li Che took a deep breath, "Postponed for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi had not yet answered, but the approaching Shangguan Qinghong had already supplemented a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's not that long, the Temple God Resonance is something many Divine Sects will do, some Divine Sects... may arrange it to be waited for several years."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong squeezed Lü Chi aside and sat down on the chair, taking out a large bag of candied fruits and handing them to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Qinghong!" </p><p></p><p>Xixia was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Xixia, for finding me a stage." Shangguan Qinghong smiled, her eyes crescent-shaped, very happy.</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Qinglang was her own brother, she had no feelings for him, and even felt indifferent, seeing Xixia beat up Shangguan Qinglang, she was actually happily delighted.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong looked at Li Che, her expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"My despicable father, I know very well... his mind is extremely petty, he dotes on Shangguan Qinglang dearly, Xixia has hurt his precious son, he definitely won't let this go easily."</p><p></p><p>"He may secretly find an opportunity to get back at you."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong warned Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen... is small-minded?"</p><p></p><p>Is his heart as big as the Ox Demon's?...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, the fifteen minutes were not too long.</p><p></p><p>After the break, the black bell was rung by Zhu Hongdou again, the vibrating sound waves dispersing, shattering the fine rain, and also shattering the soft murmurs of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell silent, and Zhang Qingzheng floated back up to the platform, standing with his hands behind his back, his face like a bitter lotus, his dead fish eyes sweeping across the crowd, speaking indifferently: "All top-grade and high-grade spirit children, come up to the stage."</p><p></p><p>Under the jurisdiction of the capital city, there were only three top-grade spirit children, but there were more than fifty high-grade spirit children, while the medium-grade and low-grade spirit children were even more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Only the top-grade and high-grade spirit children were qualified to go up to the stage.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother, Uncle Chen, Aunt Su, Sister Qinghong, Xixia is going!" </p><p></p><p>Xixia had a candied fruit in her mouth, hands on her hips, chin raised proudly, and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>She then strode towards the arena stage alone.</p><p></p><p>The other spirit children did not dare to get too close to her.</p><p></p><p>After all, the terrifying scene of Xixia blasting Shangguan Qinglang half to death with a mechanism was witnessed by everyone, it was simply too horrifying, and now seeing the three-year-old Xixia, they were like seeing the devil.</p><p></p><p>Xixia didn't mind, after climbing up the high platform, she stood with the other top-grade spirit children.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, come stand over here."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang waved to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked at Gong Yuanliang puzzledly: "My aunt is the Deputy Director of the Astronomical Bureau, and your father is also from the Astronomical Bureau, we're all in the same circle!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>Xixia understood, and trotted over to her side.</p><p></p><p>"Me too, my grandfather is Gongyang Liancheng, he's also a Deputy Director of the Astronomical Bureau! We're all in the same group!"</p><p></p><p>The five-year-old Gongyang Xiu, who was a bit older than Xixia, also came over.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes brightened, nodding, and after thinking for a moment, she took out a handful of sunflower seeds from her pocket and gave three to Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang each.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang looked at the three sunflower seeds in their palms, falling silent.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the genius Hai Chaosheng of the Hai family stood with his arms crossed, his expression cold and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He also had connections with the Astronomical Bureau, with one of his cousins being a guest researcher there, but should he go and curry favor with them?</p><p></p><p>He, Hai Chaosheng, the genius treasured by the Hai family's ancestor, was the sole top-tier talent among this batch of top-grade spirit children.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglang, who had been blasted by Xixia, still had wounds on his body, and stood with Qin Fenghuо, his heart still filled with fear, keeping a distance from Xixia.</p><p></p><p>On the small high platform, a variety of personalities gathered.</p><p></p><p>While below the fifteen top-grade spirit children, the high-grade spirit children from the capital city and the thirteen cities were lined up, numbering close to a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng, with his Confucian robe fluttering, said coldly.</p><p></p><p>That sour lotus face became as stern as the Thundergod's, and all the children immediately quieted down, fearfully looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"The detection begins, no one is allowed to use their divine spirituality, if anyone activates their divine spirituality, their qualification will be canceled!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng swept his gaze across the crowd, speaking solemnly.</p><p></p><p>All the spirit children hurriedly nodded their heads.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly sat up straight, squinting his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nanlihuo's expression was warm, looking at the other three elders, Zhu Hongdou, Xu Jiuqing, and Weng Wuyu, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the three elders stood up, tapping their eyebrows, and their divine spirituality burst forth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire area at the foot of the Divine Sect mountain was enveloped in a peculiar spiritual aura, as if one divine spiritual pillar after another was rising, forming a huge mushroom-like umbrella covering a vast area.</p><p></p><p>The umbrella was a hundred feet high, seemingly transparent, yet substantial, and the spring rain falling from the sky was blocked outside.</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked up at the mushroom-like divine spiritual umbrella in awe, letting out a "wow" of amazement.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Divine Sect's Wangxing Formation, it's a formation set up by divine formation masters... very impressive." </p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang saw Xixia's surprise and quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>"I know, my grandfather is a super impressive divine formation master!" Gongyang Xiu immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang glanced at him sideways: "My aunt is even more impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"My grandfather is more impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"My aunt is the most impressive!"</p><p></p><p>The two began to argue...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Soaring through the clouds, flying across the earth!" </p><p></p><p>"My aunt can eat..."</p><p></p><p>Xixia quickly stepped in to smooth things over, then sympathetically took out a handful of sunflower seeds and gave three each to Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Don't argue, you two. Eat the sunflower seeds to cool down, or Grandpa Referee will frown at you!" Xixia said.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Zhang Qingzheng's frown, Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu stopped arguing and quietly started eating the sunflower seeds.</p><p></p><p>Below the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Che silently watched Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu gather around Xixia, narrowing his eyes. It was as if he saw their jet-black hair gradually turning yellow.</p><p></p><p>"Are they the juniors of Gongyangxiao and Gong Yuanliang?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think about it further. Although Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu had a tendency towards yellow hair, they were not fully yellow yet, and were still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had important matters to attend to, so he lifted his head and looked at the mushroom-shaped umbrella that was expanding with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power formation..."</p><p></p><p>A formation based on divination techniques... </p><p></p><p>A spiritual power formation, only a grand master of spiritual formations could set it up.</p><p></p><p>Just like the wood carving master, it was a special profession developed based on spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Che's first time seeing the layout of a grand master of spiritual formations. Sweeping his gaze, he could see seven adorable wooden child sculptures, some crying, some laughing, some joyful, some angry, arranged around the foot of the Shenzong Jingang Peak. These wooden sculptures were the formation plates of the spiritual power formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite curious about spiritual power formations, but since he had never delved into them, he naturally had no way to study them.</p><p></p><p>Collecting his thoughts, under the coverage of this spiritual power formation, all cultivators would have their spiritual power suppressed and dared not release it, which would affect the assessment.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Li Qingshan said it was best to detect the Corpse Curse Seal at this time.</p><p></p><p>Because even the venerable ancestors of the Five Great Families, their spiritual power was also in a suppressed state, daring not to release it. Even if he investigated and detected, he would not be discovered.</p><p></p><p>This was to ensure the safety of Li Che, the one doing the detection.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had asked him if he needed to use spiritual power for the detection method. After Li Che said no, did this plan come about? His mind stirred, and the [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit in his chest trembled slightly! Li Che closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the "Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal" that had been suppressed in the center of the heaven and earth chessboard suddenly began to tremble violently, the dark and deathly aura forming concentric ripple storms that rumbled and spread outward.</p><p></p><p>Li Che abruptly opened his eyes, and in his pupils, there seemed to be a chessboard network crisscrossing.</p><p></p><p>The release of the deathly aura of the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal was like a surging river tide, rolling and rushing towards various directions.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping across the seated figures.</p><p></p><p>Silently, like a spring breeze caressing the face, it did not attract anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Che's eyes...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one after another, the responses of the Corpse Curse Seals appeared and floated up on the chessboard, like blooming hellish Mandala flowers of deathly aura.</p><p></p><p>First one, then two, three, four...</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible person was dropping chess pieces on the chessboard in midair, splashing deathly aura like flowers.</p><p></p><p>Gradually...</p><p></p><p>More and more!</p><p></p><p>Huh? So many?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, the ruthless color in his eyes becoming even more intense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed Nanlihuo, his black hair dancing in the spring wind, suddenly, he seemed to sense something and his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the entire field, but he did not find any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he seemed to feel a probing force.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not perceive the source of the probing!</p><p></p><p>"Is someone probing old me?" </p><p></p><p>Who is so audacious? Nanlihuo's brow slightly furrowed, and the divine mark on his brow twisted, emitting a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>His gaze suddenly became sharp, the terrifying spiritual sense bursting forth silently, without causing any ripples in the spiritual formation, and even the nearest few venerable ancestors could not detect it, let alone Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual sense enveloped and spread out in a fan shape, trying to detect where the probing waves were coming from.</p><p></p><p>But there was no harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo leaned back on the armchair, his gaze suddenly falling on Li Qingshan's face, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's Confucian robe clung to his body as the three elders activated the spiritual power and ignited the divination spiritual formation.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward in his cloth shoes, made a hand seal, and in an instant, his eyes were shrouded in a deep purple!</p><p></p><p>The whole person seemed to be connected to the spiritual formation, and his gaze swept over the hundreds of top-grade and superior-grade spiritual children on the high platform!</p><p></p><p>"Innate spiritual power, I observe your spiritual power!"</p><p></p><p>"Arise!"</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's hair flew, his sallow and bitter face slightly trembling, and the next moment he pointed a finger towards the hundreds of spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>Boom! On the high platform, all the spiritual children held their breath, completely different from when Li Qingshan had detected their spiritual power before.</p><p></p><p>Xixia felt that something inside her seemed to be about to break out! Attracted by the umbrella-shaped cover above, unable to suppress it! Thick purple smoke rose from the top of Xixia's head, winding like a small snake! Not only her, but the people around her, Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu, and those far away like Haichao Sheng, Qin Huofire, Huang Sixiang, and Shangguan Qinglei, all had purple smoke rising from their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>This was the manifestation of their innate spiritual power as spiritual children!</p><p></p><p>Below the wooden platform.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was silent as a graveyard, only the sound of everyone holding their breath.</p><p></p><p>Even the venerable ancestors of the major families could not help but cast their gaze.</p><p></p><p>Although testing talents does not have the excitement of a competition, the shock of witnessing the talents of the spiritual children is of a different kind.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the venerable ancestors were once spiritual children, and they have also been tested for their talents...</p><p></p><p>So they too have curiosity and a sense of comparison.</p><p></p><p>Family area.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was tense, her whole body taut, gripping Li Che's arm, her breathing heavy, her eyes fixed on Xixia on the wooden platform.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's body also couldn't help but lean forward, his eyes wide, with beads of nervous sweat on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>His precious Xixia... how would her talents be? Old Chen can be said to have watched Xixia grow up, and he has long regarded Xixia as his own granddaughter, naturally hoping that Xixia's talents would be good, and he would be nervous about it!</p><p></p><p>"Husband..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya unconsciously called the person she trusted the most.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were black at the moment, the chessboard was networking, his gaze sweeping the high platform, but he was exploring in various directions, his expression very solemn.</p><p></p><p>But this solemnity was just like being worried about his daughter's spiritual talents.</p><p></p><p>This was the normal reaction of the parents.</p><p></p><p>As for Xixia's spiritual talents, Li Che was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>Every day using the [Unsullied Heart] to comb and cleanse her spiritual power, compared to when Li Qingshan detected it before, Xixia's innate spiritual power is even higher than that time! But how much higher, Li Che had no concept.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghong, who is that person?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly spoke to Shangguan Qinghong beside him.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was stunned, not expecting Li Che to suddenly ask this at the critical moment when Xixia's spiritual talents were being tested.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, she followed the direction Li Che was pointing.</p><p></p><p>"Elder of the Guanchao Pavilion... Xiao Baihe, a virtual appearance expert!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong seemed to have been instructed to satisfy Li Che, so she immediately introduced him.</p><p></p><p>"And that one?"</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Elder of the Guanchao Pavilion... Zhao Kuyu, a virtual appearance master..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong seemed to be familiar with the information of everyone, and for whomever Li Che pointed to, she could report their name.</p><p></p><p>While the two of them were exchanging questions and answers in low voices.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>As the divination spiritual formation was activated, the spiritual power of all the top-grade and superior-grade spiritual children began to surge out.</p><p></p><p>The first to turn into blue smoke and burst out were the fifteen top-grade spiritual children, and after about five or six breaths, it was the turn of the superior-grade spiritual children! Their spiritual power turned into purple smoke columns, constantly rising, as if being drawn by the mushroom-shaped umbrella, like tender bamboo splashed with rain after a storm, climbing higher and higher! However...</p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on the fifteen top-grade spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>Even among the top-grade spiritual children, there was a distinction in their talents!</p><p></p><p>Taking the lead was Haichao Sheng!</p><p></p><p>The purple smoke column grew extremely fast, soaring straight up, in a moment it had exceeded ten feet!</p><p></p><p>Closely following was Gongyangxiu, and then Huang Sixiang...</p><p></p><p>Xixia's face was flushed, blinking her big eyes, looking at the purple smoke column rising from her head.</p><p></p><p>She was ranked sixth among the fifteen top-grade spiritual children, belonging to the middle-upper level.</p><p></p><p>Haichao Sheng looked at his purple smoke column growing the fastest, and a smile of satisfaction appeared on his lips, of course, he overwhelmed everything! What Xixia, what Huang Sixiang, what Gongyangxiu...</p><p></p><p>They were nothing!</p><p></p><p>Haichao Sheng was able to obtain the treasure of his family's venerable ancestor, who was unwilling to take it out, a genius!</p><p></p><p>When the spiritual power columns of the various top-grade spiritual children reached nearly fifty feet, the speed of further rising began to slow down.</p><p></p><p>Some of the top-grade spiritual children could not continue to rise, getting stuck below fifty feet.</p><p></p><p>Haichao Sheng's purple spiritual power column directly broke through fifty feet, unstoppable, continuing to rise! Next, Huang Sixiang, Gongyangxiu, Gong Yuanliang, Shangguan Qinglei and others also followed closely, breaking through fifty feet, and getting the grade A score.</p><p></p><p>But how high they would ultimately stop, still depended on the final situation!</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire's purple spiritual power column stopped at fifty-nine feet.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang reached sixty-five feet, Huang Sixiang reached sixty-nine feet.</p><p></p><p>Gongyangxiu's purple spiritual power column also stopped growing, staying at the seventy-two feet position, still some distance from the hundred-foot umbrella top.</p><p></p><p>Haichao Sheng's purple spiritual power column was still growing.</p><p></p><p>But the look of satisfaction on his face gradually disappeared, becoming more solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because, not far from him, there was another purple spiritual power column, slowly rising! Although slow, but steady...</p><p></p><p>Haichao Sheng turned his head to look, his eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>It was that little fireworks girl! How could it be possible? At first, Xixia's purple spiritual power column rose so slowly, slower than Gongyangxiu and Gong Yuanliang, how could she catch up?</p><p></p><p>The other top-grade spiritual children also noticed this scene, staring wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>The two spiritual power columns rose like cranes among chickens!</p><p></p><p>Not yet stopped, still rising!

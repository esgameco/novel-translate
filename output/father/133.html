        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You actually want to kill me?!" </p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes widened, but there was no fear in her gaze, only excitement.</p><p></p><p>Her small figure stood there, and a terrifying pressure suddenly burst forth from her body.</p><p></p><p>On her shoulders, the small butterfly that had looked like a tattoo earlier now came alive, spreading its wings and flapping them, like an angry tiger breathing.</p><p></p><p>On the arena.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was startled, feeling a sense of suffocation wash over him.</p><p></p><p>He was discovered? </p><p></p><p>Was this little brat's perception so sharp?</p><p></p><p>And what was that butterfly? It was only now that Shangguan Qinglei noticed the butterfly on Xixia's shoulder, and it gave him a shudder of terror, the oppressive aura pressing down on him, making it hard for him to even breathe.</p><p></p><p>He immediately turned to Zhang Qingzheng: "Elder! Disqualification!"</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi is actually using a spiritual beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Foul play!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng frowned, his dead fish eyes staring intently at Shangguan Qinglei, causing the latter to break out in a cold sweat as he thought of Zhang Qingzheng's fondness for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>However, on the arena, Xixia's laughter rang out. </p><p></p><p>"Little Huhu, go play over there, let me handle this alone!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was full of vigor, with the excitement of a coming fight.</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, Li Che was speechless, letting her have the experience all to herself? He narrowed his eyes, arms crossed, but he remained vigilant, watching intently.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was burning with the intent to kill, not knowing what tricks he had up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>If he really had some real skills and ended up hurting Xixia, Li Che would be heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>However, as a Sage Cultivator, Zhang Qingzheng should be able to ensure the safety of these two children.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>On the arena.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly spirit beast called "Little Huhu" reluctantly flapped its wings and flew away, landing on the wooden post at the edge of the arena, quietly like a blooming flower.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the arena, Xixia's chubby face twitched as she stared at Shangguan Qinglei, the latter's murderous intent causing her blood to boil, the purple snake divine markings on her arms trembling slightly, emanating heat.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei stared at Xixia, without the spirit beast, not using any mechanisms, perhaps... he could seize the opportunity!</p><p></p><p>He knew this arena challenge was under the watchful eyes of many, with Sage Cultivators observing.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Shangguan Qinglei let out a roar, the pain of losing his father combined with the cold indifference he had faced, igniting a raging tempest in his heart! He stomped his foot on the ground, and the pure qi from his bulging muscles burst forth, creating ripples on the arena floor!</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to explode forward, a small figure "whooshed" to his side.</p><p></p><p>Fast! Too fast! It was not just the speed, but also...</p><p></p><p>This brat had actually advanced from Tempering Marrow to the threshold of Blood Transformation in just one month!</p><p></p><p>Xixia's afterimage slowly dissipated, and Shangguan Qinglei felt an overwhelming killing intent! Yes...</p><p></p><p>It was killing intent! Li Nuanxi... also wanted to kill him! Shangguan Qinglei's eyes narrowed, his long legs suddenly lashing out, grabbing a long sword that exuded a potent spiritual aura. That was... a Seven-Element Divine Weapon! Shangguan Qinglei had actually brought out a Seven-Element Divine Weapon, a treasure so rare that even the Five Great Families would possess only one or two at most! </p><p></p><p>The moment the sword was unsheathed, the sharp sword qi roared and surged, creating an intense gale.</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, Gong Yanxiang, Gongyang Xiu, and others were horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, be careful!" </p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu anxiously called out.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yanxiang also immediately shouted a warning.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng stood with his hands behind his back, his brow furrowed, but he did not act immediately.</p><p></p><p>In the stands, Zhang Ya tightly gripped Li Che's arm, "Ah! My lord, how can he use a divine weapon? Not allowing Xixia to use a spirit beast or mechanisms, and yet he uses a Seven-Element Divine Weapon! How shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was terrified.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow also furrowed, but he was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>If Shangguan Qinglei's trump card was just the Seven-Element Divine Weapon...</p><p></p><p>Then he was doomed.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine weapons...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che, as the doting father, could not surpass Xixia.</p><p></p><p>That girl, she was hiding a great terror!</p><p></p><p>Even if not counting the Fire Spear, just the Seven-Element Divine Weapon 'Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring' bestowed by the Sect Master as a reward, it would not put Xixia in a weak position against divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Qinglei actually used a Seven-Element Divine Weapon, did he plan this all along..."</p><p></p><p>A glint of ruthlessness flashed in Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the arena.</p><p></p><p>With Shangguan Qinglei summoning the Seven-Element Divine Weapon, his aura soared, and he became crazed, his dark hair flying, staring at Xixia's petite figure with murderous intent. "Die!"</p><p></p><p>A shrill cry, and the Seven-Element Divine Sword in his hand swiftly slashed towards Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia narrowed her eyes, not feeling the slightest pressure from the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>With a tilt of her neck, a golden circular ring suddenly roared to life, bursting forth with dazzling golden light.</p><p></p><p>It was her Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring, which she thrust forward, colliding with the precious sword! Clang!</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, and although the two children could not fully unleash the power of the Seven-Element Divine Weapons, the sheer destructive quality of the divine weapons alone was extremely perilous, the spiritual energies clashing and erupting with terrifying impact and oppression.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's body trembled slightly, but her eyes shone even brighter with excitement.</p><p></p><p>As for Shangguan Qinglei, his whole body shook, the grip on the sword splitting his palms, blood spraying out.</p><p></p><p>He glared at Xixia gripping the Golden Vajra Ring, his fury, resentment, and murderous intent surging.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of spiritual energies were in disarray! He wanted to use his ferocity to intimidate Xixia, and then regain control of the situation and suppress her.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia was not afraid at all, in fact, her cruelty even exceeded Shangguan Qinglei's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was the little darling who had followed her Niuiu teacher to wipe out an entire family since the age of three, after all.</p><p></p><p>You can't be more vicious than my Niuiu teacher! The Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring had blocked Shangguan Qinglei's Seven-Element Divine Sword, and Xixia directly closed the distance.</p><p></p><p>Clenching her fingers, White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist!</p><p></p><p>The grandmaster-level White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, with the illusory image of a white tiger emerging, although not yet at the Transformation Realm, was already quite formidable!</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Shangguan Qinglei was completely overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was cultivation, mastery of martial arts, or divine weapons, he was suppressed by Xixia!</p><p></p><p>How could he win? Shangguan Qinglei's eyes suddenly turned red, and he slapped his own chest.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>A strange wooden figurine the size of a thumb suddenly emerged from his throat! "Die!"</p><p></p><p>With the wooden figurine expelled, Shangguan Qinglei's gaze turned bloodshot to the extreme, as if he had lost all reason, completely controlled by the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly bit down.</p><p></p><p>With great force!</p><p></p><p>The wooden figurine was instantly crushed by his bite!</p><p></p><p>A dense and potent aura of death and decay burst forth from the wooden figurine!</p><p></p><p>"Insolence!"</p><p></p><p>From the arena below.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar echoed, causing everyone's ears to ring.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura of position pressure, like a collapsing mountain, pressed down heavily, almost suffocating everyone's mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>The moment the wooden figurine released the aura of death and decay, Zhang Qingzheng reacted immediately, unleashing the Sage Cultivator's pressure to freeze the space! Not only that, the distant spectator Zhu Hongdou also erupted in furious rage.</p><p></p><p>The position pressure of the two Sage Cultivators simultaneously exploding was almost suffocating, leaving all the outer disciples, inner disciples, and true disciples in the area frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Qinglei did not care, laughing maniacally. His father was dead, what else did he have to worry about? "Die, Li Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>"Die together!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was covered in bloody saliva, completely insane. A genius? </p><p></p><p>What right did a lowborn brat like you have to become a genius?!</p><p></p><p>The crushed wooden figurine had transformed the aura of death and decay into a pale, ghostly hand, like a demonic claw from the underworld, emerging from the darkness! This claw...</p><p></p><p>It even ignored the position pressure of the Sage Cultivators!</p><p></p><p>He was indeed well-prepared!</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, Li Che's eyes instantly turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Demon Sect! It was the Corpse Demon Sect again! That wooden figurine was too familiar, the one Cao He had wielded in Feilong City, containing a powerful Corpse Curse Seal! The wooden figurine Shangguan Qinglei carried now also contained a Corpse Curse Seal at the Seven-Element level!</p><p></p><p>He had hidden the wooden figurine in his abdomen, using his qi and spiritual energy to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che had not noticed the anomaly at first.</p><p></p><p>When Shangguan Qinglei expelled the wooden figurine, Li Che immediately sensed the problem.</p><p></p><p>"A Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal!"</p><p></p><p>"He's trying to destroy Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was filled with raging fury.</p><p></p><p>Once this Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal invaded Xixia's body, even Sect Master Nanliehuo would have to expend tremendous effort to suppress and contain it! In sensing the aura, Li Che was faster than Zhang Qingzheng and Zhu Hongdou.</p><p></p><p>The moment he sensed it,</p><p></p><p>The 'Chess Saint' Dao Fruit in his chest began to pulsate violently!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixia also sensed the dense aura of death and decay, seeing the white bone hand that emerged from the crushed wooden figurine. It felt like a freezing chill, making her whole body feel numb.</p><p></p><p>However, the purple snake divine markings on her arm suddenly burst forth with heat, sweeping through her body and dispelling the numbing cold.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Xixia's Nirvana Inner Realm,</p><p></p><p>A white chess piece shot out at an incredible speed.</p><p></p><p>The moment the white chess piece was launched, it collided with the white bone hand! As if the space was collapsing, a powerful distorting force seemed to twist and swallow the space in front of Xixia...</p><p></p><p>The ominous white bone hand, before it could even grab Xixia, was devoured and disappeared by the mysterious and invisible power!</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes suddenly lit up! "Niuiu teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia sensed the familiar aura and became emboldened, and with the help of the purple snake divine markings, she was able to dispel all the pressure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xixia's courage and ferocity were stronger than ever before! She surged forward, taking a heavy step, then twisting her body, White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist! It was as if a white tiger roared and charged at the frozen Shangguan Qinglei.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was coughing up blood in midair, his bones shattering one by one! </p><p></p><p>The sound was like popping beans, echoing continuously!</p><p></p><p>Xixia had been frightened by the white bone hand, and her heart was filled with grievance.</p><p></p><p>Before Shangguan Qinglei even hit the ground, Xixia approached him again, her chubby hands grabbing his body and swinging him around on the arena like a burlap sack.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you scare me, how dare you scare me!"</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom -</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force made the arena tremble, Shangguan Qinglei's entire body was completely crushed, and he had already fallen unconscious.</p><p></p><p>If Xixia had continued to use him as a bat for a few more swings, he might have even died.</p><p></p><p>However, Xixia was not able to swing him around much more.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhang Qingzheng and Zhu Hongdou appeared at the same time, calming the furious Xixia who was on the verge of going berserk.</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, Li Che gravely suppressed the "Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal" within the 'Chess Saint' Dao Fruit, and he also seemed to have snapped out of his daze, rushing onto the arena, pulling Zhang Ya, his face a mix of shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhang Ya, Xixia immediately burrowed into her embrace, aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, Xixia was so scared, it was so terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes were brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>However, this was quite true, that Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal manifested as the white bone claw had indeed frightened Xixia, the momentary freezing of her blood by the aura of death making her need to eat at least three bowls of braised pork to calm down.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, don't be afraid, Mother is here, Mother is here." Zhang Ya's face was pale, her body trembling with lingering fear as she hugged Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was grim, his fists clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng and Zhu Hongdou's powerful spiritual sense swept over the area for a long time before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Sang Guanyin also rushed over and appeared on the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, it was my negligence."</p><p></p><p>A look of ugliness and anger appeared on Sang Guanyin's beautiful and charming face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xixia was fine, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not respond to her, still with a gloomy face. Strictly speaking, such negligence was very serious, and Li Che would not be in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng and Zhu Hongdou, the two divine elder sages, also had unpleasant expressions, and their eyes were filled with dense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, that was... the imprint of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse. It is truly malicious!"</p><p></p><p>"This is an attempt to destroy Xixia, wanting to destroy my Jingang Division's prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng shook his head: "Not only that, once the imprint of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse is struck into Xixia's body, the Sect Master will not easily give up, and must exert all his efforts to suppress it."</p><p></p><p>"The imprint of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse, even if the Sect Master wants to suppress it, it is not easy, and it will require a lot of effort."</p><p></p><p>"The other party's purpose is obviously to destroy our Sect's prodigy while restraining the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master, who is at the peak of divine sage cultivation in the Jingang Palace City, once restrained, the Corpse Demon Sect may have a large-scale action to sweep across the entire city!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng narrowed his eyes, and the cold killing intent burst out from his dead fish eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Then, what about the corpse curse imprint?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng suddenly focused his gaze.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his puzzlement, there was also a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Because, even for him, the Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint of the Corpse Demon Sect could not be guaranteed to be intercepted in time, unless he used his physical body to resist it and draw the corpse curse imprint into his own body! Zhang Qingzheng had even planned to do so.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use his own body as a medium to bear the corpse curse imprint and protect Xixia!</p><p></p><p>However, the corpse curse imprint suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an extremely pure divine essence had burst out from Xixia's body and taken the corpse curse imprint away.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a method left by the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng suddenly thought, with a stern expression on his face, and let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhang, what is the meaning of all this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a gloomy face, and as a parent, he naturally had to make a statement and investigate the matter thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng looked at Li Che, and a rare look of guilt flashed in his dead fish eyes. He simply explained and took full responsibility for Xixia's near-death experience.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression softened considerably: "It's not Elder Zhang's fault... No one could have predicted this."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the Corpse Demon Sect would use a seven-year-old child, with the intention of mutual destruction, and use a divine wooden sculpture to bear the corpse curse imprint."</p><p></p><p>Li Che loosened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"But... Elder Zhang, this matter is too serious. After the incident with Shangguan Qinglei, there will be a second one. We as parents... find it hard to be at ease."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's expression was extremely serious. This matter was indeed a major event.</p><p></p><p>Since Shangguan Qinglei's father, Shangguan Zhenghen, died, he had never returned to the Shangguan family, and was restricted from traveling by the Divine Sect, for fear of contact with the Corpse Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>If Shangguan Qinglei had not returned to the Shangguan family, how did he have contact with the Corpse Demon Sect? </p><p></p><p>Perhaps, within the Divine Sect... there are also members of the Corpse Demon Sect in hiding! And their status is not low, as they bear the Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint!</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly and restore justice for Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>The killing intent that burst out from Zhang Qingzheng's teeth almost solidified into substance. As someone who has always acted upright and straightforward, he could not tolerate the existence of evil members of the Corpse Demon Sect within the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Under which Executor is Shangguan Qinglei?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Inner disciples cannot be apprenticed to elders, and can only be apprenticed to Executors. Like Li Qingshan, he belongs to the top-tier Executor, and not all Executors have their own mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan belongs to the top-tier powerhouses among the Executors, so he has a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Qinglei... seems to have been apprenticed to Sword Cloud Peak... Zhao Jianmian!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng and Zhu Hongdou exchanged a glance and nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sang Guanyin also spoke: "I need to report this to the Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>Xixia stayed with her parents, and with the two divine elder sages Zhu Hongdou and Zhang Qingzheng present, she felt safe and left to report to the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The commotion below continued for a while.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng came out to continue presiding over the event. He glanced at Shangguan Qinglei, who had been beaten half to death by Xixia, and a hint of disgust flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Shangguan Qinglei was bewitched, but without any thoughts, he would not have been bewitched.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, a divine essence fell on Shangguan Qinglei, helping him cling to life, and then he did not heal him further, but threw him to the sect's department responsible for healing injuries.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya, along with Xixia, left first. Gong Yuanxiang, Gong Yangshou, and others gathered around to inquire and comfort Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia showed a dazzling smile: "I'm fine, you all better not be like Shangguan Qinglei, or else I won't go easy on you!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia pinched her chubby little hands, acting like a big sister and threatening them.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanxiang and Gong Yangshou immediately nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Hai Chaosheng, Huang Sixiang, and others also looked over, and seeing that Xixia was fine, they also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After Xixia was safe, Zhang Ya's mood also relaxed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing the situation, she couldn't help but blink her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, Xixia's charm among the disciples of this generation in the Divine Sect... seems to be a bit high."</p><p></p><p>Li Che hugged Xixia, his expression indifferent: "A bunch of little brats, what do they know about charm."</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife pair, along with Xixia, left, and Zhu Hongdou followed, not returning to Jingang Peak, but going to Zhenglie Peak where Li Qingshan was.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya's couple had a residence on Zhenglie Peak.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the small courtyard halfway up Zhenglie Peak, Aunt Su was watering the flowers in the courtyard. Hearing the movement, she looked over and saw Li Che's couple carrying Xixia, with Zhu Hongdou the elder following behind, and she immediately understood that a major event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi also poked his head out of the courtyard, seeing the dejected-looking Xixia in Li Che's arms, his eyes immediately reddened.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, who bullied Xixia?!" </p><p></p><p>Lü Chi grabbed an angry Santatsu divine wooden sculpture and came rushing over.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at him, and Lü Chi immediately calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Su now leaned on her python-headed cane and walked over, asking about the situation.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che briefly explained the matter, Aunt Su was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"There has been such an incident within the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go call Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>Aunt Su tapped her python-headed cane and was about to get up.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already here."</p><p></p><p>However, before Aunt Su could get up, Li Qingshan's voice came, and a figure in blue robes swept into the courtyard from outside.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan patted Aunt Su's shoulder, then looked at Zhu Hongdou: "You and Old Zhang, the two divine sages, were watching, and yet such an incident still happened... How embarrassing!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou had a cold expression, and her mood was very bad: "I'm going to the Shangguan family to settle the score! I must get a reason from the Shangguan family!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou threw out a sentence and then transformed into a red cloud, rushing towards the direction of Jingang Palace City.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Xixia and found that she was in good spirits, not like someone who had been imprinted with the corpse curse, so he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He then gave Li Che a meaningful look.</p><p></p><p>The two of them left the house.</p><p></p><p>"That Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint... have you contained it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Qingshan, thought about it, and did not hide it, nodding.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan "hissed" and took a deep breath, his face twitching slightly.</p><p></p><p>That was a Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint, after all...</p><p></p><p>This kid, is he naturally a pure and holy body? Immune to curses?</p><p></p><p>He dares to suppress that Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint? "How do you feel now?" Li Qingshan asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently: "Don't worry, I'm suppressing it... It won't cause any trouble for now, but I'll have to find a place to erase this corpse curse imprint, which may take a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Normal... After all, it's a Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint. Even if a divine sage elder is infected, it will be extremely troublesome, as this is the power of a divine sage level."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then he narrowed his eyes, and lightning arcs began to swirl around his body, with a surging killing intent: "They've finally revealed their true colors..."</p><p></p><p>"This incident must be the work of a hidden Corpse Demon Sect powerhouse within the Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"And the other party's status is not low, possessing a Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint. You mentioned before that you can't sense or investigate imprints above the Eight Extremes level, so the other party must have been imprinted with a Seven-Element Corpse Curse, which is why you couldn't detect it."</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Qinglei has been confined within the Divine Sect since his father, Shangguan Zhenghen, died, and the Shangguan family has also been investigated by the Judicial Department and the City Lord's Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>"At this juncture, even if it was really a Corpse Demon Sect member hidden within the Shangguan family, they couldn't have arranged it."</p><p></p><p>"I will investigate some of the people Shangguan Qinglei has been in contact with this month, and I should be able to infer who bewitched Shangguan Qinglei to act this way."</p><p></p><p>"A seven-year-old child, with an immature mind, and facing a major change in their family, is easily bewitched."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's indifferent voice came from the side.</p><p></p><p>"How will the Divine Sect deal with Shangguan Qinglei?"</p><p></p><p>The icy voice was filled with cold-blooded killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was taken aback and looked at Li Che: "The Divine Sect has its own rules and regulations... And Shangguan Qinglei is, after all, a scion of the Shangguan family, so he will most likely be detained and investigated, and a result will be given after the investigation is completed."</p><p></p><p>"But at the very least, Shangguan Qinglei's cultivation base is not to be expected."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Li Che's expression did not change much.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan furrowed his brows, what's not enough? Then Li Che changed the topic: "Peak Master, prepare a room for me where I won't be disturbed."</p><p></p><p>"Go to my Observation Spirit Sanctuary."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan directly said generously.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Li Che should be trying to refine the Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint, and this matter was not small. If it were to explode, the impact would be greater.</p><p></p><p>Going to his sanctuary would be the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"No need, just find any room."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Now going to Li Qingshan's sanctuary would be a bit too obvious.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary room would be enough.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chessboard silently enveloped, able to seal off all investigations, and not a bit inferior to Li Qingshan's Observation Spirit Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>Li Che first returned to the house and explained the situation to his wife and daughter, then went to the ordinary room arranged by Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Xixia stayed on Zhenglie Peak, as it was safe here with Li Qingshan around. Even if there were divine sage powerhouses attacking, Li Qingshan could hold out until Sect Master Nanlihuo's support arrived, so Zhenglie Peak was very secure.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered the room with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chessboard silently expanded.</p><p></p><p>The world became quiet in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged on the cushion, his eyelids slightly lowered.</p><p></p><p>This time, if he had not quickly sensed it and used the Flying Thunder Chess Piece to draw and resist that corpse curse imprint, Xixia would have been imprinted, and even though she would not be in danger with him around, she would still have to endure the pain of extracting the corpse curse imprint.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Qinglei's desire to harm Xixia was so strong, how could Li Che let him live?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sect has its own rules and regulations.</p><p></p><p>But he, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Also has his own rules! Those who wish to harm my daughter...</p><p></p><p>Die! Li Che suddenly opened his eyes, and the Flying Thunder Chess Piece he had previously left on Shangguan Qinglei was suddenly gripped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Flying Thunder Relocation!</p><p></p><p>In the quiet infirmary.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei had regained consciousness. He opened his eyes, lying on the bed, his entire body broken and without any sense of perception. He stared at the ceiling, his eyes lifeless.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his future was over.</p><p></p><p>His action had failed, and that person... would definitely not come to save him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>His eyes began to waver.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to the side, and his pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a person appear out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>That familiar face made the seven-year-old Shangguan Qinglei's whole body tremble violently...</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth, as if seeing something terribly frightening, wanting to scream and cry out.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Poof...</p><p></p><p>His head was twisted off.</p><p></p><p>7,000 words chapter, please vote for monthly tickets, recommend tickets, and continue to support the reading!

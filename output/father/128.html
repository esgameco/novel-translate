        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sound of the explosion pierced through the air, after the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Seed bullet had penetrated Shangguan Zhenghen's body, it rolled in with a deafening roar!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying and oppressive feeling had already permeated the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Four divine auras intertwined, mixed with the temple deity's divine power, forming a five-colored divine light! Even Li Qingshan could not help but have his hair stand on end!</p><p></p><p>Too fast! It gave an extremely strong sense of crisis! That speed, the sound could not keep up, once locked on, the danger was extreme!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Dragon Tooth Bodhi Seed bullet that had pierced into Shangguan Zhenghen's body exploded, turning into thousands upon thousands of Bodhi threads.</p><p></p><p>The Bodhi threads tore off chunks of flesh and blood, curling into blood beads! They fell from Shangguan Zhenghen's body with a pitter-patter.</p><p></p><p>Bodhi tears of blood, falling like rain!</p><p></p><p>Even though Shangguan Zhenghen's head had already been smashed open by Li Qingshan's ram's horn hammer, the hidden weapon that had been shot into his body with extreme penetrating power, still tore away all his flesh and blood! "How ruthless, how deadly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"What a long-range assassination technique!"</p><p></p><p>"With the explosive power of this hidden weapon, even ordinary Eight Extremes Divine Archer masters would not be able to match it."</p><p></p><p>"It can even rival the extremely powerful Seven Element Divine Archer Lieutenants of the City God's Guard!"</p><p></p><p>Horse Face...</p><p></p><p>The friend of Ox Demon! Li Qingshan clenched the still dripping ram's horn hammer, looking towards the distant figure standing on the boat.</p><p></p><p>That figure was carrying a strange-looking mechanism in their hands, not a bow nor a crossbow, but it was this mechanism that, from hundreds of yards away, had rolled like thunderous lightning, killing the Enchanted Copper Corpse Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Zhenghen's Enchanted Copper Corpse was only barely at the entry level, its hardness was not comparable to the Enchanted Copper Corpses that had been refined for many years.</p><p></p><p>But once it entered the ranks of the Enchanted Copper Corpse, no matter its defense, strength or toughness, it would increase tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had hammered Shangguan Zhenghen many times, but was unable to kill him or break through the defense of the Enchanted Copper Corpse.</p><p></p><p>Yet that Horse Face's distant shot had pierced through Shangguan Zhenghen's Enchanted Copper Corpse body!</p><p></p><p>Although it could not achieve a one-shot kill, after breaking the defense, the Enchanted Copper Corpse's defense was greatly weakened, allowing Li Qingshan to kill him with one hammer strike!</p><p></p><p>This was enough! "This hidden weapon that shot out should have fused the power of four divine bases, mixed with a temple deity's divine power..."</p><p></p><p>"Horse Face actually cultivated four divine natures, and even consolidated them into divine bases?!"</p><p></p><p>This was what shocked Li Qingshan the most.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating two divine natures, the repulsive force between them would be terrifyingly strong, suppressing the other divine nature within the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>If two divine natures were to be absorbed into the inner realm, it would only make the divine natures in the inner realm become chaotic, making the cultivation extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>It is already extremely difficult to forge a single divine base, let alone two divine bases! How did he do it? It was simply unbelievable! In the heavens above, the divine image's oppressive aura also suddenly weakened, with Shangguan Zhenghen's death, the target protected by the old ancestor of the Shangguan family's divine image power had been lost, so it automatically retreated, returning to the old ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu, wearing a peacock mask, floated down.</p><p></p><p>The obstacle he faced was only the divine image wooden sculpture of the Shangguan old ancestor, he had no pressure at all, and even had the spare energy to observe the situation around.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had noticed the situation on Shangguan Qinghong's side, and had originally planned to lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>But Horse Face made a move, so Lin Xiu did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>And the series of operations that Horse Face carried out afterwards, even this divine image cultivator, was amazed and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is a mechanism technique, isn't it... truly terrifying penetrating power, and the killing is also extremely ruthless and deadly, once shot through the flesh, that mechanism exploding will tear away all the flesh and blood..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit like the 'Bodhi Tears of Blood' in the Tang Clan's mechanism techniques! But it's obviously an improved version."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, landing beside Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Shangguan Zhenghen's ghastly corpse, his eyes instantly hardening.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu pushed the nearly slipping peacock mask, nodding: "This Horse Face is extraordinary, cultivating four divine bases, perhaps he has a unique talent in his inner realm... able to accommodate multiple divine natures."</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Treasures Divine Sect of the Dragon Abyss Dao has a method of cultivating multiple divine natures simultaneously! But the difficulty is extremely high, and it takes a lot of time and effort, even within the Seven Treasures Divine Sect's inner circle, there are few disciples who go to cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"Although the combination of multiple divine natures can form an extremely terrifying explosion, the problem is..."</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult to succeed, and even more difficult to reach a high realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The further you go, the more difficult it becomes, four divine bases, wanting to break through the divine image... must first condense four illusory images, and then cross the barrier of the illusory image and the divine image at the same time, observing the divine and condensing the four illusory images!"</p><p></p><p>"If one of them is not successful, it will cause the balance of the inner realm to be broken, and then there will be mutual repulsion between the divine images, at best the cultivation will retreat slightly, at worst... the inner realm will collapse, the divine consciousness will be extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>"And without becoming a divine image, cultivating multiple divine bases, although the combat power will be enhanced, when facing the oppressive aura of a higher realm... it will still be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating multiple divine natures is laborious and unrewarding."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu was after all Shangguan Qinghong's teacher, equally erudite and talented.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Treasures Divine Sect of the Dragon Abyss Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had of course heard of the name of the Seven Treasures Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Even among the eleven major divine sects in the Great Scenery, it ranked higher than the Qian Yuan Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the Patriarch of the Seven Treasures Divine Sect had a Hundred Treasures Heavenly Pouch, containing more than a thousand divine weapons, not low in quality, and he alone wielded more than two hands' worth of the Four Divine Weapons!</p><p></p><p>He was a true peak expert standing at the pinnacle of the Great Scenery's divine cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, every Divine Sect Patriarch was a person standing at the absolute peak of divine cultivation in the Great Scenery!</p><p></p><p>"Could this Ox Demon's friend Horse Face be from the Seven Treasures Divine Sect of the Dragon Abyss Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his head: "I don't know, originally... I thought this Horse Face was just an excuse made up by Ox Demon, and Ox Demon was Horse Face himself."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems, Ox Demon is Ox Demon, and Horse Face is Horse Face..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon really has a friend... Horse Face."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the boat.</p><p></p><p>The four divine bases slowly retracted their inner realms, the terrifying might gradually dissipating without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong slumped on the boat, her long legs trembling uncontrollably...</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The divine aura released by the four divine bases was no weaker than the oppressive aura of an Illusory Image cultivator! For Shangguan Qinghong, the oppressive feeling was too strong, even breathing had become a luxury.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was panting heavily, drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>But there was no fear in her eyes, only a trace of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Because she saw the fireworks shot out by Horse Face, directly piercing through the Enchanted Copper Corpse, the flesh and blood unparalleled, impervious to fire and water, Shangguan Zhenghen!</p><p></p><p>This shot was crucial, directly cutting off Shangguan Zhenghen's hope of escape!</p><p></p><p>It broke Shangguan Zhenghen's defense, and then he was killed by Li Qingshan's hammer strike!</p><p></p><p>It can be said that without Horse Face's shot, if Shangguan Zhenghen had made it to shore, and the commotion had started, he would have basically escaped with his life.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong never expected that there would be so many experts coming to kill Shangguan Zhenghen tonight.</p><p></p><p>She could only say that Shangguan Zhenghen had finally received his just retribution!</p><p></p><p>Scorching hot tears suddenly spilled from Shangguan Qinghong's eyes, blurring the scene before her.</p><p></p><p>"Mother - your grudge, has finally been avenged!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong directly lay down in the boat, letting the boat rock and sway, she began to wail and cry loudly.</p><p></p><p>She cried for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shangguan Qinghong thought of something.</p><p></p><p>She abruptly sat up, using both her left and right hands to wipe away the tears, trying to find that Horse Face hundreds of yards away who had directly shot through Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>But there was no longer a trace of Horse Face's figure.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was immediately dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Horse Face..."</p><p></p><p>"I will remember you!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shangguan Qinghong raised her beautiful face, clenching her fists, her gaze resolute.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom! A sonic boom erupted, Li Yue had used the Flying Thunder Chess Piece to shift his position, and immediately changed into the Ox Demon attire, bursting out from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The speed was extremely fast, bouncing a few times on the surface of the river, arriving beside Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>It was all done within less than a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu had not detected any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Loot the corpse, let's go."</p><p></p><p>"The old ancestor of the Shangguan family's divine image power has returned, he must have already sensed it, we need to speed up, eliminate Shangguan Leiyong and Shangguan Yunlong as well!"</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, we must make the ones who have defected to the Corpse God Sect bleed! Make them fear, dread!"</p><p></p><p>A ruthless light flashed in Li Qingshan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon-masked Li Yue did not say much, silently crouching down, expertly looting Shangguan Zhenghen's body.</p><p></p><p>While also completely absorbing his divine natures.</p><p></p><p>The【Chess Saint】Dao Fruit trembled slightly, and in an instant, the death qi on Shangguan Zhenghen's Enchanted Copper Corpse flesh was all extracted, turning into numerous chess pieces emitting gray mist on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The spoils can be divided, but the divine nature chess pieces belonging to Shangguan Zhenghen... should not be divided, right?</p><p></p><p>What delighted Li Yue the most was that the divine nature Shangguan Zhenghen cultivated was the Dread Divine Nature, precisely the one he was lacking.</p><p></p><p>The divine bases he still needed were the Worry Divine Base and the Dread Divine Base.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had obtained one, it was quite good.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the resources in the Prefecture City were much more than in the Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's speed of absorbing the divine natures was very fast, with just a swipe of his hand, the Thousand Slivers Hands had completed the absorption.</p><p></p><p>Even a divine image cultivator like Lin Xiu did not notice.</p><p></p><p>The divine image cultivators' divine sense may be powerful, but there are still gaps, after all, there are high and low levels of the divine image realm.</p><p></p><p>"Done looting?"</p><p></p><p>"After dealing with the other two, we'll divide it together."</p><p></p><p>"This time, we have to thank your friend Horse Face."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The burly Ox Demon figure remained silent, nodding, and collected Shangguan Zhenghen's Heavenly Pouch.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the three of them turned into black lines, speeding away into the night.</p><p></p><p>On the Cloud Fragrance Boat.</p><p></p><p>The commotion caused by Shangguan Zhenghen's death could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many people in the Cloud Fragrance Boat had noticed it.</p><p></p><p>Liuhe of the Heavenly Divination Bureau was drinking with a few fox friends, and after hearing the commotion, he went to the window, standing in the window of the Cloud Fragrance Boat, watching this dazzling battle with eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>Liuhe's body trembled slightly, pushing away the beautiful person in white glowing beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The Prefecture City... this is going to change the tide..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There was a curfew in the Prefecture City, at night the city gates would close, no longer allowing entry or exit.</p><p></p><p>But there are always exceptions.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a rumbling sound, the city gates of the Prefecture City slowly closed.</p><p></p><p>But where there is closure, there is also opening, the opening of the Prefecture City was to provide convenience.</p><p></p><p>Two horse carriages, simultaneously returning from outside the city, the wheels turning, slowly driving on the wide road of the Prefecture City, wide enough to accommodate ten carriages side by side.</p><p></p><p>Each carriage had a figure seated within.</p><p></p><p>The city guards did not obstruct them, instead providing convenience, because these two carriages were from the Shangguan family.</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan family was one of the five great families of the Prefecture City, with countless threads connecting them to the Prefecture City, naturally they would be given some convenience.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Leiyong and Shangguan Yunlong, eyes closed in the carriage, in sync with the rocking of the carriage, the two of them had almost simultaneously stopped their movements.</p><p></p><p>Completing the refinement of the death qi into the Condensed Martial Elixir.</p><p></p><p>A trace of bewilderment appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the bewilderment instantly turned into grave concern and terror! Boom! Boom!! The carriage compartments of the two luxurious carriages exploded almost simultaneously, billowing smoke and ash like raging dragons!</p><p></p><p>The dispersing airflow, emptying and surging outwards.</p><p></p><p>The two carriage drivers, frightened, directly fell off the carriages.</p><p></p><p>But the two masters in the carriages released powerful illusory image auras, roaring as they shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies erupted with the gray copper color of the transition from Enchanted Iron Corpse to Enchanted Copper Corpse.</p><p></p><p>Their elegant robes fluttering, a look of terror in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>The congealed blood, the trembling heart and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly telling them,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a powerful figure with a divine appearance who struck at them! Boom! Sure enough, as they looked up, they saw the dark clouds dispersing, and the moonlight shining down.</p><p></p><p>They saw a white-robed figure with a half-peacock mask, standing in the air with hands behind his back, looking down at the two of them. Behind him stood a lifelike divine statue, as if carved by the divine hands of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"You two... Surely you still have the divine statue wood carving of the old ghost Shangguan?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>His words echoed through the sky.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he stamped his foot heavily.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the stars were falling, with countless stars rushing to cleanse the mortal realm! The overwhelming pressure swept over Shangguan Leilong and Shangguan Yunlong, causing their soaring figures to suddenly crash to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The two of them coughed up fresh blood, their eyes filled with fury!</p><p></p><p>"Lin Xiu! Have you gone mad?!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Leilong roared, but his illusory divine nature could not be expanded, suppressed tightly by Lin Xiu's true divine power, unable to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>The illusory and the divine, there was ultimately a gap between the false and the real! Lin Xiu, however, was too lazy to say more, and slapped down from the sky, gathering countless divine energies into a giant palm, ruthlessly slamming down.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of the Shangguan patriarch's divine statue wood carving, the two of them were no match for Lin Xiu. The illusory divine could only withstand a few moves against the divine, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>Compared to killing Shangguan Zhenghen, it was far easier.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a ram's horn hammer shot out from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Countless thunderbolts intertwined and spread, as if moving centered on the ram's horn hammer, ruthlessly slamming down, striking Shangguan Leilong and Shangguan Yunlong to bloody again!</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the distant sky, in the direction of the Shangguan family.</p><p></p><p>An extremely angry roar burst open, a terrifying divine phantom, emanating a gloomy and blue-green glow, coalescing and outlining an ancient divine form.</p><p></p><p>The divine being opened its mouth and roared furiously!</p><p></p><p>"Lin Xiu!!!"</p><p></p><p>That was the Shangguan family's patriarch, who, upon sensing the divine statue wood carving he had bestowed upon Shangguan Zhenghen shattered, and the divine power being struck back, had to emerge from his seclusion! However.</p><p></p><p>Too late.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu struck again, his figure instantly vanishing without a trace, and reappearing beside Shangguan Leilong.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan swung his hammer to kill Yunlong, while Lin Xiu directly executed Leilong.</p><p></p><p>Their Curse Iron Corpse cultivation was ultimately no match for Shangguan Zhenghen's Curse Copper Corpse, and they were killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan skillfully took their Spatial Jade and divine weapons, and simply fled.</p><p></p><p>The tacit cooperation between Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan obviously showed that they had done such deeds many times when wandering the rivers and lakes in the past.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue, wearing a Ox Demon mask, hid in the darkness and did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>He had provided the information, confirming that Shangguan Leilong and Yunlong had been granted the Corpse Curse Seal of the Corpse Deity Sect, which was enough to reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan also had no intention of letting him intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Ox Demon were to intervene...</p><p></p><p>The price would be higher.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine nature of Shangguan Leilong and Yunlong, it was not too much of a pity either, as the two of them had cultivated the Terrifying Divine Nature, and Shangguan Zhenghen's divine nature alone was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan left after the killings,</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon also gradually disappeared into the darkness, silently vanishing.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, he only appeared briefly when looting Shangguan Zhenghen's body.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan left,</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, almost making the surrounding houses' black tiles tremble, aura descended with a boom.</p><p></p><p>White-haired and white, like flowing white seaweed.</p><p></p><p>It was the Shangguan family's patriarch, Shangguan Jie!</p><p></p><p>"Well done, Lin Xiu, well done, Li Qingshan! The Astrological Observatory! The Golden Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie's eyes were like two blazing suns, the ultimate brilliance of his divine nature, the heat it released, almost making the surrounding air boil.</p><p></p><p>"You old scoundrel of the Shangguan family, just look at what your descendants have cultivated?"</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen has already succeeded in cultivating the Curse Copper Corpse, causing countless deaths, and Shangguan Leilong and Shangguan Yunlong are also in the process of transforming from Curse Iron Corpse to Curse Copper Corpse..."</p><p></p><p>"Your Shangguan family's involvement with the Corpse Deity Sect, what is your intention?!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the intention?!"</p><p></p><p>"What intention—!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu's figure had disappeared, but his overwhelming divine power echoed and reverberated in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie's entire body creaked and crackled, his surging blood and qi burning the void, his eyes filled with towering killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"But that is not a reason for you, Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan, to kill them at will!"</p><p></p><p>"You, Lin Xiu, are the Deputy Supervisor of the Astrological Observatory, yet you have exercised the power of the Temple Guardian Sect to kill people! Do you still have the Divine Guard Army, the Prefectural Lord's Mansion, the Prefectural Lord?"</p><p></p><p>However, there was no response around.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu was too lazy to argue with the old scoundrel, killed and fled, already gone.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan family patriarch, Shangguan Jie, was furious.</p><p></p><p>He laughed towards the sky, and the ground around him suddenly erupted in white dust clouds, like dragons.</p><p></p><p>His figure soared into the sky, wrapped in the dust clouds, rushing towards the Astrological Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Cliff Stone Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Astrological Observatory tower stood there.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the shattered stones pierced the sky, and the surging waves pounded the shore.</p><p></p><p>The flow of the Nine Dragon River City suddenly boiled, as if driven by the angry emotions, roaring furiously, raising layer upon layer of waves, crashing violently against the shore!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie's murderous aura rolled in, causing the river water to surge.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the void, as if four figures had awakened, they opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were the other four patriarchs of the Five Great Families, manifesting their presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five divine aura presences, like five pillars of light descended from the sky, hovering in front of the Astrological Observatory Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Making the Treasure Pavilion appear to be on the verge of collapse, as if it would be destroyed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The five family divine statue patriarchs were all renowned old divine statues, the weakest of them being at the Divine Statue Intermediate Realm, their might formidable.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Shangguan patriarch, a divine statue wood carving could block Lin Xiu, because in terms of realm, Shangguan Jie was higher than the Divine Statue Initial Realm Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... The Five Great Families standing together, is this simultaneous pressure on my Astrological Observatory?"</p><p></p><p>"The Shangguan family's collusion with the Corpse Deity Sect, Shangguan Zhenghen's cultivation of the Curse Copper Corpse, Shangguan Yunlong and Shangguan Leilong's cultivation of the Curse Iron Corpse, has harmed the Heavenly Dao, deserving of death..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I bring it to the Divine Capital, and argue before the Divine Emperor, I, Lin Xiu, the Deputy Supervisor of the Astrological Observatory of the Golden Light Prefecture, am eliminating the harmful and relieving the nation!"</p><p></p><p>"Not only am I not guilty, but I may even be rewarded by the court, don't you believe it?"</p><p></p><p>A calm voice suddenly resounded from the Astrological Observatory Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The turbulent waves subsided and everything became calm.</p><p></p><p>The pairs of eyes lurking in the dark fell silent and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Corpse Deity Sect's actions were something the court detested, and the Corpse Deity Sect had even incited a rebellion in Jiezhou, so the court would naturally stand with Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>On the top of the Astrological Observatory Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>An old man wearing a faded blue cloth robe, sat quietly on a small bamboo and wood stool, holding a two-stringed instrument, gently plucking the strings a few times, and the heavens and earth fell into sudden silence.</p><p></p><p>"Supervisor!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie lowered his voice, his anger accumulating in his chest, unable to express it.</p><p></p><p>However, the old man plucked the strings again, and in an instant, the divine power in the heavens and earth was drained away.</p><p></p><p>"Colluding with the Corpse Deity Sect, deserving of death, and you still dare to come and mourn before this old man?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and leave?!"</p><p></p><p>"Scram!!!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice, bursting out of nowhere! Shangguan Jie's face turned slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>The other four family patriarchs sighed and gradually dissipated and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie was left isolated, clenching his fists.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the divine power in the heavens and earth being drained away in an instant, he felt a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he released his palms and disappeared into the darkness like a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>The storm had dissipated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>On the tower top.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the two-stringed instrument echoed.</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded and swayed, with a theatrical tone in his throat.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he laughed.</p><p></p><p>"This Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan... How many years has it been, how old are they now, and they still need this half-buried old thing to clean up their mess."</p><p></p><p>After laughing for a while, the sound of the strings suddenly stagnated.</p><p></p><p>The old man suddenly turned his head.</p><p></p><p>Towards the direction of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, a rift had opened, and a golden light pillar descended, falling on the peak of the Golden Light Mountain.</p><p></p><p>A semi-transparent ripple dozens of meters in diameter spread out from the peak.</p><p></p><p>"The deity in the Golden Light Mountain temple has awakened?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the deity imparting the Dharma?"</p><p></p><p>"The three-year-old girl newly accepted by South离Fire... Is she actually able to open the divine gate of the Heaven King Tower?!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dark little courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Three figures almost simultaneously appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu, Li Qingshan, and the figure wrapped in a straw hat and black robe, the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>A low chuckle soon came from Li Qingshan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Great!"</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen deserved to die, colluding with the Corpse Deity Sect, no loss!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan swung the ram's horn hammer in his hand and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I should go back and get scolded, I've gotten into trouble with you again, the Supervisor must be ready to scold me to death."</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of, it's not the first time you've been scolded, all those years when we did so many things, didn't the Supervisor cover for us?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, what we did today was not an evil deed, but a great deed, beheading the Curse Copper Corpse and Curse Iron Corpse villains of the Corpse Deity Sect, even the Temple Guardian Sect Superintendent will have to serve us tea with a smile!"</p><p></p><p>"Screw off, I'm not drinking their tea!"</p><p></p><p>"After tonight, those who colluded with the Corpse Deity Sect might behave a little better, but our next move will be even harder to find the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>It's been a long time since it's been this exciting.</p><p></p><p>Tonight was worth it, even if he gets scolded a few times by the Supervisor on his return.</p><p></p><p>The Qingshuang team, back in action.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, now we have to add the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>The Qingshuang Ox Demon team?</p><p></p><p>"Let's divide the spoils."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu said.</p><p></p><p>After dividing the spoils, it was time to go back.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took Shangguan Yunlong's Spatial Jade, and tossed Shangguan Leilong's Spatial Jade to Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Let's divide it this way, Shangguan Zhenghen's Spatial Jade goes to the Ox Demon, you can split it with Ma Mian, Leilong and Yunlong's Spatial Jade, the two of us will keep."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue nodded without saying much.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's wealth was undoubtedly the most abundant.</p><p></p><p>And most cultivators have the habit of storing their wealth in their own Spatial Jade, after all, carrying it with them prevents it from being lost, unless they die.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue nodded and pocketed Shangguan Zhenghen's jade token.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's heart suddenly started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit in his chest cavity began to palpitate, the intensity of the palpitation was the strongest he had ever encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>Almost as if it wanted to burst out of his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Xixing?!"</p><p></p><p>The face under Li Yue's Ox Demon mask changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because the excited feedback from the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit was from the few flying thunder chess pieces placed on Xixing.</p><p></p><p>The trembling Chess Saint Dao Fruit, the heavenly and earthly chess board unfolded.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue suddenly sensed the dazzling golden light pillar on the Divine Sect's Golden Light Mountain...</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, there was a phantom of a treasure pagoda, actually appearing on the heavenly and earthly chess board!</p><p></p><p>Almost as if it was going to collapse and sink the chess board!</p><p></p><p>This kind of situation, he had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes narrowed...</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, what reassured Li Yue was that the feedback from the chess pieces did not indicate that Xixing was in danger.</p><p></p><p>But rather, the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit was extremely expectant, extremely eager.</p><p></p><p>More like...</p><p></p><p>There was a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the message transmitted back by the flying thunder chess pieces, that the opportunity was quite great, Xixing seemed to be unable to handle it...</p><p></p><p>Then as her old father, helping her eat a little bit, shouldn't be a problem, right?

        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ground was trembling, and countless dust particles rose up like rolling dark clouds in the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dark clouds, there were streaks of golden light roaring like angry electric snakes!</p><p></p><p>Sixteen Ox Demons, each wielding an enhanced divine Gatling gun forged by immortal craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>They were relentlessly bombarding with the spirit wood crows created by the "Immortal in the Painting" Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>This firepower coverage was so overwhelming that even the Void Appearance realm cultivators among the Golden Fragrance Institute would have no chance of escaping! It was an all-encompassing assault.</p><p></p><p>The "Immortal in the Painting" Dao fruit provided Li Che with an endless supply of spirit wood crows - he could simply paint them into existence.</p><p></p><p>The consumption of vital energy and spiritual essence to create each spirit wood crow was negligible, and he could replenish the expended energy almost immediately after finishing a crow.</p><p></p><p>The number of spirit wood crows depended solely on how many Li Che wished to create!</p><p></p><p>He was essentially an infinite arsenal unto himself!</p><p></p><p>Since the spirit wood crows were personally crafted by Li Che, the replication through the "Immortal in the Painting" was nearly perfect.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the six enhanced divine Gatling guns firing simultaneously, the destructive power was far more terrifying than a barrage of countless arrows! The billowing smoke rose like a slowly blooming mushroom cloud!</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Light Prefecture City was shaking within the first moments.</p><p></p><p>The sheer scale of the assault was almost comparable to the thunderous roar of clashing in the heavens above - unless one was deaf, they would have sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Especially at the Flower Barge.</p><p></p><p>Many flower maidens and courtesans were trembling as they rushed to the railings, peering out to see the place that was like a nightmare in their minds... exploding!</p><p></p><p>The piercing sounds of breaking the air echoed ceaselessly, shooting out from various directions.</p><p></p><p>The Void Appearance experts from the Five Great Families, as well as the Divine Guard Army of the Prefectural Governor's Mansion and the Temple Garrison, were all alerted and quickly mobilized.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Golden Fragrance Institute.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, with his towering physique, gripped the Blizzard Thunder Halberd in one hand, with wind and thunder swirling around the shaft, emitting a sizzling sound.</p><p></p><p>He was manipulating the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, enveloping the entire Golden Fragrance Institute. He did not conceal his aura.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the trash leaders of the Beggar's Sect... he had no need to hide.</p><p></p><p>It was his Ox Demons who did it, so he had nothing to be afraid of.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar's Sect's actions of practicing the Necromantic Arts and colluding with the Corpse God Sect deserved to be exterminated! The "Chess Saint" Dao fruit in his chest was pounding, and the purpose of opening the Heavenly Earth Chessboard was to protect the poor girls who had been trained in the institute.</p><p></p><p>They were too fragile. Although there were many girls who had been specially trained in the martial arts to satisfy the customers' preferences, under the overwhelming firepower of the spirit wood crows, they were as fragile as paper.</p><p></p><p>Li Che used the Heavenly Earth Chessboard to precisely control and guide the firepower of the wood crows, so that they would automatically bypass those girls.</p><p></p><p>Although they would be startled, it was still better than being reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>After three rounds of bombardment, the last trace of aura had been completely extinguished in Li Che's perception of the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the sixteen Ox Demons cease their barrage.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap! Their movements were perfectly coordinated - ceasing fire, holstering their weapons, and standing at attention. They were even more in sync than the most meticulously trained military troops.</p><p></p><p>Li Che adjusted the hat on his head, gripping the halberd in one hand, and took a step forward, soaring into the clouds like a falcon. He appeared high above the Flower Barge, still maintaining his posture as if ascending the stairs.</p><p></p><p>His long black hair flowed like a cape, and his eyes smoldered with a faint golden haze.</p><p></p><p>He put away the Blizzard Thunder Halberd and suddenly raised both hands towards the billowing mushroom cloud below.</p><p></p><p>Ascending the stairs -</p><p>Thousand Shattering Palms! Boom! In an instant,</p><p>the thick smoke continued to roll, as if countless resentful and angry souls who had perished in the bombardment were condensing into distorted faces, bursting out from the smoke and dust.</p><p></p><p>However, they all passed through Li Che's body without causing any effect.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh -</p><p>In the next moment,</p><p>a series of piercing sounds echoed, and the severed corpses were releasing their corpse spiritual essences.</p><p></p><p>They coalesced into a multitude of grayish-black chess pieces, soaring up and suspending in the air before Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"These... will be the raw materials for making the 'Avalanche Crows' later on."</p><p></p><p>The raven hair cascading down to his waist was wildly whipping about.</p><p></p><p>Under the adorable ox-faced mask, Li Che's voice echoed low.</p><p></p><p>As the reverberating voice still lingered in the air,</p><p>it was suddenly shattered by an enraged roar!</p><p></p><p>In the distance,</p><p>the divine Appearance realm patriarchs of the Five Great Families arrived, their powerful spiritual auras blanketing the sky, their oppressive presence causing many cultivators to feel a chill and struggle to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Five mighty divine Appearances, like divine beings accompanied by the five patriarchs, swiftly crossed the sky.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were their second-generation scions in the Golden Fragrance Institute! </p><p>Some had even reached the Void Appearance realm, being the top forces of their families.</p><p></p><p>The wind howled and whipped about.</p><p>The mushroom cloud continued to rise, though small, it was quite cute.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon lightly tapped his toes, hovering in the air like a falcon.</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts rushing over all came to a halt, for they felt a deep sense of threat and... terror.</p><p></p><p>How could there be so many Ox Demons?!</p><p>Aside from the central hovering Ox Demon, the sixteen Ox Demons standing on the high walls surrounding the Golden Fragrance Institute - what was this? Had they stirred up a hornet's nest? Seventeen Ox Demons... which one was real, and which one was fake?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't tell... </p><p>Even the divine Appearance realm cultivators' powerful spiritual senses could not discern the difference! Because these Ox Demons were completely unified in their auras and vital energies!</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmly looked at the Five Great Family patriarchs rushing towards him.</p><p>His gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... have you gone mad? Do you want to completely annihilate the Golden Light Prefecture City?"</p><p></p><p>"Madman, a true demon!" Qin Dizun, the Qin Family patriarch, gritted his teeth and roared in fury.</p><p></p><p>"You destroyed the Fishermen's Gang, and now you want to eliminate the Beggar's Sect... Are you going to next wipe out the Black Python Gang, then the Five Great Families, the Five Major Sects, and finally even the Divine Sect?"</p><p>The Sea Family patriarch spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p>The response they received was only the low laughter of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Li Che's masked face was utterly shameless, completely unconcerned with the questioning and views of these family patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>His low laughter seemed to mockingly slap their faces.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fingers.</p><p>All the corpse spiritual essence chess pieces were absorbed into the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Then, his eyes behind the mask, filled with reckless madness, swept over the five family patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, pointing at each of the five patriarchs in turn.</p><p></p><p>"Among you... some have secrets that I know about."</p><p>"Don't let me smell the stench of corpses on you."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's low, suppressed yet shameless voice echoed through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Although he was currently refining the Seven Element Corpse Curse Ancestral Imprint, which had weakened his sensitivity to the aura of death and corpses, he could still sense it.</p><p></p><p>The five patriarchs immediately showed a slight change in their expressions, understanding the implication in the Ox Demon's words.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>A streak of light shot forth at lightning speed, the arrow arriving first, followed by the rumbling thunder.</p><p>However, the arrow simply pierced through one of the Ox Demons, only causing a puff of black smoke.</p><p></p><p>The remaining sixteen Ox Demons simultaneously turned their gaze towards the distant direction.</p><p>They saw a tall figure standing on the rooftop of a building from the Prefectural Governor's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>That figure was pulling a long bow, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Fake?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan, the divine archer, sneered, then immediately drew the bowstring again, the earth-shattering sound erupting.</p><p></p><p>The Five Great Family patriarchs were horrified.</p><p>That was the divine archer from the state capital who was by the Prefectural Governor's side! Each of his arrows contained terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>Yet, they all missed their mark!</p><p>For the Ox Demons he shot through simply exploded into black mist.</p><p></p><p>Fakes, all of them were fakes...</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmly looked at Wen Longshan, a faint killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the Ox Demon's little notebook...</p><p>Your name is written there.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p>clenching his fingers, the Lightning Chess Pieces.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the many powerful experts, the Ox Demon directly vanished and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining Ox Demons...</p><p>They all "boom, boom, boom" exploded, turning into billowing black mist.</p><p></p><p>"He ran away?"</p><p>"He just... ran away like that?"</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon was so elusive and mysterious!</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Qin Dizun of the Qin Family was horrified, this kind of opponent... was truly unsettling.</p><p></p><p>On the rooftop of the Prefectural Governor's Mansion,</p><p>Wen Longshan slowly lowered his divine bow.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon?"</p><p>He murmured.</p><p></p><p>What organization did they come from?</p><p>To dare be so arrogant...</p><p></p><p>This ability to manifest dozens of identical clones with the same aura and vital energy was truly bizarre! And that faceless archer who could snipe from tens of miles away...</p><p></p><p>What kind of organization was this?</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan put away his longbow and stepped off the rooftop, returning to the courtyard pavilion. He broke the ribbon binding his hair, letting it flow freely.</p><p>He only tied his hair when he was about to shoot arrows.</p><p></p><p>Prefectural Governor Su Huaili was sipping tea and reading a book.</p><p></p><p>"When did you develop such interest to be willing to shoot arrows and kill this vicious Ox Demon?"</p><p>Su Huaili said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"I just found it interesting," Wen Longshan replied with a smile.</p><p>"It's a pity I couldn't find the true body, this villain... has some intriguing methods."</p><p></p><p>"That Ox Demon's aura was very strong, likely at the Patriarch realm, with extremely robust vital energy, and he used some secret technique..."</p><p>"As for his spiritual cultivation, it was rather ordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan took a sip of the green winter tea, pondering for a moment, then smiled: "If I were to find his true self..."</p><p>"At most, it would take two arrows to take his life."</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili chuckled lightly: "So you think quite highly of this vicious Ox Demon, to the point of needing a second arrow from you."</p><p></p><p>"Hold onto your arrows, in a few days, you should be able to shoot to your heart's content."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan raised an eyebrow: "Oh? Is Li Qingshan about to break through to the divine Appearance realm?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan is a man with a fierce and unparalleled 'Goat Horn Shattering Heaven Hammer', his martial dao is exceptional. Now at the post-Patriarch realm, his physical body is formidable... But he cultivates the 'Thunderclap Exterminate Evil', hating evil with a passion..."</p><p></p><p>"He has offended most of the major powers in the Golden Light Prefecture City, as you know, the greater the power, the more they tend to harbor corruption. Li Qingshan has hammered through a lot of that filth."</p><p></p><p>"Those powers he has hammered are naturally unwilling to see him break through to the divine Appearance realm... If he doesn't accumulate the Void Appearance, and directly steps into the divine Appearance realm, he will be a formidable figure at the divine Appearance mid-realm. A difficult opponent."</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"But in my eyes, he is merely an ant that can be casually crushed."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want Li Qingshan to succeed in condensing the divine Appearance... It's simply to annoy that old fox, South离Huo."</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili suddenly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long that old fox can endure."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan glanced at Su Huaili, not knowing the details of the enmity between Su Huaili and South離Huo.</p><p>But since he was brought from the Cloud State military camp by Su Huaili, he naturally wouldn't ask about such matters.</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili closed the book, suddenly remembering something and said, "Oh yes, the young master will be arriving soon, you should go out of the city to welcome him."</p><p></p><p>"The young master is coming to the Golden Light Prefecture City in secret this time, trying to see if he can obtain the inheritance of the Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince from the temple deity, to acquire that set of Four Divine Armaments."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If this is the case, the young master has a promising divine destiny and will surely become a powerful existence on the level of a Pacifying King."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's heart sank as he heard the words "young master." He became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the five-year-old young master? Coming from afar... Is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Su shook his head: "Longshan, you still don't understand the importance of this mysterious Temple of the Four Guardians..."</p><p></p><p>"The Furious Eight-Armed Third Prince's Mysterious Temple... It's different from the ordinary Temple of the Four Guardians, and is on par with the Mysterious Temple of the Three-Eyed True Lord in the Lingnan Dao City..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a mysterious temple that forms the foundation of a Dao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The teacher values this mysterious temple greatly."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... Would a mere Southern离Fire be worth him sending me here?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The billowing smoke was suddenly dispersed by the howling wind.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao, the chief constable of the Temple Guardianship, dressed in a black and red constable's robe, descended into the courtyard, followed by the commander of the Divine Guard Army and the patriarchs of the Five Great Families.</p><p></p><p>They dispersed the mushrooming smoke with their divine winds.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Jinfang Courtyard was then revealed.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao's expression trembled as he saw the ground covered with countless corpses - the high-ranking members of the Beggar Sect, the second-generation scions of the Five Great Families, and many high-ranking officials of the Jinguang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"How cruel..."</p><p></p><p>"The evil demon, this Niu Mo is truly an unparalleled evil demon!"</p><p></p><p>"This is an outlaw who disregards the Temple Guardianship and the Divine Guard Army!"</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the families looked at the shattered bodies of their second-generation descendants, burning with rage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao was covered in cold sweat. This Niu Mo... has grown too powerful too quickly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he could only take down the subordinate forces of the Beggar Sect one by one, but now he has directly attacked the Beggar Sect headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao remained silent, his mind racing. Suddenly, he sensed something.</p><p></p><p>He burst forth with his strength and landed in the crater-filled courtyard, inhaling the lingering scent of gunpowder.</p><p></p><p>He then saw a group of young women, their clothes in disarray and expressions fearful, timidly emerging from the buildings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the corpses strewn across the ground, their fear suddenly vanished, and they began to weep pearls of tears, some going mad and clapping, some covering their mouths and crying, some kneeling and wailing...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao was perplexed. His hand on the standard-issue constable's saber at his waist felt somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Is this the dark secret of the Beggar Sect? Zhang Lianhao's face flushed with a hint of anger, but he also felt powerless, as the Temple Guardianship's main focus was on the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect... obviously had the protection and collusion of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"I'm... I'm sorry..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young women with exposed clothing, the over-forty-year-old virgin Zhang Lianhao couldn't help but feel guilty and dejected.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't help but admire Niu Mo...</p><p></p><p>Recalling the praise for Niu Mo from Feiluo City, the "Lone Hero"... Niu Mo?</p><p></p><p>It seems the reputation is well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>How envious of Niu Mo's unbridled ways.</p><p></p><p>He turned and ran into the conference hall, where he saw the Beggar Sect leader Hongsixi shot by a sniper, and... the beheaded Corpse Deity Emissary of the Eight Extremes!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao abruptly drew his saber, his anger boiling.</p><p></p><p>"The Beggar Sect has colluded with the heretical Corpse Deity Sect! Their crimes shall be punished!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Luohua Alley, in the small workshop courtyard, Li Che returned silently. The falling snowflakes on his shoulders were instantly evaporated by his surging vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Standing still in the courtyard, Li Che closed his eyes and calmed the raging killing intent within.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect... is no more.</p><p></p><p>He had wiped out the sect's high-level members, including the Beggar Sect leader Hongsixi, the false deputy leaders, and the Nine Bag Elders in the Jinfang Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Their evil deeds deserved no sympathy in death!</p><p></p><p>"This Hongsixi... actually practiced the Necromantic Art of Seductive Corpses, the Eight Forbidden Seductive Corpse Art, sacrificing three hundred and sixty-five young maidens..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the darkness of this world was deeper than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Lingying Sect in Feiluo City, the Necromantic Art in the Jinguang Prefecture... </p><p></p><p>And the source of all these evil secret arts was the Corpse Deity Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen's concerns have also been resolved."</p><p></p><p>"The recklessness in my heart has been vented."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched and his bones cracked.</p><p></p><p>His mind descended into the celestial chessboard, where countless divine chess pieces floated, representing the cultivators he had killed with his bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Utilizing these divine essences was even more beneficial than the pure divine cultivation in the divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not waste them, absorbing them all.</p><p></p><p>"I must put them to use..."</p><p></p><p>"I can develop the Snow Avalanche Raven Bullets, and also develop even more powerful cannons..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, and the hidden weapon "Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus" appeared.</p><p></p><p>This hidden weapon was no longer of much help to the current Li Che. Even the Thousand Spider Silk was more effective if he found good materials.</p><p></p><p>But Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus, even with thousands of poisoned wooden needles, would have difficulty harming Patriarchs or Pseudo-Immortals.</p><p></p><p>It had become quite useless, needing an upgrade and improvement!</p><p></p><p>The "Immortal Craftsman" Dao Fruit in his chest began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind started to consider the upgrade direction for Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus, going towards the path of area-of-effect firepower.</p><p></p><p>"Integrating the embryonic form of the divine ability, the Chess Sage's Great Snow Avalanche, into Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus?"</p><p></p><p>"Originally, Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus contained countless fine wooden needles like a cow's hair. Similarly, I can replace them with divine chess pieces."</p><p></p><p>"Hiding hundreds, thousands, or even millions of divine chess pieces, and then launching them outward... Exploding them with the body of Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Snow Avalanche power contained in the divine chess pieces...</p><p></p><p>It might create a massive fireworks display!</p><p></p><p>"So, I also need to make a launching device, to work with the 'Namo Immortal Craftsman's Great Snow Avalanche Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon'..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che fell into deep thought, considering the difficulty and feasibility of the manufacturing process.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the explosion from the divine chess pieces using the Great Snow Avalanche method is related to the strength of the divine essence itself. There are many things to research here."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>"At most, it's just a matter of adjusting the yield of the divine chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly sat down on the snow-covered courtyard ground.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and a piece of wood flew towards him. He grasped it, and the carving knife slid out as his true qi swept away the moisture in the wood.</p><p></p><p>Shhh, shhh, shhh...</p><p></p><p>Li Che focused intently on his carving.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a thought, he tried to compress a divine chess piece into one of the wooden needles that made up Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che eventually compromised and slightly enlarged some of the wooden needles to better accommodate the divine chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>After several modifications, Li Che finally completed the prototype of the "Great Snow Avalanche Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon"! Since this was the first attempt, Li Che only loaded around sixty divine chess pieces of the Spirit Foundation realm.</p><p></p><p>"The yield of sixty chess pieces is not too impressive... The yield of a hundred, a thousand, or even a million divine chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"Can I witness in this world the massive mushroom cloud fireworks etched into the depths of my soul, capable of seizing the power of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but tremble slightly at the thought of the towering mushroom cloud.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of light appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (LV3, 90%)]</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit had suddenly jumped from 86% to 90%!</p><p></p><p>Was it because he had improved Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus? Or was it due to the brilliant, earth-shattering concept in his mind?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps both, but it was undoubtedly exhilarating for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of transformation will occur when the Dao Fruit reaches LV4?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very curious and eager.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky and took out the Spatial Jade Orbs of the Beggar Sect leader and the Corpse Deity Emissary. Having become adept at robbing the dead, Li Che was no longer fazed by it.</p><p></p><p>Since he had just experienced a sudden wealth, and the Beggar Sect leader had exhausted his resources to cultivate the Necromantic Art of Seductive Corpses, he was poorer than an ordinary Spirit Foundation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The harvest from the Corpse Deity Emissary was also quite meager.</p><p></p><p>Unfazed by this level of wealth, Li Che sat cross-legged in the courtyard, his pure divine essence coalescing into paper, and he began to splash ink on it, designing the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>The Great Snow Avalanche Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon was ready, but the launching device still needed to be thoroughly researched.</p><p></p><p>The first-generation Avalokitesvara Lotus Main Battle Tank?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed...</p><p></p><p>He thought of Wen Longshan, who stood atop the City Lord's Mansion and shot the terrifying Heaven-Splitting Arrows at him.</p><p></p><p>Archer? Let you experience the firepower of the Avalokitesvara Lotus Main Battle Tank!</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, is it your arrows or my Great Snow Avalanche Lotus Cannon that are more powerful? Within the range, Avalokitesvara is the truth!</p><p></p><p>The snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who had just wiped out the Beggar Sect, was busily working in the courtyard to realize his dream of witnessing the fireworks.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had been waiting anxiously at Zhenglelou.</p><p></p><p>He kept puffing on his dry tobacco, feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Lü Cheng was cultivating in the courtyard. Seeing the restless Old Chen, he felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Chen, you're disturbing my cultivation. Can't you pace in your own courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Cheng said, somewhat exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Li Qingshan was in seclusion, and Lü Cheng knew that the teacher had reached a critical moment, so he wanted to work hard on his cultivation to avoid becoming a burden.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just worried... Have you heard any news about the Beggar Sect?" Old Chen asked.</p><p></p><p>Lü Cheng rolled his eyes and said, "Okay, I'll go find out."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Lü Cheng rushed back.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao was sitting on the threshold, smoking. Seeing the hurrying Lü Cheng, he immediately jumped up.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard any news?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took a deep breath, anxiously asking.</p><p></p><p>Lü Cheng's face flushed red, and his small body was emanating heat.</p><p></p><p>That was excitement, that was turbulence.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard news!"</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo attacked the Beggar Sect this morning..."</p><p></p><p>"It's said the scale was massive, alarming the Temple Guardianship, the Divine Guard Army, and the patriarchs of the Five Great Families..."</p><p></p><p>"The Jinfang Courtyard behind the Yunfang Pavilion, the Beggar Sect's high-level members, the second-generation scions of the families, and some prominent officials... all annihilated!"</p><p></p><p>"The Beggar Sect leader, deputy leaders, and Nine Bag Elders were all killed... The entire Beggar Sect has disintegrated."</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, as you wished..."</p><p></p><p>"The Beggar Sect... is no more!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He plopped down on the ground, his hand holding the dry tobacco pipe trembling.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>He thought Niu Mo would only go to rescue the girls imprisoned in the courtyard, kill a few of the Beggar Sect's evil members, and expose the Beggar Sect's atrocities.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo directly wiped out the entire Beggar Sect?</p><p></p><p>(Please support the author by voting for monthly tickets and recommending the novel.

        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's face instantly darkened.</p><p></p><p>During this period of interaction, not only did Xixia particularly like Old Chen, even Li Che and Zhang Ya, the husband and wife, had completely treated this lonely old man as their own family member.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze shifted to Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to have sensed Li Che's burning gaze, Zhao Chuanxiong's movements in escorting Chen Dabao paused for a moment, and he narrowed his eyes, looking back.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's Teacher Li..."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong saw Li Che, his smile not reaching his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Sun Zhangbiao died, Zhao Chuanxiong was responsible for investigating the case, and he traced it back to Li Che, saying it was an investigation... but in reality, it was a threat, to confirm Xixia's spiritual child qualifications.</p><p></p><p>What Zhao Chuanxiong regretted in his heart was that after confirming Li Nuan Xia's spiritual child qualifications, he had never found an opportunity to make a move.</p><p></p><p>And he encountered the Ox Demon, was injured by the Ox Demon, rested for a while, and then encountered the Ox Demon again, killing the Bagua Staff...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong was so frightened that he no longer dared to easily stir up trouble, and had been barely keeping himself alive, so he had no chance to make a move.</p><p></p><p>This time... if it weren't for the urgent pressure from Si Mubo's side, Zhao Chuanxiong still wanted to continue hiding, after all... the Ox Demon hasn't died yet.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhao, I don't know what crime Teacher Chen has committed?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"In the case of Sun Zhangbiao, Sun Liangfu has filed a new report, saying that Chen Dabao killed his son Sun Zhangbiao, and also killed Sun Zhangbiao's wife Liu Shi."</p><p></p><p>"This matter has reached the government office, so I was assigned to take charge of this case again... to arrest Chen Dabao."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong stared at Li Che with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your daughter has been doing quite well this past year, hasn't she?" Zhao Chuanxiong said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and his eyes narrowed slightly, suppressing the murderous intent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he did not respond to Zhao Chuanxiong's provocative words, and said in a deep voice, "Wasn't it said that the Ox Demon was responsible for that case originally?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong shook his head: "Sun Liangfu has filed a new report to the government, and now the vicious criminal Ox Demon is rampaging in the city, with a cruel killing method, so the city lord has personally intervened and issued a warrant, ordering me to arrest Chen Dabao for investigation. If he truly has a grievance, the city lord will have it clarified."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Li, don't worry, Chen Teacher is after all a highly respected wood carving master of Xu Record, our government office will not let him be harmed."</p><p></p><p>"Once it's investigated clearly, he will naturally be released."</p><p></p><p>"But, he still has to go through the Flying Thunder Great Prison."</p><p></p><p>"Chen Teacher's strength is very strong, Zhao knows, if he resists... then he will be on the government's wanted list, and at that time... it will be the city's divine captains who will take action, not me old Zhao."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao's expression darkened slightly as he shook his head slightly at Li Che, who still wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>The divine captains of the inner city... they are true spiritual cultivators. Provoking such figures would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, protect Xixia."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen instructed Li Che in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong took Old Chen away.</p><p></p><p>In front of the wood carving shop, it fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, already understanding in his heart that the Spiritual Infant Sect... has finally started to make a move against the Xu Record.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they have set their sights on Xixia, this spiritual child.</p><p></p><p>Xu You had once said that Xixia's spiritual nature is extremely rich, belonging to the top-tier among spiritual children, and for the Spiritual Infant Sect, the temptation is great, and they may even take risks.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because Old Chen has been living in my house, and with his protection over Xixia, Zhao Chuanxiong feels the need to take Old Chen away first before making a move?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, to the discerning eye, it does seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's cultivation of refining the body has reached the Blood Transformation Realm, after all, he has cultivated for decades, and as a senior wood carving master of Xu Record, Xu Record naturally did not stint on providing him with the Blood Transformation techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for his inner strength, Old Chen has even grasped the threshold of the Fourth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's martial arts are the strongest among the wood carving teachers of Xu Record, and even within the inner city, he is not considered weak.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful protector, it would not be easy to take away Xixia, so Zhao Chuanxiong naturally had to remove him first.</p><p></p><p>However, precisely because Old Chen is so strong, Li Che is not worried about his safety.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Third Shop Steward?" Li Che stared at the steward Sun.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong said that the report was filed by the steward Sun Liangfu.</p><p></p><p>But the steward Sun did not refute it, which means that there must be something to it, even if it is not... the silent steward Sun, who is also entangled with Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>The steward Sun did not answer Li Che's question, keeping his head lowered, not even making eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"The Third Shop Steward... was called away by the Second Shop Steward early this morning, and returned to the inner city."</p><p></p><p>The tall and heroic Zhao Xuan, who had practiced martial arts, spoke up to explain to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The Second Shop Steward... Xu Beihu?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>How coincidental, the Third Shop Steward Xu You had just left, and then Zhao Chuanxiong came to take away Old Chen... Could it be that Xu Beihu is also mixed up with Zhao Chuanxiong and the like?</p><p></p><p>"Steward Sun... how can you frame Teacher Chen? Wasn't the case of Sun Zhangbiao already closed? It was said that the Ox Demon Great Hero was the one who killed him!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan was very upset and looked at the butler Sun, saying in a loud voice:</p><p></p><p>"Before my son's death, Chen Dabao examined him..." Butler Sun raised his head, his old face trembling slightly: "After he examined him... my son then died... How could such a coincidence happen in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"My son's death must be inextricably linked to Chen Dabao!" </p><p></p><p>"What 'Ox Demon', what bullshit 'hero'... It might even be Chen Dabao's disguise!"</p><p></p><p>Butler Sun said coldly, with icy words even bursting from between his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Butler Sun, the 'Ox Demon Hero'... hates evil with a passion, the Lingying Sect has caused such a commotion in Feilei City, with so many families hanging white cloth and burning white paper, but only the Ox Demon Hero stood out, specifically targeting and killing the evil members of the Lingying Sect, such a heroic figure, and you dare to insult him?"</p><p></p><p>"Your son Sun Changbiao joined the Lingying Sect, wanting to exchange someone else's daughter for his son... Such a malicious person, he deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan crossed her arms and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"And your accusation is too obvious, what build does the Ox Demon have, what physique does Old Chen have... how can you connect the two?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you say Master Li is the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan was quite impatient with the ungrateful Butler Sun.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled, thinking that he had been exposed...</p><p></p><p>"Miss Zhao, you shouldn't say such things casually."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's startled look, Zhao Xuan hurriedly explained: "It was just an example, just an example, Master Li don't be nervous... how long have you been practicing martial arts, you're vastly different from the Ox Demon, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "......"</p><p></p><p>You understand nothing!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the clamor in front of Xu's woodcarving shop fell silent, and in the hazy snow, Zhao Chuanxiong, dressed in black and red, returned.</p><p></p><p>His rough palms rested on the hilt of the long sword at his waist, standing upright in the snowstorm.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts were suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's gaze was fixed intently on Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, Butler Sun said... it was you who asked Chen Dabao to investigate Sun Changbiao, so... is your involvement also related to Sun Changbiao's death?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong, who had returned, stared at Li Che and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, why don't you... come with me somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, it was as if the sky had been shattered! In front of Xu's woodcarving shop, the atmosphere suddenly exploded, boiling with commotion! Many people were both shocked and angry, and the clear-sighted ones all saw that Zhao Chuanxiong was deliberately harassing Li Che! Butler Sun's expression flickered and darkened, but he didn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's gaze even had a ferocious look as he stared at Li Che, the sword at his waist drawn an inch out of its sheath, his whole body surging with blood and qi, like a venomous snake or a python.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che! I must ask you, when Sun Changbiao died..."</p><p></p><p>"Where were you?"</p><p></p><p>"What were you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The forceful questioning words had not yet finished, the voice echoing like thunderous explosions!</p><p></p><p>But the sword light had already spread across the sky, tearing through the blowing snow, like a great net of the heavens, crashing down towards Li Che!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to subdue Li Che, making it difficult for him to respond, to surrender. The bone-piercing aura was brutal and frenzied, a boiling blood qi, combined with the dazzling sword light, making the area in front of Xu's woodcarving shop even more oppressive! Zhao Chuanxiong... not only wanted to take Chen Dabao away, but also wanted to take Li Che away!</p><p></p><p>Leaving only Zhang Ya and Xixie, the mother and daughter who were as helpless as chickens, in Xu's courtyard!</p><p></p><p>A sinister plot!</p><p></p><p>A malicious plot carried out under the rules of the government office!</p><p></p><p>What a dirty tactic! Seeing the waterfall-like sword light bursting forth before his eyes, in the moment the sword light reached within three feet of him, a fierce and ruthless look flashed in Li Che's eyes! His face flushed red, as if unleashing the anger suppressed under Zhao Chuanxiong's blood qi pressure! Then, Li Che clenched his five fingers, tearing the air like hooks, pulling out streams of airflow, and the straight arm he clenched into a fist was as straight as a spear! He stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Bent his body.</p><p></p><p>Threw a punch!</p><p></p><p>Using the fist as a spear!</p><p></p><p>Mastered... the Xu Family's Eight Consecutive Bone-Shattering Spear!</p><p></p><p>His entire body's tendons and bones rang out, bones cracking! In a moment almost like lightning and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's sword and Li Che's fist collided several times, their qi and blood intertwining and flickering, making the sword blade tremble intensely! The airflow surged, and the snowflakes floating in the air could not fall, as if blown away by the powerful force, exploding into a hazy snow mist around the two.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong gripped the trembling long sword with one hand, floating back and retreating.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face was flushed red, stepping back several times, kicking up swirling snow.</p><p></p><p>In front of the woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>The scorching blood qi had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>But the people had already been stunned by the thunderous collision between Li Che and Zhao Chuanxiong, silent as sparrows.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong gripped the long sword, his black hair fluttering, his gaze filled with shock and disbelief as he stared at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"You actually..."</p><p></p><p>"Bone-piercing?"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>BOOM!!! A gigantic foot shadow formed entirely from crimson dawn clouds!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the boot had been removed, revealing the five-toed sole, thundering down from the heavens above!</p><p></p><p>Like a crashing thunderbolt descending upon the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>Driving the enlightened martial dao master Xue Dumu straight into the ground, like a stake!</p><p></p><p>BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - The blue brick ground of the Jin Guang Mansion suddenly exploded, deeply caving in, with the surrounding hundreds of meters of blue bricks and stones all shattering and taking flight!</p><p></p><p>The sunken shape of the massive footprint, the billowing clouds of dust surrounding it like a curtain!</p><p></p><p>Spider web-like cracks rapidly spreading out! Surging streams of scorching heat gushing out from the fissures, like boiling water howling in agony!</p><p></p><p>The entire Jin Guang Mansion seemed to have fallen into a deathly silence at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xue Dumu's furious roar, with a thunderous voice that shook the night, had awakened the entire Jin Guang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts had been alerted.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the Underworld's Demon Face had actually chosen to assassinate the Prince Consort Ji Haiwei, everyone was horrified!</p><p></p><p>Insane! The Underworld has gone mad! That was Prince Consort Ji Haiwei, the son of Pacification King Ji Mo, apart from the Hunting God Pavilion, who else would dare to assassinate him? But Demon Face struck.</p><p></p><p>And with such mysterious and supernatural means, from thousands of miles away, he had taken a long-range shot.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the invincible assassination technique... failed this time!</p><p></p><p>Because, by the Prince Consort Ji Haiwei's side, there was a grand master!</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of the grand master, this mysterious Underworld Demon Face also ultimately failed in his assassination attempt.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, many people witnessed the scene of Demon Face frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Instantly caught up and slashed by the grand master Xue Dumu, a single stroke of the hatchet.</p><p></p><p>But no one had expected...</p><p></p><p>After being slain by Xue Dumu, Demon Face did not spill a single drop of blood, but instead dissipated into black mist! A fake! </p><p></p><p>That was not Demon Face! A false body!</p><p></p><p>Using a divine technique of illusion to deceive, this was not uncommon, like the [Suspended Willow Wood Body] Li Che obtained from the Xu family of Flying Thunder, which was a type of clone technique.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Face... was a decoy! Almost all the powerful experts had this thought flashing through their minds.</p><p></p><p>Then, they saw a massive foot descending from the sky! Everyone was utterly shocked, their bodies seemingly frozen, feeling parched and dry in their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The divine sages of the Four Great Families, the Void Cultivators, and others all had their scalps tingling!</p><p></p><p>An unbelievable idea surged in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Demon Face was the decoy.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld's true target...</p><p></p><p>Was the grand master! "That is... the divine might?!"</p><p></p><p>"Another grand master?!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the massive foot shadow formed by the intertwined crimson dawn clouds, as if a tangible substance, many were stirred.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's expression was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"No... it doesn't seem to be... the divine might of a grand master, able to mobilize the domain of heaven and earth through the fusion of one's qi and martial dao will!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's eyes flickered, his divine sense expanding to sense, his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld's target...</p><p></p><p>Was actually not the Prince, but...</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Xue Dumu!</p><p></p><p>Completely unexpected!</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed room, the door opened.</p><p></p><p>Prince Consort Ji Haiwei, his brow furrowed, walked out in his elegant attire, the bruises on his face having already faded significantly.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura of the grand master's confrontation, his eyes revealed a trembling expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of insignificant force... dares to offend the Pacification King?"</p><p></p><p>"Also dares to imitate the Hunting God Pavilion and try to assassinate me?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>The target was the grand master.</p><p></p><p>But if the grand master was successfully killed, he, Ji Haiwei... would be in danger!</p><p></p><p>The opponent's aura doesn't seem to be that of a grand master, lacking that terrifying and domineering martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>But to be able to stomp a grand master underfoot! Their strength... must be truly extraordinary! Even if they are not a grand master, they are definitely a top-tier expert! The six Black Armor Blood Guards have protected the Prince Consort extremely well.</p><p></p><p>There was no relaxation whatsoever, just because the one ambushed and attacked was the grand master Xue Dumu.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Scorching hot...</p><p></p><p>Searing...</p><p></p><p>The temperature of the air suddenly soared, becoming extremely scorching, an invisible qi and blood aura seemed to be affecting everyone's mind! The billowing dust was swept away by the surging air currents!</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see clearly! Amidst the howling air currents, they saw the towering figure suspended in the air, wearing a demonic monkey mask, tilting its head.</p><p></p><p>Not possessing the terrifying physique of Ox Demon, nor the slender build of Demon Face.</p><p></p><p>But a robust build, as if the muscles had been forged and twisted into a braided rope.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... Demon Monkey!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the city...</p><p></p><p>A stream of figures rushed back, those who had previously gone to investigate the destroyed Jin Lie Gate outside the city. Li Qingshan and Lin Xiuyi were among them.</p><p></p><p>The two stared blankly from afar.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that after just destroying the Jin Lie Gate, the Demon Monkey would come to trouble the grand master again...</p><p></p><p>No, how dare he provoke the grand master?!</p><p></p><p>And in broad daylight...</p><p></p><p>How could he be so blatant?</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiuyi took a deep breath, her eyes filled with admiration and a look of having learned something extraordinary, as if some incredible knowledge had been implanted into her mind in a unique way.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Li Qingshan was beating his chest and stomping his feet.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon, Demon Face, and Demon Monkey, ambushing a grand master...</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Qingshan were to play, he wouldn't be able to handle it! Assassinating a grand master...</p><p></p><p>If he were to make the slightest mistake, he might end up getting beaten to death!</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the grand master's aura erupted and clashed, the upper echelons of the entire Jin Guang Mansion had sensed and reacted.</p><p></p><p>The Shrine Superintendent, Xie Jing, who had just returned from the mysterious temple of the Third Prince, frowned and appeared on the roof of a room in the Shrine Superintendent's compound.</p><p></p><p>Gazing into the distance, observing the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>The Observatory Director sat on the top of the Treasure Pavilion, playing a mournful erhu amidst the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao, standing with his hands behind his back, had a curious gleam in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Atop the Jin Guang Peak.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо and Wang Kuyu were also alerted.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Demon Monkey?"</p><p></p><p>"Collaborating with Demon Face, using Demon Face as a decoy, the actual target is Grand Master Xue Dumu?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо was greatly shaken, disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld... has such a domineering comrade?! Wang Kuyu's figure hovered, his Taoist robe billowing, swinging his fly whisk: "Their courage is not small, but to want to kill a grand master... their level is far from enough."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>A grand master who could contend with the Divine Sage was no mere talk.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the various forces.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu, who had been driven into the ground by the massive blood cloud foot, his face changing between blue and red, was furious beyond measure! "Damned monkey!"</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu roared, the one who had driven and stomped him into the ground, the Demon Monkey. He let out a long howl! Instantly, his terrifying martial dao will formed a powerful domain-like field centered on his body!</p><p></p><p>Streams of gleaming silver gales sliced through the surroundings, causing the already shattered and fragmented ground to crack even further.</p><p></p><p>BANG! Xue Dumu clenched his single arm and struck out with a powerful punch, slamming it onto the Demon Monkey's massive foot, which was conjured from some unknown material. The foot was knocked into the air.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu's entire body trembled, but he shot up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>While in the air, an incredible transformation occurred, as if he had unleashed the hidden essence, spirit, and will that had been suppressed.</p><p></p><p>His black hair flew, seemingly coated with a layer of silver light, his eyes brimming with murderous intent. His slender single-armed body suddenly swelled and bulged!</p><p></p><p>The complete and flawless physique of a grand master was fully manifested at this moment!</p><p></p><p>From an aged, single-armed, decrepit man, in an instant, he transformed into a tall and robust middle-aged man, his silver divine might intertwining around his body like lightning, almost solidifying into a tangible armor!</p><p></p><p>The coarse hemp clothes he wore were stretched taut, then ripped, revealing skin like forged black iron, with thick, throbbing veins, the scorching red blood visibly boiling within!</p><p></p><p>The grand master! The essence, spirit, and will condensed into a bodily elixir, refined by the martial dao will! Once unleashed in battle, the might would be utterly terrifying, like a compressed spring! The more it was suppressed, the more explosive the release and unleashing would be during combat, leading to unparalleled fulfillment and enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>BANG BANG BANG...</p><p></p><p>The surrounding debris was further pulverized into countless dust and sand, swirling in the air!</p><p></p><p>BOOM! Under the demonic monkey mask, Li Che's fiery eyes narrowed! Mentally controlling the blood cloud foot, he stomped down again! BANG! However, this time, he was unable to trample Xue Dumu into the ground, as Xue Dumu's single arm possessed a terrifying strength, his flesh and blood like thick braided steel cables!</p><p></p><p>He firmly braced against the descending foot technique! "Grand master..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>Then, his mouth twisted into a mad grin!</p><p></p><p>So strong! The forcefully suppressed stomp was instantly transformed into a horizontal kick, like kicking a soccer ball, the sole slamming hard into Xue Dumu's body.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu's body became unstable, and he was immediately kicked into the air, his body rapidly spinning.</p><p></p><p>But with a flip, Xue Dumu's legs heavily pushed off the ground, his divine might erupting and propelling his body into the air!</p><p></p><p>The seemingly ordinary hatchet in his hand suddenly lit up with countless silver patterns! The handle lengthened, the blade thickened, became heavier, and wider! The power increased, becoming over a thousand pounds heavy!</p><p></p><p>Transformed into a crescent moon blade of terrifying might!</p><p></p><p>Gripping it with his single arm, with a shake, the blade rang out, the dazzling sword light sweeping across the night sky!</p><p></p><p>The fusion of martial dao will and divine might formed a horrifying domain within a ten-meter radius around him!</p><p></p><p>Like a stream of light, he swiftly charged towards the Demon Monkey suspended in the air! So powerful! Li Che felt the suffocating aura permeating the air, that was the grand master's heroic spirit!</p><p></p><p>If it had been before his transformation, just the grand master's heroic spirit alone would have been enough to make him drink a cup in submission!</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>A faint glow flickered between Li Che's brows!</p><p></p><p>The Chess Sage's Dao Fruit pounded, on the chessboard of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Li Che manifested from his divine sense, flicking his fingers, consecutively shattering nine Monkey Temple deity divine essences! The surging deity divine essences instantly flooded into his limbs and body, replenishing his Ascended state! BANG! The hat on his head instantly exploded, the golden hair flowing like a golden cape in the wild wind! The Nine Sun Divine Weapon Dripping Blood Shocking Spear that had been slung around his neck suddenly shot up, like a bloody lightning bolt! A portion of the blood cloud qi detached, wrapping and enveloping the Dripping Blood Shocking Spear, transforming it into a blood-colored staff, and even raising its rank! With a step, the blood cloud qi instantly transformed into a blood cloud, trailing his figure as he swiftly charged towards Xue Dumu! "This is... the power of the deity?"</p><p></p><p>The rejuvenated and robust Xue Dumu sneered.</p><p></p><p>"So you are a mere wretch who has borrowed the power of the deity, no wonder you dare to challenge a grand master with a non-grand master body!"</p><p></p><p>"But even if you have borrowed the deity's power, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"A grand master... "</p><p></p><p>"Has a flawless and complete physical body, with the internal and external refined to perfection!"</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Dumu's words were not yet finished.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monkey had already stepped on the blood cloud, appearing before him, the blood-colored staff undulating like a blood python, with a shake, countless overlapping staff shadows, like the spreading tail of a peacock!</p><p></p><p>Thousands of staff shadows surging, like the heavenly river cascading down from the sky!</p><p></p><p>Crashing down!</p><p></p><p>"Looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu's eyes turned cold, his killing intent surging, the crescent moon blade transformed from the hatchet was swung up!</p><p></p><p>The martial dao will and divine might erupted at this moment! Countless divine gales intertwined, tearing the air, transforming into hundreds of blade lights, slashing towards the Demon Monkey in the air.</p><p></p><p>Each divine blade light possessed the power to slay a post-Sage realm warrior! CLANG! As the blade lights approached, the ear-piercing sound of the blades slicing through the clouds and mountains echoed through the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Countless staff shadows were shattered, as if annihilated by the unstoppable blade lights!</p><p></p><p>The divine blade lights densely covered the Demon Monkey, intending to cut him into a thousand pieces!</p><p></p><p>The blade lights rapidly sliced, the air seemed to be boiling, letting out cries unable to withstand the onslaught! The Grand Master Technique! The Lone Desert Smoke Blade!</p><p></p><p>A desolate and domineering blade intent erupted within the blade lights! A grand master technique, once cultivated to the realm of enlightenment, upon reaching the grand master stage, could transform into a grand master technique!</p><p></p><p>Its power would undergo a tremendous leap! In fact, there was no essential difference between a master technique and a grand master technique.</p><p></p><p>But the Sage Technique, however, had a great difference from both! As Xue Dumu was a grand master under Ji Mogli, he naturally possessed the Sage Technique, but was not proficient in it, after all...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had just begun to cultivate the martial saint's supreme art, and had only just barely succeeded in it. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the supreme master's art was his greatest strength in battle! Boom! Countless surging blood qi rose up, and in the trembling, it collided with Xue Daofu's divine saber light! It actually swallowed up those saber qi one by one!</p><p></p><p>The divine monkey's long staff swept across, fiercely breaking out! The Mixed Origin Heavenly Staff! Now that Li Che had reached the second stage of the Dragon-Elephant Golden Warrior Dao, with the enlightenment bestowed by his heart's good fortune...</p><p></p><p>He had reached the level of great mastery! Although it was an incomplete martial saint's supreme art, obscure and difficult to cultivate, once mastered, its power was extremely terrifying! The saber and staff collided!</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang! The explosive sounds echoed throughout the Golden Light Manor City.</p><p></p><p>The air, like calm flowing water, was disturbed and lost its tranquility, constantly rippling with surging qi winds, rolling and dispersing in all directions! The entire long street was hit by a fierce wind, the qi flows shooting and raging! Some nearby divine cultivators even felt that their divine nature was difficult to manifest, suppressed to the point of struggling to breathe! A battle of grand masters! A genuine grand master-level great battle!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu wielded his single-armed crescent moon saber, like a solitary rising smoke column in the vast desert! His scorching blood qi, boiling and intertwined, the colliding staff shadows and saber light scattered on the ground, causing the already ruined blue stone ground to stir up dust and sand, like the curtain of a theater!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Staff shadows!</p><p>Saber light! Qi force!</p><p>Surging blood qi!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the night seemed to have turned into day, the terrifying boiling blood qi causing the temperature to rise, and the falling snowflakes melted into rain, a sudden winter rain!</p><p></p><p>But the falling winter rain had not yet approached the hundred-yard range of the two's clash when it evaporated into vapor! In the Golden Light Manor City,</p><p></p><p>Many onlookers felt dazzled, their minds greatly shaken! The howling winds, the qi force saber light, the surging blood qi, constantly intertwining and impacting everyone's eyes! Amid the rolling saber light, the Underworld Divine Monkey, holding a blood-colored long staff, pointed out countless staff shadows, like blooming flowers, blossoming around him! He stubbornly blocked the crescent moon saber light of the grand master Xue Daofu! Lu Yao and Wang Kuyu, these two Divine Element Perfected Ones, were greatly shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Their powerful divine souls enveloping the heavens and earth, they felt a sense of terror in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>They discovered that the divine monkey's cultivation had not yet reached the grand master realm! He was only at the late stage of the master realm!</p><p></p><p>But his physical body was extremely powerful, to the point of being superhuman, his strength overwhelmingly tyrannical, his staff shadows crashing down as if relying on innate divine power, forcibly surpassing the great realm and shattering Xue Daofu's crescent moon saber light! Lu Yao's expression was shaken: "Forged without peer! Innate iron bones and sinews!"</p><p></p><p>Such a character, he had only seen in the Dao City, and it was the pure martial artists who only cultivated the martial dao and did not cultivate the divine nature!</p><p></p><p>Only by exhausting all one's heart and spirit to pursue the limits of the martial dao, not being distracted by the divine nature, can one walk this path, and only then can one's physical body reach the level of being forged without peer!</p><p></p><p>But Lu Yao clearly sensed the divine power on the divine monkey.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the mysterious and constantly surging blood qi, just the divine nature that the divine monkey was burning and releasing...</p><p></p><p>That was divine nature! </p><p></p><p>"The origin of the Underworld, is not ordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"This divine monkey, where did he come from?"</p><p></p><p>"To be able to refine such a formidable physical body at the master realm, there are only a few in the entire Lingnan Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>As the deputy of the Dao City's Heavenly Monitoring Bureau, he had seen and known much, with a broad memory.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he was also somewhat at a loss about the origin of this divine monkey.</p><p></p><p>It's as if...</p><p></p><p>He had just popped out of a stone!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The divine monkey's eyes shone brightly, his staff shadows sweeping out, the great mastery of the martial saint's supreme art, the Mixed Origin Heavenly Staff, being displayed by him to the pinnacle of excellence.</p><p></p><p>The nine temple divine natures were simultaneously activated, allowing Li Che to feel an even greater power surging into his body.</p><p></p><p>His divine nature power had even reached the level of the Divine Element Perfected Ones!</p><p></p><p>And because they were temple divine natures, the temple divine rank... was unrivaled at the same rank! Unless the opponent was also a temple deity! So in terms of divine nature, Li Che was suppressing Xue Daofu!</p><p></p><p>"The grand master... is indeed strong!"</p><p></p><p>"If I were to rely solely on my refined physical body, I would probably be just about even with him, and to kill him, to beat him black and blue... would be difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Not enough..."</p><p></p><p>Under the divine monkey mask, Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Clang! After a collision.</p><p></p><p>The divine monkey stepped on a blood cloud and quickly pulled away, while Xue Daofu also held his single-armed crescent moon saber, retreating, his powerful grand master physique rolling large beads of sweat.</p><p></p><p>This round of battle, for Xue Daofu, was not an easy one, and he had sweated profusely!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu gritted his teeth, the shock surging in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This divine monkey...</p><p></p><p>Although he had not reached the grand master realm, he was able to withstand Xue Daofu's grand master blood qi power through his formidable forged physical body!</p><p></p><p>It was truly... exaggerated! Of course, the temple divine nature also put pressure on him in the divine dao.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>He was a true grand master after all! "Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu naturally could not tolerate this result! At this moment, under the gaze of all, he had already ridden the tiger and could not get off, if he could not defeat his opponent, his grand master martial dao will, might be unable to be fully realized, and his prestige in the Golden Light Manor City would be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu suddenly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The veins on his neck, like dragon-like, suddenly bulged, his face flushed red, his blood qi boiling to the extreme, as if all the blood vessels under his skin had burst open!</p><p></p><p>Activating his divine saber to the utmost! The ultimate of the grand master's supreme art, the Realm Transformation Force! Hum--</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it was as if there was rolling yellow sand, the image of a solitary rising smoke column in the vast desert, covering down like a domain, intending to envelop the divine monkey within!</p><p></p><p>Domain...</p><p></p><p>That was the absolute killing power of the grand master! This strike...</p><p></p><p>Carried the strong will and belief to kill!</p><p></p><p>It was almost like a burning raging fire in substance!</p><p></p><p>This was killing with a fiery temper!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face was covered by the divine monkey mask, and he opened the tower, activating the temple divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Nine Sun Divine Weapon Vermilion Blood Shocking Spear, shrouded in blood qi.</p><p></p><p>The flickering flames in his eyes slightly shimmered.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying domain, as if it was about to tear everything apart.</p><p></p><p>"The grand master... is indeed strong."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xue Daofu's divine nature cultivation had not yet reached the Divine Element Perfected One realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the grand master combined with the Divine Element Perfected One cultivation...</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no chance to beat, let alone kill Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>And now...</p><p></p><p>Under the divine monkey mask,</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>The sigh echoed suddenly! His muscles bulged, the veins pulsing like dragons, as he swung the crescent moon saber light attacking Xue Daofu, his body suddenly tensing up.</p><p></p><p>An extremely strong sense of crisis! In an instant, it enveloped his entire body! But he saw the divine monkey in front of him, suddenly bursting out countless dazzling golden lights!</p><p></p><p>A dark golden chess piece floated in front of the divine monkey.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly crushed it! Rumbling! At this moment, the ground cracked and the blue stones shattered!</p><p></p><p>Under the divine monkey's feet, an area several yards wide had suddenly sunk over a hundred feet! Golden!</p><p>Dazzlingly golden! It was as if a brilliant golden armor had covered the divine monkey's entire body! The Golden Emperor Temple Divine Nature Chess Piece! Not enough monkeys and monkey descendants.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Emperor comes! Li Che's physical body had undergone a rebirth under the second stage of the Dao Fruit, experiencing a complete transformation.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he could now try to withstand the full power of a Golden Emperor chess piece!</p><p></p><p>Poof poof poof! His flesh and blood burst open in many places, spraying blood mist! But Li Che's heroic spirit was rising steadily! Amid the surging blood qi.</p><p></p><p>One stomp of the foot! The golden armor, along with the golden-tinged flying hair, was like a golden cape! Like a golden divine general, standing on celestial clouds!</p><p></p><p>Hum--! A humming sound.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet divine weapon staff was firmly planted in the blue stone ground, the staff body unmoved.</p><p></p><p>And the golden divine monkey descended, stepping forward!</p><p></p><p>The blood qi-shrouded spear was bent to the extreme! As if...</p><p></p><p>A divine archer drawing a bow to shoot an arrow!</p><p></p><p>Boom--! The explosive sound echoed.</p><p></p><p>But the suddenly rebounding divine spear, the golden divine monkey seemed to have entered a space and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even his divine soul could not be sensed at all!</p><p></p><p>Not good!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's hackles rose.</p><p></p><p>It was not disappearance at all, but the speed was too fast, too fast to...</p><p>Exceed perception!</p><p></p><p>Boom--! Countless air waves were shattered, the grand master's martial dao will and divine saber fused domain, as if cut open by a scorching little knife through butter! The golden divine monkey appeared in front of Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying temple divine rank pressure suppressed Xue Daofu, not even having the strength to move his divine nature! The golden eyes burned with golden smoke, like flowing incense and sinking! Clenching his five fingers, the endless surging airflow, as if crushed and exploded in an instant! Li Che at this moment did not use the martial saint's supreme art, the Heavenly Staff.</p><p></p><p>But with his sinews and bones resonating, his flesh and blood burning, the dragon sinews and elephant bones trembling!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers into a fist!</p><p></p><p>Like a giant elephant swinging its trunk, he fiercely swung out! The moment his arm trembled and exploded, the countless qi winds, divine natures, airflows, and martial dao wills in front of the golden divine monkey were all blown apart! It was as if a vacuum zone had formed! With his single hand gripping the crescent moon saber, Xue Daofu was momentarily dazed, as if he saw the tail-swinging of a mythical true dragon, the trunk-raising of an ancient giant elephant! Vast, boundless, unmatched!</p><p>Such a fist art...</p><p></p><p>Such a fist art! </p><p></p><p>It was the most suitable fist art for this divine monkey, as if it was born for him!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?!"</p><p></p><p>"A self-created martial saint's supreme art?!"</p><p></p><p>What a monster?! Xue Daofu suddenly came to his senses, shocked and terrified, but his mind shrank back, only to find that the golden divine monkey's ape-like single arm had already struck him in the face! Too late, to swing the saber... too late!</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon saber, with its great momentum and force, naturally had a slower swing speed as well!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't keep up...</p><p></p><p>Couldn't keep up with this dead monkey that had changed to another temple divine nature! Six Bureaus!</p><p></p><p>This temple divine nature...</p><p></p><p>Is at the Six Bureaus level! Lunatic! </p><p></p><p>Doesn't he fear being completely possessed and controlled by the Six Bureaus temple deity, becoming a cursed guardian? Even if this dead monkey's physical body is unparalleled, how can it bear the power of the Six Bureaus temple divine nature? But at this moment, what was shocking Xue Daofu's mind was that terrifying whipping punch.</p><p></p><p>His single-armed hand gripping the crescent moon saber suddenly released it.</p><p></p><p>The suddenly lightened single arm, fiercely defended, blocking with a horizontal arm!</p><p></p><p>Boom--!!! The punch landed on the arm!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's grand master-level golden warrior physique, as if at this moment, made a sound like iron being crushed by a dragon and elephant!</p><p></p><p>Then, the terrifying surging air waves instantly submerged everything! Xue Daofu's remaining arm suddenly exploded, the flesh and blood flying, the sinews and bones shattered! And the golden divine monkey, as if not satisfied, punch after punch! His arm trembling, his fist art containing various supreme arts! Blooming in all directions, dazzling! Xue Daofu's arm was continuously pounded for seven punches!</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>It was smashed to pieces!</p><p></p><p>And Xue Daofu, at the moment his arm was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The clenched fist suddenly spread his five fingers, the airflow howling, turning into a palm.</p><p></p><p>"Let me slap your foul mouth!"</p><p></p><p>With a slap...</p><p></p><p>A resounding slap landed on Xue Daofu's cheek!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Poof--! A figure with empty arms, amid the blood mist, howled as it was violently blown back dozens of yards!</p><p>Finally, it crashed heavily onto the long street.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the ground into a crater-like depression, countless shattered stones flew like bullets! Amid the rolling smoke and dust.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's half-swollen and bleeding face, he glared with eyes about to pop out, his whole body shrouded in blood mist, furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Not only was he slapped.</p><p></p><p>His Qiankun Jade was also... gone!</p><p></p><p>This damned monkey, while pounding and slapping him, also casually picked his Qiankun Jade! Damn this monkey! And Xue Daofu still didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Why...</p><p></p><p>This divine monkey wanted to kill him, a grand master!</p><p></p><p>Has he, Xue Daofu... offended this monkey?!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would never have thought...</p><p></p><p>The reason this monkey wanted to beat him to death.</p><p></p><p>Was simply because he had yelled at a little girl three times on the peak of the Golden Light Mountain!</p><p></p><p>A trivial matter that, with his grand master memory, he could barely recall.</p><p></p><p>And this great battle was just a father's venting of anger because his daughter was wronged!</p><p></p><p>You dare to yell at my daughter!</p><p></p><p>Even if you are a grand master!</p><p></p><p>I'll smash you! Poof--</p><p></p><p>In the deep pit, Xue Daofu howled miserably.</p><p></p><p>He, was beaten by a monkey!</p><p></p><p>And had his things stolen! Then...</p><p></p><p>A terror that shook his martial dao will spread from the bottom of his eyes! His other arm...</p><p></p><p>Had been smashed to pieces!</p><p></p><p>He had lost an arm...</p><p></p><p>He might...</p><p></p><p>He might die!</p>

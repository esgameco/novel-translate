        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fei Lei City, inner city.</p><p></p><p>A small courtyard of an independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The cold air condensed the moisture in the sky, and the falling snowflakes landed on his shoulders, silently melting and evaporating.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his eyes, and the airflow in the entire courtyard was turbulent and swirling.</p><p></p><p>The bones in his whole body collided and rumbled, and the blood flow surged up, like a torrential flood bursting forth, emitting a muffled sound from under his skin! "Nine Turnings of Blood Renewal, the true Great Perfection of Blood Renewal..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were burning, and the air he exhaled was as sharp as a knife.</p><p></p><p>"And my inner strength..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, and a surge of heat welled up in his palm, and four black lotus flowers bloomed on his arm.</p><p></p><p>"Prison Lotus Subduing Ghost Inner Strength... Fourth Layer!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful inner strength rolled like waves, merging with the blood and qi, making the strength even more overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>With the Nine Turnings of Blood Renewal, combined with the Fourth Layer inner strength...</p><p></p><p>Now, even without activating [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], Li Che's pure physical cultivation could already unleash nearly Penetrating Meridians-level power. If he activated the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor and cultivated to the extreme, the explosive power could reach the peak of the Penetrating Meridians realm!</p><p></p><p>The Penetrating Meridians realm is further divided into several sub-realms: Qi Meridians, Mysterious Meridians, and Divine Meridians.</p><p></p><p>Qi Meridians cultivators can contend with those who cultivate Tranquil Spirituality.</p><p></p><p>If one reaches the Mysterious Meridians realm, the physical cultivation becomes even more terrifying. Even Tranquil Spirituality cultivators at the level of Tranquil as a Stream can be matched.</p><p></p><p>As for Divine Meridians warriors, they already belong to the pinnacle of the Penetrating Meridians realm, with flesh and blood as strong as high-quality steel, their breathing like that of a raging dragon, and they can even nourish their spirit with their blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>Above the Divine Meridians are the Grandmasters, which are extremely rare!</p><p></p><p>Even for most Tranquil Spirituality cultivators, although they use spiritual cultivation to assist their physical cultivation, allowing them to progress faster, the majority of those who cultivate Tranquil as a River can only reach the initial stage of the Qi Meridians level in their physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only a small number can reach the Mysterious Meridians, and as for the Divine Meridians level, it is even rarer.</p><p></p><p>Even for Tranquil Spirituality cultivators, to cultivate to the Divine Meridians level, they need to endure decades of arduous practice and refinement. They have enjoyed the rapid advancement brought by their spiritual cultivation, how can they then settle their hearts to grind and polish?</p><p></p><p>"In addition to blood, qi, and inner strength..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, the biggest harvest he has gained in the past half year.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, spiritual energy suddenly rushed out from his palm, accompanied by a wailing cry that lingered with his every movement.</p><p></p><p>Wrathful Cry Subduing Ghosts!</p><p></p><p>Li Che has completely mastered the "Cultivation of Tranquil as a Cup" from the司 family's "Nine Luminaries Wrathful Cry Subduing Ghosts Cultivation Record".</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Li Che also discovered a small function of [Untainted Heart].</p><p></p><p>That is, Untainted Heart can also conceal and hide the spiritual energy he has cultivated, just like the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor.</p><p></p><p>It can disguise him as an ordinary person who has never cultivated spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"The fragment of the司 family elder's divine foundation... If I can fully refine it, I'm afraid it can help me advance to the 'Tranquil as a River' realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, even with the help of Untainted Heart, it will still take some time."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered and summarized his current overall strength.</p><p></p><p>The improvement is undoubtedly huge! Now, if he encounters司 Mu Bai again, he doesn't need to ambush, he can directly crush him!</p><p></p><p>Letting out a long sigh, the wild wind howled.</p><p></p><p>After organizing his self-cultivation, Li Che tilted his head up, and the snowflakes fluttered down from the sky, falling on his cheek and melting, feeling very cold.</p><p></p><p>"Today... Xixia is three years old."</p><p></p><p>He murmured.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the heaven and earth became eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>Violent fluctuations came from Li Che's chest, and the Dao Fruit [Immortal Craftsman], [Untainted Heart], and [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] began to palpitate.</p><p></p><p>The familiar scene slowly emerged before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The vast and profound earth, a towering precious tree rose from the ground, its leaves trembling and shimmering. A seven-colored fruit, overflowing with colorful light, flashing the growth scenes of Xixia this year.</p><p></p><p>Jet-black hair flying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly...</p><p></p><p>Another year has passed.</p><p></p><p>A year of guardianship and expectation, finally reaped today.</p><p></p><p>Xixia is three years old, the fourth Dao Fruit...</p><p></p><p>It's here!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Your daughter is three years old, lively and smart, safe and sound, and has obtained the Dao Fruit "Chess Sage"]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes, prompts gradually emerged and intertwined with flashes of light.</p><p></p><p>The fourth Dao fruit! After [Immortal Craftsman], [Dragon-Elephant Vajra], and [Untainted Heart], the fourth Dao fruit - Li Che's heart was filled with immense anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Even though he already had three, he never felt he had too many Dao fruits. </p><p></p><p>Each Dao fruit could bring him tremendous help, whether in his daily life, his martial arts cultivation, or his spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But what role would this fourth Dao fruit play? He had no idea.</p><p></p><p>This gave Li Che a sense of excitement, like opening a blind box.</p><p></p><p>However, when the name of the fourth Dao fruit appeared, Li Che was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Chess... Chess Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed involuntarily, and the joy on his face seemed to freeze a bit.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Wasn't really good at chess.</p><p></p><p>He could play Go, but for other chess games, aside from knowing the basic rules, he was largely ignorant.</p><p></p><p>[Chess Saint (Dao Fruit): The world is like a chess game, with spiritual nature condensed into chess pieces. From the primordial beginning, the pieces are moved by the heart's intent.]</p><p></p><p>His mind fluctuated slightly, and the introduction to the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit quietly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"The world is like a chess game, with spiritual nature condensed into... chess pieces?"</p><p></p><p>"From the primordial beginning, the pieces are moved by the heart's intent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a sense of bewilderment, as if even with the explanation, he still didn't fully understand the underlying principles.</p><p></p><p>Anything related to chess just seemed so mystical.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was not entirely clueless: "Spiritual nature condensed into chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind stirred, and the [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit throbbed, causing pure white spiritual energy to gush forth and swirl around the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy drawn from [Untainted Heart] had no other special properties, only pure, flawless spirituality.</p><p></p><p>Hum-m-m-</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy swirled and gradually... formed a white chess piece in front of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Emitting a pure white glow, it floated in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes held a hint of curiosity, and the next moment, he reached up and grasped the chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Instantly!</p><p></p><p>Like a drop of water falling on a calm lake, ripples spread out in layers.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that his spiritual perception seemed to be instantly elevated. In a flash, the entire Half-Celestial City was perfectly replicated in his spiritual awareness, like a high-definition map.</p><p></p><p>Intersecting lines, like a chessboard, enveloped the entire Half-Celestial City!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly...</p><p></p><p>This scene was like having a North Star satellite, overlooking half the city! Although the people's conversations and movements within the city were still blurry, if he was willing to expend spiritual energy, he could gradually obtain clearer feedback.</p><p></p><p>"You call this... the Chess Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"The Grandmaster Chess Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite surprised by the effects of this fourth Dao fruit...</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fingers holding the piece.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he flicked his finger, and this chess piece condensed from the pure spiritual energy of [Untainted Heart] shot out dozens of meters, landing at the gate of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao fruit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt his vision blur, and when his sight cleared, he found himself standing at the gate where the chess piece was floating, instead of in the center of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Pieces moved by the heart's intent..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood quietly at the gate of the courtyard, as snowflakes fell around him, shredded by the invisible spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>He played with the spiritual chess piece held between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile tugged at the corners of his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Chess Saint, what is the Chess Saint? To control everything within the chess game, that is the true Chess Saint. Within the chessboard, everything is under my observation."</p><p></p><p>"The world is the chessboard, spiritual nature the chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>If he let Xixia carry this chess piece with her...</p><p></p><p>"I will wander freely, moving the pieces by my heart's intent."</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean that if any danger appeared within his chess game perception range around Xixia, </p><p></p><p>he could instantly teleport to her side to eliminate the threat?</p><p></p><p>From now on...</p><p></p><p>Danger, suppress the danger; Yellow-haired, kill the Yellow-haired! He would no longer have to worry about Xixia's safety!</p>

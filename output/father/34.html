        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che brought his uncle's family back to the Xu family's estate. They first stayed in his own courtyard for one night, and the next day he went to find the steward, Xun.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu You had given his approval, Xun the steward did not give them any trouble. Although Xun had become rather cold towards Li Che after the loss of his son, upon further reflection, Xun Changbiao had originally wanted to sacrifice Xixia to pray for a son.</p><p></p><p>The fault lay with his son, not with Li Che's family who were the victims.</p><p></p><p>After smoothly resolving the issue of his uncle's accommodation, Li Che breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>Recalling the oppressive feeling when the Lingying Cult followers were marching on the streets, Li Che couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly. The entire Lingying Cult... they all looked like bad people. They would eventually become a disaster.</p><p></p><p>In the workshop, Li Che paused his carving knife, his black hair flecked with wood shavings, and gazed at the drifting snowflakes in the courtyard, mentally adding the entire Lingying Cult to his personal "must eliminate" list, with the Lingying Patriarch at the very top, circled and highlighted.</p><p></p><p>Day by day, time passed. </p><p></p><p>Ever since the bounty on the Ox Demon was raised to 500 taels, aside from helping his uncle's family, Li Che had chosen to keep a low profile and not take any further action.</p><p></p><p>He had tried to track down the constable Zhao Chuanxiong, but unfortunately, Zhao seemed to know Li Che was trying to kill him and had become cautious and sly. He never appeared alone, and even when traveling, he was accompanied by several constable subordinates. At night, he did not return home, hiding somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't find an opportunity to strike, so he gave up.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the death of that Baguazhang expert who had reached the Tempering the Bones realm, the outskirts of Flying Thunder City seemed to have settled down for a while. But gradually, news of more children being killed started to spread.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were people, evil would never cease.</p><p></p><p>Time slipped through the fingers like sand, turning from spring to summer in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had flown by.</p><p></p><p>At the Xu Family Woodcarving Workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, blowing away the wood shavings on the carving. Amidst the swirling dust, a "Nine Children Embracing the Lotus" statue emerged, lifelike and vivid before him.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had also carved a Nine Children Embracing the Lotus wooden sculpture before, but the one Li Che had carved was even more lively and expressive, with a unique artistic conception, as if the nine children carved were truly alive, playing and frolicking, their voices almost audible.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of his "Immortal Craftsman" Dao Fruit reaching Level 3, imbuing the work with an even richer artistic essence.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, your skills have really improved! You'll probably be promoted to a Fourth-Grade Woodcarver in the next evaluation," said Xu You, standing at the workshop entrance in a silk white robe, holding a jar of wine and smiling warmly.</p><p></p><p>"As a Fourth-Grade Woodcarver, you'll be able to freely come and go between the inner and outer cities. Ah Che, have you considered moving your whole family into the inner city?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che thought about the experts swarming in the inner city, and how the true powerhouses of the Lingying Cult were said to be within. Moving there would be too risky. </p><p></p><p>Just as Old Chen had said, the living conditions in the outer city were a bit worse, but being far from the vortex of intrigue, it was more carefree and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che remain silent for a long time, Xu You waved his hand: "Nevermind, let's not talk about this topic. If you moved to the inner city, it would be a hassle for me to come drink with you."</p><p></p><p>As a member of the family who was not favored and had lost the chance to compete for the position of clan leader, staying in the outer city was like being exiled. Xu You, since returning from clearing out the mysterious temple evil in the outer city, seemed to have taken a liking to Li Che, often coming to drink with him. At first, it may have been with the intention of cultivating him, but over time, he had genuinely come to see Li Che as a friend.</p><p></p><p>Coming to mooch meals at Li Che's little courtyard had become a familiar routine.</p><p></p><p>After work, Li Che and Xu You returned to the small courtyard together.</p><p></p><p>The loquat tree in the courtyard was lush and verdant.</p><p></p><p>Little Xixia was under the loquat tree, gripping a wooden stick, happily shouting and giggling nonstop.</p><p></p><p>One and a half weeks old Xixia was lively and intelligent, almost like a three-year-old child - full of boundless energy, active and agile, her differences from a normal infant becoming increasingly apparent.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che return, Xixia's chubby little face lit up, and she ran towards him on her bare little feet, her topknot bouncing.</p><p></p><p>She came to an abrupt stop in front of Li Che and Xu You, her head almost colliding with Li Che's leg.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, did you bring sugar-coated haws for Xixia to eat? Where are they?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her big eyes, already searching around.</p><p></p><p>But after looking all around, she couldn't find them, and her puffed-out chest deflated in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed and picked up the dejected Xixia. "That was what I promised you the day before yesterday. Didn't I bring you sugar-coated haws just yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia paused, tilting her head. "Really? I forgot the taste of the sugar-coated haws from yesterday..."</p><p></p><p>She stuck out her tongue, licking her lips.</p><p></p><p>Xu You couldn't help but laugh. "Uncle's got you, your daddy didn't buy you any. Your Uncle Xu did."</p><p></p><p>As if performing a magic trick, Xu You suddenly produced a sugar-coated haw, and Xixia cheered excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen pulled over a bamboo chair, sitting under the loquat tree to enjoy the cool breeze. Seeing this, he couldn't help but shake his head and smile. "Third Master, you mustn't spoil little Xixia so much. Eating sugar-coated haws every day will ruin her teeth."</p><p></p><p>Xixia heard this and pouted. "I'm not little Xixia, I'm Warm Xixia, Li Wanxixia!"</p><p></p><p>She muttered and grumbled, her words still carrying a touch of childish sweetness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It made several people unable to help but chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya had just finished bustling in the kitchen, and then she started to prepare the meal. Xu You and Old Chen, who had come to mooch a meal, along with Li Che's family, directly spread out a table in the courtyard and started eating in the summer evening.</p><p></p><p>Xu You very much enjoyed this feeling. He lived alone in the outer city, and ate and did everything alone. Now, this lively and comfortable atmosphere made him cherish it very much.</p><p></p><p>Picking up a piece of pork head meat, Xu You looked at Li Che and said, "Ache, in this period of time... the movements of the Lingying Sect have become bigger and bigger."</p><p></p><p>"Within the inner city, the Lingying Sect has joined hands with the Shi family... to extend their hands towards the lingying infants of the other three families, which is equivalent to breaking with the other three major families. Several people at the Juegun Boundary have already died."</p><p></p><p>"The Shi family can no longer bear this wrath, and the instigator Shi Mubaiwas driven out of the inner city, and the power of the Lingying Sect in the inner city has also been thoroughly cleaned up, with the majority retreating to the outer city..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a sip of wine: "Since the three major families in the inner city have fallen out with the Lingying Sect, why don't they completely eradicate the power of the Lingying Sect? Why not kill them thoroughly?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen gave a cold laugh: "This Lingying Sect originated from a mysterious temple outside the city. How could it be so easy to clean up? Those Lingying Sect members, the upper echelons are basically those who hide their identities behind masks... The source of their power is complex and intricate. How could they be cleaned up thoroughly?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, maybe the upper echelons of the three major families, or even the upper echelons of the government office, have powerful figures from the Lingying Sect."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen seemed to be accustomed to such things, and his cold words carried a touch of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"If this matter of the Lingying Sect is not handled properly, Feiluo City... will eventually be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the dining table fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's brows furrowed and then relaxed...</p><p></p><p>He looked at Old Chen, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen gulped down a whole bowl of wine, slamming the bowl on the table: "The three shopkeepers also know my origins. I was originally a refugee from Zhouyan City in the north. I will never forget how Zhouyan City was destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You sighed, not saying much, only looking at Li Che: "In this period of time, keep an eye on Xixie, don't let her wander around... After the Lingying Sect matter is over, or after next year's infant selection, I will try to get her into the 'Shenxiu Academy' established by the major families of Feiluo City. Then she will have some protection."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have also received news that the Shenzong will send powerful figures down the mountain to recruit disciples next year. Unfortunately, Xixie is a bit too young, I don't know if she can catch the eye of the Shenzong disciples. I'll try to arrange it then. If she can enter the Shenzong, Xixie will no longer have to worry about the threat of the Lingying Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In the face of the mighty Shenzong, the Lingying Sect... is pitifully weak."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Lingying Sect will most likely go crazy before the Shenzong disciples arrive."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, filled his own cup, and toasted Xu You.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of Xixie... I'll leave it to you, Old Xu."</p><p></p><p>Xu You rolled his eyes, but still raised his cup in return.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so distant, Xixie and I are very close."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu You's words, Li Che listened to them carefully and did not take Xixie out to wander around.</p><p></p><p>He also specifically observed that the outer city had indeed become more chaotic, and the Lingying Sect members were more active, even outside Xu's woodcarving shop, there were often martial artists leaping from rooftops, coveting it ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>However, the guard team organized by Xu You with many martial artist woodcarvers had strengthened the patrols, and after Xu You personally killed a cultivator at the Juegun Boundary who was coveting it, the Lingying Sect finally became a bit more restrained.</p><p></p><p>But in other places, the Lingying Sect was still extremely active.</p><p></p><p>In the outer city of Feiluo, in this half year, it had fallen into a chorus of lamentations, with many bereaved citizens going to the government office to file complaints.</p><p></p><p>The patrol officers of the government office organized a team to patrol, but the effect was minimal, as the evil members of the Lingying Sect seemed to be able to know the news in advance.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this chaos, half a year passed, but the chaos not only did not improve, but became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, and early winter quietly arrived.</p><p></p><p>Half a year had passed unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, two years old.</p><p></p><p>Outer City, Listening to Rain Alley.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard rented by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, and the snowflakes falling from the sky, as soon as they fell on his body, were shattered into snow mist by the internal energy surging within him, like a dragon-like snake.</p><p></p><p>Slowly opening his eyes, the internal energy was restrained, all returning to the Dao Fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor].</p><p></p><p>"The Serpent Internal Energy... has reached the Third Heaven. This internal energy technique has also reached its limit."</p><p></p><p>"To break through to the Fourth Heaven of internal energy, I need to get a superior internal energy technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, and the surging airflow sprayed out of his mouth like a sharp arrow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Dao Fruit [Immortal Craftsman] and [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] in his chest cavity pulsed slightly! The familiar scene appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the vast earth, a precious tree towering into the clouds rose up, its countless leaves trembling and sparkling, and on it, a seven-colored fruit slowly formed, the fruit glowing and flowing, reflecting the many growth scenes of Xixie over the past year.</p><p></p><p>With long black hair, Li Che's eyes were bright.</p><p></p><p>Another year of expectation has finally blossomed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xixie is two years old, the third Dao Fruit...</p><p></p><p>Finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Your daughter is two years old, safe and sound, without illness or disaster, and you have obtained a Dao Fruit "Untainted Heart"]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

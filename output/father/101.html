        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bitter winter has passed, and early spring has arrived.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain drizzles on endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth still accompany the bitter cold.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated rainwater extracts the heat from the heavens and earth, bringing a chill that accompanies the spring breeze, sweeping across the land, seeming even more bone-piercing than the thick snow of the deep winter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a horse-faced mask, has his entire being sunk into the utmost stillness, without a sound, his eyes deep and gloomy, swiftly dashing through the streets of the capital city.</p><p></p><p>His speed is extremely fast, each step of his toes touching down like a dragonfly skimming the water, causing the accumulated water to ripple and spread, his entire body gliding and shooting forth, covering several meters in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He is running in the direction away from the Qin Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Namo Arhat Bodhi Barrett" was manufactured by Li Che based on the concept of a sniper rifle from his previous life. The basic idea is the same, perhaps the craftsmanship is different, but Li Che is at the Arhat Lv.3 level of attainment, combined with the analytical ability of the Thousand Slicer, synchronizing the production according to the power and effect.</p><p></p><p>The destructive power presented should be about the same.</p><p></p><p>Namo Arhat Gatling is for area coverage, firing a thousand rounds per second.</p><p></p><p>While the latter is mainly characterized by its penetration and explosive power.</p><p></p><p>It can achieve long-range sniping, the range... is far greater than the Arhat Gatling improved from the wood-rendered crow.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, the two are not the same conceptual mechanism.</p><p></p><p>The black clothing blends into the spring waters, the horse-faced Li Che becomes extremely calm, as if everything in the heavens and earth is captured and listened to in his every breath.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's personality actually has multiple facets, most of the time the personality presented to others is the normal temperament or the public persona.</p><p></p><p>But often, in private, the personality exhibited can be completely different.</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that he is like this.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the cute ox-faced mask, becoming the Ox Demon, he becomes irritable, reckless, and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>In times of killing, he relies more on his martial arts cultivation, his physical body swelling, his great sinews trembling, using brute force as the main method.</p><p></p><p>But with the horse-faced mask, Li Che becomes very calm, not liking to meet force with force, preferring long-range killing.</p><p></p><p>Archery, sniping, and the like... are very suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Locking the soul within a hundred li, restraining the life within a thousand li! This is the horse-face.</p><p></p><p>But fundamentally, the Ox Demon and the Horse-face are both Li Che...</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] attainment in his chest cavity is constantly trembling, the heavenly and earthly chessboard network is expanding and spreading.</p><p></p><p>Gradually enveloping half of the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Prefecture City is too large, much larger than the Flying Thunder City, the range of the Arhat Barrett is very long, combined with the targeting of the [Chess Saint] attainment's heavenly and earthly chessboard, the scope of the sight is basically eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che can achieve long-range strikes.</p><p></p><p>There will only be one shot, one shot, whether successful or not, Li Che will end today's assassination.</p><p></p><p>The threat brought by Qin Yuqing is too great, if left unchecked, allowing the enemy to gradually erode and approach, slowly affecting his family, this is not what Li Che desires.</p><p></p><p>He specifically chose today because he had an appointment with Shangguan Qinghong to attend the client's examination at the Qin Tian Observatory today.</p><p></p><p>This can provide him with an alibi for his assassination.</p><p></p><p>Everything must be stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Stability is also a beautiful virtue.</p><p></p><p>Tap—</p><p></p><p>With one step, Li Che's tall figure suddenly stopped, no longer advancing, the surrounding spring rain swaying, the spring wind biting.</p><p></p><p>The cold raindrops pounded the straw hat, making a muffled sound.</p><p></p><p>But the eyes behind the horse-face mask burst with dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, at this moment he is located outside the outer city of the Golden Light Prefecture City, about tens of miles away from the Qin Manor.</p><p></p><p>"About right."</p><p></p><p>Having chosen the location, Li Che's gaze flashed like lightning, suddenly raising his head, water droplets dripping from the angular jaw under the horse-face mask.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly chessboard, the network unfurls! Continuing to spread, spread...</p><p></p><p>Soon, it had enveloped the Qin Manor within its own perception.</p><p></p><p>There is a divine relative expert guarding the Qin Manor, Li Che also dares not underestimate, the chessboard network of the heavenly and earthly chessboard continues to expand, quickly seeping into the interior of the Qin Manor, the perspective within the Qin Manor then surges into Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because the aura of Qin Yuqing has been locked on, the moment the chessboard envelops the Qin Manor, Qin Yuqing's aura appears on the chessboard, emitting a dense black aura.</p><p></p><p>That is the intense killing intent directed at him! Li Che's eyebrows under the mask raise slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What a poisonous woman, the desire to kill me is so intense..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che reflects, this poisonous woman should have no evidence to prove that he killed her son Cao Qingyuan.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Li Che is a wood carving master from Flying Thunder City, cultured and amiable, kind to others, but this poisonous woman, without any evidence, still has such intense killing intent towards an honest man.</p><p></p><p>It is probably because he comes from Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>Just because of this, she wants to kill him...</p><p></p><p>If this is not a poisonous woman, then what is? Li Che's heart sinks, his killing intent also diffusing, no longer having the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Raising the Arhat Barrett he is gripping, the interwoven patterns engraved on it can contain divine nature and blood qi, this is the characteristic of the dragon tooth boxwood, a seventh-grade spiritual wood, naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings are silent, Li Che stands on the black-tiled roof, opens his horse stance, and then cups the mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Raising the arc slightly, under the lock of the heavenly and earthly chessboard, he aims bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the deep black aura of Qin Yuqing's aura in the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Under the horse-face mask, Li Che has no expression.</p><p></p><p>Horse-face, locking the soul within a hundred li! Restraining the life within a thousand li!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Li Che's body suddenly swells, but he does not fully unleash the Golden Vajra Elephant, only his flesh swelling by a circle, the powerful blood qi completely infused into the Arhat Barrett.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored light instantly comes alive, wrapping and spreading, circling as if charging, converging entirely into the gun barrel.</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Che, the [Three-Eyed Furious True Lord] divine foundation suddenly emerges.</p><p></p><p>And, to ensure the accuracy of the killing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind moves.</p><p></p><p>In the chessboard, a deep black temple god spiritual chess piece suddenly appears before Li Che, "bang" exploding, also fusing into that dragon tooth Bodhi within the gun barrel.</p><p></p><p>The momentum rises step by step.</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain completely distorts!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth suddenly fall silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only feels that he is left with the sound of his own breathing in the mask.</p><p></p><p>"Namo Arhat."</p><p></p><p>"Explode."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thunderously pulls the trigger.</p><p></p><p>In an instant...</p><p></p><p>As if a divine rope twisted into a string suddenly snapped, the dike holding back the river torrents opened the floodgates! Boom—!!! A heaven-shaking roar, instantly erupting from the scarlet-red mechanism gripped by Li Che, a powerful shockwave immediately sweeping up countless spring rains, rippling out in concentric circles, the formless energy ripples, like a lotus flower in full bloom behind Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The black tiles beneath his feet all shattered and crumbled, being transmitted by the terrible vibrating force, scattering and flying up, the broken black tiles fragmenting further into countless powders.</p><p></p><p>The fierce gale suddenly whipped up Li Che's clothes, tightly clinging to his muscular physique, perfectly outlining the towering muscle lines!</p><p></p><p>Bang! Li Che retreated a step under the recoil, heavily stomping a foot down.</p><p></p><p>A roar like a dragon's cry seems to burst forth from the gun barrel.</p><p></p><p>Scorching radiant light, like a meandering dragon, like a thunderclap behind the clouds! Before the explosive force even bursts open, a scorching radiant light, wrapped in a rolling air current, distorting and shattering countless spring rains, pulling out the void in the air! Sweeping across the skies of the Golden Light Prefecture City! At the moment Li Che fired the Bodhi dragon tooth from tens of miles away, he no longer cared whether this shot could hit, whether it could kill Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>He took off the horse-face mask, his aura completely suppressed, putting away the "Namo Arhat Bodhi Barrett".</p><p></p><p>A white jade-like chess piece floats in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qin Manor.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing sits gracefully and elegantly, her voluptuous figure tightly outlining the robes, revealing much of her fair and tender skin under the fabric.</p><p></p><p>She is thinking, thinking about who exactly killed her gray-faced spy.</p><p></p><p>She first suspects Li Che, this wood carving master from Flying Thunder City, the suspicion is great.</p><p></p><p>After all, her spy was assigned to monitor Li Che, but unexpectedly returned to seek her out, only to be shot dead at the gates of the Qin Manor.</p><p></p><p>But she also cannot rule out the Gongyang family, because the [Furious Giant Spirit God] divine nature of the Gongyang family is also of the wrathful divine lineage, and the Qin family and the Gongyang family are originally not on good terms, Qin Yuqing has secretly eliminated several branch members of the Gongyang family, torturing them to death.</p><p></p><p>So the Gongyang family also has suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the bald monks of the Heart Monkey Temple also have motives...</p><p></p><p>Rubbing her temples, Qin Yuqing really feels a headache.</p><p></p><p>"Archer... Three-Eyed Furious True Lord divine nature..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that the waste Cao Guang really didn't die?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's slender eyes opened slightly, a gleam of light flashing.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a person from the Divine Sect's branch?"</p><p></p><p>"The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord, the main gate of the Cloud State Qianyuan Divine Sect, just suppresses such a mysterious temple, the temple god there, seems to be the three-eyed..."</p><p></p><p>"But the possibility is extremely low..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing lazily stretched, looking at the human-sized bronze mirror, seeing the voluptuous and beautiful reflection in the mirror,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her appearance was still as beautiful, and her vermilion lips couldn't help but open slightly.</p><p></p><p>She was still so beautiful, even after having a child, she was still a radiant flower.</p><p></p><p>Back then, how could she have been so blind as to marry that useless man Cao Guang from Feilei City? Apart from having a handsome face, what else did he have? She had once been completely infatuated with him, and even gave birth to a son for him.</p><p></p><p>As a result, now in the Jinguang Prefecture, she no longer had any value for intermarriage with other families. If not for her own exceptional talents and excellent skills, she would not have become a true disciple of the Jinjie Gate. Otherwise, how could she have attained her current status in Jinguang Prefecture? Although she is known as the "Jade-faced Demonic Rakshasi", this is also a form of respect. "It's a pity for my son..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing thought of her son, and her heart still ached slightly. As a mother, she always viewed her son as a precious gem in the palm of her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, child, mother won't let you die in vain. Mother will send your corpse to the Corpse God Sect, so that you can live on in another way..."</p><p></p><p>"Mother will avenge you, can't find the culprit? All those from Feilei City are suspects, they are all the killers..."</p><p></p><p>"Mother will... kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Silently grieving in her heart, yet also filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, there seemed to be an extremely sharp sound, vaguely like a thunderclap tearing through the hazy clouds.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing was startled, suddenly opening her eyes. In the next moment, her willow-leaf brows trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>Her lush and tender body trembled uncontrollably, her hairs standing on end!</p><p></p><p>"What is that?!"</p><p></p><p>She abruptly turned around and saw a stream of light shooting in from the outside, countless waves of energy sweeping through the heavens and earth, like a furious dragon bursting out from the Nine Dragon River!</p><p></p><p>Like a rainbow piercing the sky, tearing through the azure heavens!</p><p></p><p>Fast! Too fast! From the moment Qin Yuqing saw it to when she reacted, the stream of light had already arrived, descending into the Qin Mansion!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying heat, like a blazing sun plummeting down! As a newly breakthrough Zongshi master, Qin Yuqing's eyesight was extremely keen, and she saw the stream of light shooting over, causing the air to ripple with shallow waves, and waves of white energy exploding around it.</p><p></p><p>The explosion had not yet arrived, but the stream of light was already there! Too fast! In the time it took for Qin Yuqing to blink her eyes, the stream of light had already entered the small courtyard of the Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Causing a great commotion!</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the Qin Mansion, the dormant divine ancestor's divine sense immediately sensed this terrifying stream of light!</p><p></p><p>Countless divine essences, like the surging waves of a great river, erupted.</p><p></p><p>But this stream of light was too fast! It was only a matter of blinks of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The stream of light invaded the small courtyard, almost at the speed of breaking the sound barrier, rushing towards Qin Yuqing, who was standing in front of the mirror admiring her own beauty.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's hairs stood on end, her newly broken through Zongshi's sixth sense making her feel an unprecedented sense of danger. She almost instinctively activated her own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Behind her, a huge divine foundation suddenly floated up, like a jade plate at the back of her head, emitting a mournful ghostly wail.</p><p></p><p>Divine essence, qi and blood, were all mobilized by her at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But she, it seemed, could only do this much.</p><p></p><p>That blood-colored stream of light was already right in front of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's eyes froze, staring at the thing that had dispersed the stream of light, revealing its true form - a drop of tear, a blood-colored tear, like amber.</p><p></p><p>Made of spirit wood material, with delicate patterns engraved all over it, extremely demanding in terms of craftsmanship and technique, almost divine, these patterns were filled with divine essence.</p><p></p><p>When it approached within ten steps of her, the divine essence on it suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying positional pressure, like a mountain pressing down on her, made her unable to mobilize her divine essence, and her entire body's qi and blood became stiff! "This is... the divine essence of a temple deity!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone wants to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"Unreasonable..."</p><p></p><p>"Kill me!"</p><p></p><p>A scream finally burst out from Qin Yuqing's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Her qi, blood, and divine essence were all concentrated in front of her, almost instinctively as a last-ditch effort to save her life.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Poof! A violent tremor erupted, and that drop of blood-colored tear, with unparalleled penetrating power, pierced through Qin Yuqing's divine essence and qi.</p><p></p><p>Even Zongshi true qi could not resist it at all, being ruthlessly torn apart.</p><p></p><p>That penetrating power was too strong! Qin Yuqing's eyes were bloodshot, and she clearly saw everything shattering, saw that tear-like thing pierce through her proud chest, tearing open her pale skin, and entering her chest.</p><p></p><p>Then, she felt that tear...</p><p></p><p>Exploding inside her body!</p><p></p><p>Bang! In an instant, Qin Yuqing felt a thousand cuts of pain, her entire body directly torn into pieces, and her consciousness immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Splash splash...</p><p></p><p>Countless pieces of flesh and blood were scattered into blood beads.</p><p></p><p>That was the moment when the Bodhi Tears exploded inside the human body, and the coiled Bodhi wood fibers tore off pieces of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>These pieces of flesh and blood turned into blood-colored beads, scattered all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The terrifying penetrating force, after exploding Qin Yuqing, violently crashed into the ground of the Qin Mansion, causing the entire house to be completely destroyed in an instant, countless precious items reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>The ground was even blasted into a crater five meters in diameter, with thick smoke billowing from it and faint flames flickering within.</p><p></p><p>Everything fell silent, the surging waves of energy seemed to have been cut off, and the drizzling spring rain resumed its light patter.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Mansion experienced about five or six breaths of dead silence.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a mighty aura erupted, one figure after another rushing over from various directions of the Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>However, the hovering divine ancestor let out an angry roar, causing these core and branch disciples of the Qin family to abandon their curiosity to go take a look.</p><p></p><p>But the direct descendants of the Qin family had almost all gathered outside Qin Yuqing's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>When they pushed open the door and saw the ruins of the small courtyard, saw Qin Yuqing's tragic state, a look of endless bewilderment flashed in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>After the bewilderment, came towering terror!</p><p></p><p>No... how could she have died like this? A stream of light from the sky struck Qin Yuqing, and she died on the spot, torn into pieces, her flesh and blood turned into beads.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful red face was instantly transformed into a red powder skeleton with the flesh torn off.</p><p></p><p>Such a death was truly too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just killing whoever they want? Unstoppable! A divine archer? But this could no longer be explained by a divine archer, where did this stream of light come from? Why, even from such a distance, could its power be so terrifying as to kill a Zongshi master with a divine foundation?</p><p></p><p>Like a dark cloud, it hung heavily over the heads of the two Qin brothers.</p><p></p><p>Causing their hearts and guts to tremble, their hands and feet to turn ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>An extremely aged figure appeared in the courtyard where Qin Yuqing had been slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The two Qin Baonan hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Venerable Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Qin Mansion's divine ancestor cultivator, also the foundation of the Qin family as a divine ancestor lineage!</p><p></p><p>The Qin family's venerable ancestor radiated divine essence, like a living deity walking out of a painting, like a sculpture that could move.</p><p></p><p>The old man was extremely aged, his entire body emanating an extremely thick death aura, as if he was about to enter the earth at any moment.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was hazy as he appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Like the deeply furrowed bark of a thousand-year-old tree, his face trembled.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, one of the blood beads torn from Qin Yuqing floated into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Pressing his index finger and thumb, he crushed the flesh and blood, and a coiled spirit wood fiber was squeezed out.</p><p></p><p>"Seventh-grade spirit wood... Dragon Tooth Boxwood..."</p><p></p><p>"And containing divine essence, the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord, as well as... the divine essence of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord's Spiritual Child Temple Deity..."</p><p></p><p>"This is not an arrow..."</p><p></p><p>"But the way of a mechanism."</p><p></p><p>"The Tong family... mechanism..."</p><p></p><p>The old man's hazy gaze suddenly became extremely profound.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The white [Untainted Heart] divine essence chess piece was gripped in Li Che's palm.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che opened his eyes, the terrifying howling gale brought by the Dragon Tooth Bodhi had long since dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Everything had returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>He did not know whether that Dragon Tooth Bodhi shot had killed Qin Yuqing or not.</p><p></p><p>A true sniper never looks back at the result.</p><p></p><p>The surging spring wind and rain had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>The warmth of the charcoal stove permeated the eaves-drooping pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Brushing off the raindrops on his black outfit, having finished his task, Li Che's expression was refined and gentle.</p><p></p><p>Holding his head high and full of vigor, he stepped into the Qingtian Observatory.</p>

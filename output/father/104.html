        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Has this boy been to the Three Prince Temple outside the city?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed Vice Supervisor's robe fluttered without wind as he narrowed his eyes at the serene wooden statue placed on the tea table.</p><p></p><p>Although... it was only at the Tenth Rank level, its divinity was quite weak.</p><p></p><p>But for a master woodcarver, through a wooden sculpture, one could sense what the carver wanted to express - a meaning conveyed through the technique, lines, and patterns.</p><p></p><p>The reason why they are masters is that they have mastered an art to the extreme, and if they want to seek a breakthrough, they can only present and express it differently in terms of meaning.</p><p></p><p>Some masters of freehand ink painting, with just a few strokes, may seem like random splashes of ink at first glance, but upon careful observation, a unique beauty, a beauty of meaning, can be discovered.</p><p></p><p>Carving... is the same.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng and Lady Gong Yunli were both bewildered by the Vice Supervisor's words.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Supervisor, are you referring to the 'Furious Eight-Armed Prince of Hell' temple, the strange temple outside the city?" Lady Gong Yunli couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor, dressed in white, had a delicate appearance, looking like a handsome young man of seventeen or eighteen. He gave Lady Gong Yunli an impatient glance. "Little Gong, don't be brainless..."</p><p></p><p>"Are there other Prince temples outside the city?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lady Gong Yunli immediately felt embarrassed. She looked down at her own prominent bosom, and the Vice Supervisor... just loved to tell the whole truth.</p><p></p><p>"He must not have gone in there, nor seen the temple's deity..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che's blood cultivation is only at the level of blood refinement, and his divinity is only as pure as a stream... He cannot even enter the Mysterious Pavilion, let alone the strange temple."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we... were to forcibly enter the strange temple while bearing the temple deity's pressure, we might not be able to reach the temple altar and see the furious eight-armed Prince of Hell deity."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng spoke up in a deep voice from the side.</p><p></p><p>"That's indeed the case..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if that little fellow has hidden his cultivation, he couldn't have hidden so much."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor nodded, walked up to the wooden sculpture, and raised his finger, gently caressing the carved lines.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, and with each inch his fingers slid across the sculpture, it seemed to evoke a strange sensation that made the hair on his body stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"This wood carving assignment was set by me. I spent a few breaths of time simply roughing out the initial form, but this boy... not only perfectly continued my carving ideas and techniques, but also in the latter half, infused his own understanding and feelings."</p><p></p><p>"He must never have seen the true deity, yet he was able to depict something almost identical to it through his own imagination."</p><p></p><p>"This boy... is like me."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor slowly opened his eyes, a gentle smile curling at the corners of his lips.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "This boy... has the qualifications of a Special-Grade Guest Official."</p><p></p><p>These words immediately shocked Gongyang Liancheng and Lady Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>This evaluation... was too high!</p><p></p><p>Guest Officials are usually divided into three grades: Third, Second, and First. A First-Grade Guest Official, placed in the Astronomical Observatory of the capital city, would even have a status surpassing theirs as Junior Supervisors.</p><p></p><p>Because of the identity of a First-Grade Guest Official, even if they went to other cities or even provincial capitals, they would still be able to get by.</p><p></p><p>But they were only Junior Supervisors of the Astronomical Observatory in the Golden Light Prefecture. If they left the Golden Light Prefecture and went to other prefectures, they would naturally be a grade lower. If they went to provincial capitals or even the Great Deity Capital, they would be two or three grades lower!</p><p></p><p>Let alone... a Special-Grade Guest Official!</p><p></p><p>Lady Gong Yunli was even more disbelieving, shaking her head, her ample bosom heaving up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Supervisor, are you... excessively praising a newcomer! You can't just flatter him because he was recommended by Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng regained his senses, his face darkening.</p><p></p><p>Oh, little Yunli, how can you speak to your superior like that? Can you say such words?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Vice Supervisor's brow furrowed. "Excessively praising? Am I flattering a newcomer because of Li Qingshan?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Gong, do you remember how many articles there are in the total regulations for formal Astronomical Observatory officials jointly drafted by the Chief Supervisor and Vice Supervisor of the Astronomical Observatory in the Divine Capital?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Gong Yunli: "There are a total of 108 Astronomical Observatory regulations."</p><p></p><p>"You remembered very well. Go back and copy them 20 times. Tomorrow, bring them to me for inspection. If there is even one word missing or wrong, you will be fined 10 Divine Essence Crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lady Gong Yunli was suddenly alarmed, gritting her teeth in resentment. Settling personal grudges, how unreasonable! The Vice Supervisor's eyes narrowed as he glared at Lady Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>"30 times!"</p><p></p><p>Lady Gong Yunli immediately lowered her unwilling head, forgetting that this old man had a similar heart-reading divine art.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Supervisor, I still have to say, casually proclaiming someone has the qualifications of a Special-Grade Guest Official... is too much flattery of a newcomer!"</p><p></p><p>Lady Gong Yunli quite liked Li Che, a good woodcarving master, who was amiable and had a gentle temperament. She didn't want this young man to be crushed by such high praise.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lady Gong Yunli quickly tucked her white robe and hurriedly slipped away.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gongyang Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>"The Vice Supervisor has keen eyes and is right. I also feel that this boy has limitless potential and the qualifications of a Special-Grade Guest Official!"</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng loudly expressed his agreement, not being as brainless and iron-headed as Lady Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>Opposing a superior, what's the point? Gongyang Liancheng's motto was...</p><p></p><p>One flattering word is worth a thousand in gold!</p><p></p><p>"Remind little Gong not to spread this evaluation around. Calling it excessive flattery of a newcomer... I'm afraid she'll let it slip first."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor was weary. His two subordinates, one was as stubborn as iron, the other as flattering as could be...</p><p></p><p>They were truly both fragrant and foul.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng naturally understood, solemnly nodding, "The Vice Supervisor's consideration is to be prepared for the unexpected. No wonder you are the Supervisor. Your subordinate is sincerely..."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up and leave."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng made a deep bow, hands lowered to the ground, and slowly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Within the tea room, the fragrance of tea lingered.</p><p></p><p>Tranquil as usual.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor's fingers caressed the statue, and in a moment of reverie, he seemed to see the figure of someone in red robes, stirring the vast sea...</p><p></p><p>"Recommended by Li Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>"Such talent, not sent to the Divine Sect, but instead sent to the Astronomical Observatory to be a Guest Official... for what purpose? In another five years... it will be the time when the Furious Three Prince of Hell Temple's Mysterious Pavilion shakes and forms a calamity..."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Cult..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a turbulent time."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Supervisor withdrew his hand from touching the statue and closed his eyes, rubbing his temples.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his fingers paused, and his slender eyes opened.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps... this Li Qingshan fellow is suspecting a schism in the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the rain, the sky cleared, and the sun, rarely emerging from the thick lead-colored clouds, shone down on the world, reflecting a rippling surface.</p><p></p><p>Li Che left the Astronomical Observatory Treasure Hall, his mood extremely good.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Third-Grade Guest Official of the Astronomical Observatory, he could enjoy the Observatory's resources while also obtaining many good things.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he had obtained a tiger skin, enough to make many powers in the prefecture city wary of him. It could ensure the safety of his little family for some years.</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want much, just a peaceful and stable life.</p><p></p><p>Quietly watching his daughter grow up, watching her cultivation reach maturity.</p><p></p><p>This was a simple and modest wish of an old father.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a good mood as he walked on the wide street in the prefecture city, wide enough to accommodate ten horse-drawn carriages side by side.</p><p></p><p>Inhaling the fresh air after the rain, basking in the spring breeze that soothed the heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che planned to go to the留香阁 (Lingering Fragrance Pavilion) to order some good wine and dishes, go back and celebrate, especially the roast duck from Lingering Fragrance Pavilion, get a few more, as his daughter and wife both loved to eat it.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not let his guard down. After all, he had killed Qin Yuqing...</p><p></p><p>Although he was sure he had left no clues related to himself, and even if the Qin family really came to his door, without evidence, they wouldn't be able to do anything to him with his status as a Guest Official of the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>But there are no absolutes in this world, what if the Qin family produced another Qin Yuqing-like venomous woman? The kind who thinks they can kill you just because they want to, and even the passing dog should be stabbed...</p><p></p><p>So Li Che still had to be vigilant, not to let his guard down. Even in the prefecture city, this world was not safe, and perhaps for a long time, he would have to tread carefully.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, Li Che's mind stirred, the Chess Sage Dao Fruit trembled, and the Heaven and Earth Chess Board's enveloping spread expanded.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the three Qin family's gray-faced secret agents who had been tracking and investigating him had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>With Qin Yuqing's death, these three people must have returned to the Qin family to report the situation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they had provided him with proof of his entry into the Astronomical Observatory, proof that he could not have harmed Qin Yuqing, as he had shot her in a different direction in the Astronomical Observatory Treasure Hall.</p><p></p><p>After ordering the wine and dishes, Li Che did not immediately return to his own small courtyard, but first went to another courtyard he had purchased, the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in a chair, heating water, and brewing a pot of tea.</p><p></p><p>Amid the swaying spring breeze, sipping a good tea, his mood became even more beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Then, he began to organize the gains he had obtained after becoming a Third-Grade Guest Official of the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Name: Li Che】</p><p></p><p>【Bonds: Li Nuan Xi (daughter)】</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruits: Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 68%), Dragon Elephant Vajra (Lv3, 13%), Untainted Heart (Lv2, 18%), Chess Sage (Lv2, 7%)】</p><p></p><p>【Nascent Divine Arts: Immortal Craftsman·Thousand Analysis Hands, Dragon Elephant Vajra·Ascend the Tower】</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the feedback on the Dao fruit, only to see that the "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit had suddenly increased in maturity by 20%.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly taken aback. Could the statue he had carved in the Qin Tian Observatory have provided such a large feedback? No, it must be because he had completed the "Namo Immortal Craftsman Bodhi Barrett" and then carved that statue in the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had carved divine statues at the Tenth Rank before, but an increase of this magnitude in maturity was a bit strange - there must be a reason for it.</p><p></p><p>Could it be related to the image he had envisioned and infused into the wooden carving, of a deity with four arms, red ribbons dancing across the four seas, stepping on a golden wheel? Li Che's eyes gleamed, and his heart began to grow warm. If that was the case, he may have found a method to quickly increase the maturity of the Immortal Craftsman Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>He didn't rush to experiment, as it was already late in the day, and carving another four-armed, wrathful Third Prince deity wood carving might not be finished in time.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, he took out the other harvests he had obtained after becoming a Third-Rank Guest Chamberlain from his Spatial Ring.</p><p></p><p>A glimmering crystal stone fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>A soothing sensation emanated from the crystal stone.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Crystal... a divine object that can only be obtained in the Mysterious Chasm. Lady Shangguan said that the higher-level divine objects, elixirs, and divine weapons in the Qin Tian Observatory can only be purchased using Divine Crystals, not with common gold and silver."</p><p></p><p>Li Che held the crystal stone, but what stirred his emotions the most was the divine essence contained within the Divine Crystal...</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the same pure white divine essence as the "Untainted Heart"! "The same source? Both are pure, untainted divine essences?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze sharpened, and the next moment, his divine sense surged out, guiding the divine essence within the Divine Crystal. However, as his divine sense made contact with the divine essence in the crystal, the "Untainted Heart" in his chest suddenly began to beat rapidly!</p><p></p><p>Like a hungry, gaping mouth, it abruptly opened wide.</p><p></p><p>The silky-smooth divine essence from the Tenth-Rank Divine Crystal was drawn out and completely absorbed into the "Untainted Heart".</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (Lv2, 20%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "!!!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need the Thousand Slicer, the divine essence in the Divine Crystal was directly devoured and enjoyed in a smooth, voracious gulp! The maturity of the Untainted Heart Dao fruit had directly increased by 2%!</p><p></p><p>This was unbelievable! If he could get forty more of these Tenth-Rank Divine Crystals, the Untainted Heart Dao fruit would be able to reach Lv3 maturity!</p><p></p><p>A shortcut! In the small courtyard, Li Che's eyes gleamed brightly, or rather... this was the correct way to nurture the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>In Fei Lei City, he had hardly been able to access Divine Crystals, only able to diligently cultivate and absorb the divine essence from heaven and earth to nourish the Untainted Heart.</p><p></p><p>But now that he was in the capital city... with more resources available, it was different.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, as a Third-Rank Guest Chamberlain, he only received ten Tenth-Rank Divine Crystals per month.</p><p></p><p>To gather forty Divine Crystals would take a year...</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath: "No matter, take it slowly, no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>His mood settled, and Li Che became calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, now that I've become a Third-Rank Guest Chamberlain, in addition to the monthly stipend, I should also be able to earn Divine Crystals through divine wood carvings..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, feeling that the future was becoming increasingly brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the divine essence of my Untainted Heart has reached the level of 'nourishing like a river'. To condense the Untainted Heart divine foundation, I'll need to reach Lv3..."</p><p></p><p>In the past, Li Che didn't know how long it would take, but now with the Divine Crystals, the speed should be much faster.</p><p></p><p>He took out the second Divine Crystal and activated the Untainted Heart to absorb it.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the divine essence from the Tenth-Rank Divine Crystal was completely devoured, leaving only a dull, lifeless crystal.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a Tenth-Rank Divine Crystal, there are even higher-quality Divine Crystals..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but grow increasingly eager.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because this silky-smooth process of absorbing the divine essence from the Divine Crystals made Li Che's pores expand, and he felt incredibly comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The absorbed divine essence not only entered the Untainted Heart Dao fruit, but also cleansed and purified his physical body!</p><p></p><p>Three Divine Crystals were quickly devoured by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Untainted Heart Dao fruit had also reached 24%, this rapid maturation making Li Che's mood even more joyful.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the three empty crystals, Li Che felt a sense of loss for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Without the divine essence, the Divine Crystals have lost their currency function and become ordinary crystals."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly thought of something and grabbed a Divine Crystal, pondering.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed the divine essence from the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord" divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that this attributed divine essence colliding with the crystal shell of the Divine Crystal was as if it was being shielded, making it much more difficult to release and activate.</p><p></p><p>"The empty shell of the Divine Crystal... is a good material for transmitting untainted divine essence. If it's incorporated into the 'Spiritual Wood Raven', the divine essence can be detonated to enhance the explosive power..."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, if the crystal powder of the Divine Crystal is exploded, it can even form a field that weakens the opponent's divine essence..."</p><p></p><p>Ideas began to emerge in Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>His gaze brightened slightly. The reason why divine cultivators were strong was due to the suppression of their divine essence realm.</p><p></p><p>If the divine essence was restricted, and they had to rely solely on their qi and blood cultivation to fight...</p><p></p><p>Li Che had the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor" Dao fruit, refining it to the pinnacle, and with his Ascension Tower...</p><p></p><p>He could easily crush ordinary divine veins, it would only be difficult against Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that his martial dao cultivation was still at the Mysterious Vein realm, a bit weak. He needed to hurry and cultivate to the Divine Vein realm, or even break through to True Qi Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>If the refined "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor" couldn't subdue the opponent, in the Divine Crystal field, the opponent's attributed divine essence would be weakened, but Li Che's "Untainted Heart" divine essence could still be utilized.</p><p></p><p>"It can be considered a small trump card."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He then clenched his fingers tightly, crushing the tough Divine Crystal into fine powder, and took out the Nine Yang-Grade "Bloody Shocking Spear", grinding it for a while to turn it into a powder like fine limestone.</p><p></p><p>"It can be combined with the craftsmanship of the Wood Raven, hiding this Divine Crystal powder within, and when thrown out in battle, it will explode to form a crystal powder field..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let's call it the 'Raven Hand Grenade'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the sky began to darken, Li Che returned home. Xixia was sitting listlessly under the eaves, not even playing with her scooter anymore, the excitement having worn off.</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to set off fireworks, but her father would definitely not allow it.</p><p></p><p>Tilting her head back, a look of melancholy beyond her years filled the small face.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to go back to school."</p><p></p><p>Xixia missed the days at the Xu Ji Divine Cultivation Academy.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che returned, he saw the thoughtful Xixia under the eaves and couldn't help but take out the candied hawthorns he had bought.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes immediately lit up, and she ran towards her father.</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked her up and handed her the candied hawthorns. If Xixia could eat candied hawthorns every day, she might not miss going to school so much.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the staff from the Lingxiang Pavilion brought over a sumptuous feast.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was surprised as he held the wine gourd: "You boy, ordering food again? It's not easy living in the capital, you should be more frugal."</p><p></p><p>Wife Zhang Ya was also a bit surprised, but seeing the abundant delicacies on the table, she thought her husband must have some good news to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also called over his uncle's family, as they lived in a small courtyard not far from his. Li Che had bought it for them to live in.</p><p></p><p>With Li Che's current financial capabilities, this was nothing. His uncle's family had raised him, so this was the least he could do.</p><p></p><p>His uncle, aunt, and cousin Li Zhengran all came to the feast.</p><p></p><p>After the meal was half over, Li Che raised his cup and announced that he had become a Third-Rank Guest Chamberlain at the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the announcement, everyone fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen almost choked on his wine: "Qin Tian Observatory? Third-Rank Guest Chamberlain?!"</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, you've landed a government job now!" </p><p></p><p>Uncle Li Liang was overjoyed and extremely excited, as a scholar with a jinshi degree, he was the most excited about Li Che being able to enter the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from Li Che becoming a wood carving master at Xu Ji Woodcarving Shop back then!</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a government power, and although a Guest Chamberlain was not an official, it was still half an official position...</p><p></p><p>When it came to becoming an official, Uncle Li, as a scholar, was deeply obsessed with it! "Good, good, good!" Uncle Li excitedly downed several cups of fine wine, quickly becoming tipsy, his eyes growing moist...</p><p></p><p>Second brother, your son has made it!</p><p></p><p>After announcing the news, Li Che also tore off a roasted duck leg for Xixia, then quietly drank and ate.</p><p></p><p>In the candlelight, the atmosphere was harmonious and joyful.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled warmly, but soon furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Because in the perception of the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, two powerful auras were rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Knocking sounds soon came from the courtyard, and the lively atmosphere immediately quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go, I'll go..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go open the door."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li wiped the oily corners of his mouth and shakily stood up, intending to go open the door.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che, who knew not when he had appeared, gently pushed his uncle back into the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, keep enjoying your wine, I'll go."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The massive head shot up into the sky, its black hair strands soaked with rainwater, rolling rapidly and splashing water droplets. </p><p></p><p>Those furious eyes could never be closed! Guo Zhan, being a perfected blood-transformation martial artist, although his age was too advanced and his qi and blood had begun to decline, he never imagined that he would die in such a manner in this life! Originally, when he was exchanging crossbow arrows with the Ox Demon, he thought it would be a contest between mechanical crossbows and divine archers, with the two fighting until the last arrow was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected the Ox Demon to be so ruthless and without any sense of martial ethics.</p><p></p><p>That sudden and terrifying hidden weapon, even for the perfected blood-transformation Guo Zhan, at close range, it blasted away half his life. The scorching flames radiated intense heat, burning his entire body, instantly evaporating the moisture on the surface and directly searing his skin.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the shockwave triggered by the explosion, it penetrated into his untempered viscera, causing him to sustain heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>And it was not over yet, there were also the poisoned needles...</p><p></p><p>The consecutive combo of hidden weapons and poisons was too seamless, Guo Zhan could only feel deep resentment in his heart as he fell into the Ox Demon's continuous onslaught, ultimately being beheaded by the razor-sharp blade.</p><p></p><p>The cold, lifeless body fell to the ground, the severed neck spraying blood, but the blood would eventually run out.</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan was dead beyond any further death.</p><p></p><p>As a perfected blood-transformation martial artist, his qi and blood were strong, but he was still just a mortal. Once his head was cut off, there was no possibility of him surviving.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's burly figure had silver threads dancing wildly around him, and he looked at the fallen perfected blood-transformation martial artist with complex emotions, becoming even more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>In such a chaotic world, even the strongest martial artists could still meet their demise...</p><p></p><p>When fighting against others, one must think more, guarding against all kinds of sinister and despicable methods.</p><p></p><p>In the battles of martial artists, Li Che deeply realized that...</p><p></p><p>The only way to win is to be more sinister and despicable than the opponent, not allowing them to be sinister and despicable towards you.</p><p></p><p>The rain in the sky seemed to have returned to its icy cold state, beginning to condense into frost and snow.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the scorching source in the city had finished its intense release of light and heat.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater gathered and condensed into snowflakes, drifting down gently.</p><p></p><p>As if perfectly preserving the pungent bloody aroma of the perfected blood-transformation martial artist, almost making one want to vomit.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the Xu Family Estate, it fell into a deathly silence, only the rustling sound of snow falling to the ground remained.</p><p></p><p>The three perfected blood-transformation experts from the Spirit Infant Sect paused their steps, their pupils behind their masks staring in shock at the deceased Guo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, in the blink of an eye...Guo Zhan had died? </p><p></p><p>Too fast! Too ruthless! A chill rose in their hearts, never imagining that the much-celebrated hero Ox Demon in Feiluo City was actually such a vicious and malicious villain! Hidden weapons, poisoned needles, ambushes...all kinds of methods, one after another!</p><p></p><p>What kind of hero was this?!</p><p></p><p>"Guo Zhan is dead too, this won't be easy to explain to Simo Bai's side!"</p><p></p><p>The three perfected blood-transformation experts from the Spirit Infant Sect suddenly had throbbing temples, their brains almost about to explode.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong had been used as bait and devoured, and now Guo Zhan, the divine archer, had been beheaded before their eyes by the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Both of them had spiritual cultivators backing them up.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>"We must kill the Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The three perfected blood-transformation experts from the Spirit Infant Sect roared, "Defend against his hidden weapons, get in close and fight him hand-to-hand, be careful of his poison and that strange fire bird!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan's death was not due to a lack of strength, but completely because he was schemed against by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>If it was a direct confrontation, how could the Ox Demon, with just one perfected blood-transformation, match the three of them?</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The ice formed on the ground due to the drop in temperature suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The three perfected blood-transformation experts from the Spirit Infant Sect charged in angrily, one wielding a spear, one a knife, and one a chain sword, swinging and flailing, their sharp edges wailing.</p><p></p><p>Their speed had increased even further, sealing off all of the Ox Demon's escape routes, not giving him a chance to hide his tracks!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Che, who had killed Guo Zhan, only felt that the Dao Fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] in his chest was pounding like a violently beating heart after intense exercise! </p><p></p><p>With each beat, it was as if there were the sounds of gongs and drums exploding in his eardrums! In front of him, the ancient trees rising from the vast earth were violently shaking their branches, like the sound of surging waves.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (lv1, 98%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm still a little short... What's this about a breakthrough in the midst of battle, it's all just lies in novels."</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After killing Zhao Chuanxiong and then a perfected blood-transformation martial artist, he still had not been able to push the maturity of the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] to level 2...</p><p></p><p>It really was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's a pity, but the problem is not big.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already prepared for failure. His mind stirred, and another Dao fruit [Immaculate Heart] began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>It was as if grasped by an invisible palm.</p><p></p><p>Then, in a contraction and ejection, the rich divinity gushed out and was swallowed by the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Then, the final push was completed...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Li Che, standing quietly beside Guo Zhan's corpse with a hat on, only felt a roar in his ears.</p><p></p><p>As if something terrible had broken free from the constraints of the flesh and blood body, and broken free from the shackles! A scorching heat suddenly surged from the surface of the skin.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (lv2, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Actively triggered, in an instant, as if the shackles of the flesh had suddenly snapped, the scalding, boiling power gushed out from the nine bulging tendons on the back, from the bone forged like tiger bone, from the roaring dragon in the spine...</p><p></p><p>The original height of one meter and ninety centimeters actually... rose again! The muscles twisted like braids, the elastic clothes supported to the limit, and then shattered, revealing the perfect muscles covered with coiled dragons below, and even the slightest movement could drive countless muscle fibers, like an extremely precise machine!</p><p></p><p>Two meters, two meters one...</p><p></p><p>Two meters two! The second transformation of the Vajra, making Li Che's body rise again, the infinite power spreading from the tendons and bones, as if pushing all the processes of skin peeling, tendon opening, and bone tempering that Li Che had experienced so far to perfection.</p><p></p><p>The perfect body sculpted! In every inch of the muscles, the terrifying power of the Dragon Elephant was nurtured!</p><p></p><p>And Li Che only felt that the towering anger burst out from the depths of his mind, although angry, but it did not affect his thinking, making him fall into the ultimate calmness.</p><p></p><p>Under the ox-face mask, a pair of eyes were filled with anger! This feeling... is it divine?</p><p></p><p>"This state... shall be called 'Wrathful Vajra'."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>From Vajra to Wrathful Vajra...</p><p></p><p>A leap and transformation on the horizontal refinement level!</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that now he... hated the sky without limits, hated the earth without handles! The wind and snow were bitter and piercing! The three elite blood-changing warriors of the Lingying Sect formed a surrounding formation, intending to encircle and kill the Ox Demon! When they saw the Ox Demon standing with his hands down beside Guo Zhan's corpse, they couldn't help but feel delighted, thinking that the Ox Demon had exhausted his strength in killing Guo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to seize this rare opportunity to capture and kill this evil villain!</p><p></p><p>But when they saw the Ox Demon's flesh swell, the abdomen, chest, and shoulders rising high, the muscles twisting and coiling like braided dragons, the big tendons frantically trembling like angry pythons...</p><p></p><p>The three people all flashed with terror in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>The oppressive feeling of blood and qi surged like the waves of a great river, scorching hot, and there was also a terrible power similar to the divine nature of anger that shook their consciousness...</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The three blood-changing warriors were horrified!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the Ox Demon finally raised his head, and under the cute ox-face mask, a pair of wrathful eyes, like beacons in the night, shining brightly like the sun! Like a demon, like a god!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan gritted her teeth, braving the wind and snow, and quietly approached.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... was the hero in her heart, and tonight... she realized that it was a trap set by the Lingying Sect to ambush the hero Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>When the Ox Demon fought with the Lingying Sect's elite warriors, the dispersed blood qi made her unable to approach.</p><p></p><p>Now, the blood qi has finally been restrained.</p><p></p><p>The yearning for the hero... made Zhao Xuan unable to hold back anymore, and she mustered her courage and approached the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was inexplicably sad.</p><p></p><p>The encirclement of the four blood-changing warriors...</p><p></p><p>The hero Ox Demon, it seems... is going to die miserably, right?</p><p></p><p>She could only come to collect the Ox Demon's body...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The endless wind and snow were swept away, and in the secluded corner of the Xu family's mansion, countless bricks were shattered, and a web of cracks grew.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan, with her long legs, stood in the snow, dumbfounded, looking at the shattered battlefield in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Where was the Ox Demon's body?</p><p></p><p>There was only Guo Zhan's decapitated corpse, and...</p><p></p><p>Three blood-stained flowers scattered on the snowy ground, splattered with scattered flesh!</p><p></p><p>PS: Good news, I advanced to the third round of the PK, bad news, next week should be the PK of the Three Rivers, although the hope is not high, I still want to give it a try, everyone please join me in another round of effort!

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was something Li Che had previously promised Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had said that it was not auspicious for Xixia's birthday to see blood, so they should change it to a better day.</p><p></p><p>Today, Xixia's birthday had already passed.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's eyes were murky, with a few blood vessels, clearly indicating that he had not slept well the night before.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stuffed the bun in his mouth and looked at Old Chen: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>No questions asked.</p><p></p><p>No reasons given.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che believed that Old Chen's nature would not harbor any ill intentions, and the blood he wanted to see would not be that of an innocent person.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's tense body suddenly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long sigh. Li Che's presence was now too oppressive.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't know Li Che's identity, it would be fine, but knowing Li Che's background, Old Chen felt as if he was facing a towering mountain, suppressed to the point of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... </p><p></p><p>That figure who was already renowned in Feilei City, known as the lone hero who hated evil and killed without blinking...</p><p></p><p>Now that he had come to Jinguang Prefecture, the rumors about him had only grown louder.</p><p></p><p>The storytellers in the teahouses spoke of this heroic figure, who single-handedly overturned the despicable Fishing Gang, freeing many exploited workers and restoring their peaceful lives.</p><p></p><p>This was a true hero! And now, the hero was right beside him! When Old Chen first learned of Li Che's identity, he was completely stunned, his emotions unsettled for a long time.</p><p></p><p>So it turned out...</p><p></p><p>Old Chen also had a powerful backer! This Ox Demon, wasn't he Old Chen's backer? But after careful consideration, Old Chen inexplicably developed some reservations and distance, becoming more cautious in his behavior and actions.</p><p></p><p>After all... the Ox Demon was a master who could kill gods as easily as chickens!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Old Chen's awkward demeanor, Li Che smiled gently and patted his shoulder: "Old Chen, relax, there's no need to be so nervous..."</p><p></p><p>"I've always been Ahe, and that won't change."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's voice was gentle, like a warm spring breeze, and his sincere reassurance dispelled Old Chen's awkwardness and tension.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this young man... he was the one who brought him into the trade, the little worker who used to cheerfully move wooden carvings and lumber in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Simple, honest, and kind-hearted, at least in Old Chen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>That was enough.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took a puff of his pipe: "The Beggar Sect... I'm doing a job for the Beggar Sect, responsible for guarding a courtyard behind the Yunfang Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"At first, they told me to guard it well, not to look at what I shouldn't see."</p><p></p><p>"I also upheld this belief in doing my duty, not prying into what I shouldn't. But you know, gradually I felt a sense of death and decay within me, and I knew there was a problem with this job."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen slowly recounted the details of his work.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, twenty taels a month would be enough... no need to risk one's life."</p><p></p><p>"After sensing the death and decay, I planned to resign and leave, but before that, a girl escaped from the courtyard I was guarding."</p><p></p><p>"The information then barged into my mind in a damning manner..."</p><p></p><p>"It turned out that the women in the Yunfang Pavilion... all came from that courtyard, and their entire lives might be confined within it."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen closed his eyes, recalling the scene he had witnessed, his heart trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That girl sought my help, and I saved her, letting her return home... but I know I did the wrong thing."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"I'm too weak... even with my blood refining cultivation, I'm too feeble to stand up against this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel the self-blame emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Without needing to think, Li Che also knew the girl's fate, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I, Old Chen... am afraid of trouble, so in Feilei City, I ran to the woodcarving shop in the outer city, wanting to stay away from the conflicts in the inner city."</p><p></p><p>"But I, Old Chen, also have my own conscience, just like when I intervened in your family's matter with the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But this time... it's completely different, I've harmed a family."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen seemed to have aged considerably, the heroic spirit of his youth seemingly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect...</p><p></p><p>Infusing Old Chen with the aura of death and decay, the target could only be one person - Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect must have hidden Corpse God Sect experts within.</p><p></p><p>Everything was now clear.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already reached the point of life-and-death struggle with the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>This Beggar Sect, he would have to deal with them eventually.</p><p></p><p>If it had been before, Li Che might have hesitated a bit, as his combat power was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no need to hesitate anymore, he had sufficient strength and confidence to do what needed to be done.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up another bun and took a light bite.</p><p></p><p>After comforting Old Chen for a while, he smiled and said, "Actually, I'm not a hero..."</p><p></p><p>"I've always just wanted to protect my family."</p><p></p><p>"I'm against the Corpse God Sect because... they want to harm Xixia, my daughter."</p><p></p><p>"As a father, how could I tolerate that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"But since they've bullied my family, I naturally won't hold back."</p><p></p><p>"Leave it to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Old Chen with a deep gaze.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Chen's expression did not show much joy, he only took a step back and bowed to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"This matter, Old Chen owes you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so distant, Old Chen."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"But you must also be careful, don't do anything reckless, preserving your life is the most important thing." Old Chen said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want Li Che to encounter any accidents because of this matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gestured for Old Chen to rest assured, then stood up and looked at Xixia, Gong Yanliang, and Gongyang Xiu, the three little ones.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you've eaten, you've drunk, you've played, now each of you go cultivate properly."</p><p></p><p>"Your youth is not an excuse to slack off."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clapped his hands and called out to the three little ones.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm~ Daddy, I want to eat one more." Xixia blinked her bright eyes and held up a finger, indicating she wanted to eat one more bun.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yanliang said they didn't want to eat anymore, and Lü Chiyi was also shaking his head constantly.</p><p></p><p>They had all been competing to eat the buns, and they were all almost full.</p><p></p><p>Only Xixia was truly enjoying the delicious buns.</p><p></p><p>Xixia really could eat a lot!</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "Aren't you leaving one for your mother to eat?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xixia's little brows furrowed, and she let go of the bun she was holding: "Oh right, Mother hasn't eaten yet, I'll leave it for her to eat, Xixia won't eat anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a good girl." Li Che praised with a smile, ruffling Xixia's hair.</p><p></p><p>Carrying Xixia, and taking Gong Yanliang, Gongyang Xiu, and Lü Chiyi, the three little rascals, he left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>At the Jinguang Peak.</p><p></p><p>Sanguan Yin led Xixia away, and Xixia hopped and skipped, occasionally describing the unforgettable deliciousness of the buns to Sanguan Yin.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heaved a sigh of relief, then turned and headed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Heavy snow was falling, as big as duck feathers.</p><p></p><p>At the Cliff Stone Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The eaves of the pagoda were piled high with thick snow, obscuring much of the pearl-like luster, adding a touch of poetic charm.</p><p></p><p>The Jiulong River flowing through the city had not frozen over.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was connected to the raging river outside, as if there was a furnace at the bottom of the river, keeping it warm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che came to the Cliff Stone Pagoda of the Qingtian Observatory, as usual, to work his shift. He had accumulated several wooden carvings to submit as his task.</p><p></p><p>Now, these wooden carvings were not carved by him, but by the avatar of [Painting Immortal], and the memories of the carving would return to his body, as if he had done it himself.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong had taken off her shoes and was sitting on a chair, cracking melon seeds and reading a romance novel.</p><p></p><p>The deaths of Shangguan Qingzheng and Shangguan Qingliu had seemed to have lifted a burden from Shangguan Qinghong's shoulders, and she had become more lazy and indolent since then.</p><p></p><p>Li Che came before her, taking out all the wooden carvings to be submitted and arranging them in front of Shangguan Qinghong.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, your efficiency has really improved, before it used to take you half a month to carve one piece." Shangguan Qinghong exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "Help me submit these and collect the payment."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, leave it to me." Shangguan Qinghong smiled.</p><p></p><p>This was her job when on duty, to help the Observatory's clients submit their tasks and collect their payments, freeing up their time.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the wooden carvings, Li Che planned to leave the Pagoda and return to the Luohua Alley courtyard, then go to deal with the Beggar Sect.</p><p></p><p>But before he could leave the Pagoda, he was called out to.</p><p></p><p>The one who called him was Gong Yunli, the burly young Supervisor.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che greets the Supervisor." Li Che cupped his hands and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli looked Li Che up and down, growing more and more satisfied.</p><p></p><p>She liked people who were honest, upright, and well-behaved, as long as they didn't cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che, since becoming a client of the Observatory, had a reputation for being extremely well-behaved.</p><p></p><p>He completed his monthly tasks perfectly, and every employer praised him highly.</p><p></p><p>If there was a flaw in Li Che as a client...</p><p></p><p>It would be that he was too perfect.</p><p></p><p>"Supervisor Gong, how is the matter I requested?" Li Che couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli puffed out her ample bosom and smiled: "You've been a third-class client for about a year now, and according to the rules, you're eligible to apply for the second-class client assessment."</p><p></p><p>"I've already arranged it for you, and in about half a month, you'll be notified to undergo the second-class client assessment."</p><p></p><p>"The second-class client assessment needs to be reported to the Observatory in the provincial capital, and the Observatory will send special examiners, so it will take about half a month to arrange."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli explained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, upon hearing this, did not show much disappointment.</p><p></p><p>After thanking the other party, he planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, Gong Yunli suddenly stepped in front of him, spreading her arms to block his way.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not done yet, why are you in such a hurry?" The beautiful Supervisor Gong said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che almost couldn't help but collide with her. It had to be said that this Supervisor was indeed blessed with a voluptuous figure.</p><p></p><p>"Supervisor, please continue." Li Che smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me to see the Monitoring Master."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli adjusted her brocade robe, unconsciously taking a step back.</p><p></p><p>"See the Monitoring Master?" Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you've been a third-class client for a year, and I've specially applied for you to have the opportunity to enter the Mysterious Temple to observe the deities. Aren't you planning to challenge the title of Grand Master Woodcarver? Woodcarving masters need to observe deities to improve their skills, so I've applied for you to enter the Mysterious Temple to the Monitoring Master."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli raised her chin slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes brightened upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the Mysterious Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it that Furious Eight-Armed Prince Mysterious Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli looked at Li Che as if he was an idiot: "What are you thinking? Of course, it's not the Furious Three Prince Mysterious Temple, that's the Forbidden Four Deities Mysterious Temple, no cultivators are allowed to enter the sanctum."</p><p></p><p>"It's the two other Eight Extremes Mysterious Temples outside Jingguan Prefecture... since they've already been conquered, they are now under the control of the Monitoring Department."</p><p></p><p>"Since they are under Monitoring Department control, you need to apply to enter the Mysterious Temple. If you enter the Mysterious Temple without an entry permit, that would be... a major crime, and the Monitoring Department would execute you on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli led the way, guiding Li Che up to the top of the Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>After climbing up countless flights of stairs, they finally stopped in front of a room, from which the soulful sound of a two-stringed instrument could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Every client who wants to enter the Mysterious Temple must come see the Monitoring Master, who will examine whether you are a hidden pawn of the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect is not allowed to enter the Mysterious Temple, because the Corpse God Sect is different from other sects, they can become a major threat to the great sects. Besides having many powerful experts, they also have another trait..."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect's ambitions are too great, they enter the Mysterious Temple only to hunt the deities!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed upon hearing this. The Corpse God Sect actually had such a shocking intention? Creak.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and the sound of the two-stringed instrument grew louder. Li Che could even...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The seven divine foundations in the Nirvana Palace were trembling slightly, and the divine nature seemed to be out of control.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, and the untainted Dharma fruit pounded rapidly, but that restless emotion was gradually suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli respectfully led Li Che into the palace.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the erhu stopped, and the old man in plain clothes sitting on the bench slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Li Che, and in an instant, Li Che felt as if he had been seen through.</p><p></p><p>An extremely powerful force instantly descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>Formless and unknowable, like a true divine being!</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit! </p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>This was the primordial spirit that South离Fire had mentioned!</p><p></p><p>It is an indispensable step for cultivators of the Primordial Realm to break through to the Divine Realm, the birth of the primordial spirit!</p><p></p><p>Once the primordial spirit emerges, it can roam the yin and yang, traversing the void.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it is said that the primordial spirit is divided into yin spirit and yang spirit, and the Supervisor-General should be in the realm of the yin spirit.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Supervisor-General of the Heavenly Mandate Bureau to be even stronger than South离Fire.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Third-Class Guest Counselor Li Che?"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General narrowed his eyes, looking at Li Che, a trace of strangeness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This kid...</p><p></p><p>Detected it?</p><p></p><p>Sensed the aura of his primordial spirit?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would this kid suddenly become so tense.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Supervisor-General clearly sensed the aura of the divine foundation in Li Che, as well as the extremely thick and terrifying vital energy, but this kid... looked so ordinary, just an ordinary blood-changing martial artist and cultivator of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Instinct told the Supervisor-General that Li Che must be hiding his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was the intuition of an old fox.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General smiled: "I should have arranged for you to enter the Mysterious Temple earlier to improve your wood carving skills."</p><p></p><p>"But I was delayed by some matters."</p><p></p><p>"I have approved your entry into the Mysterious Temple, and I will write you a letter, and you can enter the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, which one are you going to visit? Which temple god?"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Divine Three Prince Mysterious Temple is definitely not an option, you can only take the other two Eight Extremes Mysterious Temples, one of which is the 'Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Monkey Temple God', located ten miles outside the Heart Monkey Temple."</p><p></p><p>"The other one is the 'Iron Crutch Happy Ascetic Temple God', and the Mysterious Temple is closer to the Golden Rift Gate."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General recited the two Mysterious Temples and their temple gods.</p><p></p><p>"Which one do you want to visit?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che thought of the introduction that Shangguan Qinghong had given him before.</p><p></p><p>"I choose the 'Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Monkey Temple God' outside the Heart Monkey Temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his fists and said.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General nodded: "Good, I understand, I will write a letter and send it to the Temple Garrison, the result will be out in about five days, and a temple entry order will be sent to you then."</p><p></p><p>"I'll have the Palace Supervisor and Gongyuan Supervisor accompany you to the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General smiled.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli heard this and was immediately dissatisfied: "Teacher! Why do you still have to send Gongyuan Chengcheng? I alone is enough."</p><p></p><p>She, Gong Yunli, was already at the Virtual Appearance Perfection realm, taking a guest counselor to the Eight Extremes Mysterious Temple, as if something could go wrong?</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General was speechless and stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>With Li Che going to the Mysterious Temple, did you think your teacher was worried about Li Che's safety?</p><p></p><p>Your teacher is worried about you, little Gong!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Heavenly Mandate Bureau's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on his hat, wearing a black robe, and walked on the snow-covered street. He looked back at the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>On the top of the Treasure Pavilion, at the railing, the Supervisor-General, wearing a robe, with an erhu and a small stool hanging at his waist, was smiling at him.</p><p></p><p>"Have I been seen through?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down his hat and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps.</p><p></p><p>But even if he has been seen through, it doesn't matter...</p><p></p><p>These days, who isn't an old fox? The Supervisor-General narrowed his eyes, and the smile on his face gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly raised the hand behind his back, and the fingers, twisted like braids, formed a mudra.</p><p></p><p>"His fate is really hard... I almost got a cramp when I calculated it."</p><p></p><p>"He hides it so deeply... Could this kid be that Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor-General thought for a moment, then suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense, only a father like that could give birth to a genius child like Li Nuanxi." The Supervisor-General smoothed out his cramped hand and stopped thinking.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, in a corner of the capital city.</p><p></p><p>An old man wearing a felt hat, sitting on a small stool playing the erhu, swaying to the music, with a small bowl with a broken mouth in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Life is not easy, the Supervisor-General is busking.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the independent workshop in Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chessboard Expansion enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sat in the courtyard, and his vital energy and divine nature merged into thick ink.</p><p></p><p>The untainted Dharma fruit trembled, and suddenly, one sheet of pure white paper after another, transformed from the untainted Dharma, floated in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>One after another, pure and flawless, as if competing with the swirling white snow in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Che scanned the countless untainted Dharma paper sheets.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he flicked his fingers.</p><p></p><p>One stroke of thick ink after another, flew and crashed onto the pure white paper sheets.</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone was walking with a brush, the sound of brushstrokes echoing continuously.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, stretched, and then parted the air with two fingers, taking out a hat, a cute cow mask, and a black robe wrapped around him.</p><p></p><p>His physical body swelled, becoming as towering as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Pressing down the hat, the Ox Demon reappeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>On the untainted Dharma paper, one towering figure after another walked out.</p><p></p><p>The black robe fluttered in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The lowered hat, all raised at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a face...</p><p></p><p>A cute cow mask.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The most luxurious brothel in the Golden Light Capital.</p><p></p><p>The women here are of all kinds, plump and thin, obedient and feisty, intellectual and pitiful... all kinds of women are available, and each type has a flower-like beauty.</p><p></p><p>It has made many second and third-rate scions of the capital families, obsessed.</p><p></p><p>Behind Cloud Pavilion stands the Beggar Sect, which is not really a secret.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to the Beggar Sect, Cloud Pavilion also has the involvement of the second-generation scions of many aristocratic families, such as the Hai family, Qin family, Shangguan family, Gongyuan family, and Gong family, the top five aristocratic families in the capital.</p><p></p><p>This is also the biggest backing of Cloud Pavilion, making many forces dare not cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Pavilion, Golden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The entire courtyard occupies a vast area, and the interior decoration is extremely luxurious, dazzling with gold and jade, intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>And the Beggar Sect's Patriarch and the Nine Bag Elders all live in this courtyard, enjoying a luxurious life.</p><p></p><p>They are not beggars at all, they live better than the emperor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the reception hall of the Golden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect Patriarch was talking with a Corpse Deity Emissary, who was emanating a thick aura of death and corpses.</p><p></p><p>"I have mastered the Eight Forbidden Seductive Corpse Art, I have sacrificed the lives of three hundred and sixty-five pure and innocent young girls, and finally mastered this art."</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect Patriarch looked at the Corpse Deity Emissary, his gaze burning.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary, when will you teach me the Sixteen Forbidden Seductive Corpse Art?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Emissary looked at the Beggar Sect Patriarch and said in a low voice: "The Sixteen Forbidden Seductive Corpse Art is one of the forbidden arts of my sect, and it requires the sacrifice of one thousand six hundred pure and innocent young girls..."</p><p></p><p>The Beggar Sect Patriarch narrowed his eyes: "In this world, there are so many refugees and displaced people, just give them some food and silver, and there will be no shortage of refugees and displaced people willing to sell their daughters."</p><p></p><p>"But one thousand six hundred is a bit too much..."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Beggar Sect Patriarch Hong Sixi laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, you are really ruthless... But my sect likes people like you who are practical."</p><p></p><p>"Has the arrangement I made for the Patriarch been completed?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Emissary asked.</p><p></p><p>Hong Sixi lightly tapped the table: "That Chen Dabao, the aura of death and corpses has been infused into his body according to your instructions."</p><p></p><p>"As long as he sees Li Nuanxi once, those auras of death and corpses will automatically transform into a corpse curse mark and enter Li Nuanxi's body, controlling this genius child."</p><p></p><p>"But, it seems that Chen Dabao has discovered something... He has resigned from his job and has not come to work for several days."</p><p></p><p>"He even secretly released one of the young girls I was preparing to sacrifice for the seductive corpse art."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, I would have broken his legs and drowned him in the Nine Dragon River."</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, he is still useful, your plan still needs him, so he is lucky."</p><p></p><p>Hong Sixi stretched.</p><p></p><p>Who says beggars can't live a rich life? In this world today, as long as you have cultivation and strength, even as a beggar, you can manipulate the life and death of others.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, when the corpse curse mark takes effect on Li Nuanxi and I receive the feedback, I will teach you the Sixteen Forbidden Seductive Corpse Art."</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Emissary stood up and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>Black smoke began to emerge from behind him, spreading out like black ink in water.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The masked Corpse Deity Emissary, his heart suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>He saw the chest of the Beggar Sect Patriarch Hong Sixi suddenly explode in a mist of blood, and then accompanied by a miserable howl, another bullet like a dragon's tooth pierced through Hong Sixi's head, directly blowing up his head like a firework.</p><p></p><p>Although Hong Sixi was only at the Divine Appearance Realm, and had not even cultivated the Copper Corpse, his physical defense was extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Emissary reacted in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Puff - his chest suddenly caved in, and a bronze light burst forth, which was a small Copper Corpse he had cultivated! A series of dragon tooth bullets flew at him in rapid succession!</p><p></p><p>Then came the terrifying sonic boom, rolling towards him in waves.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Emissary under the mask shrank.</p><p></p><p>Because, four dragon tooth bullets had pierced through the same spot in succession, finally penetrating his small Copper Corpse and entering his body.</p><p></p><p>The bullets exploded, and the Bodhi threads seemed to spread like countless crawling creatures, scraping his small Copper Corpse's flesh, making a clanging sound that never stopped!

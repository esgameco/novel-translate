            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Master?</p><p></p><p>Li Che... has become a master?!</p><p></p><p>Old Chen felt the powerful true qi that was surging into his body, evaporating and removing the corpse qi and death qi that had been lurking within him. </p><p></p><p>He felt every bit of flesh and blood in his body trembling incessantly!</p><p></p><p>These death qi and corpse qi were very subtle, and if it weren't for Old Chen's extraordinary talent in perception, it would have been very difficult to sense them.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen knew the Corpse God Sect, how could he not be aware of this evil cult.</p><p></p><p>It was the forces of this cult that had forced him to leave his hometown and ancestral home in the first place.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the Corpse Curse Seal, the means by which the Corpse God Sect controlled its followers.</p><p></p><p>When Old Chen sensed the corpse qi within himself, he realized that it did not affect his physical body, and he understood that it was not aimed at him.</p><p></p><p>But at Xixia! The moment Old Chen realized this, he immediately chose to move out of Li Che and Zhang Ya's courtyard, afraid that the corpse qi on him would infect the two.</p><p></p><p>As for the source of the corpse qi within him, Old Chen guessed it was related to the beggar gang job his fellow villager had recommended.</p><p></p><p>The next day after learning of the situation, he secretly went to look for his fellow villager, only to find that the entire family had been killed.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen fell silent, the dangers in the capital city were more biting than outside, where the dead could at least let out a miserable scream, but inside the city, the dead were silent and unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>In Old Chen's eyes, the beggar gang was truly powerful, so he did not want to involve Li Che's family, or Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen silently moved out of the courtyard, refusing Li Che's invitation to come see Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Even though it tore his heart, even though he was filled with reluctance...</p><p></p><p>He had to make this decision.</p><p></p><p>It was for Xixia's own good.</p><p></p><p>Even though Old Chen was a mighty warrior, in the quiet of the night, he couldn't help but have his eyes redden, filled with melancholy and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>Today was Xixia's fourth birthday, a date he remembered clearly.</p><p></p><p>So, he drank alone under the night sky.</p><p></p><p>But then Li Che came.</p><p></p><p>The troublesome corpse qi that had been plaguing him was easily dissipated by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The stubborn corpse qi, like evil spirits, encountered the brilliant sun and instantly evaporated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che's cultivation had reached the realm of the master!</p><p></p><p>A realm that Old Chen could not have imagined.</p><p></p><p>After unblocking the meridians, one becomes a master, but Old Chen knew very well how difficult the master realm was to attain...</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, I have become a master," Li Che said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>He already knew what Old Chen was planning to do, so tonight he came out to stop him and dissuade him from his suicidal thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been cultivating?" Old Chen swallowed.</p><p></p><p>What a monster is this?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's martial arts training was something Old Chen had half-introduced him to, although it was taught by Xu Beahu at the Xu Family Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>But he was still considered Li Che's initiator.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in less than four years, Li Che had become a master of the qi and blood realm! Old Chen closed his eyes, sensing the corpse qi and death qi within himself, and indeed could no longer feel even a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, his eyes slightly moist...</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, if you have any troubles, you can come to me. Xixia is the one you've watched grow up, you're also part of our family."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the meaning of family?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up the cup on the stove and poured himself a drink, raising it towards Old Chen and downing it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen let out a breath, his tense body relaxing as he sat down on the eaves.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, someone wants to use me to target Xixia... They've planted corpse qi in me, with Xixia as the target."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen tilted his head back, speaking solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I know... I know everything."</p><p></p><p>"Today is Xixia's birthday, we won't see any bloodshed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted Old Chen's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was stunned...</p><p></p><p>What did he mean by "no bloodshed"?</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "I know you suspect it's someone from the beggar gang who has joined the Corpse God Sect, wanting to target Xixia, this Jia Zi prodigy."</p><p></p><p>"As for these Corpse God Sect experts..."</p><p></p><p>"Just kill them all."</p><p></p><p>"After all, anyone who wants to harm Xixia, they all need to be killed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che spoke these words calmly and gently.</p><p></p><p>This was his determination, his unwavering will.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen looked at Li Che blankly, how could he speak of wiping out the beggar gang so mildly and calmly...</p><p></p><p>Was this still the gentle wood carving master Li Che he knew?</p><p></p><p>"The beggar gang... is very strong," Old Chen reminded, afraid that the newly breakthrough master Li Che might be too arrogant and make unwise moves.</p><p></p><p>Then Old Chen saw Li Che smile.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The snow all over the courtyard instantly melted and evaporated! And in front of him, Li Che instantly transformed into a towering, massive figure, a dense black shadow that completely obscured Old Chen's vision.</p><p></p><p>A bovine-faced mask was placed over Li Che's face.</p><p></p><p>Just like that...</p><p></p><p>Towering over him.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's face flushed red, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After a long while...</p><p></p><p>He plucked off a strand of beard and blurted out a word.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Chen followed Li Che to Shen Sect that night.</p><p></p><p>This was Old Chen's first time entering Shen Sect, and he felt a bit uneasy, but in the deep of the night, with heavy snow falling, the scenery wasn't much to see.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, in order to hurry the journey, grabbed Old Chen and directly unleashed the Cloud Heron Stepping Clouds technique.</p><p></p><p>Swift as lightning, they soared up like a falcon, the speed reaching the extreme, the airflow rushing, blowing Old Chen into a mess.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time experiencing the speed of a master.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Ling Peak.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen stepped into the brightly lit courtyard in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The snow was falling heavily, but the ground had been swept clean, the new snow falling was instantly evaporated, leaving a dry and comfortable space.</p><p></p><p>A familiar and long-missed feeling.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was busy in the kitchen, though Li Che had brought back ingredients from outside, she still had the habit of cooking some of Xixia's favorite dishes.</p><p></p><p>She also cooked a bowl of dragon whisker longevity noodles, with an egg.</p><p></p><p>One egg, one bowl of noodles.</p><p></p><p>Wishing little Xixia a safe and peaceful new year.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che brought Old Chen into the courtyard, the Xixia who was playing with the twisting car with LÃ¼ Chi, Gong Yang Xiu, and Gong Yuan Liang, suddenly let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Chen!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia jumped excitedly off the twisting car and then, like a released little mouse, dashed towards Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>With a leap, she threw herself into Old Chen's arms.</p><p></p><p>The powerful impact made the old Chen, who had just experienced high-speed flight, a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixia... you've grown stronger!" </p><p></p><p>Old Chen came to his senses and hugged Xixia, sighing.</p><p></p><p>Four-year-old Xixia had grown taller, but her face was still chubby, and she still had a little belly.</p><p></p><p>It had been almost eight months since he last saw the little stinky Xixia, and Old Chen really missed her.</p><p></p><p>But the old and young pair only cuddled briefly at their first meeting, then they started bickering again.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>"Old stinky Chen!"</p><p></p><p>The old and young exchanged insults.</p><p></p><p>The wrinkled face of Old Chen blossomed into a smile, he hadn't smiled this happily in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya came out of the kitchen, seeing Old Chen, she was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, Old Chen hasn't been here for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't know what had happened to Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>But since Li Che had invited Old Chen, the problem must have been resolved.</p><p></p><p>"A small problem, with your husband taking care of it, any problem is no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite boastful in front of his wife.</p><p></p><p>"Cook a bowl of noodles for Old Chen as well."  Li Che suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya paused, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"To celebrate his rebirth, his return home."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>When it was almost time to start the meal, Li Qingshan brought Sumu Laopo, and in addition, there were also Xixia's senior brothers and sisters, Sang Guanyin and Liu Yanguan.</p><p></p><p>The elder Zhu Hongdou from Red Cloud Peak also came over.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong followed behind Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard was bustling with liveliness, the winter snow unable to conceal or dispel this laughter.</p><p></p><p>As the protagonist of the day, Xixia was overjoyed, with delicious food, fun games, seeing the long-unseen Grandpa Chen, and all kinds of gifts to collect.</p><p></p><p>She really wished every day could be her birthday.</p><p></p><p>The night wind blew, the snowflakes drifting down.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Li Che and the others gathered around the fire in the courtyard, sipping tea and chatting.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, where Li Che had blown away the accumulated snow with his qi and blood, Xixia and her little friends were happily playing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan squinted, sipping his tea, observing the Shen Sect was quite taxing on the spirit, but being able to drink a cup of tea in between was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin and Shangguan Qinghong were playing with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The handsome and elegant Liu Yanguan was drinking tea with Li Che and Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"Little Source, where's your master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a sip of tea and asked.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yanguan also carefully sipped his tea, saying, "Master has gone into seclusion again, recently he's been in seclusion more frequently."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could it be our Sect Master is about to break through to the Divine Element Realm, to become a True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan squinted.</p><p></p><p>But Liu Yanguan shook his head, "The Divine Element Realm is not that easy to attain. Master doesn't have much confidence..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, Master was... injured back then."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent beside them, not interrupting.</p><p></p><p>After drinking some tea, Liu Yanguan took his leave, walking side by side with Sang Guanyin.</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes were falling, but before they could land, they were shattered by a sharp aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan exhaled.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Yanguan and Sang Guanyin, the Third and Fourth Disciples, are still a bit inferior to the First and Second Disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at him curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan cleared his throat and continued, "Apart from Xixia, the four true disciples of our Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>"The one with the highest talent was the late First Disciple, Zhou Daoyuan, who, like Xixia, was also a Jia Zi prodigy with exceptional endowments. At the age of twelve, he had already completed the forging of the Six Dao Divine Foundation, and then entered the orthodox cultivation of the Qian Yuan Shen Sect."</p><p></p><p>"He once performed excellently in the 'Junior Deity Assembly', helping our Gold Light Branch Sect gain a lot of resources."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled at the mention of the "Junior Deity Assembly": "Junior Deity Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded: "One Dao, One Deity Sect, one province, one branch sect. The Lingnan Dao has a total of ten provinces, besides the Gold Light Branch Sect of Yun Province, there are also branch sects of other provinces..."</p><p></p><p>"With so many branch sects, the distribution of resources is a problem. It's never been a fair distribution, aside from looking at the number of divine cultivators in the branch sect, the quality of the disciples is also considered..."</p><p></p><p>"The Junior Deity Assembly is an evaluation of the quality of the disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow, sipping some hot tea, his gaze sweeping over the joyfully playing Xixia in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Then how did Zhou Daoyuan, with such talent, end up passing away?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is also a puzzle for us, but the old one vaguely heard that Zhou Daoyuan's death... is related to the Prefectural Governor's Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"How is it related to the Prefectural Governor's Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>"The Southernç¦»Fire has a strong killing intent towards the Prefectural Governor's Mansion, though he appears gentle and amiable on the surface, but in reality, Southerné¢Fire's killing intent is extremely strong... He truly wants to kill Prefectural Governor Su Huaili."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's really as the rumors say, that Prefectural Governor Su Huaili killed Zhou Daoyuan, so Southerné¢Fire wants to kill Su Huaili..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan fell silent after finishing his words.</p><p></p><p>"Then why have you always suspected our Sect Master? There must be a reason, otherwise you shouldn't suspect the Sect Master of a branch sect."</p><p></p><p>This was a doubt in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che in surprise, as if puzzled by his words tonight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Qingshan's eyes lit up. The fact that he asked this question meant that Li Che must have already completed the refinement of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal!</p><p></p><p>"You succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan became excited. Li Che smiled and nodded without denying it.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan clapped his hands and then stood up, glancing at the children playing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"The two of us... shall go in secret."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained unmoved and asked, "Where to?"</p><p></p><p>"To the Golden Light Peak, to verify the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan rubbed his hands and excitedly spoke the blasphemous words.</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained silent for a long time before uttering a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"You really can't wait to overturn the Heavenly Principles, can you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan became solemn: "I just want an answer. This conjecture has troubled me for too long, making me tremble, terrify, rage, feel powerless, and shiver..."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, don't you want to know who masterminded the assassination of Xixia?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a hidden danger, and with your personality... you won't be able to tolerate it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan leaned back in the chair, squinting his eyes at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che finished the last sip of hot tea in the cup, patted his ink-black robe, and stood up: "You really know how to read people."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the hidden danger targeting Xixia, I believe..."</p><p></p><p>"We should eliminate it completely, not leaving a single one."</p><p></p><p>"No matter who it is."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took his leave, saying he was going back to continue his divine observation.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo and LÃ¼ Chi stayed in Li Che's small courtyard tonight, and Gong Yuan Liang and Gongsun Xiu also stayed, returning to their cultivation peaks tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered the study, lit the lamps, and then drew the avatar of the Painting Immortal, quietly and seriously carving a wooden sculpture in the study.</p><p></p><p>His main body, however, left the study, turning into a black shadow and departing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing a cat-faced mask and hunching his back, had been waiting outside the courtyard early on. When Li Che arrived wearing a Ox Demon mask, the two "Qing-Niu" (Blue-Ox) met in the darkness, nodding slightly before disappearing into the night as streaks of light.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>The two "swooshed" down, landing on a towering tree, gazing at the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Sect Master is an Elementalist Cultivator, only one step away from achieving the Elemental Spirit. Once the Elemental Spirit is formed, he can detach from the physical body and roam the heavens and earth freely, silently and invisibly. Perhaps the Elemental Spirit is already beside you, and you haven't even sensed it."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing the cat-faced mask, spoke in a muffled voice.</p><p></p><p>This statement startled Li Che, causing the Chessmaster Dao Fruit in his chest to tremble, and the Heavenly Earth Chessboard to expand and envelop the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that there was no Elemental Spirit spying on them, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Earth Chessboard of the Chessmaster Dao Fruit should be able to detect the Elemental Spirit, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It's right here... but can it be detected? Any closer, and it might be noticed."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded but did not make a move immediately: "Now, can you tell me... what are your suspicions about the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the cat-faced mask looked up at the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Because... the clues I found, Zhou Daoyuan's death... is actually related to the Southernç¦»Fire."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Li Che suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Che fell silent, closing his eyes and immersing his mind into the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Within the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>A multitude of pure spiritual chess pieces surrounded the pitch-black, seemingly like a black hole, Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal that was now completely refined and obedient.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's phantom floated in the chessboard, hands behind his back, and flicked a finger.</p><p></p><p>One of the pure spiritual chess pieces suddenly shot out and was detonated by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The avalanche-like shockwave from the exploding spiritual chess piece violently struck the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal...</p><p></p><p>Instantly!</p><p></p><p>The previously calm and tranquil vast sea suddenly whipped up furious waves! The Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal trembled, and the invisible concentric circular ripples spread out in a fan-shaped manner, surging towards the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood tall and straight on the tree, his gaze fixed.</p><p></p><p>Any who had the Corpse Curse Seal imprinted on them would be exposed to his eyes by the shockwaves emanating from the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have a certain control over the hidden techniques of the Corpse Deity Sect, no, it should be said that it was the Chessmaster Dao Fruit, the Heavenly Nemesis of the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>The black shockwaves kept bursting out one after another.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were deep and insightful, comprehending everything.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Chessboard had long since expanded to envelop the entire Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>He also saw the secluded Southerné¢Fire in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Southerné¢Fire was seated on a meditation cushion, his body emanating dense, substantial spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves of the Corpse Curse Seal swept across his body.</p><p></p><p>Southerné¢Fire suddenly opened his eyes, and his powerful divine sense surged and fluctuated violently.</p><p></p><p>But he was unable to find any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Southerné¢Fire felt that someone was spying on him, but he couldn't locate the source.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't dare use the Heavenly Earth Chessboard to spy for too long, and after confirming that there was no trace of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal on Southerné¢Fire, he withdrew the chessboard's surveillance.</p><p></p><p>In the temple.</p><p></p><p>Southerné¢Fire's eyes were like two burning golden flames, and his body was like molten gold, with the spiritual energy constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>"Who is spying on me? To be able to do so silently and invisibly... is it an Elemental Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Has Suhuai already broken through to the Elemental Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Southerné¢Fire's gaze narrowed, and a sense of urgency suddenly surged from every muscle and bone in his body.</p><p></p><p>There was an intense killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, a trace of sorrow and pain was silently concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Am I... destined to be a step behind?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, the snow was icy cold, and the air was bitterly cold.</p><p></p><p>The tree branches were covered in thick snow, which fell off with a rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, and Li Qingshan immediately focused his gaze, waiting for an answer.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not hide anything, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Really no?"</p><p></p><p>He confirmed again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, indicating that there was truly nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Unless the Corpse Curse Seal on the other party's body has reached the Sixth Magistrate level, otherwise, if they harbor the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal, they will be exposed without any place to hide."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very confident.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly let out a low laugh, his whole body relaxing, and the tense spirit and energy within him seemed to have undergone a earth-shattering change at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, haha... That's great, that's great!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan felt that the heavy burden on his shoulders had suddenly collapsed and moved away.</p><p></p><p>Like a bird breaking free from its cage, breaking through the mountain pressure of the stone monkey.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even felt a change in the spiritual energy of Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"It was I, Li Qingshan, who misjudged the gentleman's heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked towards the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his hands and bowed deeply, as if expelling all the doubts and pent-up feelings he had harbored over the years.</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched silently.</p><p></p><p>"With a clear mind, the unease that has always been pressing on my heart has been completely erased. As long as it's not the Sect Master... the hidden scoundrels within the Divine Sect, they are not to be feared!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled lightly, seeming much younger.</p><p></p><p>The oppression brought by a persistent obsession can indeed change a person greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, I'm going to break through soon, in three days, I will break through to the Divine Cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>"I must break through, the Temple God Resonance is about to begin, and at that time... the Dao City, the various states, the various branch sects, and the experts of the Corpse Deity Sect will all gather in the Prefecture City. In that situation, the danger of my breakthrough will be extremely great."</p><p></p><p>"And I also need to enter the Divine Cultivator realm as soon as possible, to have the confidence to compete for the benefits in the Temple God Resonance!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's voice was filled with an unrestrained excitement and joy.</p><p></p><p>"In three days?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It will still be very dangerous, won't it?"</p><p></p><p>The hidden expert of the Corpse Deity Sect has not yet been exposed, and if he chooses to break through, the risk will still be very high.</p><p></p><p>"It's bait... this time it's true bait."</p><p></p><p>"I'll lure him out, and he will die!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's voice carried a cold and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, how's the situation with Ma Mian? Remember to help me contact Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, Li Qingshan, as if unable to hold back any longer, bid Li Che farewell and shot out, leaving no footprints in the snowy night.</p><p></p><p>On the tree branch, the snow was piled up thick.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, transformed into the mighty Ox Demon, stood upright on the branch, but did not bend it or shake off the snow.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Then who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were deep and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, there must be a result."</p><p></p><p>"You can't hide it."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's birthday has ended... it's time to see some blood."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood with his hands behind his back, and the Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao Fruit in his chest pounded, and the fiery blood within him became increasingly silent and invisible.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly plummeted, landing on the white snow-covered plain, and began to walk.</p><p></p><p>With each step, he left no footprints in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered, thickly covering the sky.</p><p></p><p>White snow drifted down, fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a black robe and wearing a Ox-faced mask under a wide-brimmed hat, walked silently within the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>His shoulders were broad, and his figure was towering.</p><p></p><p>He moved without a sound, blending into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Even if the disciples who had just completed their tasks and were returning at night brushed past him, they did not sense his presence at all.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Chessboard enveloped the area within a hundred yards around him, moving with his movements.</p><p></p><p>Within the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine sense, condensed into spiritual energy, flicked his fingers.</p><p></p><p>One spiritual chess piece after another was detonated by him using the nascent form of the technique "Great Avalanche".</p><p></p><p>The exploding shockwaves struck the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal,</p><p></p><p>Forming ripples that spread out in concentric circles.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was walking on the calm surface of a pond, and with each step, the ripples would expand outward.</p><p></p><p>Like a raging tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Che had acted so unrestrained within the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of a Furnace Sect Master, forging the Seven Emotions and Seven Spirits...</p><p></p><p>It was the confidence brought by his cultivation advancement.</p><p></p><p>Involving his daughter, the hidden party did not show themselves.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Che would...</p><p></p><p>Like a divine being inspecting the mountains, personally ferret out and eliminate the hidden vermin!</p><p></p><p>Boom!

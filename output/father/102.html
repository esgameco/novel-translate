        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qin Manor.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain was speaking of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>The entire manor seemed to have sunk into an ocean of divinity, with the dense and almost suffocating divine aura surging.</p><p></p><p>The source of this divinity was none other than the stooped old man standing amidst the devastation and large craters.</p><p></p><p>He was Qin Diwen, the ancestral patriarch of the Qin family who cultivated the "Nine Snakes Grieving Heavenly King" divine projection.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Snakes Grieving Heavenly King divine projection was a mid-grade seventh-tier divine projection, the foundation of the Qin family's ancestral divine projection art that allowed them to establish a foothold in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Although Qin Haonan and Qin Leishou were grand masters with perfected divine foundations, they could only gasp for breath under the oppressive divine aura of the ancestral patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"The Tang Clan's mechanism..."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Tang Clan are behind this?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen, the Qin family's ancestral patriarch, slightly furrowed his brows, his weathered face twitching: "Made with seventh-grade spiritual wood, complemented by godly carving skills... Such a precise mechanism could not have been created without the foundation of the Tang Clan's mechanism techniques."</p><p></p><p>"This thing explodes with extreme speed, shooting from who knows how far away. With the consumption of the qi and divinity in the heavens and earth, it still had the strength to kill Yuqing..."</p><p></p><p>The old man narrowed his eyes, the fury in his gaze gradually subsiding, as he retrieved a strand of the Bodhi tear-like Bodhi silk.</p><p></p><p>This mechanism was vicious - once it entered the body, it would explode violently, shredding the flesh and blood into bloody spheres.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Qin Yuqing was blown into pieces, otherwise, with the viciousness of this mechanism, her flesh and blood would have scattered like bloody teardrops all over the ground, leaving a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>"The Tang Clan's mechanism... Was it that old devil's doing? But why..."</p><p></p><p>"The Tang Clan has already been destroyed, and he is also under the surveillance of the Great Scenery Dynasty, how could he have acted?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Even as a divine projection cultivator, he felt bewildered and confused by this incident.</p><p></p><p>He had been in seclusion in the secret chamber, and by the time he sensed the fleeting light, it was already too late. He tried to block it with his divine sense, but it pierced through him completely.</p><p></p><p>So he gave up on the rescue, after all, Qin Yuqing's own qi and divinity were ignited in an instant, leaving him no time to react, and he couldn't teleport from the secret chamber in time.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Patriarch..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan and Qin Leishou, seeing that the old patriarch had stopped pondering, greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Has Yuqing offended anyone recently?"</p><p></p><p>"First, the gray-faced spy under her command was shot and killed, and then she was killed in the manor by this terrifying mechanism..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of ruthless person has she provoked?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan and Qin Leishou were at a loss, opening their mouths but unable to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Yuqing's child with the Fei Lei City Lord Cao Guang, Cao Qingyuan, died in Fei Lei City. Ancestral Patriarch, that Cao Guang cultivates the 'Three-Eyed Furious True Lord' divine foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Cao Guang is not dead? Has he secretly come to the prefecture city, and because Yuqing had an affair with Jinlie Gate's Jinxuan, provoked his wrath and murderous intent?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's ability to become the core true inheritor of Jinlie Gate naturally meant she had her own methods. Her talent was so ordinary, and she had taken so many elixirs to reach the grand master realm, so unstable, how could she occupy that true inheritor position? There must be someone backing her up.</p><p></p><p>"Jinxuan... the Jinlie Gate's Grand Elder? That old thing..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen furrowed his brows. As the divine projection ancestral patriarch, he now had to stabilize the clan, and let the clan master handle many matters, so this matter of Qin Yuqing's was the first time he had to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"That old thing is what, two hundred years old? This girl..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen's eyes flashed with disgust.</p><p></p><p>"When Qin Cao returns, let him arrange the handling of this matter. You two should also investigate, Qin Yuqing is at least our Qin family member, to be shot and killed within the manor... It's embarrassing to let it spread out."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's likely that we can't trace it, this mechanism came from at least twenty li away to shoot and kill..."</p><p></p><p>"But one after another, they simply don't regard our Qin family."</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The fleeting light broke through the air, and although the momentum was not great, the explosive power that had killed Qin Yuqing had already attracted the attention of many divine projection cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many divine projection cultivators had sensed it and were now curious to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Qin Diwen casually picked up a few flesh pearls that the Bodhi silk had torn out of Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Such a long-range lethal mechanism technique... Let the other old fellows take a look as well, it can't be that only our Qin family... has to live in fear."</p><p></p><p>The old man's figure flickered, directly soaring into the air, stepping into the void and floating away like an ancient immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off the Ancestral Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan and Qin Leishou bowed with clasped hands.</p><p></p><p>After the oppressive divine aura like a tidal wave had receded,</p><p></p><p>the two of them stood up and looked at the devastation in the courtyard, at the shredded remains of their sister Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Both of them sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Is it still Cao Guang? The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord's divine aura... Only Fei Lei City has it, I heard that Cao Guang has had a temple deity enter his body, his divine aura must have surged..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the news said he was killed and his body was shredded into a thousand pieces... but..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"His body was never found."</p><p></p><p>Qin Leishou shook his head: "He may not be dead..."</p><p></p><p>"But... what is this?"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, their faces full of worry.</p><p></p><p>"A mechanism from dozens of li away killed Yuqing..."</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to investigate this?"</p><p></p><p>They were all afraid...</p><p></p><p>Of becoming the next Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Enjoying themselves at home, only to be shot dead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spring rain was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pavilion, the warm brazier dispersed the chilly spring cold.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong had taken off her shoes and socks, her bare, shiny feet curled up on the sandalwood armchair, munching on melon seeds while reading a book.</p><p></p><p>Her beautiful brows were furrowed, her pretty face full of the thirst for knowledge. Her eyes did not move, but her fingers could skillfully find the position of the melon seeds, the crisp sound accompanied by her nimble tongue separating the shells and meat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had entered the Qin Tian Monitoring Treasure Pavilion, the warm atmosphere making him feel lazy and sluggish.</p><p></p><p>His gaze slightly narrowed, without a trace of the anxiety and unease from just having carried out an assassination.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a breath, Li Che found that no one had come to receive him.</p><p></p><p>Hesitating for a moment, he went straight to the private room and saw Shangguan Qinghong seemingly just drifting.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che hadn't seen the romance novel on the cover, he might have thought Shangguan Qinghong was studying some difficult technical problem.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Shangguan."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cleared his throat lightly, interrupting her concentration.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's dark brows relaxed, and seeing Li Che, she didn't feel embarrassed about being caught slacking off.</p><p></p><p>As a civil servant, eating the iron rice bowl, this was just standard operating procedure.</p><p></p><p>"You're here?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong unhurriedly patted her hands, and in front of Li Che, she began to put on socks and shoes on her shiny feet.</p><p></p><p>Li Che waited silently as she finished, and then the tightly dressed Shangguan Qinghong led the way deeper into the Qin Tian Monitoring.</p><p></p><p>"You came quite early, the assessment preparations are all done, I'll take you upstairs, the assessment room is on the third floor."</p><p></p><p>"The third-grade client assessment of the Qin Tian Monitoring in the Golden Light Prefecture will not be presided over by the Monitoring Supervisor, but by the two Junior Supervisors."</p><p></p><p>"You need to gain the approval of the two Junior Supervisors in order to obtain the third-grade client position."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>They went up to the second floor, which was also very spacious, with transparent crystal boxes displaying elixirs, divine wooden carvings and other items.</p><p></p><p>"The things displayed on the second level are good items among the tenth-grade divine objects, or even ninth-grade level good things..."</p><p></p><p>"Since you were recommended by Senior Qingshan, the two Junior Supervisors have specially arranged for you to be assessed individually today, normally the third-grade client assessments... are only held when there are enough people gathered."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong kept chattering, and Li Che nodded along. The positions in the Qin Tian Monitoring were hierarchical, with the Monitoring Supervisor being the highest, followed by the Deputy Supervisor, and then the Junior Supervisors, Qin Tian Reng, and Executives.</p><p></p><p>The third-grade client was equivalent to the Qin Tian Monitoring Executive position.</p><p></p><p>However, to become a third-grade client of the Qin Tian Monitoring was already something that many wood carving masters were scrambling for.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the inner private room on the second floor, the private room was surprisingly large, with a strong fragrance of wood permeating the air. Two figures in white robes were seated, conversing with each other.</p><p></p><p>As Shangguan Qinghong and Li Che entered, the two figures stopped talking and their gazes swept over them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a powerful divine sense suddenly descend upon him, his heart involuntarily tightening! Divine projection? The might of this divine sense was almost no different from the one the Qin family's ancestral patriarch had released when killing the gray-faced spy.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che soon dismissed this idea, as the divine aura emanating from these two Junior Supervisors did not give him the oppressive feeling of a divine projection cultivator's realm.</p><p></p><p>So they were just powerful in divine sense, but their divine aura had not yet reached that level.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's the matter?</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Li Che's mind, and he finally cupped his fists and bowed: "Li Che pays his respects to the two Supervisors."</p><p></p><p>The two Supervisors, one male and one female, were middle-aged in appearance. The woman's charm was still well-preserved, while the man had a goatee and narrow eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You were recommended by Li Qingshan, the Sect Master of the Qianyuan Shenzong's Leifeng Branch. We have specially arranged this Third-Grade Clientele Examination for you..."</p><p></p><p>"However, we will not show any favoritism just because you were recommended by Li Qingshan. In fact, we will be even more stringent."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his fists: "As it should be."</p><p></p><p>The two of them nodded. The middle-aged beauty looked Li Che up and down and said, "Li Che, a resident of Feilei City, started learning wood carving three years ago and has shown remarkable talent, becoming a master wood carver at Xu's Wood Carving Shop in Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>The beauty recounted Li Che's background.</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained silent, waiting for her to continue.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong dragged a small stool to the corner, took out a handful of melon seeds from her pocket, and started cracking them while watching Li Che's examination.</p><p></p><p>"Your background is quite clean. Demonstrate your cultivation of qi, blood, and spiritual attainments."</p><p></p><p>The other middle-aged man in white robes said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, clenched his five fingers, and his qi and blood surged. He revealed his superficial martial arts cultivation of "Three Turnovers of Blood."</p><p></p><p>In terms of spiritual attainments, he displayed the Xu family's "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" spiritual technique, with his nature as calm as a flowing stream.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man gripped the wolf-hair brush and slightly furrowed his brows as he lightly wrote on the white paper: "Three Turnovers of Blood, nature as calm as a stream... the cultivation is a bit weak, barely passing the Third-Grade Clientele Examination."</p><p></p><p>"Most Third-Grade Clienteles have spiritual foundation cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Clientele Examination focuses more on skills. There are also those who are not spiritually inclined but still become Clienteles. Master Li, prepare yourself, and we shall begin the examination."</p><p></p><p>"The examination you applied for is the Third-Grade Master Wood Carver Clientele Examination, and there is only one item to be tested."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man stroked his goatee, and with a quick guidance of the Qiankun Jade at his waist, a wooden sculpture about half the size of a person suddenly appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sculpture was carved from spiritual wood, with rough lines and aggressive chisel marks, only roughly sketched out.</p><p></p><p>One could vaguely see that this wooden sculpture was of a child-like figure. Although very crude and simplified, the form was discernible.</p><p></p><p>Barefoot, stepping on fierce dragons and snakes, with a furious gaze, four arms protruding from the back, wearing a red belly band and red flowing robes, one hand grasping a jade vase, one hand grasping a jade scepter, one hand grasping a collar, and one hand grasping a short spear! Due to the only preliminary sketching of the lines, it appeared very rough, but there was already a powerful spiritual presence permeating it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were instantly captivated.</p><p></p><p>"This is a spiritual wood sculpture with only 30% completion. Master Li, you will continue the carving for three hours. When the time is up, the carving will stop, and your completion will be evaluated based on how much you have carved."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged beauty Supervisor said.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Four-Armed Furious Third Prince' spiritual wood sculpture, originally the statue of the 'Eight-Armed Purgatory Lotus Furious Third Prince' temple deity outside the city."</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual essence that flows through the Nine Dragon River in the city is diluted from the essence of this Third Prince temple deity, and it is the spiritual vein for the cultivation of the spiritual cultivators in the Golden Light Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Once the Four-Armed Furious Third Prince statue is completed, it can stir up the waves of the Nine Dragon River. Although you are only continuing the carving, if you can stir up the waves, it will be considered a successful examination."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged Supervisor with the goatee said calmly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, whether it was the beauty or Shangguan Qinghong sitting in the corner cracking melon seeds, their movements paused.</p><p></p><p>"Public Goat Supervisor... Since when has the Third-Grade Clientele Examination required stirring up the waves of the Nine Dragon River when continuing the carving of the statue?"</p><p></p><p>The beauty frowned, somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged Supervisor with the goatee, however, smiled: "Palace Carp Supervisor, this person was recommended by Li Qingshan. If he cannot even stir up the waves of the Nine Dragon River..."</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't that mean Li Qingshan is just toying with us?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, my evaluation standard is still within the scope, isn't it? This spiritual wood sculpture is already 30% complete. If he can continue the carving to 70%, he should be able to stir up the waves. If he can't even carve 40%..."</p><p></p><p>"The Clientele threshold of our Heavenly Monitoring Bureau is not that low."</p><p></p><p>His calm words lingered in the room.</p><p></p><p>The beauty frowned slightly but did not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the corner, Shangguan Qinghong looked at Li Che with some sympathy and couldn't help muttering, "Senior Qingshan's recommendation has indeed opened the convenient door, but the Supervisors' requirements will be even more stringent... He needs true talent and skill."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, becoming a wood carving master in three years... does he have true talent and skill?"</p><p></p><p>The room gradually fell silent, and the beauty Palace Carp also said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Public Goat Supervisor is right. I am willing to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was gracious and amiable, cupping his fists and bowing.</p><p></p><p>The beauty's expression softened, and her gaze at Li Che was quite appreciative.</p><p></p><p>What a gracious and amiable person he is.</p><p></p><p>Unhurried and calm, he is indeed the material of a wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>Public Goat Conncheng stroked his beard, his eyes shining, and smiled: "Then let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>He then walked to the wooden sculpture, embraced the half-person-tall wooden sculpture with his hands, and with the circulation of his qi and blood, moved the sculpture to the carving workbench.</p><p></p><p>The workbench was fully equipped with carving tools, even superior quality chisels far beyond Li Che's own tools.</p><p></p><p>Gently exhaling a breath to calm his mind, Li Che began to carefully examine this "Four-Armed Furious Third Prince." Although it was a simplified version of the temple deity statue, it still possessed a unique connotation.</p><p></p><p>The carving had reached 30%, and according to Supervisor Public Goat's words, he needed to continue the carving to 70% in order to stir up the spiritual essence in the waters of the Nine Dragon River and cause the waves to rise.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Monitoring Bureau's Treasure Pavilion was located on the banks of the tributary of the Nine Dragon River that ran through the Golden Light Prefecture, built by the river. Looking out through the carved wooden windows, one could see the calm and gentle river surface outside.</p><p></p><p>Continuing the carving meant completing the work based on the existing carving. In fact, the carving techniques and methods used by the original carver would affect the final product of the continued carving. One needed to try to connect with the original carver's skills, or else the sense of discontinuity would be too severe, and it might not even become a spiritual wood sculpture.</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, this was not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>What Li Che needed to consider was... how much to complete.</p><p></p><p>Hold back his skills?</p><p></p><p>No, Li Che shook his head. He did not need to hold back his skills in this Clientele examination.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's family had just arrived in the prefecture, and they needed the support of a powerful faction. At least until Xixing entered the Sect, they needed to find another background to stand on. Moreover, they had offended the Qin Family, and had even made a move against Qin Yuqing before.</p><p></p><p>If Qin Yuqing were to die, the Qin Family would certainly be enraged. Although Li Che was confident that he had left no traces, it would be difficult for the other party to trace it back to him from dozens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>However, a steady hand was still needed, and he had to wrap himself in the tiger's skin in order to establish a foothold in the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qingshan was a good backing, he was not currently in the prefecture, and the face of the Sect would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>So, Li Qingshan's recommendation of him to the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau might also have this consideration in mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly had an idea in his mind. He would no longer choose to hide his own skills.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Technique: Thousand Separation Hands.</p><p></p><p>With a jade-like luster, Li Che's palms gently brushed over the wooden sculpture, and a flood of information about this sculpture poured into his mind - the carving skills of the creator, the angle of the chisel, the force of the strokes, the style of the carving, and so on.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes, an invisible wave of energy surged out from within the building.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's aura underwent a complete transformation, his gaze becoming cold and detached. The wooden sculpture seemed to be in constant motion in his eyes, with countless lines rising and falling. Gripping the chisel, the gleaming blade instantly fell, slicing into a line, the crisp sound of the sharp blade smoothly cutting through the spiritual wood, and wood chips falling.</p><p></p><p>The chisel rose and fell, the blade light like a swimming dragon.</p><p></p><p>Public Goat Conncheng and Palace Carp could see at a glance that this Li Che had substance, skill in his hands, and was not someone who had come through the back door.</p><p></p><p>The room was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Even Shangguan Qinghong in the corner, who had been cracking melon seeds, no longer made a sound, afraid of disturbing Li Che's... display of skills.</p><p></p><p>She slightly parted her moist red lips, her eyes revealing a strange color.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual essence dispersed in the heavens and earth began to slowly converge.</p><p></p><p>As the form of the spiritual wood sculpture gradually took shape, and the posture was perfectly delineated...</p><p></p><p>The "Four-Armed Furious Third Prince" seemed to come alive.</p><p></p><p>The dragons and snakes under his bare feet roared in fury, the four arms waving, the red robes billowing, the angry glare, vivid and lifelike, as if about to overturn the seas and subdue the dragons.</p><p></p><p>The wandering spiritual essence in the heavens and earth began to be ravenously devoured by the furious spiritual wood sculpture, to the extent that...</p><p></p><p>Through the carved wooden window, the flow of the Nine Dragon River near the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau's Treasure Pavilion also began to ripple slightly, the white waves crashing, the spiritual essence diffusing...</p><p></p><p>But the white waves were just beginning to brew, as if the spiritual essence in the water was being pulled by an invisible force! A wave crashed against the foundation of the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau's Treasure Pavilion, splashing up transparent water droplets in the sunlight!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sound of the wave hitting the Treasure Pavilion was deafening! Inside the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was burning, and his qi and blood surged unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>The chisel flipped between his five fingers, wood chips flying.</p><p></p><p>The "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit in his chest was pounding rapidly, as if sensing Li Che's surging and turbulent state at this moment, wanting to use his own craftsmanship to become the capital for his family to settle safely in the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>To make the world open their eyes and see.</p><p></p><p>What is...</p><p></p><p>Immortal Craftsman!</p><p></p><p>(Please support me with monthly votes and recommendations!

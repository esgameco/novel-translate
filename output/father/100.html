        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spring rain seemed to have become more turbulent, evaporated by the scorching temperature, rising into a hazy wave.</p><p></p><p>Lingering in the air, it left behind a trace like an angry flood dragon's rolling.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying divine power suddenly erupted, like thunderous explosions, with countless electric snakes intertwined and coiled, and an icy cold death aura permeating!</p><p></p><p>The cultivator at the initial Shen Ji realm, wearing a gray mask, was pierced through the brow, and the terrifying inertia of the arrow pinned him firmly to the vermilion door of the Qin Mansion, studded with copper nails.</p><p></p><p>Blood blossomed from the back of his head like an exploding lotus.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint "crack" sound was heard.</p><p></p><p>It was the sound of the gray mask shattering, the cracked mask splitting into two and falling to the ground, revealing the pale middle-aged face that had long been deprived of sunlight.</p><p></p><p>His eyes still lingered with the terror before death.</p><p></p><p>Just one arrow...</p><p></p><p>An initial Shen Ji realm cultivator was killed on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The silence lasted only for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly surged from within the Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The deafening voice, like a thunderous strike on the earth, a giant rock plunging into a vast lake, the sound waves forming a shockwave, burst out from the Qin Mansion, causing the spring rain to evaporate instantly.</p><p></p><p>After firing the arrow, Li Che, wearing the horse-faced mask, immediately concealed his aura and activated the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" of the Dragon Elephant Vajra Fruit to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>He became like a straight black line, merging into the rain curtain and fleeing along the wall.</p><p></p><p>After changing several alleys, he finally stood still, pressed against the wall, holding his breath, and even slowing his heartbeat to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on the sky above the Qin Mansion, as if a mirage, a huge virtual image appeared, which was the condensation of divine power. Its mere presence caused a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>The virtual image had a face full of sorrowful tears, wearing golden armor and clothes like golden dragon scales, with four arms, knotted muscles, and blue veins like flood dragons. Coiled around its body were long snakes, with nine heads twisting and winding, their purple skin exuding an overwhelming divine power of sorrow, sweeping away the falling spring raindrops like a storm!</p><p></p><p>The divine appearance! </p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, and his heartbeat became even more steady.</p><p></p><p>This was the realm beyond the Shen Ji, the divine appearance! By observing the divine image, one could cultivate the divine power, and this was an extremely powerful realm.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family, as a century-old aristocratic family in the prefecture city, not only had the inheritance of the divine appearance, but also had a living divine appearance ancestor guarding the family!</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of a clan!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind had already connected with the Chess Sage Fruit, ready to use the flying thunder chess sage power to move away.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise was that he did not expose himself...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Countless raindrops exploded, and a powerful, almost tangible divine consciousness swept across the long street, like a radar scan.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could even clearly feel the countless raindrops being distorted, forming a series of rippling water waves.</p><p></p><p>This was the divine appearance's divine consciousness, sweeping across the ten-mile-long street...</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Che sensed the divine consciousness scanning over his body, he seemed to have detected something, and it retreated, then scanned again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained motionless, as if fusing with the wall.</p><p></p><p>The divine consciousness left, then came back, and left again.</p><p></p><p>After going back and forth about four or five times, it finally left.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but think: "This old Gu..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was also a little excited, as the concealment ability of the Sleeping Dragon Elephant at level 3 of the Dragon Elephant Vajra Fruit could barely evade the divine consciousness of the divine appearance cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Just this realization alone was an excellent harvest, even though he had taken action in the identity of the horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>As for other gains...</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained standing still, not only to prevent the divine appearance elder of the Qin family from launching a counterattack, but also because he was using the chessboard ability of the Chess Sage Fruit.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, black lines danced, then intersected and woven, forming a chessboard grid that extended downward.</p><p></p><p>With Li Che's body position as a chessboard star, it immediately spread out, encompassing the area in front of the Qin Mansion, as Li Che had pulled in a close-range view.</p><p></p><p>So he did not venture into the Qin Mansion, as the divine power pressure of the divine appearance cultivator permeated the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not dare to directly intrude and spy.</p><p></p><p>However, this was already enough.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the heavenly chessboard, Li Che clearly saw the situation in front of the Qin Mansion at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Three figures rushed out of the Qin Mansion at an extremely fast speed, their powerful blood and qi intertwining and permeating in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Two men and one woman, with the two men in middle age, dressed in elegant clothes and brocade, and the woman with a graceful and beautiful appearance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's vision immediately locked onto the woman.</p><p></p><p>When the woman saw the gray-masked man who had been shot and killed, her beautiful face darkened like water, and her long, white fingers clenched into fists, with terrifying killing intent intertwining and permeating.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the horse-faced mask, was pressed against the wall.</p><p></p><p>His expression was completely calm.</p><p></p><p>Under the horse-faced mask, his eyes were deep and tranquil, as if reflecting the woman's exquisite face.</p><p></p><p>Committing it deeply to memory.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing, the jade-faced demonic goddess.</p><p></p><p>I, the horse-faced, have remembered you.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lightly stepped with his toes, wearing the horse-faced mask, as if merging into the spring rain, disappearing silently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Mansion, the pungent smell of blood permeated the air, mixed with the scorched aroma of the electric arc and the scorching heat that had evaporated the spring rain.</p><p></p><p>The three elegant figures stood in front of the door, looking at the impaled figure.</p><p></p><p>The two middle-aged men's gaze fell on the woman: "Yueqing, is this your person?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing's raven-black hair gently brushed against her delicate, well-maintained face, and her expression was icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"I sent him on a mission, and he must have made some discoveries and wanted to return to the mansion to report, but was shot and killed at the front gate."</p><p></p><p>"The thief... How dare he! Treat our Qin Mansion as nothing?!"</p><p></p><p>The sharp killing intent emanating from Qin Yueqing's eyes, with her Shen Ji realm divine power intertwining, caused ominous winds and ghostly howls.</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to kill someone now! Her gray-masked spy she had sent to monitor that carpenter had died, this was a provocation, but who was it? That stinking carpenter from Flaming Thunder City? Or other aristocratic families? Or the Temple Guard? The Divine Sect's branch?</p><p></p><p>There were indeed too many forces in the prefecture city that could strike against the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>Too chaotic... She couldn't guess who it was right away.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing bit her full lips, her eyes flashing, constantly pondering. The world said she was a deranged and poisonous woman who loved to torture people and listen to the sounds of pain. But in reality, she planned her actions very systematically, never leaving any loopholes, and aimed to kill her targets in one strike, not giving them a chance to struggle.</p><p></p><p>"Sensing the lingering divine power, it can be analyzed that the one who struck was of the divine power of wrath."</p><p></p><p>"Killing a Shen Ji realm cultivator with a single arrow, it must be a divine archer, proficient in archery, to have the confidence to kill in one strike, not giving any chance."</p><p></p><p>One of the middle-aged men closed his eyes and then opened them, with a faint reddish glow flowing in his pupils, as if the air was being drawn in, swirling like a vortex.</p><p></p><p>"A divine archer? And also cultivating the divine power of wrath, with such qualifications, even in the prefecture city, there are not many, even if they are disguised and concealed, the divine power cannot be deceived... Could it be the 'Heart Monkey Temple'? Or the divine archer of the Gongyang family?"</p><p></p><p>The other middle-aged man also frowned, speculating.</p><p></p><p>"An arrow shot from miles away, piercing through a Shen Ji realm cultivator, shattering his Nirvana Inner Landscape, this accuracy, this strength, this ruthlessness... It is not an ordinary divine archer. Among the major aristocratic families in the prefecture city, which one has secretly nurtured such a terrifying divine archer?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did they strike against our Qin family? Is it a show of force? Or... Third Sister, have you not handled things properly recently and left a loophole?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the questioning of her two elder brothers, Qin Yueqing's face was impatient: "Impossible, if I took action, it would be done cleanly..."</p><p></p><p>"This divine archer may not necessarily be targeting us, perhaps it is aimed at our Qin family!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing was dissatisfied with her two elder brothers' doubts, as it was a lack of trust in her abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing clenched her five fingers and suddenly pulled out the wooden arrow deeply embedded in the wooden door. The arrow had a spiral pattern, made of spiritual wood, like a winding snake on it.</p><p></p><p>The divine power remaining on it...</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing's eyes suddenly narrowed, as if she had been struck by lightning on a clear day.</p><p></p><p>"The divine power of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord?!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine power that can be generated by the mysterious temple of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord in Flaming Thunder City?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing was somewhat unbelieving.</p><p></p><p>And Qin Yueqing's two elder brothers, Qin Haonan and Qin Leixiao, were also stunned, their expressions gradually becoming strange.</p><p></p><p>"The divine power of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord? It really is..."</p><p></p><p>"Third Sister, could it be that your former husband from Flaming Thunder City..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing's face instantly became ferocious: "Impossible, shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"That waste is dead, he died long ago! His body can't even be found!"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be him!"</p><p></p><p>Clenching her fingers, the wooden arrow instantly shattered into powder, and Qin Yueqing's eyes were crazed and bitter, making her beautiful face appear distorted and acrimonious.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it then?"</p><p></p><p>"The Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord... Who else can cultivate such divine power?"</p><p></p><p>"That stinking carpenter from Flaming Thunder City, he must not be able to wash away the suspicion... My people just went to investigate him, and the result is that he was shot and killed at the gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Li Che... He must be involved!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the horse-faced mask and returned to the bustling main street, holding a paper umbrella.</p><p></p><p>His shoes were soaked in the wet cobblestone ground, and as he walked, he pondered and recalled the beautiful woman's face he had locked onto through the heavenly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueqing, it should be her.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I don't know how strong her cultivation is?</p><p></p><p>Earlier, through the heavenly chessboard, he had a fleeting glimpse and vaguely sensed that her blood strength was definitely not low, and the magnitude of her divine power should have reached the post-Shen Ji realm.</p><p></p><p>"The core true transmission of the Golden Rift Gate, their cultivation must not be low. As one of the five major sects in the prefecture city of the Gold Light Mansion, although they may not be as strong as the Divine Sect's branch, the core true transmissions within the sect definitely do not lack in medicinal resources and martial arts. Their blood cultivation... Likely at the level of a Zhenqi Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>"The legendary South Wushan Venerable Work Bodhi Barret... Using the dragon tooth yellow sandalwood as the body, imbued with a powerful spirituality and divine power, and further assisted by the meticulous craftsmanship of the Bodhi Tears and Raven Wood techniques, the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullets..."</p><p></p><p>"Can they kill a Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>The pupils in Li Che's eyes flickered with light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew that the battle between Sect Masters was not so simple.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was indeed a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>Between Qin Yuqing and Li Qingshan, there must be a huge chasm. Just as people like Liu He spoke of Li Qingshan with great respect, addressing him as "Senior Qingshan", when they mentioned Qin Yuqing, it was always "that poisonous woman".</p><p></p><p>This shows that even if Qin Yuqing was a grandmaster, she was certainly not a powerful grandmaster... <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>So...</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"It's best to kill her, but if not... at least we should be able to make her settle down a bit."</p><p></p><p>"A smart person, upon learning of a great hidden threat, will naturally act more cautiously and steadily, not daring to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the capital city, Li Che also did not want to stir up too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>But this world was like walking on thin ice, Li Che had to be extremely careful, not afraid of thieves, but afraid of those who had their eyes on him...</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing...</p><p></p><p>The thought of such a poisonous woman having her eyes on him made Li Che's hair stand on end. If he were to imagine his daughter encountering great calamity, his heart and liver would be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in order to obtain a peaceful and quiet life, Li Che could only take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, and the next moment he opened them, he had regained his calm.</p><p></p><p>The misty spring rain in the south of the Yangtze River, stirring up the intoxicating spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>In a black robe and clothes, the figure of Li Che, without the snow-white appearance of a Confucian scholar, did not seem to have emerged from an ink-and-wash painting.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was also refined and gentle, blending in with the spring rain.</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory in the capital city had a dedicated building.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, Liu He and Hai Chuanying had informed him of the specific location of the Astronomical Observatory in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy spring rain, on the bank of the tributary of the Jiulong River, facing the spring breeze, stood a nine-story pagoda tower, with eight-treasure eaves and two dragons arching over a pearl at the top. The black tiles were neatly and meticulously laid, and the water flow gathered by the spring rain flowed down the edges, like a jade bead curtain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped up to the Astronomical Observatory, wanting to understand the examination requirements for becoming a guest scholar there.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the pavilion, he folded his umbrella and shook off the water droplets.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stored the oiled paper umbrella in his Void Space, and then stepped into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It was quite different from the image of a government office, with no hurried figures, no slacking civil servants, but rather a dazzling array of goods.</p><p></p><p>In transparent crystal frames, laid with satin, various items were displayed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze swept over them, seeing elixirs, weapons, divine wood carvings, and more, all categorized with wooden tags.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was puzzled, this was the Astronomical Observatory... not a supermarket? "Sir, is there anything you wish to purchase?"</p><p></p><p>A soft, gentle voice came from the side, accompanied by a waft of fragrance. Li Che turned his head and saw a graceful young lady, her skin as white as jade, her eyes turning gently, standing quietly beside him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled, he had entered the Astronomical Observatory, yet he had not noticed this woman's appearance at all. The woman looked at Li Che and smiled, "The first floor of the Astronomical Observatory has goods of the Tenth-Grade level, of course, there are also common items of lower grades. Sir, please state your needs, and I can advise you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head and clasped his hands, "I have come to inquire about the examination for becoming a guest scholar."</p><p></p><p>The woman's face showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Before she could respond, a loud, cheerful laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Li, you're here! I've been waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Liu He, wearing a service uniform with the seal of the Zhen Temple on his waist, came over with a smile on his face. He had a good impression of Li Che after their conversation yesterday, and with Li Qingshan's recommendation, the first impression was excellent.</p><p></p><p>The graceful woman saw Liu He and nodded, "Guest Scholar Liu, shall I introduce?"</p><p></p><p>"Miss Shangguan Qinghong, this is Li Che, a master wood carver from Feilei City, recommended by Senior Qingshan to participate in the guest scholar examination at our Astronomical Observatory."</p><p></p><p>Liu He did not beat around the bush and directly stated Li Che's identity.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Master Li. I am Shangguan Qinghong." The woman smiled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Guest Scholar Liu can go about your business. I heard you've taken on a big order, carving a 'Furious Three Princes Temple Statue with Eight-Armed Lotus', that's not an easy task. I'll take care of receiving Master Li."</p><p></p><p>The woman said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Liu He's face stiffened slightly, but he knew Shangguan Qinghong was doing this because of Li Qingshan, so he didn't mind. He looked at Li Che, "Master Li, I wish you success in the examination. Another day, I'll take you to Yunfang Pavilion to drink and listen to music."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong gave Liu He a kick, and Liu He laughed heartily as he left.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, don't get too close to him, Yunfang Pavilion is not a good place." Shangguan Qinghong resumed her dignified demeanor and spoke to Li Che in a sweet voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, his gaze flickering. The Shangguan family, one of the five great families of Jinguang Prefecture?</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong led Li Che to a private room in the pavilion, where a heated stove was boiling water, and the fragrant aroma of tea filled the room.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, have some tea. This is 'Dragon Ridge Tea' grown with water from the Jiulong River. It's sweet on the tongue and burns like fire in the belly, containing a touch of divinity. The taste is excellent."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong had been reading and drinking tea in the private room, and only came out to receive Li Che when she sensed his arrival.</p><p></p><p>Today was her shift, and reading books and drinking tea was the most comfortable thing to do during her shift.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was an official staff member of the Astronomical Observatory, certified by the court, not like Liu He or Hai Chuanying who had passed the examination to become guest scholars.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, you're from Feilei City?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong poured a cup of tea for Li Che, placing it before him with her long, slender fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Feilei City is not very peaceful. I heard the city lord is insane, gathering the blood of a thousand infants, robbing the divine nature of a thousand wood carvers, and sacrificing the people of the entire city to help a strange temple ascend to the Nine Luminaries... Fortunately, he was stopped by Senior Qingshan with a ram's horn hammer."</p><p></p><p>"For Master Li to come from Feilei City to the capital is indeed not easy."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong glanced at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter has good divine nature, and was valued by Senior Qingshan, so she left Feilei City early, avoiding a disaster."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's expression stiffened slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Master Li already has a child?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hand holding the teacup paused for a moment. He's 22 years old... has a child... is that not normal? Shangguan Qinghong's dignified demeanor suddenly relaxed, and she slumped back into the armchair like a reckless young girl.</p><p></p><p>Since he's a married man, there's no need to keep up appearances.</p><p></p><p>"That's really a pity." Shangguan Qinghong took out various candied fruits, seeds, and dried meats from the drawer of the tea table and began to eat without any reservations.</p><p></p><p>Why bother with an image in front of a married man? It's not like he'll marry her.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>However, the current Shangguan Qinghong gave a more relaxed impression.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted more harmoniously.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Li, this is your examination token and identity token. Come to the Astronomical Observatory again tomorrow, the guest scholar examination requires prior preparation and approval from the Supervisor before it can be conducted. I'll need to report it later."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong handed Li Che a wooden token made of spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like color flowed from his fingertips, and the information was immediately displayed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Divine Weapon (Top-Grade Tenth): Astronomical Observatory Third-Grade Token】</p><p></p><p>【Craftsmanship: Made from Ninth-Grade spiritual wood "Southern離Pine", can store divine nature and inner qi, extremely durable, can be used as bricks, a symbol of identity】</p><p></p><p>【Wielder: Astronomical Observatory Third-Grade Guest Scholar and Astronomical Executor】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che played with the token, his eyes brightening: "Southern離Pine?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong looked at Li Che with surprise: "Master Li has excellent eyesight to identify the spiritual wood species of the token at a glance, that is extremely rare."</p><p></p><p>"Once Master Li passes the examination, he can input his own divine nature or inner qi, and it will become a symbol of identity."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded and put away the token.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong then told Li Che more details about the examination the next day, and Li Che took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching from the carved window, Shangguan Qinghong cracked some melon seeds in her hand, her gaze flickering as she looked at Li Che's black-clad figure disappearing into the rain.</p><p></p><p>"Crack, crack, someone was shot dead in front of the Qin family manor... it shouldn't be him, right? I didn't sense any divine foundation or divine nature, and his blood refinement is only at the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>"One arrow to kill a divine foundation cultivator at the initial stage, crack, crack, it seems the Qin family's poisonous woman has met her match."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Astronomical Observatory, Li Che went to Liuxiang Pavilion, packed some wine and dishes, and stored them in his Void Jade, then headed home.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the spring rain drizzled, muffled sounds coming from the oiled paper umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Just as he reached the entrance of Tinghua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's foot touched the ground, and the puddle instantly rippled. In his chest, the [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit pulsed, and the celestial chessboard unfolded.</p><p></p><p>In the intersecting grid of the chessboard, a series of auras rose from the ground, shining like stars in his perception.</p><p></p><p>"One, two, three... suddenly there are three gray-masked surveillance figures, quite a poisonous woman."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression remained calm as he strode upright with his umbrella, entering Tinghua Alley.</p><p></p><p>The three figures in gray masks, their gazes gloomy and their auras suppressed, continued to keep watch on his orders.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the spring wind brought rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che taught his wife Zhang Ya a more difficult meridian-opening movement, and also used the [Untainted Heart] divine nature to help her refine her body.</p><p></p><p>He also habitually taught Xixie martial arts and strengthened her divine nature to enhance her physique, then Li Che left the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Upon leaving Tinghua Alley, the three surveillance auras reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paid no mind, opening his umbrella and heading towards the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful gaze of the three gray-masked Qin family members, he entered the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Che's five fingers gripped the Feilei chess piece, and he disappeared without a trace the instant he stepped into the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the workshop courtyard, the spring rain drizzled, wetting many of the wood materials.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in a chair, taking out the "Dragon Tooth Bodhi" made of dragon tooth yellow sandalwood, carefully carving the patterns on it.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly carving it,</p><p></p><p>Li Che tore open the air with his five fingers, pulling out a horse-faced mask and covering his face with it.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a wide-brimmed hat and lowering the brim,</p><p></p><p>Click!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of metal friction and assembly, a long gun barrel made of seventh-grade spiritual wood, dragon tooth yellow sandalwood, was embedded into the gun body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held the "Namo Immortal Craftsman Bodhi Barrett" diagonally, inserting the sole dragon tooth Bodhi into it.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a scorching heat, a clamor, like a roaring dragon, ready to be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of miles away, ready to lock onto a soul!</p><p></p><p>Tapping his toes,</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced mask, like a ghostly figure, silently and invisibly merged into the fine spring rain.</p><p></p><p>A six-thousand-word chapter, seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes, seeking continued reading!

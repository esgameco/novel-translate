        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Fishing Clan fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan leader, with his bushy eyebrows and leopard-like eyes, had a grave expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Spring Equinox is approaching, and the time has come for the Shen Sect to open its mountain gate to recruit disciples. Li Qingshan should indeed be returning soon."</p><p></p><p>The leader let out a sigh and leaned back in his chair.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Shen Sect has been inactive lately, they must have been waiting for Li Qingshan's return. And with Li Qingshan's temperament, he won't be any easier to deal with than Niu Mo. Our Fishing Clan has been getting closer to the Corpse God Sect recently... We will definitely be targeted by those bastards!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Wudao, the Fishing Clan leader, frowned deeply and began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The anger he had felt towards Niu Mo gradually subsided, as Niu Mo could only threaten the lower-level forces under the Fishing Clan, but not the higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingshan was different.</p><p></p><p>This man was a renowned expert in the Zun State, with a "Six Bureaus" level Shen Basis, the [Suspended Thought Thunder Execution of Evil]. Being able to cultivate a Six Bureaus Shen Basis was a testament to his innate talent and foundation.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his Patriarch-level physical cultivation, even Xuan Xiang experts could be severely injured by him. Although Xuan Xiang was considered a Shen Xiang realm, it was far inferior to the true Shen Xiang level, and they could not resist the suppression of the Shen Basis realm.</p><p></p><p>Many Xuan Xiang experts had been defeated by Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The true Shen Xiang cultivators did not dare to provoke him easily, as the Shen Sect's experts had entered the Four Sovereign Prince Temple, but... they could not treat the Shen Sect as if no one was there.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was the Shen Sect's enforcer, specifically targeting the aristocratic sects in the Jin Guang Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that they did not dare to retaliate against Li Qingshan's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Inauspicious!" Jing Wudao cursed angrily, feeling helpless.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of Li Qingshan, as a true Shen Xiang initial stage cultivator, Li Qingshan could not be his match.</p><p></p><p>But for the Fishing Clan, if Li Qingshan were to rampage, they would have a hard time dealing with him.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately... fortunately, Niu Mo and this Li Qingshan are not on the same side."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if Niu Mo had obtained a Corpse Curse Seal cultivator from the Fishing Clan, and Li Qingshan started to attack... our Fishing Clan would be crushed."</p><p></p><p>Jing Wudao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Deputy Leader Liu Jingsong, sitting beside him, also furrowed his brows, as the interests of the Fishing Clan were their own interests.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, have we made contact with a powerful expert from the Corpse God Sect? How did this Niu Mo manage to find someone who has been granted the Corpse Curse Seal? If we don't figure this out, the threat of Niu Mo will not be eliminated, and who else will dare to trust the Corpse God Sect's promises in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Wudao shook his head, "The Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Enraged Three Prince Mysterious Temple has suddenly erupted in turmoil, and the Shen Sect's experts, the Zhen Temple, the Qin Tian Observatory, and most of the Shen Xiang experts in the Jin Guang Prefecture City have gone to investigate. This should have been the best opportunity for the Corpse God Sect to infiltrate the Jin Guang Prefecture City... but then this Niu Mo appeared."</p><p></p><p>"You think the [Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Enraged Three Prince] Mysterious Temple's sudden turmoil is not without reason? Such sudden and widespread events are often orchestrated by someone behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect's experts who have infiltrated the Jin Guang Prefecture have all gone to the Three Prince Temple."</p><p></p><p>"This is a Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple, after all..."</p><p></p><p>"There are too many people with ulterior motives... Just think about it, the reason why the Qian Yuan Sect is ranked among the Great Scenery Eleven Paths, the Lingnan Path Sect, is because of the Mysterious Temple they suppress..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not really suppression, but rather coexistence, relying on the temple to establish their sect's lineage!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Wudao's leopard-like eyes flashed with insight.</p><p></p><p>He let out a sigh, feeling that the topic had strayed, and brought it back.</p><p></p><p>"This Niu Mo, a clown-like thing, won't be able to jump around for much longer. The Corpse God Sect has specially dispatched an Eight Extremes Corpse God Envoy from the Cloud State City, a true Shen Xiang realm cultivator, and they have brought a divine weapon that can counter the Teleportation Technique, along with a divine talisman that can seal the void..."</p><p></p><p>"This Niu Mo, if he dares to jump around again, he will not be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Wudao slammed his palm on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no one who can deal with this Niu Mo?"</p><p></p><p>Deputy Leader Liu Jingsong and Elder Lao Qi visibly relaxed their brows.</p><p></p><p>Good.</p><p></p><p>An Eight Extremes Corpse God Envoy has been dispatched, and they have a divine weapon that can counter the Teleportation Technique.</p><p></p><p>Everyone...</p><p></p><p>Can finally sit down and enjoy the beef!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che finished his cultivation and was in the workshop making "Dragon Tooth Bodhi" bullets.</p><p></p><p>This was truly not easy to make. Previously, it had taken him more than half a month to carve just one bullet on the way from Flying Thunder City to the Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Now, although Li Che's [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit had improved significantly, and he had the experience of making the first bullet, the speed was still not that fast.</p><p></p><p>After carefully polishing for a while, Li Che finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The second 'Dragon Tooth Bodhi' bullet is complete, my Immortal Craftsman Barrett can finally be used again, and my gun has a bullet now!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a good mood, carefully storing the "Dragon Tooth Bodhi" bullet, which was like an exquisite work of art.</p><p></p><p>Stretching his arms, Li Che left the workshop.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingfeng saw Li Che come out and her eyes lit up: "Big Brother Li, can I go to your house to freeload a meal today? I want to eat Sister-in-law's cooking!"</p><p></p><p>Since the last time Shangguan Qingfeng had expressed her heart's desire to have Li Che as her father, this girl had a tendency to throw caution to the wind and truly treat Li Che as her father.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took her to his home for a meal, and after tasting Zhang Ya's cooking, this girl's thick-skinned behavior became even more shameless, running to Li Che's house to freeload meals every day after work, more homesick than Li Che himself.</p><p></p><p>"When don't you come to freeload a meal?" Li Che said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Pay the boarding fee."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingfeng just laughed, she knew Li Che was joking, after all, for them, gold and silver were not much of a concern.</p><p></p><p>After a simple clean-up, Li Che left the Qin Tian Observatory with the clingy Shangguan Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they stepped down the stone stairs, they saw the drunken Liu He and Hai Chuanying.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Brother Li, going home from work again? Why don't you come with us to the Yun Fang Pavilion today, we've invited you many times but you never come... "</p><p></p><p>Liu He, seeing Li Che, immediately invited him enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Visiting the brothels and listening to music was not the standard configuration for Qin Tian Observatory's client officials, but Li Che was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Every day after work, he just ran back home, as if the women in the Yun Fang Pavilion would eat him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, another day, another day." Li Che smiled and clasped his hands in response to Liu He, nodding to Hai Chuanying.</p><p></p><p>The two shook their heads, not knowing when Li Che would finally go to the Yun Fang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll wait for you, Brother Li... don't go back on your word."</p><p></p><p>Liu He and Hai Chuanying left, still smiling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, these two were really carefree.</p><p></p><p>"The normal third-rank client officials of the Qin Tian Observatory, after mixing in the Observatory for a long time, become so carefree and unrestrained, visiting brothels, drinking and socializing, completely laid-back, because they have no ambition or hope to strive for the second-rank client official level."</p><p></p><p>"To breakthrough to the second-rank client official, one needs to cultivate the 'Great Scenery Qin Tian Seven Element Deity Carving Art' to the Perfection level... this is truly not an easy task, both the Shen Xing secret art and martial arts need to reach the Perfection level."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing they have no hope, they start to enjoy life, focusing more on enjoyment and Shen Xing cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingfeng saw through the state of Liu He and the others, and said with a pout, "Brother Li, go to the Yun Fang Pavilion less, that place is not clean, with a mixed crowd..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled. Would he be the kind of person to go to such a place?</p><p></p><p>The two passed through the Long Street and returned to the Hear Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>The sentries planted by the Black Snake Gang had not withdrawn, but instead there were more and more of them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had not yet eliminated the Black Snake Gang, mainly because he started by clearing out the other forces of the Fishing Clan, just to confuse everyone and dispel the idea that Niu Mo was him.</p><p></p><p>Now, this idea had basically been completely dispelled.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che wanted to, he could wipe out the Black Snake Gang at any time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Snake Gang was not much stronger than the White Wave Hall.</p><p></p><p>His footsteps slowed slightly, and Li Che's brows furrowed as he sensed that the number of sentries the Black Snake Gang had placed today had increased tenfold, and there was also a hidden powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flashed with a cold light, silently returning to the small courtyard in the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Big Sister Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the courtyard, Xixie, who was practicing punches, immediately ran over excitedly, using the excuse not to practice martial arts and cultivate anymore! Old Chen could only sigh in resignation, announce a break, and sit down to drink.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingfeng screamed back in response to Xixie, the two of them jumping up and down in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng is here? I'll cook another dish so we can have dinner." Zhang Ya walked out of the house, seeing the freeloading Shangguan Qingfeng, and smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>She had always been a very gentle woman.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she could see that her husband had no great interest in this girl, and was even completely treating her like a daughter to raise.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, after hearing about Shangguan Qingfeng's family background at the dinner table, Zhang Ya's motherly love had overflowed, and she could no longer suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingfeng was from one of the five great families of the Prefecture City, the Shangguan Family, with an excellent family background. Her father, Shangguan Zhenghen, was the family patriarch, a nearly hundred-year-old old man, and Shangguan Qingfeng was born to him when he was a hundred years old, by forcing a maid.</p><p></p><p>After giving birth to Shangguan Qingfeng, the mother and daughter did not receive any attention, but were instead constantly harassed. Shangguan Zhenghen had no affection for them, and even had some aversion, and when Shangguan Qingfeng was six years old, her mother died, leaving her alone, almost being driven out of the Shangguan Family and ending up on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she was noticed by the Deputy Monitor Lin Xiu of the Qin Tian Observatory, accepted as a disciple, and gradually grew up with a status in the Shangguan Family.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya loved and doted on Shangguan Qingfeng, and had no objection to her freeloading meals.</p><p></p><p>The reason Shangguan Qingfeng dared to shamelessly freeload meals was that she relied on Zhang Ya's affection for her, and Xixie's willingness to play with her.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Shangguan Qingfeng continued to play with Xixie in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered the study.</p><p></p><p>Lighting the oil lamp, the flickering flame cast a flickering light.</p><p></p><p>Li Che locked the study, and his pupils emitted a faint white mist.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Technique Embryo, Restrain Spirit!</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual energies converged into Sinda's figure, merging into the [Suspended Thought Willow Wood Body] he had carved, casting a shadow under the lamp light as he carved a wooden figurine.</p><p></p><p>Some of the restrained spiritual energies had entered the Suspended Thought Willow Wood Body, making it almost indistinguishable from Li Che's own appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if a perfect wooden clone had been created.</p><p></p><p>After completing this, Li Che brought his index finger and middle finger together, tearing open the air.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a cow-face mask, and a black robe, he gripped a white spiritual chess piece in his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>He then disappeared from the study.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The piled-up dark clouds collided with each other, and electric snakes suddenly appeared and hid.</p><p></p><p>On the official road outside the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Several simple horse-drawn carriages were galloping on the official road.</p><p></p><p>The coachman quickly whipped the reins, the spirited horses exhaled hot air, and they sped along the spacious official road.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was lying on Mu Popo's lap, allowing Mu Popo to gently stroke his head.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo was reading the secret letter sent from the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon has caused trouble again, slaughtering the power of the Fishermen's Alliance's White Wave Hall. The White Wave Hall Master and Vice Hall Master were all killed, their bodies torn to pieces, extremely cruel."</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence feedback, the White Wave Hall Master and Vice Hall Master had imprinted the corpse curse, and the White Wave Hall Master had even worshipped the Corpse God and cultivated the corpse art, devouring the flesh and blood of thirty-six innocent women..."</p><p></p><p>"Bastard!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, there is the heroic Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"This prefecture city... why is it still so chaotic!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, who was resting on her lap, opened his eyes slightly and sneered, "Chaos is normal... a mysterious temple of the Four Guardians stands outside the Golden Light Prefecture City, destining that the Golden Light Prefecture will never be peaceful."</p><p></p><p>"Among the four prefectures of Cloud State, the Corpse God Cult first chose to infiltrate the Golden Light Prefecture, for what purpose? Not only because the aristocratic sects of the Golden Light Prefecture are most likely to breed ambition, but also because of the existence of this mysterious temple of the Four Guardians."</p><p></p><p>"To rely on the temple and establish a cult... what a grand ambition?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the mysterious temple of the Four Guardians in the Golden Light Prefecture is both a blessing and a curse."</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo's expression changed repeatedly, and she finally shook her head with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out... no matter where you go, it's the same, never peaceful."</p><p></p><p>"There is no place in the world that is truly peaceful."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sat up and embraced Mu Popo, "But don't worry, as long as I'm here, you'll be at peace."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not peaceful, I'll hammer out a peace for you."</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo looked at Li Qingshan with a dazed gaze, then her eyes dimmed a bit, "I'm old, my spiritual foundation is hopeless, you're different from me... your future can enter the Immortal Realm, and even pursue higher."</p><p></p><p>"As for me, I'm probably going to die."</p><p></p><p>"So, I just want to spend some peaceful days with you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked out the window, stunned.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he kissed Mu Popo's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll keep you company to watch the sunset."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo struggled out of his embrace and stared at Li Qingshan, "No, you don't need to."</p><p></p><p>"You are Li Qingshan, you don't have to change for me, I know that one person's strength is limited and cannot change the filth in the world, but I hope you can uphold the original intention when you first entered the rivers and lakes."</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can be at peace with your conscience! Use your hammer... to kill all those disgusting fellows, just like what the Ox Demon is doing now."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he burst out laughing and gave Mu Popo a big kiss.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you are the woman I've been missing for so long!"</p><p></p><p>"I took a liking to you the moment I entered the rivers and lakes!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan leaped out of the carriage, appearing on the roof of the carriage. The carriage sped forward, the fierce wind surging, and he stood upright like a spear, his sleeves fluttering close to his body. He looked at the coachman, and the coachman stopped the reins.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master," the coachman said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Safely send these spirit children into the city and arrange their accommodation, waiting for the sect's assessment in the spring equinox."</p><p></p><p>"After entering the city, Lü Chi will come to meet you."</p><p></p><p>The coachman saluted, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled, his gaze sweeping towards the dark night sky over the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted, looking at the terrifying temple of the Four Guardians in the distance, surging in the Jiulong River, as if distorting time and space, sitting in the middle of the river.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his gaze, Li Qingshan tapped his toes, his body soaring like a falcon, and during the flight, a cat-faced mask was immediately covered on his face.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, a sheep-horn hammer slid into his palm, and as he gripped it, lightning arcs crackled.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Qingshan, has returned.</p><p></p><p>Unable to eliminate the filth in the city, but he must still do his utmost.</p><p></p><p>That little guy Ox Demon is also trying hard to be a hero.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Qingshan, had also dreamed of being a hero in his youth, carrying a sword and entering the rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't become a coward in his old age, could he?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was dark and the wind was high.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The airflow surged and swirled, and Li Che, with the Vajra Dharma Fruit, perfectly contained his qi and blood, as if merging into the air of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward in the long night, wearing a cute ox mask, his figure towering, and the surrounding scenery rapidly retreated as he moved.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang's stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind kept howling in the night, and the willow branches swayed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>As the only remaining powerful force under the Fishermen's Alliance, the Black Snake Gang's defense was now extremely cautious, with one team of skilled warriors after another patrolling.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Ox Demon appeared, they would give a warning, allowing the high-level members of the Black Snake Gang to quickly escape.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the roof, stepping on the black tiles.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure of Li Che, wrapped in a black robe, looked indifferently at the brightly lit Black Snake Gang stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he tapped his brow.</p><p></p><p>Instantly...</p><p></p><p>From the place where he stood, as the chess board star position, the heaven and earth chessboard enveloped and expanded, reflecting the map, with intersecting black lines delineating the chessboard image.</p><p></p><p>On it, one chess piece after another emitting a black aura, that is the killing intent targeting his Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the "Eight Extreme Corpse Curse Seal" suppressed in the chessboard kept trembling.</p><p></p><p>A circle of death qi appeared in concentric ripples, constantly expanding!</p><p></p><p>Then on the chessboard, one Corpse Curse Seal after another began to appear!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Eight Extreme Corpse Curse Seal?!"</p><p></p><p>Under the ox mask, Li Che's eyes narrowed, the stronghold of the Black Snake Gang and the surrounding powerful experts were not only numerous, but also of extremely high quality!</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was also a trembling Eight Extreme Corpse Curse Seal, presenting itself under the impact of the death qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Cult's Eight Extreme Corpse God Envoy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath under the mask.</p><p></p><p>An ambush, ah.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang has become the bait, the bait to lure him to bite.</p><p></p><p>After all, the remaining forces of the Fishermen's Alliance are not many, and the Black Snake Gang, as the force monitoring Xixing, has been keeping an eye on her because of her relationship with the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>But it is precisely because of Xixing's relationship with the Ox Demon that the Fishermen's Alliance feels the Ox Demon must definitely make a move against the Black Snake Gang! Liu Jinsheng and Lei Laoqi, the two deputy gang masters of the Fishermen's Alliance, are now hidden in the Black Snake Gang stronghold, concealing their spiritual aura with secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>There is also a Corpse God Cult Corpse God Envoy, whose aura is extremely terrifying, and although it is very far away, the intimidation it brings is extremely horrifying.</p><p></p><p>They are all quietly waiting for him, the Ox Demon, to take the bait.</p><p></p><p>A Spiritual Immortal, two Pseudo-Immortal Realm experts, this lineup...</p><p></p><p>It's really impressive, they are really giving face!</p><p></p><p>"You guys are really impressive."</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>With the "Flying Thunder Chess Sage" in his possession, he can come and go freely, even if it's bait, he can easily swallow it.</p><p></p><p>Eating bait, he, the Ox Demon, is a professional!</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning, he has been on the path of eating bait.</p><p></p><p>Fishing?</p><p></p><p>Li Che loves fishing the most.</p><p></p><p>The Fishermen's Alliance just doesn't believe in evil, they should have already guessed that the Ox Demon has the ability to move, so they have laid an ambush in advance.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they are already confident that they have mastered the means to deal with the moving technique.</p><p></p><p>But his Ox Demon's movement...</p><p></p><p>It's not an ordinary moving technique, ah.</p><p></p><p>Although he has mastered the moving technique of the Flying Thunder Chess Sage, Li Che still feels that there is no need to take such a big risk, to stubbornly charge in where the other party has laid an ambush.</p><p></p><p>In life, it's always better to be stable.</p><p></p><p>Although the Li Che wearing the Ox Demon mask is reckless, crazy, unrestrained, and unbridled...</p><p></p><p>But he's not reckless.</p><p></p><p>Under the ox mask, a low, sinister laughter came.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Grandpa, I won't play with you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Besides, killing people doesn't have to be done up close.</p><p></p><p>The wind howled and roared.</p><p></p><p>Tapping his toes, the towering figure shattered the rustling cold wind and silently merged into the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che let out a light exclamation.</p><p></p><p>On the heaven and earth chessboard, there was a familiar aura, recklessly bursting in, like a thunderous snake stretching across the land, quickly slithering and dominating arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Reckless... a complete mess!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside, the lights were bright.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang leader sat in the chair, his expression solemn. By his side, a large iron broadsword stood upright.</p><p></p><p>Sitting upright with the sword in front of him, the Black Snake Gang leader's eyes were bright, very calm and collected.</p><p></p><p>But the hand gripping the broadsword was constantly sweating, with protruding blue veins throbbing, revealing the tension in his heart at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Although he has achieved the Corpse Iron Zombie through the Corpse Curse Seal, his physical body is comparable to a sect master's strength.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual foundation has also been forcibly elevated to spiritual foundation completion due to the cultivation of the Fishermen's Alliance gang leader, which is a promise to save his life.</p><p></p><p>But he is still terrified.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>The name of the Ox Demon is now truly renowned within the Golden Light Prefecture City! The seven subordinate gangs of the Fishermen's Alliance were all massacred... all by the Ox Demon! Torn to pieces, heads exploded, blood flowing like rivers...</p><p></p><p>Facing such a ruthless and cruel villain.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang leader... how could he not be afraid?</p><p></p><p>Who the hell wouldn't be afraid of death?</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have cultivated the Corpse Iron Zombie, my physical body is comparable to a sect master... the Ox Demon won't be able to kill me in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I survive, the ambushing forces will act, and the Ox Demon will not be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang leader encouraged himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Will the Ox Demon come?"</p><p></p><p>He must come.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang leader is clear that according to Zhang Xiangyang's intelligence, that Ox Demon is Xixing's protector.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang has been watching Xixing for so long, how could the Ox Demon let the Black Snake Gang go?!</p><p></p><p>"As long as I hold on..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I don't get killed instantly!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon will die when he comes!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang leader thought of the ambushing forces around him, and his breathing became rapid and heavy!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>He heard the sound of thundering in his ear.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked up, his pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon has come? However...</p><p></p><p>When the Black Snake Gang leader heard the thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>The thunder...</p><p></p><p>Has arrived in front of him!</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black night sky, like Thor's mighty hammer striking from high above, a flash of lightning suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Tearing the darkness with lightning! The head of the Black Snake Gang leader, who had cultivated the Corpse Iron Zombie, was suddenly shattered by the hammer! A dull thud...</p><p></p><p>The ground behind the Black Snake Gang leader sank into a deep pit, with radiating cracks spreading.</p><p></p><p>A completely azure sheep-horn hammer slammed into the center of the pit, and amid the billowing dust, sizzling lightning arcs crackled!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had not even crouched down.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The Sheep has arrived.</p>

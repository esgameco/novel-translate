            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, electric snakes slithered, and fierce winds howled!</p><p></p><p>Although they were separated by an invisible force,</p><p></p><p>the torrential rain pouring down, washing and pounding, made a continuous crackling sound, bursting into everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>Listening from the top of the towering cliff, there were many carriages lined up.</p><p></p><p>The dragons-blooded horses were restless and agitated, but dared not make too much movement, only occasionally stomping their hooves in place.</p><p></p><p>Many of the people present were also in silent contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the glimpse they had just seen of the temple deity's resonance was quite shocking to many.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Many of the cultivators who had come to the Golden Light Manor to watch were in a somewhat low mood.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Li Nuanxi, the Golden Light Manor's prodigy child, did not perform well in this temple deity's resonance.</p><p></p><p>She had not even taken a single step, unable to resonate with the temple deity at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the unexpected Qin Fenghuо from the Qin family had surged forward and entered the forefront.</p><p></p><p>For the cultivators of the Golden Light Manor, this temple deity's resonance was taking place in their own manor, with the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Deity, the Furious Third Prince, as their temple deity.</p><p></p><p>The manor's prodigy children naturally had to demonstrate a higher degree of resonance.</p><p></p><p>This was a competition for glory.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо and Wang Daoren's brows were furrowed, as they were also shocked by Nuanxi's poor temple deity resonance performance.</p><p></p><p>They seemed somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"But... Nuanxi's temple deity resonance was not ideal, how could this Qin Fenghuо have such a performance?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо's white hair was flying, his brows tightly knit, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Something might have happened to Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>But Nuanxi's talent was there for all to see, a prodigy child with exceptional divine aptitude.</p><p></p><p>As for Qin Fenghuо, he was only an exceptional spiritual child, not yet a prodigy child, how could he catch up to the prodigy sequence.</p><p></p><p>As for Lü Chi, Nan Lihuо and the others seemed to know something about the inside situation and did not make too much comment.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Fenghuо has a problem."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо said decisively.</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren flicked his fly whisk and rolled his eyes: "Can't it be that this child has a high temple deity resonance?"</p><p></p><p>"Temple deity resonance... divine aptitude does not explain everything."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо shook his head: "Impossible."</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family doesn't have this temple deity resonance either..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren smiled: "You are biased."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо's gaze suddenly swept towards the area where the Qin family's carriage was parked, where the carriage stood quietly, the curtain gently fluttering in the breeze.</p><p></p><p>The silhouette of the person sitting inside could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt something was wrong, Nan Lihuо did not make any move, his gaze turning back to the swirling mist on the river.</p><p></p><p>Although the mist was thick, obscuring the traces of many prodigy children,</p><p></p><p>the mysterious temple stood in the middle of the river, yet it was extremely conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>As if nothing in heaven and earth could conceal the existence of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Inhale.</p><p>Exhale.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat on the carriage pole.</p><p></p><p>His eyes slightly opened and closed, as if there was a hidden brilliance flickering in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was immersed in the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Through the flying thunder chess piece left on Nuanxi, he was observing Nuanxi's situation after the mist had shrouded everything again.</p><p></p><p>He was not at all worried about Nuanxi's previous display of temple deity resonance, where her resonance degree was almost zero.</p><p></p><p>Li Che knew why Nuanxi had no resonance.</p><p></p><p>It was because Nuanxi had stubbornly resisted the temple deity's temptation, remaining unmoved, even confronting the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>With such behavior, it would be strange if she had any resonance.</p><p></p><p>But it was just a matter of finding the right trigger.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, to achieve temple deity resonance, one only needed a certain emotion, action, or attitude.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Even if she really had no temple deity resonance, so what?</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi had a Four Divine Weapons hidden in her arm, the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear.</p><p></p><p>So, even without temple deity resonance...</p><p></p><p>It would not have much impact on Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind sank into the heavenly and earthly chessboard, and the intersecting and crisscrossing chessboard projected the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>He saw Nuanxi moving a golden brick.</p><p></p><p>"This golden brick..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the distance, he could not use the Plucking Star Eyes to detect the composition of this golden brick.</p><p></p><p>But without a doubt, this thing... was definitely also one of the Third Prince's divine weapon sets, and its power was extremely formidable!</p><p></p><p>Li Che saw the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear obediently releasing flames to help Nuanxi burn the golden brick and move it.</p><p></p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>This Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear, indeed... had not been trained in vain.</p><p></p><p>It had indeed become much more sensible.</p><p></p><p>Knowing to take care of its master's well-being.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it still needs to be beaten, three days without a beating and the roof will be lifted.</p><p></p><p>This fire tip spear, after being beaten, became obedient and mature.</p><p></p><p>If it was still the fire tip spear that had just entered Nuanxi's arm, although it recognized Nuanxi as its master, it would bully Nuanxi for not having a backer.</p><p></p><p>Facing this precious golden brick, it might not even show the slightest attitude.</p><p></p><p>So Nuanxi would have a hard time subduing this golden brick.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che was very satisfied with the fire tip spear's performance.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's eyes soon became sharp.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw the appearance of Ji Haihuі...</p><p></p><p>Holding a black as ink sword, just looking at it made his spiritual sense feel its terrifying sharpness, emerged from the mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression instantly became cold.</p><p></p><p>Just by the posture alone, he knew what Ji Haihuі wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che also guessed what this Third Prince wanted to test Nuanxi with.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a test for Nuanxi at all..."</p><p></p><p>"This is a test for me as a father."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was calm, unruffled.</p><p></p><p>Because in his heart, he had the answer from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>His daughter.</p><p></p><p>He doted on her! As a father, if he could not protect his own daughter, but instead pushed her into the abyss, would that be what a father should do? What about the greater good, what about righteousness, in Li Che's eyes, none of that mattered.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary father, only hoping that his daughter would not be bullied.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, had his daughter done anything wrong?</p><p></p><p>Although Nuanxi liked to fight, liked to set off fireworks, because of her status as a prodigy child, her spiritual intelligence had awakened early, making her smarter than other children.</p><p></p><p>But she was also playful, greedy...</p><p></p><p>Yet she also understood reason, knew right from wrong, and grasped the importance of things.</p><p></p><p>She could think, she could empathize...</p><p></p><p>So even if Nuanxi really did something wrong, there must be a reason for it, and as a father, Li Che only needed to unconditionally believe in and protect his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was different from the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che, was different from the Heavenly King as well.</p><p></p><p>His gaze opened and closed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nuanxi defeat Ji Haihuі, smashing him with the golden brick, causing blood to spray, yet Ji Haihuі cursed wildly, arrogantly declaring that he would kill Nuanxi's entire family.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity's temptation of Nuanxi, Li Che had naturally also heard it, heard it very clearly.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of divine power invasion.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince's temple deity wanted to corrupt Nuanxi in this way.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nuanxi, with tears streaming down her face, angry and conflicted, yet also worried about her father and mother's safety.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter, does not need to be carved to the bone."</p><p></p><p>"Because, even if she was really wrong, all righteousness suppressed, so the greater good is like the sky collapsing."</p><p></p><p>"I, as her father, will also stand in the forefront."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said softly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"I told you before, I will always protect you."</p><p></p><p>"We even pinky promised."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's eyes still had tears hanging at the corners, gripping the fire tip spear and golden brick, but she suddenly became excited.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were bright, hearing the words her father had said.</p><p></p><p>Her heart, like an inflated balloon, was filled with joy!</p><p></p><p>Father is here! Father has always been here!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi suddenly gained confidence, raising her chin, her eyes shining brightly with light again.</p><p></p><p>She no longer felt conflicted or pained.</p><p></p><p>She didn't cry anymore, because father said, whoever hurt her, she would hurt back.</p><p></p><p>Whoever wanted to kill her, she would kill them! Nuanxi no longer needed to suffer injustice!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, Nuanxi's spirit and energy became extremely exhilarated, as if it was boiling and burning.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was fixed on the ferocious Ji Haihuі, whose will was completely controlled by the dragon god bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Little slave!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's anger surged, she now only wanted to kill Ji Haihuі! Because this little slave threatened her, threatened her father and mother's lives, if it was before, she might still hesitate.</p><p></p><p>But now father is here!</p><p></p><p>Father told her that she can freely use her hands, with father here!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi believed in her father!</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Kill him! Bang—! The red belly jacket fluttered, Nuanxi's feet suddenly stepped forward, and endless swirling mist rose up!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's body began to radiate dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>Like the proud sun!</p><p></p><p>The fire tip spear roared and howled, the purple flames coiled around her, like long silk ribbons, wrapping around her body.</p><p></p><p>In the distance!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuі's eyes turned blood red, scales seemed to be growing on his skin, his face becoming extremely ferocious, with fangs growing out, his back constantly bulging, like fish fins, about to break through the flesh and blood! There seemed to be a muffled thunderous sound coming from within his body, the sinews and bones constantly grinding, the bones twisting and colliding!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Haihuі, with his dragon god bloodline fully activated, had reached the Patriarch level, surpassing the Profound Vein and Divine Vein realms!</p><p></p><p>Hum—!!! Ji Haihuі's eyes instantly turned a clear purple, with golden light scattering from the pupils, like dispersed golden ink, twisting and writhing, spreading out in the purple eyeball, like three petals.</p><p></p><p>"Die—!!!"</p><p></p><p>Completely unleashing his mind, letting the dragon god bloodline control his physical body, Ji Haihuі let out a long roar.</p><p></p><p>The powerful airflow rippled out, the divine power and blood energy spreading from his physical body, crashing like waves on the river, striking fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—! Like a reptile, using all four limbs, he began to run at an extremely fast speed! The dragon tail swung, and Ji Haihuі's figure disappeared in an instant! When it reappeared, the powerful force had leaped, and the purple-scaled dragon claws had already struck out.</p><p></p><p>Slapping the air, it seemed to tear it apart, like a group of dragons dancing!</p><p></p><p>The burst of power in that instant caused the mist beneath to be torn apart as if ripped open! Roar, roar, roar! The dragon's roar echoed all around, the mist dispersed, and in the surging river below, it seemed that a dragon shadow appeared! Oppressive, cramped, terrifying! Making it hard to breathe!</p><p></p><p>This was the pure power of the dragon god, the surging and overwhelming might, like a tangible force spreading out in this one claw strike!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuі's body even presented another kind of strange distortion, which was a sign that the physical body could not withstand the runaway state of the dragon god bloodline!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was not afraid, not desperate! The golden brick in her hand was defiantly flung out, directly smashing towards the claw Ji Haihuі had struck out! Boom, boom, boom! The collision was too fast! It was impossible to imagine this was a battle between a four-year-old and a five-year-old!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the usual Patriarch-level confrontation, it was far more intense! In an instant, the fierce wind, like a shaken carpet, kept trembling, rising up in waves, surging and spreading! Three zhang, five zhang, ten zhang! Around the collision of the two, the mist rose up like an upside-down mushroom cloud, soaring dozens of zhang high!</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi—!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The hoarse roar came from the distorted face of Ji Haihuі. His killing intent was so intense that it was almost fused with his instinct.</p><p></p><p>Kill, kill, kill, kill!</p><p></p><p>The dragon claw and the golden brick collided, instantly shattering, but Ji Haihuі at this moment seemed to be unaware of the pain! The dragon tail whipped, like an extremely sharp divine whip, striking down towards Nuanxi's head!</p><p></p><p>Slap, slap, slap! The sonic booms kept exploding, the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear suddenly thrust out, the speed also extremely fast!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had specially taught Nuanxi spear techniques, organizing his understanding of spearmanship and passing it on to Nuanxi! After all, since the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear was hidden in Nuanxi's arm, Li Che knew that Nuanxi and spearmanship were inseparable!</p><p></p><p>The Li Family Eight Consecutive Bone-Shattering Spear! It had already been improved by Li Che into an excellent martial art, and Nuanxi had at least mastered it to the Grand Master level!</p><p></p><p>The spear tip spewed fire tongues, striking the dragon tail fiercely! The dragon tail instantly exploded! Blasted apart! The Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear was one of the Four Divine Weapons, and although Nuanxi could not yet fully wield it, its power was still undoubtedly formidable!</p><p></p><p>And with the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear being trained by Li Che,</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi could even unleash some of its power! The virtual image brought by the dragon god bloodline was indeed tough, and Ji Haihuі even had the hard scales of the dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>But in Nuanxi's fire tip spear, it was utterly fragile!</p><p></p><p>Two moves without success, Ji Haihuі's Three Flower Dragon God Eyes spun, his four limbs pounding the ground hard, his body rapidly rotating, clenching his fists, using the inertia of the physical body to strike out a punch! It seemed that the virtual images of countless dragons were undulating on it!</p><p></p><p>The dragon god bloodline at full power, Ji Haihuі unleashing this martial saint supreme skill, the Myriad Dragons Prostrating the Deity! </p><p></p><p>It was indeed terrifyingly powerful! But Nuanxi had the Four Divine Weapons, after all.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The long spear blocked, colliding with the fist aura of Ji Haihuei, causing this body to tremble violently!</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang bang bang! Ji Haihuei was like a madman, continuously swinging and smashing his fists, as if there were dragon shadows, roaring and pouncing unceasingly! His fists shot out like powerful crossbows!</p><p></p><p>Even Xixie, at this moment, was being suppressed and could only constantly block with the horizontal spear!</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang—</p><p></p><p>The sound of collision, like fine steel clashing, the dragon tail condensed again and lashed down once more!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei was completely possessed by the power of the Dragon God, wild and surging at this moment!</p><p></p><p>His blood and flesh were extremely robust, like a demonic monster!</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation level, Ji Haihuei was already stronger than Xixie, and now with the support of the Dragon God's power, he was simply unstoppable! Although Xixie wielded the Four Divine Weapons, her own strength was ultimately too weak to unleash their full power!</p><p></p><p>Xixie was also somewhat annoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear and Fire Tip Spear seemed to sense Xixie's anger! The transformed fire snakes suddenly reared up, opening their mouths and letting out a silent roar!</p><p></p><p>That silent roar seemed to be about to explode!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment...</p><p></p><p>Countless wisps of smoke were torn open!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the clanging sound of chains.</p><p></p><p>Then the golden wheel began to spin rapidly, scattering endless streams of fire light! It was as if a phoenix had been wrapped in endless chains, and under the response of the fire snake, it spread its wings and took flight.</p><p></p><p>Countless illusory mists were torn open!</p><p></p><p>The cry of the phoenix echoed! Instantly, it shot out from the endless illusory mists!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p></p><p>The swinging fist of Ji Haihuei was instantly swept away, sending him flying.</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel!</p><p></p><p>The flames burned, the golden fire wheel continuously rotating! </p><p></p><p>The second wheel, the Infernal Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel! Rumbling! Xixie held the Fire Tip Spear, stepping on a golden light wheel.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, she disappeared from the original spot like lightning.</p><p></p><p>The speed was not too fast, but it completely opened up the distance.</p><p></p><p>Xixie panted, putting away the golden brick, then clenched her five fingers, and the huge pink mechanism was immediately hugged in her arms! It was Xixie's own... Immortal Craftsman Fire God Gatling Gun! The distanced Xixie! The lopsided Xixie stepping on a wind fire golden light wheel, although she was not very used to flying.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, her eyes gradually became dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei... had the bloodline of the Dragon God and the Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>Xixie didn't, so there was no other way, she could only rely on divine weapons and mechanisms! Bang bang bang! The six barrels of the Fire God Angry Flood Dragon Cannon suddenly heated up, the pink light dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Then it spewed out roaring blue light!</p><p></p><p>Under the high-speed rotation, the terrifying shells instantly exploded!</p><p></p><p>After Ji Haihuei fully activated the Dragon God bloodline, his speed became too fast, but...</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of the Fire Tip Spear, Xixie summoned the second golden light wheel, although it was only a single wheel, but after getting used to it, the flight speed was also not slow!</p><p></p><p>Bang—!!! An explosion occurred!</p><p></p><p>Billowing smoke rose, and the terrifying shockwave ravaged. A muffled groan! Ji Haihuei's body covered in dragon scales was instantly blown away by the explosion, the powerful force violently throwing him out.</p><p></p><p>Clatter clatter clatter—</p><p></p><p>Then it was Xixie stepping on a single wheel, bombarding him with a furious barrage!</p><p></p><p>Blue light spewed!</p><p></p><p>Tongues of fire raged!</p><p></p><p>One snowslide raven after another darted out, submerging Ji Haihuei!</p><p></p><p>Brilliant fireworks exploded one after another at the site!</p><p></p><p>Divine nature raged and surged, accompanied by Ji Haihuei's agonizing screams!</p><p></p><p>After bombarding for nearly a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>Xixie finally stopped the Fire God Cannon's attack with a slightly pale face.</p><p></p><p>She panted heavily, with beads of sweat the size of beans covering her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>So tired...</p><p></p><p>But this fireworks display, it was so much fun to set off!</p><p></p><p>Xixie's heart became even more excited.</p><p></p><p>She liked setting off fireworks more and more! The illusory mist rolled, and the will of the Three Princes Temple's deity seemed to have fallen silent.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, He did not expect that Xixie would defeat Ji Haihuei, who had activated the Dragon God bloodline, in this way.</p><p></p><p>He was still waiting for Xixie to give in, and then start tempting her again, making Xixie accept his power.</p><p></p><p>The smoke and dust rolled, and a surging wind suddenly came from the midst of the haze.</p><p></p><p>Tearing through the gunpowder smoke.</p><p></p><p>Revealing Ji Haihuei's skin-torn, blood-soaked appearance.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon God's aura... was forcibly broken by Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei lay on the ground, his chest heaving violently.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had completely lost their light.</p><p></p><p>He lost again.</p><p></p><p>Even with his full strength, he still lost, and even let the Dragon God's bloodline completely take over his body.</p><p></p><p>Still lost.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei's expression was twisted.</p><p></p><p>He slowly straightened up, staring fixedly at Xixie.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi..."</p><p></p><p>"You don't dare to kill me, do you?"</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>Scorching flames surged.</p><p></p><p>Xixie stood barefoot on the single wheel, looking down at Ji Haihuei! In the moment Ji Haihuei's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's Fire Tip Spear suddenly stabbed down!</p><p></p><p>Puchi!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei's brow was instantly pierced by Xixie's spear!</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to have fallen into a state of stagnation at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The pain in his brow, the rapid dissipation of consciousness, and the separation of life force...</p><p></p><p>Let him...</p><p></p><p>Finally wake up.</p><p></p><p>He broke free from the Temple God's invasion, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>But life no longer had any time left for him.</p><p></p><p>Darkness engulfed all his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He.</p><p></p><p>Died.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The howling wind.</p><p></p><p>In the area of the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>The luxurious carriage was parked quietly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Su Huai and Yingwei Zhenren sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The body of the shrouded in darkness Yingwei Zhenren began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai also seemed to have a sense of it, his complexion turning deathly pale in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"No... no..."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible..."</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?!"</p><p></p><p>A roar came from Su Huai's mouth.</p><p></p><p>He rushed out of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>But the speed of Yingwei Zhenren was even faster!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!! As soon as he got out of the carriage, the powerful aura of the Shenyuan Zhenren instantly swept and expanded, and a Shenyuan Elixir appeared, brilliant like the proud sun!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master—!!!"</p><p></p><p>Piercing roar.</p><p></p><p>Yingwei Zhenren roared incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren and Lu Yao, the two Shenyuan Zhenren, instantly burst forth with their auras.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang of the Temple Guard's divine might soared, tearing through the clouds, his burly body wrapped in divine might like turbulent currents.</p><p></p><p>"Yingwei! What do you want to do?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Wang Kuyu, the two Shenyuan Zhenren, suppressed the situation.</p><p></p><p>But on the Howling Cliff, the wind and rain were completely shaking, tense and ready to strike! Everyone was suppressed to the point of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>Because, this was a collision at the level of Shenyuan Zhenren! Su Huai also rushed out of the carriage, staring at the illusory mist surging on the Nine Dragon River, his body trembling slightly, suddenly understanding something, with a chill in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Dead..."</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone killed the Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Yingwei's roar, in an instant, fell like thunderous on the cliff! Shocking all the powerful figures of the various factions, causing them to be dumbfounded, their hair standing on end, everyone turning pale.</p><p></p><p>What? The son of the Pacifying King Ji Mogli...</p><p></p><p>Died? !...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!! The Fire Tip Spear that pierced Ji Haihuei's brow and crushed his Nirvana and brain, suddenly had purple flames gushing out, turning into a crazy and greedy purple snake, tearing and devouring all the purple divine energy on Ji Haihuei's body.</p><p></p><p>Puchi!</p><p></p><p>Xixie pulled out the Fire Tip Spear, the spearhead still dripping with glistening blood drops.</p><p></p><p>Xixie panted heavily.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes slightly dazed, the small hand holding the spear was trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Xixie... had killed someone.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Xixie had killed someone with her own hands, and she was a bit at a loss, but fortunately Master Niunie had taught her.</p><p></p><p>So, she was still relatively calm, only her inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>She even forgot to retrieve Ji Haihuei's Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>But killing is killing, Xixie was not wrong!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling!!!! And at the moment Ji Haihuei lost his life! The entire illusory mist suddenly began to roll.</p><p></p><p>Above Ji Haihuei's lifeless body, two terrifyingly powerful auras actually rose!</p><p></p><p>One aura transformed into a towering and robust figure, which just by standing there, was as majestic and powerful as a towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>And the other aura directly transformed into a winding divine dragon, accompanied by countless surging waters. "Roar—!!!"</p><p></p><p>"My son!!!"</p><p></p><p>The heart-wrenching roar came from the mouth of the dragon shadow.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure instantly crashed down, and even though Xixie was standing on the golden light wheel, she felt as if she was swaying in a storm, unable to maintain her body.</p><p></p><p>The golden light wheel turned into a flame light and merged into Xixie's soles.</p><p></p><p>Xixie landed on the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>But the surrounding illusory mist suddenly erupted with a momentum like towering waves!</p><p></p><p>The tiny Xixie, at this moment, was so insignificant in the face of this mighty power, like a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>The towering golden human figure, and the huge divine dragon shadow.</p><p></p><p>Gave Xixie an overwhelming pressure.</p><p></p><p>Almost making Xixie kneel on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha... the show is about to begin!"</p><p></p><p>"Dare to curse the Temple!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if you dare to come! "</p><p></p><p>"You definitely won't dare to come, because if you come, you'll die!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone will die, unless Xixie carves the flesh and bones, and severs ties with you to appease the wrath!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, everyone will die!"</p><p></p><p>From the illusory tower, the voice of the mischievous child laughing hissed.</p><p></p><p>And the towering figure like a mountain that emerged from Ji Haihuei's corpse, clenched its five fingers, and in an instant... the pretending Infernal Abyss Sword began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Although it resisted...</p><p></p><p>But it shot out, grasped in the hand of that towering figure.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the aura was almost condensed into a tangible form.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Mogli!"</p><p></p><p>"My son is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"My son is dead, are you satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>"I want her to die! Otherwise, I will make the entire Golden Light City accompany my son!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon shadow roared.</p><p></p><p>The towering illusory golden figure grasping the Infernal Abyss Sword did not heed the frenzied divine dragon shadow.</p><p></p><p>His eyes opened and closed, rising up and landing on Xixie's body.</p><p></p><p>Cold, heartless, devoid of emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Carve the flesh and bones."</p><p></p><p>The faint voice came from the figure.</p><p></p><p>He threw the Infernal Abyss Sword.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xixie uses the Infernal Abyss Sword to carve the flesh and bones...</p><p></p><p>Achieve the highest level of Temple God resonance, and receive the Temple God's legacy gift.</p><p></p><p>That power and legacy belonging to the Temple God will be transferred to the Infernal Abyss Sword, devoured and captured by it, and then belong to him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haihuei's mission to come to the Golden Light City, to this Four Divine Illusory Temple...</p><p></p><p>Has been perfectly accomplished.</p><p></p><p>As if the death of a son, to him, is nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Everything is just a pawn for him to achieve his purpose.</p><p></p><p>He knew that with the Dragon God bloodline, his son coming to this Three Princes Illusory Temple would definitely not be able to leave alive.</p><p></p><p>But he still sent Ji Haihuei here.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>The thrown Infernal Abyss Sword slowly floated in front of Xixie.</p><p></p><p>The majestic, towering, and fierce figure looked at her indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Hold the sword, commit suicide."</p><p></p><p>"Carve the flesh and bones."</p><p></p><p>"Atone."</p><p></p><p>The words carried a command.</p><p></p><p>Unyielding.</p><p></p><p>The tiny Xixie, like being tossed in the raging wind and waves.</p><p></p><p>Xixie glared.</p><p></p><p>She was not obedient! And also...</p><p></p><p>Xixie didn't want to carve the flesh and bones! Xixie didn't do anything wrong! What crime did Xixie have?! The little girl, though tiny, stood firmly in the raging wind and rain, her body leaning forward, the red belly warmer tightly pressed against her little belly, her hands clenched into little fists, glaring.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure that was like an overturned sea suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Looking up.</p><p></p><p>She saw a familiar, broad back, not knowing when it had appeared in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Blocking all the pressure and wind and rain for her.</p><p></p><p>The black robe fluttered and cracked, whipping the air with a bursting sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue maintained the gesture of clenching the chess piece with five fingers.</p><p></p><p>Just calmly appeared in front of Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the wind and rain, blocking the thunder.</p><p></p><p>Fulfilling the promise of a father to his daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie called softly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue reached out and gently rubbed the little girl's head.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy is here."</p><p></p><p>In the little girl's dazzling and worshipful smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue slowly turned around.</p><p></p><p>Reached out and grasped...</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Abyss Sword sent by the Martial Saint's shadow, for Xixie to commit suicide and carve the flesh and bones.</p><p></p><p>"The sword is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue praised.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana in his brow slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>In his chest.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit that had reached LV4...</p><p></p><p>Throbbed.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue shamelessly directly absorbed this Four Divine Weapon into the Chess Board of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The sword is not bad.</p><p></p><p>It's a Li now.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze caressed the willow trees, and a fine drizzle shrouded everything in a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>The drops fell rhythmically on the wooden platform, creating a soft rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>As Zhang Qingzheng called out the names of the defending challengers, the parents watching the true inheritance assessment ceremony below let out soft exclamations.</p><p></p><p>For the first round of the true inheritance assessment, there was no arrangement for the observation of spiritual aura, as the emphasis was on fairness.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all exceptional spiritual children, there were still differences in their talents.</p><p></p><p>The length and density of the spiritual aura observed would be the standard for judging their innate talents, and once the talent assessment was revealed, it would inevitably affect the children's mentality and fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Venerable Ancestor had placed this difficult-to-change talent assessment in the second round.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi, that three-year-old spiritual child... has become a defending challenger?" </p><p></p><p>"This luck is unbelievable. She'll probably be beaten and sent crying back home to drink milk soon!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a three-year-old defending, compared to Qin Huofire from the Qin family, Hai Chaosheng from the Hai family, and Gongyang Xiu from the Gongyang family, or even the renowned Huang Sixiang from the Elephant Ring City, she's far inferior."</p><p></p><p>"Except for Huang Sixiang, the other three seem to come from the five great families of the capital, with excellent family backgrounds and deep foundations. Most importantly, their ages are far beyond three years old, with Gongyang Xiu being the youngest at five years old."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many voices came from the positions of the prominent families.</p><p></p><p>Was there any suspense left?</p><p></p><p>They were definitely targeting the soft persimmon to squeeze.</p><p></p><p>Forget about the loss of face for bullying a three-year-old child, the pursuit of becoming a true inheritor would bring them the Venerable Ancestor's full support and abundant resources. What did a little loss of face matter?</p><p></p><p>Since Li Nuanxi dared to stand here, she must be prepared to be defeated. </p><p></p><p>The spiritual children were all sharp-witted, their eyes gleaming as they sized up the situation. The five defending challengers and the remaining ten... would be the attacking challengers.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's folded paper had the character "defend" written on it, meaning she had to defend the platform.</p><p></p><p>Whether attacking or defending, it all came down to a fight for Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was excited, clenching her chubby little fists. The time had come to fight! The mighty Empress Nuanxi, who had cultivated for two and a half years, was finally about to emerge!</p><p></p><p>Below the platform, Zhang Ya saw that Nuanxi was the first to defend, and her face immediately paled as she tightly gripped Li Che's arm.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, how come Nuanxi is the first to defend? She's only three years old... Isn't she going to be attacked by everyone?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya almost burst into tears, "My poor Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen slumped back in his chair, feeling powerless, "My poor Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>Sumu Grandma sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly comforted his wife, "We have to believe in Nuanxi... She's quite capable."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was amused and a little exasperated. Old Chen, who knew Nuanxi's tempering level, was still so pessimistic about her.</p><p></p><p>Deeply rooted prejudice. Who said that a three-year-old child could only be beaten up?</p><p></p><p>He had taught Nuanxi many things, and this girl had exceptional talent. Combined with his guidance...</p><p></p><p>He had great confidence in Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up at the platform, through the drizzling spring rain.</p><p></p><p>However, even Li Che felt a slight trepidation, after all... this was Nuanxi's first battle since birth.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had prepared Nuanxi completely... it was impossible for a parent not to feel pressure when a three-year-old child was guarding the platform.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's stern face carried a serious expression. After reciting the names of the defending challengers, he waved his sleeve, and a gust of wind surged forth, sweeping up the five defending spiritual children and gently placing them on the five platforms.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi, a tiny figure, stood on the fifth platform, blinking her lively eyes and curiously looking around, showing no signs of stage fright or fear.</p><p></p><p>Everything fell silent, and all eyes were focused on the figures on the platforms. Many had a look of pity in their eyes, seeing the small, pitiful three-year-old girl on the platform.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could guess what she was about to face.</p><p></p><p>"The defending challenger loses, the attacking challenger wins. The winning attacker then becomes the defending challenger. The final one standing on the platform will receive the top score."</p><p></p><p>"So, if you want to become the Venerable Ancestor's true inheritor, then use all your abilities to stand until the end!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng, with his robe fluttering, said in a faint voice, his gaze lowered.</p><p></p><p>He had done his best to show a smile, trying to make his stern face less so.</p><p></p><p>"Now, does anyone have any questions?"</p><p></p><p>After his words, the platform fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was satisfied, and prepared to officially announce the start of the platform battle.</p><p></p><p>However, on the fifth platform, Nuanxi suddenly raised her hand high, even jumping up and down, worried that Zhang Qingzheng wouldn't see her.</p><p></p><p>"I, I, I have a question, Grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi called out in her childish voice.</p><p></p><p>Many gazes were instantly drawn to her.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng heard her and slightly tugged the corner of his dry, bitter mouth, smiling as he said, "Li Nuanxi, what is your question?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can win, is there any restriction, like not being able to use hidden weapons or traps?"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi blinked her expectant eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was momentarily taken aback.</p><p></p><p>This three-year-old girl had thought it through so thoroughly, even considering these aspects.</p><p></p><p>"There are no restrictions. Even if you use divine weapons, as long as you can wield them..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's bitter, gloomy face broke into a smile as he said, "As long as you're aiming for victory, go all out. With me here, I can control you all, even if you're not even a fraction of my age."</p><p></p><p>What level were these children at?</p><p></p><p>He, the venerable Spiritual Appearance Cultivator, couldn't possibly fail to control a few children, even if their combined age was less than his.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Nuanxi understands! Thank you, Grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi said politely.</p><p></p><p>This girl was truly unafraid, with great boldness, her bright eyes shining like fire.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was delighted by this girl's attitude.</p><p></p><p>Look at her, such a sweet mouth. Who would still dare to say that Zhang Qingzheng had an ugly, repulsive face?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the platform, Li Qingshan, who had been hunched over and dozing in the chair, suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>He straightened his back, leaning forward and intently watching the attacking and defending battle on the platform.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Nanliehuo smiled and said, "This girl is lively, with great boldness, and her martial cultivation is also quite impressive, having reached the peak of Tempering."</p><p></p><p>"Reaching Tempering at three years old, although her physical functions are inferior to seven-year-old spiritual children, with her strength at least 30% weaker, she is not without competitiveness."</p><p></p><p>"A good seedling."</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Nanliehuo stroked his beard and smiled approvingly.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that if she could have waited until she was one year older, participating in the sect's assessment at four years old would have been the most stable, and her chances might have been even greater. At three years old...</p><p></p><p>She would probably end up crying.</p><p></p><p>"This girl is the one you rescued from Flaming Thunder City? It's strange, such a talent, how could the Corpse God Sect have overlooked her?"</p><p></p><p>Nanliehuo praised.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan bared his teeth, as he had sensed something amiss when Nuanxi asked Zhang Qingzheng.</p><p></p><p>Too much like Li Che! Exactly like him, polite and gracious in speech, but ready to pull out some big mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Ox Demon identity and the many mechanisms he commanded were absolutely formidable, and it was Li Che's ability to use these mechanisms that allowed him to dominate and even counterattack the spiritual cultivators of the Flaming Thunder City families.</p><p></p><p>Now, Nuanxi's inquiry definitely meant she had something brewing in her mind, wanting to set off some fireworks.</p><p></p><p>Could Nuanxi be without any weapons on her?</p><p></p><p>Given Li Che's doting nature towards his daughter, he must have equipped her with all kinds of hidden weapons and traps! Maybe even laced with poison!</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of thing the Ox Demon would do!</p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to underestimate this little girl is going to suffer a big loss. Elder Zhang better keep his focus, or he might end up in a mess."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled, already planning to thoroughly enjoy the upcoming spectacle.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could this little girl possess divine weapons? But even if she does, at this age, she won't be able to unleash their full power," Patriarch Nanliehuo laughed.</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons? These little brats know nothing about divine weapons...</p><p></p><p>At this age, divine weapons are not as fun as hidden weapons, Li Qingshan shook his head mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>This cryptic behavior piqued the curiosity of the few elders on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhu Hongdou glanced at Li Qingshan, her gaze then falling on the tiny Li Nuanxi, a hint of curiosity also appearing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Her disciples were mostly female, so she was more attentive to female disciples.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi stood on her platform, lifting her head high.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she could fight! When she was at the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Academy, she had dominated everything.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she had looked down on all, but after being brought back home, she had no such prestige, being forced to practice martial arts and cultivate every day, without a chance to reign supreme.</p><p></p><p>No matter, it was just a bit of wind and frost.</p><p></p><p>Now, Nuanxi had risen up again, and she could fight! Come on, you rebellious subjects!</p><p></p><p>Come challenge your Empress Nuanxi!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi stood with her hands on her hips, her small chest thrust out, a smile rippling in the spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen exceptional spiritual children, five defending, the remaining ten would be the attacking challengers. On average, each platform could be attacked twice, of course, this was the ideal situation, as it was also possible that everyone would focus on one platform... who knows.</p><p></p><p>Fearing the strength of the defenders on the other platforms, without confidence in victory, they would target the softer targets.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after each attack, there would be a half-hour rest period to adjust their energy.</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Qingzheng announced the start of the attacks, the ten attacking exceptional spiritual children made no move, each looking at the others, as if contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>Among the five platforms, Li Nuanxi was definitely the best target for attack.</p><p></p><p>Coming from a commoner family, young in age, and a girl... </p><p></p><p>Possessing these three flaws, how could they not be eager to pounce?</p><p></p><p>But who would be the first to attack Li Nuanxi?</p><p>This was worth considering.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone here is a seven-year-old child, so it feels a bit awkward to challenge a three-year-old girl.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go first!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the elite spiritual children of the capital city did not make a move, Liu Changqing's gaze sharpened as he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"I challenge Li Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing was tall and slender, with a delicate and fair complexion. It was evident that he had mastered martial arts, and now he lowered his voice, mimicking the tone of an adult.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng glanced at him and nodded, "Proceed."</p><p></p><p>The elite spiritual children of the capital city did not try to compete with Liu Changqing. For example, Shangguan Qinglei from the Shangguan family and Gong Yuanliang from the Gong family, the two elite spiritual children from the five great aristocratic clans, did not make a move, allowing others to take the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was Liu Changqing, the elite spiritual child from the Eastern Huan City, who seized the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing, wearing a tall hat and a blue robe, stood tall and proud as he leaped onto the wooden stage.</p><p></p><p>On the other four stages, Qin Fenghuо, Hai Chaosheng, Gongyang Xiu, and Huang Sixiang were all curiously watching the battle on Li Nuanxi's stage, as no one had challenged them.</p><p></p><p>"That little girl is sure to lose and start crying. She's only three years old... She hasn't even stopped wearing diapers or drinking milk, and she dares to compete with us?" Qin Fenghuо crossed his arms and grinned.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng quietly glanced at him. As a prodigy that the Hai family's ancestors were reluctant to bring out, Hai Chaosheng possessed a maturity that was beyond his age.</p><p></p><p>Huang Sixiang, with his bronze-colored skin, had a faint aura of vitality flowing through him. He crossed his arms and closed his eyes, indifferent to the non-capital city elite spiritual child Li Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Under the near-universal gaze, Liu Changqing stepped onto the stage. Standing tall, he looked down at the petite Li Nuanxi, who only reached his waist, and couldn't help but curl his lips in disdain.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was careless, but rather... Looking at the little runt in front of him, he couldn't take her seriously at all. If he were to reach out and press his hand against her head, she wouldn't even be able to reach him with her fists and kicks. There was no challenge.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, just admit defeat and go home to drink milk!" Liu Changqing raised his chin and crossed his arms.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi narrowed her eyes and stomped her foot heavily, "How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>But he soon realized that the little runt had suddenly crouched down, and the wooden stage beneath her feet began to tremble violently, accompanied by a loud cracking sound. Nuanxi's figure then shot out like a black line, her speed so fast that it was almost as if she had transformed into one!</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing's hairs stood on end, and he quickly widened his stance, letting out a long roar as his black hair flew. The qi and blood within his body surged, and his tendons and bones crackled and groaned. The nine major tendons on his back were writhing, and his bones were emitting tiger roars. Liu Changqing, at the age of seven... had tempered his bones!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists, a ruthless look flashed in his eyes. He had to go all the way and become the true successor of the Divine Sect. His family had placed so much hope in him, and his mother and father wanted to be proud of him!</p><p></p><p>"Little runt, get off this stage! This stage belongs to me!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the heavy responsibilities he had to bear at such a young age, Liu Changqing's eyes reddened slightly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his fist, and the divine energy surged and dispersed, aiming at the sneaky little girl who had darted to his waist. With a twist of his waist, he brought his fist down with tremendous force, intending to easily smash it into the girl's forehead. With his tempered bone cultivation, combined with the explosive power of his nurtured nature, this punch would be enough to knock the little girl unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing did not hold back, and there was even a hint of excitement in his eyes - the excitement of hitting someone.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a chubby little fist clenched and shot out. Nuanxi had invaded Liu Changqing's waist, firmly planting her feet and pushing forward with a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>Her father had told her that this was the weakest point for an opponent, but where she could exert the most perfect force.</p><p></p><p>Attacking the opponent's weakness with her own perfection - this was the essence of combat that her father had taught her!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Their fists collided. Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing was horrified. That chubby little fist contained a terrifying internal force that was even more frightening than his tempered bone cultivation!</p><p></p><p>A surge of divine energy-infused power crashed into him, and he was overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>His punch was deflected, and that little fist slammed into his abdomen...</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing felt as if his kidneys were about to burst. The excruciating pain instantly enveloped his entire head like a spider's web.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!"</p><p></p><p>After landing the punch, Nuanxi immediately followed up with a flying kick, solidly kicking Liu Changqing in the chest.</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced Liu Changqing was in agony.</p><p></p><p>He was kicked away, flying off the stage and sliding several meters.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah... my waist... Mommy... Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing curled up on the ground, wailing and crying, with snot and tears streaming down his face, turning into a pitiful little kitten.</p><p></p><p>The area around the stage had already erupted in an uproar. That impact force... was so strong! That punch and that flying kick - could one really say this was a three-year-old girl? At three years old, what could she do? She couldn't even control her own urination! This girl... had actually reached the level of tempered bones?! Those with discerning eyes were not few, and after Nuanxi unleashed her powerful force, punching and kicking Liu Changqing to tears, they all sensed the intensity of Nuanxi's qi and energy.</p><p></p><p>"Three years old... Tempered bones mastered..."</p><p></p><p>On the neighboring four stages, the expressions of the others had all changed.</p><p></p><p>Huang Sixiang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and piercing, and his bronze-colored skin seemed to be shimmering with light.</p><p></p><p>This little runt... was so strong?! Even the originally mocking Qin Fenghuо fell silent, his face showing a hint of astonishment. He, at seven years old... had only just reached the level of tempered bones.</p><p></p><p>No, this girl... what kind of monster was she?!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the high platform, Li Qingshan stroked his beard and burst into laughter, almost choking from laughing so hard.</p><p></p><p>Good job, little Nuanxi!</p><p></p><p>Sneak attack, suppressing her aura, sudden burst of power... and fierce pursuit and relentless strikes...</p><p></p><p>If she had pulled out a cute ox-faced mask from her pocket, she would have been the spitting image of the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Little Ox Demon! She truly takes after her father and daughter.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Divine Sect, Nan Lihuo, raised his eyebrows, a hint of surprise in his eyes. Indeed, he was quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. At such a young age, her mind is so keen, and her combat techniques... are filled with spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo praised.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Zhu Hongdou's eyes had already lit up, and she had the urge to take Nuanxi in as her disciple.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan rolled his eyes. Techniques filled with spiritual energy... </p><p></p><p>If it were the Ox Demon instead, the evaluation would certainly be one of a ruthless, cunning, and shameless villain!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? That three-year-old brat actually... "</p><p></p><p>"So fierce, so powerful! That burst of qi and blood, that strength... Tempered bones mastered?"</p><p></p><p>"Tempered bones mastered at three years old? I couldn't even pee far at three!"</p><p></p><p>"Can the difference between people really be this great?"</p><p></p><p>The many parents and onlookers surrounding the wooden stage were all taking in sharp breaths.</p><p></p><p>Just watching it made them feel the pain. Nuanxi's extremely cunning punch landing on Liu Changqing's abdomen, while not fatal, was extremely humiliating.</p><p></p><p>The kidneys were right there. If there were any problems...</p><p></p><p>The young boy's flowery future... could be ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Did Liu Changqing hold back?" The spiritual children from the Eastern Huan City were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They were all only low-grade or mid-grade spiritual children, and under Liu Changqing's suppression, they could hardly breathe.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that the invincible Liu Changqing under seven years old in the Eastern Huan City would be defeated by a three-year-old brat at the very start?</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was also taken aback, and a bitter smile, which was quite genuine, appeared on his lotus-like face.</p><p></p><p>Tempered bones mastered at three years old, not bad, a very promising seedling.</p><p></p><p>Though young, her combat experience was quite seasoned.</p><p></p><p>First, the attack location was extremely cunning and malicious. Secondly, the sudden burst of tempered bone cultivation caught the opponent off guard, displaying a certain degree of interconnected design, with an extremely high combat awareness.</p><p></p><p>The fighting style, though still raw, had a touch of agile and cunning!</p><p></p><p>Very good!</p><p></p><p>As for the strike to the waist and kidneys, what bad intentions could a child have? Innocent and pure, her strikes were not intentional.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's bitter and gloomy expression could not fully conceal his smile as he quickly stepped onto the stage.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't appear, the undecided Nuanxi might continue to pound the whimpering Liu Changqing into the ground...</p><p></p><p>"Father said that as long as the referee hasn't called a stop, I have to keep attacking, and can't stop until the referee does," Nuanxi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Tactically, one can look down on the opponent, but the strikes must not be held back! Father said the world is too dangerous, so one must be steady and cautious, while simultaneously ambushing the opponent, also guarding against the opponent's sudden retaliation and sneak attack!</p><p></p><p>Fighting is a serious matter, after all, if you're not serious, you'll get beaten up.</p><p>Nuanxi didn't want to get beaten up! In this world, the only one who could beat her was her stinky father!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright."</p><p></p><p>"He admits defeat."</p><p></p><p>"In this challenge, Liu Changqing's assault on the stage has failed, and Li Nuanxi has successfully defended the stage!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng held back Nuanxi's rushing head with one hand, and with the other, he flicked his finger, sending a divine light energy into Liu Changqing's body, gradually calming the agonized Liu Changqing, who was rolling on the ground and wailing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Nuanxi was still reluctant to stop, putting her hands on her hips and shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>"Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>"Seven years old... not that impressive at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Much worse than Lü Daitou."</p><p></p><p>The precious badge has been obtained, thank you all for your support.

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes drifted down slowly from the high sky.</p><p></p><p>They were torn apart by the surging hot blood and suddenly burst open.</p><p></p><p>Xixi stood still, and a mighty surge of blood erupted from her small body!</p><p></p><p>Blood exchange... the fifth stage! She had reached the fourth-stage blood exchange and even the fifth stage! At this moment, on the entire Golden Peak Platform, many people were taken aback, with sounds of shock, sharp intakes of breath, and amazement that did not cease. "At four years old... she can actually cultivate to the fifth stage of blood exchange? How did she train to achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>"Is her martial talent this high? It's too exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>"Even in the Dao City... unless it's the one with the innate grand master physique, who could reach the blood exchange stage at four years old?"</p><p></p><p>Exaggerated...</p><p></p><p>The only word that could describe her is "monster"! On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wang Kuyu's hand paused in stroking his beard, and a hint of shock also flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This talent... is indeed quite extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my junior brother admires her so much. Reaching this level of martial cultivation at four years old is indeed rare!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this girl really has a chance to be accepted as the last disciple under the direct lineage of the Qianyuan Sect? To become the last closed-door disciple of the Sect Master? After all, the Sect Master of the Qianyuan Divine Sect is a powerful cultivator who stands at the pinnacle of the Great Landscape, worthy of being called a great deity!</p><p></p><p>Many people have been scrambling to be accepted into his sect.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Sect Master has announced that he will only accept one more disciple in his lifetime, this news has shaken the Lingnan Dao and the surrounding regions! It is enough to show the influence of a Sect Master of a divine sect!</p><p></p><p>"But it's still difficult..." Wang Kuyu shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the fourth-stage blood exchange is indeed remarkable, but there are indeed too many child prodigies who can compete with her.</p><p></p><p>The favored scions of the millennium-old families in the Dao City, the princes and princesses of the vassal kingdoms, the royal bloodlines, the wild child prodigies, the reincarnated child prodigies...</p><p></p><p>And the Sect Master is still in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He has announced that he will not emerge for another four years...</p><p></p><p>By the time four years have passed, Xixi will be eight years old.</p><p></p><p>Some children may be precocious, with a growth rate higher than ordinary people in the beginning.</p><p></p><p>But their speed will gradually slow down, and they may even become ordinary.</p><p></p><p>As for Xixi...</p><p></p><p>Before the age of eight, there are too many variables.</p><p></p><p>And compared to those child prodigies from the Dao City or even the Divine Capital, the resources of the Golden Peak Sect are indeed lacking! Wang Kuyu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo wants to give his beloved junior disciple a better future and destination at the end of his life.</p><p></p><p>"As her senior brother..."</p><p></p><p>"I can only do my best to give her one last push."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crimson mist burned on Zhong Liushou's fists.</p><p></p><p>He slowly stood up, having been sent flying by a four-year-old little bean, which indeed caused him to lose face.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was not big.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to win back the victory with an even more domineering posture!</p><p></p><p>Fifth-stage blood exchange?</p><p></p><p>He had it too!</p><p></p><p>And he was at the fifth-stage blood exchange at the age of seven!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Soundless rumbles erupted from his body, as if five fierce tigers were roaring in unison.</p><p></p><p>He took a step, and the blue stones paving the platform instantly cracked, forming a radial spider web of fissures.</p><p></p><p>The huge recoil force instantly tore through the airflow, emitting a sonic boom, like a crimson flash of light, rapidly charging towards Xixi!</p><p></p><p>Xixi's big eyes blinked rapidly.</p><p></p><p>But they were filled with excitement! Ah - it's been a while since she had a good fight! Xixi was going to enjoy this to the fullest! Her chubby palms slapped forward, and a mighty spiritual force surged out from her body.</p><p></p><p>[Extreme Sorrow Wind Fire Subduing the Dragon Three Princes] Spiritual Force! Accompanied by the fifth-level Nourishing Spirituality Technique!</p><p></p><p>In fact, this Nourishing Spirituality Technique was not high-level. Even within the Sect, there were fourth-level Nourishing Spirituality Techniques.</p><p></p><p>But the Nourishing Spirituality Techniques aim to nourish the spiritual force, paving the way for the establishment of the Spiritual Foundation.</p><p></p><p>If one were to pursue higher-level Nourishing Spirituality Techniques, it would be easy to get stuck at the Spiritual Foundation stage!</p><p></p><p>The technique Xixi cultivated was a complementary Spiritual Manifestation technique.</p><p></p><p>Obtained from the Golden Divine Palace, Nourishing, Spiritual Foundation, Illusory Manifestation, Spiritual Manifestation...</p><p></p><p>Five levels in a complete chain!</p><p></p><p>This cost-performance ratio was far higher than the techniques within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Golden Hellfire Jade Body! Xixi let out a childish big roar, and this signature technique of Nanlihuo was also displayed by her, reaching the minor success level and approaching the great success level! Her entire body transformed into a blazing flame, like a brilliant golden flash, charging towards Zhong Liushou!</p><p></p><p>Boomâ€”</p><p></p><p>The two collided and clashed directly!</p><p></p><p>Killing intent!</p><p></p><p>Fierce impact!</p><p></p><p>The big and the small were engaged in a rapid exchange on the snowy platform! Zhong Liushou's martial arts attainments were not low, having cultivated a low-grade secret technique to the great success level!</p><p></p><p>It was a family technique used to cultivate martial arts from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>However, after reaching the great success, wanting to push the secret technique to the grand master level would be an extremely difficult task!</p><p></p><p>Even by the time Zhong Liushou turned eighteen, he might not be able to advance this secret technique from the great success to the grand master realm! He would need to cultivate his own martial dao to the Grandmaster realm first.</p><p></p><p>However, with a great success secret technique as a foundation, it would be much easier to gain insights into other superior martial arts and achieve a transformation of the spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>This was also the common cultivation method of scions from influential families.</p><p></p><p>And Xixi's martial talent, after being constantly cheated by Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Using her pure spiritual force, wrapped in the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit's insights into martial arts, infusing them into her body.</p><p></p><p>This caused her already not weak martial talent to also rise rapidly!</p><p></p><p>In just a year's time, she had cultivated the Golden Hellfire Jade Body to the near-great success level! Although it was not as good as Zhong Liushou's great success secret technique, Xixi still had the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist at the Transformation Realm level!</p><p></p><p>That's right, the little kitten brawling fist technique that Xixi mentioned, under Li Che's cheating-style transmission, had reached the Transformation Realm level! Zhong Liushou felt immense pressure, and there was an old resentment in his heart that he could not spit out! Transformation Realm!</p><p></p><p>At four years old... she actually has a Transformation Realm fist technique?!</p><p></p><p>Are you a reincarnated ancient monster? The body of this little bean must be hiding an ancient cultivator who has practiced martial arts for decades!</p><p></p><p>I can't suppress her anymore!</p><p></p><p>After colliding with Xixi, beads of sweat appeared on Zhong Liushou's forehead, and he couldn't help but be drenched in sweat!</p><p></p><p>"No... if this continues, I will be completely suppressed... until I'm defeated!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly a four-year-old freak ranked 21st on the Dao City's child prodigy list!"</p><p></p><p>"She has some abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to break free from her..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou roared, and suddenly his arms were enveloped in the crimson patterns of tiger stripes!</p><p></p><p>He struck out with his fists, and two spotted blood-red tigers roared and charged out!</p><p></p><p>Xixi leaped up, as if riding on a crimson tiger, swinging her little fists, her entire body burning with golden jade fire.</p><p></p><p>Riding the tiger, swinging her fists! The four-year-old Empress Xixi, roaring and attacking the tiger!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Haitao Sheng was pulled away by Gong Yangliang and Gongyang Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Empress Xixi has arrived, clearing the field of bystanders!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing pointed out the spiritual force and healed Haitao Sheng's injuries, and Haitao Sheng became lively again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Haitao Sheng was staring intently at the scene in the center where Xixi was pressing down and fighting Zhong Liushou.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Haitao Sheng was completely convinced.</p><p></p><p>"Xixi... is really strong..."</p><p></p><p>Haitao Sheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yangliang and Gongyang Xiu gave him a wary look.</p><p></p><p>Strong is strong, but why are you looking at her with such admiration?</p><p></p><p>"I was Xixi's friend a year ago!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yangliang said.</p><p></p><p>"I held hands with Xixi a year ago!" Gongyang Xiu puffed out his little face, bringing out his trump card!</p><p></p><p>Gong Yangliang glared, and he and Gongyang Xiu started bickering again.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gong Yangliang brought out his trump card - his little sister can eat...</p><p></p><p>This really infuriated Gongyang Xiu!</p><p></p><p>Haitao Sheng snorted and glanced disdainfully at the two immature boys.</p><p></p><p>These two fledgling dragons, how could they possibly stand by Xixi's side?</p><p></p><p>Only he, Haitao Sheng!</p><p></p><p>Only he had common topics with Empress Xixi!</p><p></p><p>In Haitao Sheng's mind, the scene of Xixi tearing open the darkness to save him when he was in dire straits resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>That scene...</p><p></p><p>was deeply engraved in his mind, the most touching moment in his eight years of life.</p><p></p><p>Empress Xixi!</p><p></p><p>He, Haitao Sheng, will follow her for the rest of his life!</p><p></p><p>Haitao Sheng stepped forward, pushing Gong Yangliang and Gongyang Xiu aside! "Go, Xixi!"</p><p></p><p>Haitao Sheng clenched his fists, suddenly shaking his head, and the sweat droplets on his hair tips scattered in the faint winter sunlight as he opened his mouth and let out a hoarse, impassioned cheer!</p><p></p><p>He even cracked his voice a bit...</p><p></p><p>But that enthusiasm, that sincerity, that heartfelt roar!</p><p></p><p>It completely stunned the bickering Gong Yangliang and Gongyang Xiu.</p><p></p><p>But the two soon reacted.</p><p></p><p>They also started howling and cheering!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the bitter cold of deep winter, the heavens and earth were frigid and bone-chilling! A heavy snowstorm suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>The world was blanketed in white, with distant snowy mountains shrouded in white.</p><p></p><p>Whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>The biting cold wind, whipping up the branches and leaves covered in thick snow.</p><p></p><p>In the dense forests on the sides of the official road, there was no one in sight, everything covered in a thick layer of snow.</p><p></p><p>It was like a vast expanse of blank space in a landscape painting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the white snow burst open.</p><p></p><p>A towering, mountain-like black figure leaped out from the snow, kicking up flying soil and swirling white snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down his hat brim, wearing a black robe and a carved eight-level spirit wood ox mask.</p><p></p><p>He landed on the snowy ground, leaving no footprints.</p><p></p><p>Li Che used the Burrowing Talisman gifted by Nanlihuo to emerge from the ground here.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo and Li Qingshan were not nearby.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo hired the Ox Demon Horse Face, and he did not need them for close-quarters combat. He needed the long-range shooting ability of the Horse Face.</p><p></p><p>And in Nanlihuo's impression, a divine archer needs the protection of the Ox Demon to focus on archery without worrying about being ambushed.</p><p></p><p>So Nanlihuo initially hired the Ox Demon Horse Face as a whole, not just the Horse Face alone, nor just the Ox Demon alone.</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood this point, so he did not mind.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Mask, Li Che suddenly laughed out loud.</p><p></p><p>But the laughter sounded a bit ominous.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixi... a divine sect's temptress, huh? At four years old, your charm is already so great?"</p><p></p><p>"The little yellow-haired ones are one after another being drawn to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, through Xixi's Flying Thunder Chess Piece, overlooked the entire scene, capturing every detail.</p><p></p><p>He clearly saw the images of Haitao Sheng, Gongyang Xiu, and Gong Yangliang competing for Xixi's attention.</p><p></p><p>These three little yellow-haired ones, Li Che remembered them.</p><p></p><p>Focus on them!</p><p></p><p>Twisting his neck, Li Che's demonic muscles on his back suddenly exploded, and the blood qi formed concentric shock waves radiating outwards.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped down, his figure instantly catapulted away, dashing through the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Finally finding a suitable position, Li Che landed without a single disturbance.</p><p></p><p>The entire snow-covered tree did not even shake off a flake of snow.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of the Ox Demon appeared, while he himself transformed into the Horse Face identity.</p><p></p><p>Pinching two fingers together, he tore open the air and took out the divine Barret sniper rifle, gripping it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, and the [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit pulsed, causing the luminous luster of the heavens and earth to disappear around him.</p><p></p><p>Only the glowing celestial chessboard, with his current location as the star position, suddenly expanded to envelop the area.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, the howling wind and swirling snow! Everything became incredibly clear in Li Che's perception.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling of carriages, the neighing of horses.</p><p></p><p>Lun Dragon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>They have arrived.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The flying snow swirled, the icy wind rustled.</p><p></p><p>The official road was covered in thick frozen snow.</p><p></p><p>The biting cold wind raged, even on the cleared official road, it was rarely traveled, even experienced merchants or escort agencies would not venture out on a day like this.</p><p></p><p>But in the icy and snowy world,</p><p></p><p>a group of people were tearing through the blinding snowstorm, their surging blood qi parting the snow curtain in front of them, advancing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In the lead, a familiar figure, dressed in black tight-fitting clothes, a saber hanging at his waist, riding a horse and trampling through the snow.</p><p></p><p>On his back, evenly spaced iron bows, frosted white by the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>They were cautious and solemn, in the middle was a plain and ordinary-looking carriage being protected.</p><p></p><p>The heavy curtain of the carriage was drawn, shielding against the cold.</p><p></p><p>On the carriage shaft sat a one-armed old coachman in a straw hat.</p><p></p><p>Creaking, the wheels crushed the frozen snow, opening a path forward.</p><p></p><p>The carriage curtain was lifted.</p><p></p><p>A five-year-old child, dressed in luxurious attire, with a youthful face, emerged from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The young master was entirely clad in elegance, an imposing aura emanating from his brow, and his pupils were faintly tinged with purple.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the heavens and earth are bitterly cold, do not let yourself freeze."</p><p></p><p>The one-armed coachman, his empty sleeve swaying in the icy wind, looked at the young master and slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The young master, however, was unfazed, calmly stepping out of the carriage and sitting on the carriage shaft.</p><p></p><p>His small figure, looking at the raging snowstorm, raised his hand and plucked a snowflake.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Dufu, are we almost to the Golden Peak City?"</p><p></p><p>The young master asked.</p><p></p><p>His childish voice carried a hint of maturity.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man smiled: "Almost."</p><p></p><p>"Suhuai has</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It just seems a bit slow... We have not arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit lax, but after all, it's not the prince's own army, so being lax is normal."</p><p></p><p>The young man nodded, his purple pupils reflecting the white snow in the sky, appearing extremely dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Flower's Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple... The Four Mysterious Temples, when my father was young, he once came to explore one..."</p><p></p><p>"He gave an extremely high evaluation, saying that this Mysterious Temple could be the top-tier Four Mysterious Temple within the Great Scenery Dynasty's territory."</p><p></p><p>"My father has been arranging this since I was born..." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>"I hope this Mysterious Temple will not disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>The five-year-old young man, in his resplendent attire, with eyes like purple lightning, said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man, however, laughed: "Don't worry... The prince's evaluation won't be wrong."</p><p></p><p>"The prince has paved such a long path for the young prince."</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity will resonate, the young prince will definitely take the lead, although I've heard that this time in the Lingnan Road City, the Qianxuan Sect has arranged a divine child and superior spiritual child to come, and the Jinguang Prefecture has also given birth to a hundred-foot purple qi divine child..."</p><p></p><p>"But, for the young prince..."</p><p></p><p>The one-armed charioteer had not finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>The childish voice then resounded in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"They are all trash!"</p><p></p><p>The charioteer was stunned, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the old prince's offspring, he has the old prince's heroic spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lingnan Road City, among the Great Scenery's eleven road cities, ranks in the middle to lower tier, the divine children they produce... are indeed no different from trash for the young prince."</p><p></p><p>The young man's lips curled up.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the divine child the Jinguang Branch Sect has taken in is only four years old? It seems their talent is extremely good, their martial prowess is extraordinary, reaching the Blood Transformation Realm at the age of four, and was taken as a direct disciple by Nanlihuo?"</p><p></p><p>The young man stood with his hands behind his back in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of Nanlihuo, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Reaching Blood Transformation at the age of four is not bad, I can generously grant her the qualification to become my concubine in the future!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the young man spread his arms.</p><p></p><p>The heroic and magnanimous spirit in his chest seemed to be infusing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"I must obtain the inheritance of the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Flower's Furious Third Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Rumbleâ€”</p><p></p><p>The carriage wheels turned, crushing the wind and snow! In the white, boundless icy land.</p><p></p><p>It was like a black spear thrown out, hunting a wild beast!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crimson blood steed galloped furiously, shattering the wind and snow, scorching hot blood surging from both the rider and the steed.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan, in his military uniform, carried a crimson longbow on his back, majestic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>With a squeeze of his legs, the demonic blood steed beneath him suddenly let out a shrill neigh, its front hooves rising high, scattering countless snowflakes!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, there were also several armored guards riding divine steeds.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Wen, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>A deputy general pulled on the reins, making the horse stop, asking in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan raised his hand and took an feathered arrow from the quiver on his back.</p><p></p><p>However, the feathered arrow was trembling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"My arrow... is trembling."</p><p></p><p>"There is an ambush."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The deputy general was stunned, then laughed: "Captain, you're overthinking it, aren't you? We are secretly going out of the city to welcome the young prince, who would ambush us?"</p><p></p><p>"And if there is an ambush, it would be for the young prince... Why would they ambush us?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy general laughed, but gradually stopped laughing under Wen Longshan's indifferent gaze.</p><p></p><p>The deputy general's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Is it an ambush for Captain Wen?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan took off his waist-long bow, chuckling coldly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be the case..."</p><p></p><p>"Well, before going to see the young prince, let's clean up some stray cats and dogs, so as not to disturb the young prince later."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan twisted his neck, and instantly, blue veins like a dragon's net spread over his neck.</p><p></p><p>In his crimson eyes, sharp and crazy light burst forth.</p><p></p><p>The surging powerful blood suddenly surged up.</p><p></p><p>It was like a scarlet flame in the icy land, melting everything around it! "Horse Faceâ€”!!!!"</p><p></p><p>Whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>Silently, black lines shot from the distant sky!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's hair burst open, his body suddenly leaping and falling to the snowy ground, taking several heavy steps.</p><p></p><p>The muscles under his military uniform bulged! </p><p></p><p>Tossing his head back, twisting his waist, a creaking sound like tearing ten miles of frozen ice rang out! The divine bow was fully drawn! Countless boiling hot steam rose up!</p><p></p><p>Boomâ€”!! The dragon tooth bullets arrived first, followed by the terrifying sound waves, like the roar of a dragon, exploding in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan had evaded in advance, but the demonic blood steed under him was instantly pierced and exploded!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's small team immediately became tense and chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Pulling the reins, they began to roar.</p><p></p><p>Poofâ€”! However.</p><p></p><p>By the time they reacted, it was too late! One by one, the dragon tooth bullets, like invisible dragon claws, stealthily struck from the void.</p><p></p><p>Silently, but with tremendous force and terrible destructive power!</p><p></p><p>Except for the deputy general at the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>The other guards, without even having time to react, had their heads blown open one by one!</p><p></p><p>"Go! Find the location of Horse Face!"</p><p></p><p>"Based on the speed and explosion of that hidden weapon, he must be within ten miles!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's low voice was filled with bursting anger.</p><p></p><p>The deputy general, without hesitation, leapt off the horse and rushed into the dense forest like a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan bent the bow, drawing the moon, and the surging blood like threads flowed into the longbow, the feathered arrow seemed to let out a shrill scream!</p><p></p><p>Horse Face dares to kill him?! Horse Face actually dares to come and kill him?!</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>With just a Horse Face, it would be impossible, and he wouldn't have the confidence to come and kill him!</p><p></p><p>Horse Face has accomplices! Or rather, someone has hired Horse Face to kill him! In an instant, in the blink of an eye, Wen Longshan figured out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Who is it?! "Come out!!!!!!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan let out a long roar, the bowstring trembled, and the feathered arrow, like a wild beast ready to pounce, fiercely flew out! Screechingâ€”! The air suddenly exploded into white waves, like thunder tearing the earth! Sizzle sizzle sizzle! However, a terrifying hammer shadow suddenly crashed down!</p><p></p><p>The entire snow field seemed to tremble, and the dense snow was suddenly blown up by the shock!</p><p></p><p>"Sheep Horn Breaking the Sky! Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>"You cowardly dog?!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's eyes narrowed, countless scarlet flames ignited, and his arms seemed to be burning with terrifying flames.</p><p></p><p>He drew the bow, bent the bow, and shot the arrow! The feathered arrows were ignited with scarlet flames, like a series of scarlet dragons spanning the heavens and earth! "Wen Longshan! You despicable, treacherous, shameless piece of shit, daring to try to shoot me when I'm breaking through, why wouldn't I dare to kill you?!"</p><p></p><p>In the forest.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly swung out the Sheep Horn Hammer, and dense electric arcs intertwined in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The impact collided with the scarlet flowing arrows! Explosions kept bursting open!</p><p></p><p>Poofâ€”</p><p></p><p>A muffled groan, the deputy general at the Spiritual Perception Realm initial stage, suddenly spewed blood and was shot back, leaving a deep furrow in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Then a sharp golden light sword shadow, accompanied by the roar of the overturning heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Pierced through this deputy general's head!</p><p></p><p>Pinning him to the snowy ground.</p><p></p><p>The crimson blood immediately spread, staining the pristine white snow into a scarlet color! The gilded long sword was still slightly trembling! "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Killing Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Nanlihuo!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan narrowed his eyes, his body flowing with scarlet flames, and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>In front and behind him.</p><p></p><p>Two figures gradually appeared, completely cutting off his path forward and retreat.</p><p></p><p>There was also a cunning archer in the dark, aiming at him, ready to unleash the terrifying dragon roar thunder at any time! It's simply...</p><p></p><p>A heavenly net and earthly trap!</p><p></p><p>The tense expression on Wen Longshan's face suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Nanlihuo... you old fox, you couldn't hold back and took the initiative to attack... wanting to kill me."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan gripped the divine bow and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo, wearing a white fox mask, his white hair swaying in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>A light sigh.</p><p></p><p>"As expected..."</p><p></p><p>Wearing a black cat mask, Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes and suddenly tilted his head back.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw a terrifying white wave suddenly tear across the sky from above!</p><p></p><p>That is...</p><p></p><p>City Lord Su Huaili! Li Qingshan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Mantis stalking cicada, oriole in the back?</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Nanlihuo, Patriarch, your intelligence seems to have been known by someone long ago! Or you were calculating someone, and someone was also calculating you back...</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili...</p><p></p><p>This junior disciple of Pacification King Yimo, although only the youngest disciple, the mere title of Yimo's disciple is enough to make people's hearts retreat and shudder with fear!</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, if the situation is not good, find an opportunity to retreat."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet our Jinguang Prefecture's Prefect."</p><p></p><p>"Meet this... junior disciple of the Pacification King."</p><p></p><p>Under the white fox mask, the pitch-black pupils suddenly ignited golden flames! A step landed.</p><p></p><p>The white fox figure, accompanied by rippling rapidly expanding turbulent air currents, rushed into the sky! In the heavens above.</p><p></p><p>Wearing armor and carrying a wide-bladed longsword, the city lord Su Huaili, in a military attire, no longer had the scholarly elegance of the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Slowly removing the thick wide-bladed longsword on his back, Su Huaili sneered as he looked at Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>He slowly raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>A bloody head was gripped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch of the South, next time don't insert assassins in the homes of officials... the reaction is not good, affecting the harmony between the court and the Sects."</p><p></p><p>"Also, since you've come, then stay."</p><p></p><p>"I'm very curious, why did my teacher specifically transfer me here to watch over you... what secret do you have?"</p><p></p><p>"Or... Patriarch of the South... do you know some secret of my teacher?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Su Huaili's aura suddenly became tyrannical, and the assassin's head was thrown out.</p><p></p><p>Then the longsword trembled, and instantly, the sky was filled with sweeping sword light! Powerful and terrifying spiritual power, like dark clouds obscuring the day, instantly enveloped and oppressed Nanlihuo!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Power!</p><p></p><p>The golden flames in Nanlihuo's pupils suddenly flickered! Su Huaili... has indeed cultivated Spiritual Power!</p><p></p><p>But he, Nanlihuo...</p><p></p><p>Also has the Golden Prison Fiery Jade Lotus! </p><p></p><p>Transformation Realm!</p><p></p><p>Absolute Skill True Meaning... Domain! Nanlihuo suddenly spread his arms, and instantly, it was as if a golden celestial deity appeared in the sky, turning into a dazzling golden flame, colliding with Su Huaili's longsword!</p><p></p><p>The golden sword and the tyrannical blade collided!</p><p></p><p>Clanging of metal!</p><p></p><p>Sparks flew!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the snow field.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan gripped the longbow, his gaze sharp and cold.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the distant Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about Li Qingshan, the more killing intent was still aimed at the hidden Horse Face! He wanted to kill Horse Face... </p><p></p><p>So much that he wanted to kill him! That dragon tooth bodhi bullet that pierced his chest was an endless humiliation to him!</p><p></p><p>Only by severing Horse Face's head could he regain the confidence and glory of being an archer!  Li Qingshan...</p><p></p><p>Wasn't even worth Wen Longshan's attention! Slightly tilting his head, his ears twitching, Wen Longshan's eyes suddenly brightened, his five fingers clenching.</p><p></p><p>The longbow was fully drawn!</p><p></p><p>The scarlet flowing light feathered arrow, exploded out, colliding with the silent and invisible dragon tooth bodhi in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>Bursting into intense flames! The howling air currents swept through!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing the cat-faced mask, dragging the thunderous electric net-like sweeping Sheep Horn Breaking the Sky Hammer, had already rushed over!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan soon turned pale! Because, in the forest, there were divine crossbows whistling through the air!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying piercing power broke the sound barrier, causing Li Qingshan's hammer strike towards Wen Longshan to suddenly change direction.</p><p></p><p>Smashing towards the thick divine crossbow bolt!</p><p></p><p>Blasting a huge snow pit in the ground as the two figures suddenly leapt into the air, powerful spiritual perception auras simultaneously appearing!</p><p></p><p>Both were armored divine generals at the Spiritual Perception Realm! "The two divine general commanders of the Divine Guard Army!"</p><p></p><p>Under the cat-faced mask, Li Qingshan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>They were prepared too thoroughly, weren't they?</p><p></p><p>This is...</p><p></p><p>Being counterplotted!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Wen Longshan didn't even bother with Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The two late-stage Spiritual Perception Realm divine general commanders of the Divine Guard Army... were enough to deal with the just-broken-through Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>His target...</p><p></p><p>Was only Horse Face!</p><p></p><p>His body flickered, stepping heavily, the surging snow waves, like a curtain, rose dozens of feet high, then gradually fell intermittently! And Wen Longshan, taking advantage of this hazy moment, left no trace in the snow, diving into the forest! The forest...</p><p></p><p>Was the domain of an archer!</p><p></p><p>When the position of an archer was exposed,</p><p></p><p>It meant...</p><p></p><p>This archer... was not far from death!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan rushed through the snowy forest like a scarlet dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Horse Face..."</p><p></p><p>"I've found you!"</p><p></p><p>7,000 word chapter, the last day of the month, Old Li continues to update!

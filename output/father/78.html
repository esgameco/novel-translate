        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds seemed to be dispersing. </p><p></p><p>Li Che, carrying an oiled paper umbrella and dressed in a black outfit, came to pick up his daughter and take her home, full of energy.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of what had happened at the Shen Xiu Temple.</p><p></p><p>Although he now had the confidence to reveal his "Ox Demon" identity, he still habitually tried to conceal it whenever possible.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shu Auntie's pale complexion and the mess throughout the courtyard, Li Che instinctively displayed the self-cultivation of an actor.</p><p></p><p>"Shu Auntie, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scholarly Li Che strolling in from the rain, Shu Auntie let out a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>As if finally finding someone to confide in, she hurriedly told Li Che about the Yang family's attack on the Shen Xiu Temple, which was ruthlessly wiped out by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>"It's too terrible, truly too terrible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face was filled with horror as he shook his head repeatedly. </p><p></p><p>The improvement in his physical strength had also made him more adept at controlling the subtle expressions on his face, allowing his acting skills to become even more exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the big-headed Lu Chi tilted his head, speechless, just quietly watching Li Che's performance.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Shu Auntie's account, Li Che hugged Xixia tightly, his face full of worry, and directly asked Shu Auntie for leave.</p><p></p><p>"Shu Auntie, for the time being, Xixia will not come to the Shen Xiu Temple, I'm worried about her safety."</p><p></p><p>Shu Auntie naturally would not refuse. The Xu family's Shen Xiu Temple was no longer safe, and not a single Xu family expert had shown up today, which clearly showed that the Xu family had chosen to do something despicable. </p><p></p><p>If this had happened once, it could happen again, and trust had already been lost. </p><p></p><p>So it would be too dangerous for Xixia to stay, and Shu Auntie could understand Li Che's feelings. </p><p></p><p>In fact, she also did not want Xixia to remain.</p><p></p><p>In the drizzling rain, Shu Auntie watched Li Che carry Xixia away, a trace of melancholy flashing across her face.</p><p></p><p>But the melancholy soon dissipated, replaced by a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Nuan Xixia had such a scholarly, amiable, and honest father. Although he had taken the Ox Demon, a ruthless and evil master, the path ahead, under her father's influence... should not go astray.</p><p></p><p>She should grow up well... </p><p></p><p>Become an excellent and cheerful female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were only two of them.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang's "Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light" technique of the divine hunter had not yet been obtained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, gently sliding his fingertips through the air, instantly tearing open the space and revealing the inner space.</p><p></p><p>After expelling two Qiankun Jade and breaking the divine seals on them with his thousand-split hand technique, the contents within were fully exposed to Li Che's perception.</p><p></p><p>The Yang family's harvest was the greatest. After Li Che annihilated the Yang family, in addition to the collections on each of the experts, he also specifically went to the Yang family's treasure vault for a tour.</p><p></p><p>The harvest was abundant.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the bank notes, gold bars, and silver ingots, which were too many to count, Li Che simply gave up counting.</p><p></p><p>For these aristocratic families, money was the least of their concerns.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the money, what most delighted Li Che were the elixir bottles that the Yang family's treasure vault placed great emphasis on storing.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs!" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>He took a porcelain bottle, poured out a blood-red elixir pill, and the potent medicinal fragrance instantly permeated the entire courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood in his body even began to boil faintly, stimulated by the medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>"Viper Blood Warrior Elixir?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not recognize this elixir, but there was an explanation next to it in the Yang family's treasure vault, so Li Che identified it.</p><p></p><p>The Viper Blood Warrior Elixir, containing a mighty medicinal nature, could only be refined and consumed by those with profound martial arts cultivation. A single pill was worth three thousand gold leaves, an extremely high price!</p><p></p><p>In the Yang family's treasure vault, a total of eleven warrior elixirs were collected, which was obviously the family's heritage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che happily collected all these elixir pills.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these external objects, there were also martial arts techniques and skills.</p><p></p><p>What Li Che truly valued were the divine martial arts and divine secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Python Dragon Cannon, Cloudhawk Treading Clouds..."</p><p></p><p>"Nine Radiance-level divine martial arts, as well as..."</p><p></p><p>"Nine Radiance-level divine secret technique... Joyful Flying Head Savage!"</p><p></p><p>The only two precious divine martial arts, as well as the divine secret technique obtained from Zhou Ruoguan's body, were kept by him.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Yang family's treasure vault nor Yang Kaihe's Qiankun Jade contained any divine secret techniques, which made Li Che quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>Aside from these three, he collected the rest of the books, some of which were mid-level and low-level qi and blood martial arts, and even planned to sell them on the black market later to exchange for money.</p><p></p><p>The money earned could be used to purchase elixir resources, and he would also need money in the future to raise his children.</p><p></p><p>After the final count, two books with yellow leather covers remained in Li Che's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Radiance Heart-Startling Tempering Cultivation Classic" and "Great Scenery Shrine Eight Extremes Chaotic Joyful Deity Tempering Method"! Two tempering cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze fell on the ones he had obtained from the divine hunter Zhou Ruoguan. Previously, he had obtained the "Wrathful Amitabha" tempering method from Zhao Xuanhai, which was also at the Eight Extremes level.</p><p></p><p>"The entire set of Seven Emotions tempering methods passed down by the Great Scenery Shrine?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow raised, and he couldn't help but associate it. Thinking about it this way, the official Great Scenery organization was quite generous.</p><p></p><p>Being a civil servant really is lucrative.</p><p></p><p>"But... now they all belong to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed as he opened the books.</p><p></p><p>In the "Chess Sage" Dao Fruit, the "Chaotic Joyful Deity" divine chess piece obtained from Zhou Ruoguan's body trembled slightly and appeared in his palm, assisting Li Che in quickly comprehending this tempering cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>As the day cleared and the candles burned out, Li Che opened his eyes in the lacquered black study room. His gaze was shimmering, his divine nature fluttering, as if there were countless laughter, distant and near.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Chaotic Joyful Deity' has also been cultivated, and a third divine nature has been refined within my Nirvana Palace, and the tempering cultivation is like a lantern!"</p><p></p><p>In one night, Li Che not only cultivated the "Chaotic Joyful Deity", but also, through the refinement of the chess piece, reached the realm of tempering cultivation like a lantern.</p><p></p><p>"Wrathful Weeping Demon", "Wrathful Amitabha", "Chaotic Joyful Deity"...</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che has mastered three tempering cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Emotions divine nature...</p><p></p><p>He has already grasped three of them!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed with brilliance, his heart surging with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Could he truly grasp all seven divine emotions?</p><p></p><p>If he could master the seven divine emotions...</p><p></p><p>And cultivate them all to the highest levels...</p><p></p><p>What would he become?</p><p></p><p>Would he... become a deity?</p><p></p><p>PS: Monday, a new week has begun!

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuò suddenly rose, his usually gentle expression changing slightly, a gleam of light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The divine purple mist reached a height of over a hundred feet! This is the title bestowed upon a prodigious child!</p><p></p><p>This is the title recorded in the divination arts for the gifted children.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the finest spirit children, this is an extremely rare occurrence!</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jinguang Prefecture, including the thirteen surrounding cities, it would be rare to find a prodigy in a lifetime, and Li Qingshan had never discovered one before this selection.</p><p></p><p>At each city, Li Qingshan would perform the divination arts to select spirit children, categorizing them into different levels, and then arranging for them to come to the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they had only managed to select three exceptional spirit children.</p><p></p><p>As for prodigies, they had not even seen a single one! This was not just the case for Jinguang Prefecture, but the four prefectures under Yunzhou, with Jinguang being the most powerful. It was the location of the main peak of the Yunzhou Divine Sect's branch.</p><p></p><p>The other three prefectures were even worse, with few exceptional spirit children, let alone prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, across the entire Yunzhou, prodigies were a rare occurrence once in decades.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was the main sect's capital city, where new disciples were recruited, prodigies would occasionally appear.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuò did not expect that this Divine Sect branch recruitment examination would produce a prodigy! Not only Nan Lihuò was shocked.</p><p></p><p>When the divine purple mist column above Xīxī's head reached a height of over a hundred feet, touching the mushroom-shaped canopy, almost all the divine sense cultivators found it difficult to suppress their own divine senses, causing a disturbance! "Over a hundred feet, this is a prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy? Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Jinguang Prefecture, this recruitment examination actually produced a prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The divine sense elders of the five great families all had flickering gazes, their minds in turmoil!</p><p></p><p>The divine sense experts from the Zhen Temple Agency, the Celestial Observatory, and the Divine Guard Army were also emotionally stirred.</p><p></p><p>Especially from the direction of the Zhen Temple Agency, the divine sense pressure of the agency's supervisor was almost uncontrollable, leaking out. That eager, eager-to-pry-at-the-corners emotion was almost blatantly revealed! The Zhen Temple Agency's usual style was to pry at the corners of the Divine Sect, as the court did not openly recruit spirit children, but whenever a good seedling appeared, the Zhen Temple Agency would try to pry it away.</p><p></p><p>A prodigy, this was enough to make the agency's supervisor and the chief supervisor throw caution to the wind.</p><p></p><p>However, prying at the corners was not that easy, as this prodigy was too young, only three years old, so to seize the three-year-old prodigy, they would have to start from the child's parents.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhen Temple Agency area, Zhang Lianhao was utterly astonished. As the chief agent, he had once kept an eye on Li Yue for a period, and although he had initially dismissed the suspicions about Li Yue's identity, Li Yue had ultimately remained in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Yue's daughter was actually a prodigy! Zhang Lianhao was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The daughter has brought glory to the father... With a prodigy appearing, the Divine Sect branch will surely pay great attention! Li Yue will also gain the attention of the Divine Sect because of his daughter's prodigy status!"</p><p></p><p>"They have truly become wealthy and noble."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sat in his chair, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this prodigy would be pried away by the Zhen Temple Agency, it would be very difficult. Sect Master Nan Lihuò of the Divine Sect would definitely not let go of a prodigy and would have made ample preparations.</p><p></p><p>"A three-year-old prodigy, already being valued and cultivated by the Divine Sect branch, in the future... they will surely enter the Lingnan Dao Qianyuan Proper Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"That's when they will truly soar!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sighed deeply, for the vicissitudes of life, who could say for sure about one's destiny?</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that when the Li family had just arrived in the prefecture, they were still worried about being persecuted by Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Qin family probably dared not easily provoke the Li family.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was somewhat taken aback, and this trace of astonishment could not be hidden even on his stern, lotus-like face.</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's Confucian robe fluttered, and even his lifeless fish eyes lit up with light.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>He started to boast.</p><p></p><p>The exceptional spirit children, however, were all dumbfounded, gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Especially Hai Chaosheng, who stared blankly at the divine purple mist column above Xīxī's head, which had directly surpassed his own height, reaching over a hundred feet! His face immediately felt scorching hot, and he had been the top newcomer of this batch, hadn't he?</p><p></p><p>Now, it was clear that he had been trampled underfoot by this three-year-old violent little girl.</p><p></p><p>This three-year-old powerhouse had become the unique existence among the newcomers!</p><p></p><p>He, Hai Chaosheng...</p><p></p><p>Was just trash.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng's eyes became moist, with a sense of inexplicable grievance, making him feel like he wanted to cry.</p><p></p><p>He was a genius that the elder had secretly prepared to cultivate...</p><p></p><p>Yet he had lost to a three-year-old violent little girl! Hai Chaosheng felt utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>The other children were also greatly shocked. As children, their thoughts were not so complex, they just felt...</p><p></p><p>Xīxī was so powerful! The Upper Guan Qinglei, who had been blasted by Xīxī's fireworks until his skin was torn and his flesh was exposed, gritted his teeth in resentment. Heavens, how unfair! This stinky girl could also have a hundred-foot divine nature, becoming a prodigy-like existence?</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gong Yangshou didn't have as many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Wow... Xīxī is so powerful... She reached the top!"</p><p></p><p>The five-year-old Gong Yangshou jumped and clapped.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang also nodded: "No wonder she is the child of someone my aunt knows!"</p><p></p><p>"She is also the child of someone my grandfather knows!" Gong Yangshou retorted, unwilling to lose.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two were about to start arguing again, Xīxī sighed and rubbed her forehead, these two troublesome subjects really gave her a headache.</p><p></p><p>"Don't argue, eat some melon seeds! Three each!"</p><p></p><p>Xīxī grabbed another handful of melon seeds, giving three to each of them. This was fair and impartial.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gong Yangshou finally quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng swept his gaze over all the superior and exceptional spirit children, recording their names and the heights of their divine purple mist columns.</p><p></p><p>He had thus completed the assessment of the second stage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the assessment of the intermediate and lower-level spirit children was not to be presided over by him, Zhang Qingzheng. The intermediate and lower-level spirit children would basically only be able to enter the outer sect, and the outer sect's attendants would be responsible for their assessment.</p><p></p><p>That assessment would be quite complex, with many being eliminated, and Zhang Qingzheng was too lazy to manage that.</p><p></p><p>After the divination array dissipated, the crisp spring drizzle fell again.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng, with his Confucian robe billowing in the wind, his sleeves concealing the cool breeze, stood on the platform and said in a deep voice, "The second stage of the true disciple assessment is over."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the heights of the divine purple mist columns measured by the divination arts, the top five are as follows."</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi, a height of over a hundred feet, evaluated as superior superior, possessing the qualities of a prodigy."</p><p></p><p>"Hai Chaosheng, a height of ninety-one feet, evaluated as superior, an exceptional spirit child."</p><p></p><p>"Gong Yangshou, a height of seventy-two feet, evaluated as superior, an exceptional spirit child."</p><p></p><p>"Huang Sixiang, a height of sixty-nine feet, evaluated as superior, an exceptional spirit child."</p><p></p><p>"Gong Yuanliang, a height of sixty-five feet, evaluated as superior, an exceptional spirit child."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng announced, and the crowd below immediately erupted into a flurry of whispers. On the high platform, some of the exceptional spirit children also had slight changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Combining the scores from the first stage, the confirmed true disciples are Li Nuanxi, Hai Chaosheng, and Gong Yuanliang."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, an uproar broke out.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng suddenly waved his sleeve, and an invisible wind wave enveloped Xīxī, Hai Chaosheng, and Gong Yuanliang.</p><p></p><p>Like riding the clouds, Zhang Qingzheng brought the three children to the high platform, facing Sect Master Nan Lihuò and the other elders.</p><p></p><p>Those who could step onto the high platform represented that they had been promoted to become true disciples, about to be accepted as disciples under a certain elder's peak.</p><p></p><p>The three children landed on the high platform, with Hai Chaosheng and Gong Yuanliang almost being ignored.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuò, and the elders Zhu Hongdou, Xu Jiuqing, and Weng Wuyu all had their gazes fixed on the bewildered Xīxī, who still had a melon seed in her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Crack" Xīxī unconsciously bit the melon seed, the sound of the shell breaking... was like thunder.</p><p></p><p>It even scared Xīxī herself.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, good child, a fine child."</p><p></p><p>Elder Weng Wuyu, a man dressed in plain clothes, with white hair and beard, looked much more amiable than Zhang Qingzheng. He laughed heartily, full of appreciation for Xīxī.</p><p></p><p>The other elder, Xu Jiuqing, was a young man in appearance, tall and slender, wearing white robes, with a suppressed divine sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>He also greatly admired Xīxī, his gaze filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's eyes had already fixed unblinkingly on Xīxī, unable to look away.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng took a deep breath, his lifeless eyes serious and vigilant as he stared at the three: "You three elders, when selecting disciples, you must wait until all the true disciples are out, you can't renege!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait until I arrive to choose together!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou and the others smiled but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was inwardly furious, always feeling that the moment he turned his back, he would lose the opportunity to fairly tempt Xīxī.</p><p></p><p>However, the true disciple selection was not yet complete, and as the presiding elder, he naturally could not linger here.</p><p></p><p>He turned to the sect master and cupped his fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, in this true disciple assessment, there is still one true disciple position left."</p><p></p><p>"Among the successful platform defenders in the first stage, Qin Fenghuò and Jin Ao, but in the second stage, Gong Yangshou and Huang Sixiang had higher talent assessments..."</p><p></p><p>"So the final true disciple will be selected from these four."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng said.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuò stood up, hands clasped behind his back, and smiled faintly: "Talent takes priority, Gong Yangshou's talent is seventy-two feet, ranking third, so he is admitted first."</p><p></p><p>"Huang Sixiang, Qin Fenghuò, and Jin Ao will enter the inner sect."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuò made the decision.</p><p></p><p>He then turned his gaze along with Zhang Qingzheng to the other three elders.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Qingzheng saw a scene that made him want to burst his eyes out.</p><p></p><p>Because the three elders had already surrounded Xīxī, trying to persuade and tempt her with reason and emotion, offering her elixirs, divine weapons, and peerless techniques to lure her into their respective peaks.</p><p></p><p>"Inserting flags and selling their souls!"</p><p></p><p>"Utterly shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng trembled with anger.</p><p></p><p>The sect master patted Zhang Qingzheng's shoulder: "Elder Zhang, do not get upset, go announce it first, don't let the children wait."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng calmed down a bit, the sect master was kind and polite, caring for the old man.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng waved his sleeve and flew to the platform.</p><p></p><p>He announced the remaining one true disciple position.</p><p></p><p>The five-year-old Gong Yangshou, bewildered, was brought up to the high platform.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the four true disciples had all gathered.</p><p></p><p>On the platform, Qin Fenghuò was listless and dejected. He... had not been selected as a true disciple?</p><p></p><p>In the second stage, his divine purple mist column had also exceeded fifty feet in height, yet he... had not been selected!</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of frustration made Qin Fenghuò deeply disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that among these four true disciples, this little girl Li Nuanxi was not from a prefecture city family.</p><p></p><p>She came from one of the thirteen cities outside the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He, Qin Fenghuò, came from the Qin family, enjoying abundant resources since childhood, yet he had been defeated by this three-year-old little girl!</p><p></p><p>It was agonizing.</p><p></p><p>Twisted, about to break apart!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seven-year-old Qin Fenghuо bore the failure that his age should not have borne.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei didn't really care much. From the moment Qin Fenghuо was beaten to a pulp in the first round of the challenge, he knew that the position of the true disciple had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>It was Qin Fenghuо who was truly miserable.</p><p></p><p>He had successfully defended the challenge, and in the second round, his divine energy pillar had reached over fifty feet high, yet he was still knocked down and became an inner sect disciple just like Qin Fenghuо.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei felt relieved. People fear comparison, but it is comparison that brings hope.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The true disciples were finally selected.</p><p></p><p>The names of the four true disciples echoed and reverberated at the foot of the Divine Ancestor Mountain, as the excited crowd discussed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The name "Xixі" had become a high-frequency word on everyone's lips.</p><p></p><p>A three-year-old girl from one of the thirteen cities of the Imperial City had actually surpassed the scions of the five great families and five major sects, becoming a true disciple of the Divine Ancestor! Moreover, in the second round, she had displayed the talent of a prodigy! This was so inspiring that it would become the protagonist of the storytellers' tales in the teahouses of the Imperial City for the next month!</p><p></p><p>In the parents' area.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes were vacant, and a silly smile hung on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Xixі has become a true disciple! Hehe... our Xixі has become a true disciple!"</p><p></p><p>She snapped out of it, excitedly grabbing Li Che's arm: "My lord, our precious Xixі has become a true disciple of the Divine Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che finished detecting the death curse seals around them and had already formed a list in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also opened his heart and rejoiced with his wife.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, congratulations, congratulations! Your daughter's talent is extraordinary, a rare genius in a century. This is truly joyous news!"</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su immediately smiled and congratulated them.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen next to her also finally relaxed and smiled widely, congratulating Li Che as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya, the husband and wife, stood up together to respond with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, many people around them, upon learning that Li Che and Zhang Ya were the parents of the genius child Xixі, came over to congratulate them.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the congratulations echoed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao, the chief constable of the Temple Guardians, as well as the divine constables Hung Yung and Shih Lei, also came to congratulate them.</p><p></p><p>Colleagues from the Astrology Bureau, such as Liu Ho and Hai Chuan-ying, as well as the voluptuous junior constable Kung Yun-li and Kung-yang Lien-ch'eng, also came to offer their congratulations.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took the opportunity to introduce his colleagues and superiors to Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was harmonious and joyful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, human nature requires a balance.</p><p></p><p>There are those who are happy, and those who are worried.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Family.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan and Qin Leixiao exchanged a glance, both somewhat incredulous, their expressions slightly grim.</p><p></p><p>The family patriarch Qin Cao's sharp gaze swept over them: "Were you the ones who originally suspected this Li Che of killing Yuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"You even sent a gray-faced spy to keep an eye on him?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That Li Che should know about our Qin family, and he must have felt the threat and pressure that Yuqing once brought to their family, which is why he hurried to become a third-class guest constable of the Astrology Bureau after arriving in the Imperial City."</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Qin Cao said indifferently, "I heard he's just a muddy-footed fellow from Fei Lei City... who got lucky and had a genius daughter."</p><p></p><p>"Fenghuо performed very well in this assessment, but unfortunately... his luck was a bit lacking. However, he still has a chance. In a while, the Divine Ancestor will organize the 'Temple God Resonance', and Fenghuо will have a chance to turn the tables then!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Cao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan nodded, his gaze turning to Patriarch Qin Cao, and he couldn't help but say, "Back then, Yuqing brought a lot of threat to the Li family. Should we send a gift to the Li family side..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Cao looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere around them suddenly became gloomy and oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p></p><p>After a long while...</p><p></p><p>Just as Qin Haonan thought he had said the wrong thing, Qin Cao said faintly, "You can take a gift..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan was stunned, thinking he had heard wrong.</p><p></p><p>"After all, she is a genius..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Cao said softly.</p><p></p><p>"This girl is bound to enter the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect in the future."</p><p></p><p>"If... she doesn't die midway."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Xixі was surrounded by the three elders, feeling a bit bewildered and confused. They were all competing to have her join their sect, and she didn't know how to choose... Xixі was so troubled.</p><p></p><p>Daddy, come quickly!</p><p></p><p>She called out in her heart, longing for her father.</p><p></p><p>If her father were here now, he would surely help her make the right decision.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Sect Master Nan Lihuо came over, and the three elders timely restrained themselves a bit.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou beamed with joy and said to the Sect Master, "Sect Master, I think Xixі joining my Red Cloud Peak would be the best, I have very rich experience in teaching female disciples!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Elder, your words are mistaken..."</p><p></p><p>The refined and elegant Elder Xu Jiuqing was about to refute.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was already frowning and had rolled up his sleeves, ready to argue and snatch the disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, Sect Master Nan Lihuо raised his hand gently, and the four elders fell silent, beginning to brew their emotions before the fight for the disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all listen to what the Sect Master has to say."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the peak masters like Li Qingshan and others with pseudo-manifestation level battle power also perked up their ears, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has not taken a disciple in ten years. A genius like Xixі, being able to join our Divine Ancestor Gold Light Branch Sect, is considered good luck for our sect!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou heard the Sect Master's opening remarks and changed color instantly.</p><p></p><p>This old scoundrel... actually wants to join them in snatching a disciple!</p><p></p><p>She was careless, really careless!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's body trembled, she had actually forgotten about this old scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master also wants to take a true disciple."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо looked at the crowd with a gentle gaze, and the four elders were left speechless, not knowing how to argue.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master is personally taking a disciple...</p><p></p><p>Can they compete with him?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng was even shaking with anger... Inserting a stake and selling one's head! A shameless villain! He had previously thought the Sect Master was a good person, what a waste of his smile!</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you all need not be too disappointed... Xixі is a genius talent, and in the future, she must be sent to the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect for further cultivation, to compete with the geniuses of the Orthodox Sect, and strive for glory for our Gold Light Branch Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"So, the Sect Master hopes that the four elders... can cultivate Xixі together with this old man."</p><p></p><p>"Work hard to cultivate Xixі into a talent, and try to get Xixі to enter the top ten of the Qianyuan Ranking in the future, so that we can obtain more resources from the Orthodox Sect for our Gold Light Branch Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо said, raising his arm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, there was dead silence.</p><p></p><p>The four elders were almost simultaneously bulging-eyed with rage. The old scoundrel! Not only did he snatch their beloved disciple, but he also wanted to freeload off them...</p><p></p><p>Unfilial son!</p><p></p><p>"I agree!"</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, the first to speak up was Zhang Qingzheng.</p><p></p><p>"This old man agrees, the 'Two Sleeve Peak' of this old man is open for Xixі to freely come and go."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou glared, and also expressed her agreement: "My Red Cloud Peak is also open for Xixі, if she is willing to come, she can even stay there permanently, I truly love this little girl."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing and Weng Wuyu hesitated for a moment, then sighed and also expressed their agreement one after another.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, who was watching from the side, was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This kind of situation...</p><p></p><p>He had never encountered it before.</p><p></p><p>A disciple who made the top echelons of the Divine Ancestor Sect want to cultivate her together, this was what kind of treatment? The darling disciple of the Qianyuan Divine Ancestor Gold Light Branch Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Since Xixі has joined my sect and become the Sect Master's true disciple, there will be one less true disciple for the elders. Elder Zhang, that Huang Sixiang's talent is a bit inferior to Gong Yang Xiu, and he was also defeated in the challenge battle by Gong Yuanling, so I'll promote him to be the true disciple."</p><p></p><p>"No need." Zhu Hongdou refused.</p><p></p><p>"Without a female disciple, this generation of Zhu Hongdou will not accept a true disciple, I will focus all my attention on cultivating Xixі."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's decision did not surprise the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then Huang Sixiang will remain an inner sect disciple..."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he walked up to Xixі, took her small hand, and led her away.</p><p></p><p>An invisible wave of energy surged and undulated from all around.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо, carrying Xixі, soared into the air like riding the clouds, hovering in midair, as if a myriad of crimson lights were bursting forth, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi from Fei Lei City, possessing divine energy of a hundred feet, her blood at the age of three has been tempered to perfection, mastering the martial arts of a great master, her cultivation complete, is an unparalleled genius in the Imperial City..."</p><p></p><p>"Today, after much discussion and decision by the many divine elders and the Sect Master of our Qianyuan Divine Ancestor Gold Light Branch Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"She is appointed as the Sect Master's true disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"Bestowed upon her are the Seven Element Spirit Weapons 'Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring', a seventh-tier Qianyuan Myriad Manifestation Nascent Pill, a seven-element spirit wood sculpture, the Divine Ancestor Gold Light Branch Sect's martial art supreme skill 'Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Annihilation Sword Technique', and the matching heaven and earth spiritual object 'Golden Light Annihilation'."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Divine Ancestor Gate, in front of the white jade pavilion.</p><p></p><p>All who were present fell into silence, only overwhelmed by the endless shock and turbulence.</p><p></p><p>The various major and minor forces were all in an uproar! A Sect Master's true disciple?! Not an elder's true disciple, but the Qianyuan Divine Ancestor Gold Light Branch Sect's Sect Master's true disciple! One who has the potential to inherit the position of Sect Master in the future!</p><p></p><p>But even more shocking were the rewards that Sect Master Nan Lihuо had promised! Seven Element Spirit Weapons!</p><p></p><p>A seventh-tier martial pill!</p><p></p><p>A supreme martial art technique!</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth spiritual object "Golden Light Annihilation"! Simply... the envy of all!</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of the Divine Ancestor Sect, this was the soaring future of becoming a Divine Ancestor Sect true disciple! The other elder true disciples would also have various rewards, although they would definitely not be as good as the Sect Master's true disciple.</p><p></p><p>But with such a proclamation, the Sect Master's true disciple's rewards simply made everyone's hearts itch with envy and admiration.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Lihuо, holding Xixі, hovered in the air.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, auspicious clouds descended, slowly falling in front of the Divine Ancestor Gate, in front of the parents' area.</p><p></p><p>A vast and overwhelming pressure surged, as if the Nine Dragon River was shaking, raising towering waves.</p><p></p><p>Everyone dared not breathe a word.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the top experts in the Imperial City, ranked among the supreme powerhouses! At this moment, his majestic presence was unparalleled! Nan Lihuо, holding Xixі, cast his gentle gaze upon Li Che and Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Li Che quickly led Zhang Ya, bowing and clasping his hands towards Sect Master Nan Lihuо.</p><p></p><p>"Parents of Xixі, the Li family and Zhang family have contributed to nurturing the genius child Xixі, and are rewarded with two Nine Luminaries Spirit Weapons, two eighth-tier martial pills, a Divine Ancestor Sect entry and exit permit, a hundred thousand taels of gold, and three shops in the Imperial City..."</p><p></p><p>"As thanks for your efforts in raising the genius child!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuо's voice was gentle as he spoke to Li Che and Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>His voice thundered like a clap of clouds.</p><p></p><p>The booming echoed throughout the entire area in front of the Divine Ancestor Gate.</p><p></p><p>Good news, the characters have been created, everyone can go and give the characters some virtual hearts, add some heart counts. Bad news, there are no recommendations, continue going bare, seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes to support! Thank you, Old Li!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He looked intently at this capable assistant: "Lei Chunlan... wasn't she supposed to be staying inside the Jinhuang Hall? How could she have died?"</p><p></p><p>"And didn't we send a well-trained guard to protect her? Even if she faced a crisis, couldn't he at least hold out for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Si Mubaio's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan was a representative from the Lingying Sect who had come to discuss matters with him. But now, Lei Chunlan... had actually died! Died right after their discussion...</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, the atmosphere suddenly became cold and solemn, with a sense of ruthlessness. The howling winds and swirling snowflakes seemed unusually sharp.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu had originally wanted to take his leave, but now he didn't want to go. His eyes flickered with uncertainty, and his heart was filled with some doubt.</p><p></p><p>An odd idea even began to form in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had just met with Lei Chunlan...</p><p></p><p>And then Lei Chunlan was immediately killed? Could that be a coincidence?! </p><p></p><p>How could such a coincidence occur?!</p><p></p><p>Si Mubaio stood up and placed the cup down. "Old Guo, lead the way, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>The battle-hardened warrior Guo Zhan cupped his fist and turned to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Before the incident, Li Che had left the Jinhuang Hall, circled around the inner city streets a few times to confirm he wasn't being followed, and then returned to the alley where he had left his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Shedding the black robe and suppressing his aura, his body returned to its original state, and he changed back into his own clothes. </p><p></p><p>Crushing the wooden mask into powder, Li Che let out a long sigh. </p><p></p><p>With Lei Chunlan's death, he felt a sense of relief, as if a heavy weight had been lifted. But this feeling was quickly overwhelmed. Li Che raised his hand, and wispy, snake-like strands of energy began swirling rapidly in his pristine white palm.</p><p></p><p>"Divine power..."</p><p></p><p>"The divine power of the Lingying Sect's leader? </p><p></p><p>"The power I've absorbed, contained within the 'Thousand Slivers Hand'... I wonder what use it could have?"</p><p></p><p>Time was of the essence, so Li Che didn't spend time investigating further.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the alley, he bought a box of osmanthus cakes from a shop, then went to a restaurant to pick up the fine wine and delicacies he had pre-ordered. He then found the old carriage driver who had parked his cart by the roadside, puffing on a pipe.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, I've got everything. Please take me back to the wood carving shop," Li Che said with a smile, handing the driver a small jar of yellow wine from the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>The driver was hesitant at first, but couldn't refuse the gift. With a cheerful expression, he climbed onto the carriage and drove off, the sound of hooves clattering on the cobblestones.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the bitter cold, the snow flurries.</p><p></p><p>Heading gradually towards the outer city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, the white snow was stained red with blood. The guard's body had been cleaved in two, a truly tragic sight in the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>The sound of footsteps crunching in the snow rang out as Si Mubaio and Xu Beihu entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Wrapped in a crane-feather cloak, the handsome Si Mubaio looked at the guard's gruesome death scene, his expression grim. "Crushed and killed without any ability to fight back..."</p><p></p><p>"The killer's strength is extraordinary, far beyond the guard's 'Qi Completion' level. He couldn't even send a message, definitely not a novice, perhaps even at the 'Qi Completion Perfection' stage."</p><p></p><p>Si Mubaio's keen eyes quickly assessed the guard's powerful opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The wounds look like they were caused by a sharp weapon, but not quite like those made by a sword or blade..." </p><p></p><p>The experienced battle-hardened warrior Guo Zhan crouched down to examine the body, speaking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu, wrapped in a fox-fur cloak, looked at the guard's smooth, even cuts and couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity...</p><p></p><p>These wounds... seemed somewhat familiar. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of the way the wood carver Xun Changbiao had been killed at their outer city wood carving shop...</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the killer was the same person? Si Mubaio stepped over the guard's body and entered the room. The smoldering coal fire filled the space with hazy heat, making the smell of blood even more pungent and nauseating.</p><p></p><p>And there, Lei Chunlan's body was pinned to the wooden floor, her death extremely tragic.</p><p></p><p>A wanted poster, and a tragic corpse.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gloomy deity of the prison, walking among the mortals, arresting and judging! Xu Beihu narrowed his eyes, and a trace of delicate understanding flashed across his rugged face, confirming that...</p><p></p><p>The murderer who killed Lei Chunlan...</p><p></p><p>Was the same as the one who killed Sun Changbiao! The method of killing was the same, and the modus operandi was also the same - the distinctive wooden arrow, and the wound caused as if by a thin thread... The identity of the murderer was basically determined.</p><p></p><p>"The evil criminal is the Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Who exactly is he?! In the outer city, he dared to commit the crime in the well-guarded wood carving shop of his own family...</p><p></p><p>And in the inner city, he was able to kill within the even more tightly guarded Jinhuang Hall, which was jointly operated by various families! Reckless... and mysterious!</p><p></p><p>Who is he? Whose person is he?!</p><p></p><p>"Who is the Ox Demon?" </p><p></p><p>As if hearing Xu Beihu's murmur, Simubai coldly looked over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu briefly explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>"What a bold Ox Demon, daring to commit a crime in the Jinhuang Hall, truly... audacious and arrogant, completely disregarding us, the Feilei families!"</p><p></p><p>Simubai's fist in his sleeve clenched tightly, and he coldly and murderously uttered a sentence.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual fluctuations in his eyes seemed to spread in ripples, accompanied by the wailing cries of ghosts, lingering and unceasing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu glanced at Simubai's appearance, and his heart shuddered slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Simubai must be very close to the "divine foundation", as his spiritual nature was somewhat difficult to control.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by footsteps, a powerful aura intertwined in the air, and several figures walked in from the courtyard. The one in the lead wore a black and red robe, with a saber hanging at his waist, and sharp eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young Masters Xu and Simubai, you are both here." </p><p></p><p>The newcomer clasped his hands, his voice powerful and mighty.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Divine Constable Zhang has come. Please, Divine Constable, take a walk with us." Simubai's expression calmed down, his angry aura suppressed, and the pitiful crying expression reappeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu and Simubai were quite polite to the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person was Zhang Xiangyang, one of the three divine constables of the Feilei City Yamen. Dispatched by the imperial court, he possessed formidable martial arts prowess and strong spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The divine constables were so called because they had cultivated their spiritual nature, possessing abilities far beyond ordinary warriors.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang rested his hand on the hilt of his saber and slowly walked in. Upon entering the room, he saw Lei Chunlan's body and the wanted poster.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so the deceased was also a wanted criminal... Tsk, after committing the murder, he issued a wanted poster, considering himself righteous, but he has violated the law with his martial arts." Zhang Xiangyang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Let's confirm the murderer first..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang spoke a sentence, and the next moment, he took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! His hair and beard stood on end, and there seemed to be a trace of gray flowing in his eyes - this was his cultivated spiritual nature...</p><p></p><p>The air suddenly became permeated with a sense of fear, which was the fear that Lei Chunlan had exuded in life, and it was now all captured by Zhang Xiangyang, reflected in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>"A burly figure, over nine feet tall, wearing a straw hat, dressed in black, with powerful vital energy, and wearing... a Ox Demon mask..."</p><p></p><p>The gray light in Zhang Xiangyang's eyes disappeared, and his focus returned, as he said indifferently, "The evil criminal wanted in the outer city is indeed this Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"Daring to commit a crime in the inner city, after the one in the outer city, this Ox Demon... must have a powerful background."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang chuckled coldly. Without a strong background, how could he dare to easily commit a crime in the inner city? </p><p></p><p>Those powerful families and the official yamen were not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Constable Zhang's 'Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light' spiritual nature... has grown even stronger, and he is likely to become the leader of the three divine constables of Feilei in the future."</p><p></p><p>Simubai applauded with a mix of laughter and tears.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang glanced at Simubai's uncontrollable spiritual nature and smiled, "Young Master Simubai is the one whose spiritual nature is about to break through, and the divine foundation will soon be established. Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhang Xiangyang turned to look at the several constables behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Go back to the yamen, rewrite the wanted poster for the Ox Demon, and increase the bounty to three hundred..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the oppressive image of the Ox Demon he had seen through Lei Chunlan's fear...</p><p></p><p>"No, make it five hundred taels instead!"</p>

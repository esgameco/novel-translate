        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fragrance and bitterness of the wine lingered in his mouth, but his mind had already drifted to the towering Dao tree that rose up from the vast wilderness.</p><p></p><p>His daughter was one year old, and the Dao tree had borne fruit.</p><p></p><p>A Dao fruit of [Dragon Elephant Vajra]! This was the second Dao fruit Li Che had obtained, the first being [Immortal Craftsman], which had enhanced his wood carving talent and allowed him to establish a livelihood in this world.</p><p></p><p>He had become a wood carving master at Xu's Woodcarving Shop, residing in the Xu family compound, ensuring his daughter Li Nuanxi's safe and steady growth to her first birthday.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had long understood the importance of Dao fruits.</p><p></p><p>So he had eagerly awaited the arrival of the second Dao fruit, and now it had finally borne fruit! [Dragon Elephant Vajra (Dao Fruit): Flesh and blood of the dragon and elephant, indestructible as a vajra, unparalleled in refinement.]</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a flood of information about the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao fruit surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Che felt his blood and qi boiling and surging, as if his flesh and blood were undergoing a cataclysmic transformation.</p><p></p><p>If he wished, he could actively stimulate the Dao fruit, causing even greater physical changes. However, with Old Chen by his side, Li Che did not have the heart to explore the special abilities of the Dragon Elephant Vajra.</p><p></p><p>"Flesh and blood of the dragon and elephant, indestructible as a vajra, unparalleled in refinement!" Li Che's heart raced with excitement, and he downed the cup of yellow wine in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>This was a Dao fruit that could enhance his martial cultivation!</p><p></p><p>And it was exactly what Li Che urgently needed. This Dao fruit not only confirmed the reality of his daughter receiving a Dao fruit each year, but also made Li Che understand that he must strive even harder to protect his daughter's safe growth...</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of seeing her...live forever! Li Che's heart skipped a beat. If his daughter could live forever, with a Dao fruit each year...</p><p></p><p>Then wouldn't he be able to accumulate Dao fruits, and grow to unimaginable heights in the future?</p><p></p><p>"Hey, when did you start drinking so freely?" Old Chen looked at Li Che, who had downed the cup in one go, with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and his gaze fell tenderly on Nuanxi, who was toddling in her walker. "Before I knew it, our little girl is already one year old..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Chen's lips curved into a smile, and his doting gaze returned to Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the little one who was so small before has grown up a bit now."</p><p></p><p>"This old man has no children, no descendants... This little Nuanxi has really grown on me."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen also downed his cup of old yellow wine, his heart light and the gloom dispelled.</p><p></p><p>From now on, Nuanxi would be his own beloved granddaughter!</p><p></p><p>Seeming to understand the meaning behind Old Chen's words, Li Che poured him another cup, and the two clinked glasses and drank it down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The training grounds.</p><p></p><p>Heavy snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Several figures were training fervently on the grounds, their blood and qi surging and dispersing the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che changed into his training clothes and came to the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, two figures saw Li Che and immediately stopped their movements, panting.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan, with her tall and slender figure and neatly tied black hair, smiled and said, "Teacher Chen, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't today Nuanxi's first birthday celebration?"</p><p></p><p>The other training figure, Wang Zhengping, also smiled and said, "Zhao Xuan and I were just planning to finish our training and go to the celebration."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, yes, go, go! As her uncles, you can't miss giving Nuanxi a birthday gift," Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>"The banquet is set at the Springwind Pavilion in the outer city. Springwind Pavilion has sent their own chefs and servers, so everything is taken care of. I don't have much to do, and Nuanxi has been taken by Old Chen, so I came here to train."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Zhengping pursed his lips: "A banquet at Springwind Pavilion, it seems we'll be in for a treat tonight."</p><p></p><p>After a brief chat, the three continued their martial practice.</p><p></p><p>The two shop managers, Xu Beihu, had once said that if the three of them wanted to reach perfection, they would have to train diligently for at least two years. If they were to slack off, it might take even longer.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, none of them dared to be the least bit negligent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite a few years older than Zhao Xuan and Wang Zhengpin. He was now twenty years old, about three or four years older than the two of them.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't work hard enough, as he got older, his vital energy would decline, and it would become even more difficult for him to advance in the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>That's why Xu Beihu had said that the most important thing in cultivating the physical body was diligence, racing against time.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, Li Che would practice in the morning, carve wood sculptures in the afternoon, and try making mechanisms at night...</p><p></p><p>Busy and fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't neglected the skin tempering cultivation either, and had already reached the initial stage of skin tempering.</p><p></p><p>In terms of progress, he was even a bit ahead of Zhao Xuan and Wang Zhengpin.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Beihu said that natural talent wasn't important for physical cultivation, there would still be some minor differences.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Che had come to the practice field, it was of course to test the attainment of the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the stone lock, the vital energy in his body surged and boiled, the scorching blood pounding against the membrane, causing it to instantly turn crimson red, the temperature rising, waves of heat rolling!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" dao fruit, as he activated his vital energy, seemed to be completely awakened, starting to vibrate and hum! Suddenly, a prompt appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv 1, 1%)]</p><p></p><p>A joyful expression appeared in his eyes, and an invisible force spread throughout his body, impacting the membrane, as if it had experienced thousands of strikes in an instant, rapidly accelerating the progress of skin tempering!</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who had already reached the initial stage of skin tempering, only felt his inner strength suddenly soar, his membrane becoming extremely tough, even emanating a faint luster, as if he had, with the activation power of the dao fruit, directly stepped from the initial stage of skin tempering... to perfection! And unlike the "Immortal Craftsman" dao fruit, the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Elixir dao fruit could be cultivated through diligent practice - in other words, he could "liver it out"! Li Che was overjoyed, and with a thought, the faint glow on his body immediately receded, and the powerful aura was also completely concealed.</p><p></p><p>As if it had been completely erased from the world.</p><p></p><p>"Freely controlling its release and concealment, this is a great dao fruit essential for hiding one's true self!"</p><p></p><p>With the vital energy contained, not revealing the slightest bit.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, I don't have to worry about my cultivation rising too fast and arousing suspicion. My innate talent... Xu Beihu has tested it, and if the improvement is too fast, it will definitely arouse doubt, and even invite mortal danger."</p><p></p><p>"In this chaotic world, for the Xu family to have been firmly established in Feilei City for two hundred years, their methods must have been ruthless - it's impossible otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"So, one cannot be careless in guarding against others."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered for a moment, then let out a soft sigh.</p><p></p><p>In the practice field, he diligently cultivated according to the skin tempering method for half a day.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv 1, 2%)]</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the dao fruit had actually increased by 1%!</p><p></p><p>This made Li Che's smile grow even more radiant. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention to him, he opened the floodgates again, unleashing the vital energy power contained in the dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the vital energy surged powerfully again, reaching skin tempering perfection, the membrane emanating a faint golden glow, his temples throbbing, the mighty strength wandering in his fists and palms.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the 1% increase in maturity and the resulting power boost... Li Che's expression turned delighted, which meant that he... now had the qualifications to assault the Meridian Openings Realm and begin cultivating the inner energy techniques!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" dao fruit also had a special effect of unleashing the power of the dragon and elephant, but unfortunately, at the moment the practice field was crowded, so Li Che did not dare to activate it.</p><p></p><p>But he could imagine that the boost from mobilizing the dragon and elephant power would be even greater! He reabsorbed the vital energy back into the dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head back, and snowflakes drifted down lightly on his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his lips curled up.</p><p></p><p>In terms of personal martial power...</p><p></p><p>The future was promising!</p><p></p><p>To the point where... he might even have a chance to kill that Nascent Soul Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

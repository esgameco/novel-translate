        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, the lamps burned quietly, occasionally emitting a faint crackling sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Che embraced his wife Zhang Ya, listening to his wife's resolute words, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Che smiled gently and ruffled his wife's head.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to practice, then practice."</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya tilted her chin up, pursed her lips, and said softly, "Xixia and you both practice martial arts. I've heard that those who practice martial arts have long-lasting vital energy and live much longer than ordinary people..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback, his gaze becoming increasingly tender.</p><p></p><p>He understood his wife's worries, for it was because of her care that she had these concerns.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was confident that he would be able to reach great heights in the future, and Xixia's talent was extraordinary, with limitless potential...</p><p></p><p>For his wife Zhang Ya to keep up with them would be a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>"But I now have the Dao Fruit... Slowly, I'll be able to find a way."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and gently stroked his wife's black, beautiful hair.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at his wife and said softly, "Xiao Ya, don't worry, our family will be fine, safe and sound, for a long time."</p><p></p><p>A warm home with a wife and children.</p><p></p><p>He only wished for this world to be peaceful for his small family.</p><p></p><p>The night was deep.</p><p></p><p>After the clamor had subsided, only a deathly silence remained.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, who wanted to learn martial arts, was lulled into a deep sleep by Li Che's gentle caresses, feeling tired.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Che, he was full of energy, as if the fierce battle earlier had not affected him much.</p><p></p><p>He took out the "Furious Three-Headed Six-Armed Infant Statue" the size of a thumb and, under the oil lamp's light, narrowed his eyes to examine it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his palm suddenly erupted with a pure white mist, as if his hand had turned into jade.</p><p></p><p>The nascent divine ability, [Immortal Craft: Thousand-Splitting Palm]! Instantly, Li Che felt the raging divine nature within the infant statue being frantically absorbed by his palm. In just a breath's time, the infant statue crumbled into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Scarlet threads of energy flowed through his arm, and Li Che sensed the power of the divine nature, his expression slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what kind of divine nature this is... It should be the divine nature left by the cultivators of the Infant Sect, a killing technique for those blood-transforming warriors. Unfortunately... it was crushed before it could be used."</p><p></p><p>"But this divine nature has conveniently fallen into my hands."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Thousand-Splitting Palm soon dimmed, sealing the divine nature within.</p><p></p><p>"The divine art I obtained is called [Wrathful Cry of a Hundred Ghosts Wind and Thunder Arrow]. It should be a divine art of the Shi family, but I wonder if I can use this divine nature to catalyze its activation?"</p><p></p><p>Probably not, as the divine nature he had absorbed was the nature of Wrath, completely different from the nature of Sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brow slightly, he realized he knew too little about divine natures.</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't understand, he decided not to waste his mental energy pondering it further.</p><p></p><p>He only planned to practice [Wrathful Cry of a Hundred Ghosts Wind and Thunder Arrow] when he had the time.</p><p></p><p>This was both an archery technique and a divine art...</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan clearly had not cultivated the divine nature and could not activate it; otherwise, the battle last night would have been even more difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon-Elephant Golden Armor (Lv2, 5%)]</p><p>[Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (Lv1, 1%)]</p><p></p><p>"Killing four Infant Sect blood-transforming cultivators only increased the maturity of Lv2 Dragon-Elephant Golden Armor by 5%... That's a bit too little."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the divine nature stored in [Untainted Heart] has been consumed by 2%, leaving only 1% of its maturity. In a single night, it's back to square one. This is the downside of not having divine arts."</p><p></p><p>"Divine arts, huh..."</p><p></p><p>As the lamp flickered, Li Che's desire for divine arts burned ever more intensely.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, after a night of heavy snowfall, it suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The quiet Xu Family Woodcarving Shop became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Many people gathered outside Li Che's courtyard, looking at the unharmed family and the frozen corpse of Zhao Chuanxiong lying in the snow, their faces filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"The commotion last night... the vital energy surging like raging fire, many blood-transforming martial artists attacked, but Li Shifu's family... actually didn't suffer any harm?"</p><p></p><p>"What, are you hoping Li Shifu's family would have been harmed?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is called the heavenly arrangement for good people, the Lingying Sect... It has become even more rampant, daring to openly snatch children even from our Xu family."</p><p></p><p>"This Zhao Chuanxiong... Zhao the captain is actually a member of the Lingying Sect?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many of the wood carving masters came out of their houses and gathered in Li Che's courtyard, chattering endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was gentle. Although these wood carving masters did not take action last night, it was understandable, after all... not everyone dares to be a hero.</p><p></p><p>Facing the blood-changing warriors of the Lingying Sect, even if these old masters took action... they would only end up being beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>Fear is understandable.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a figure in white clothes rushed over quickly, the energy surging, and in a moment, it whipped up a flurry of snow, arriving in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu You, who had rushed back from the inner city.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You came in front of Li Che's family.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head: "Last night, there was a bloody battle outside... I didn't dare to stick my head out, and stayed in the house with my wife and daughter. This morning when I came out, I saw Zhao Chuanxiong's body."</p><p></p><p>Xu You saw the coated Xixia, and the murderous look on his face immediately melted away as he hugged Xixia: "It's good that you're alright... Xixia, come, Uncle Xu will hug you."</p><p></p><p>"The incident last night was just the prelude, the real purpose... was to lure the 'Ox Demon' who has been causing a stir in Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>"This Zhao Chuanxiong was the bait, and now it seems the bait has been completely devoured..."</p><p></p><p>"In a corner of the courtyard, there is another corpse and scattered flesh, that Ox Demon... is really fierce, fighting against four people and killing them all while escaping unharmed. If you didn't know, you'd think that Ox Demon had cultivated the Penetrating Meridians."</p><p></p><p>"The blood-changing of the Lingying Sect is too cruel, exploded into nothing but scattered flesh."</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining corpse, it is one of司慕白's subordinates."</p><p></p><p>"This matter, the司 family must give us an explanation."</p><p></p><p>"Stealing a chicken and losing the rice, this is what司慕白deserves..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You sneered: "Last night, when that司慕白went out, it seems he encountered a mysterious powerful figure behind the Ox Demon, and his divine nature was almost shattered... Now he is suffering from serious injuries, and it will be difficult for him to recover his divine nature in a year or two."</p><p></p><p>"I've asked someone to take care of Old Chen's side, he should be released this afternoon..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You said a few more words to Li Che, then took his leave, as he still had many things to do.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary civilians, the events of last night did not have a big impact, but for the aristocratic families of the inner city, it was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Ox Demon who could kill the blood-changers, or the [Furious Prince] cultivator who had almost destroyed司慕白...</p><p></p><p>They had a huge impact on the various forces.</p><p></p><p>Holding Xixia, Li Che looked at the disappearing Xu You in the wind and snow, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>He gently stroked Xixia's back, making the little girl a little ticklish and squirming.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Li Che was using the divine nature accumulated from his [Untainted Heart] to groom Xixia's body, ensuring she was free from illness and disaster.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of the Untainted Heart is pure and spotless, without the strong emotional connotations of the other seven divine natures, so it is extremely suitable for nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also heard from Xu You's words that the events of last night were not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Did司慕白intend to take action himself last night?"</p><p></p><p>"But he was obstructed by a divine nature cultivator and was almost beaten to death..."</p><p></p><p>"Mistakenly thought there was someone behind the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, and he couldn't help but feel a little frightened...</p><p></p><p>If司慕白had taken action himself...</p><p></p><p>As a divine nature cultivator, Li Che had no confidence.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there was someone to obstruct him, but... whether there was someone behind the Ox Demon, he was the clearest.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was just a lonely individual.</p><p></p><p>"Who is helping me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly puzzled, but this was not the focus of his attention.</p><p></p><p>The focus was that he had obtained an extremely important piece of information from Xu You.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the snowflakes drifting in the sky, Li Che's gaze was pensive.</p><p></p><p>"司慕白... has been seriously injured, huh..."</p>

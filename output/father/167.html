        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Nirvana Aperture between his eyebrows was slightly warm.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Pupils flickered in and out, the gaze they projected could penetrate the false and return to the true, seeing the purple qi that was being leisurely exhaled from the tip of the Purple Flame Snake Spear...</p><p></p><p>That purple qi, Li Che was not unfamiliar with!</p><p></p><p>When Xixia underwent the sect assessment, Zhang Qing was using the Spiritual Observation Formation to detect the talents of the spiritual children, and he could see this kind of purple qi! According to what Li Qingshan said, this was a manifestation of the spiritual children's innate spiritual talents, representing the potential and limit of each child's future cultivation of the Spiritual Dao. The higher the purple qi column, the greater the future potential.</p><p></p><p>And if the purple qi exceeded a hundred feet, it meant that this child's spiritual talent had surpassed the top-grade spiritual children and could reach the level of a spiritual prodigy! A prefecture city could encompass the surrounding cities, and there were about a dozen or so top-grade spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>Looking at a state city, there would be even more, about three or four prefecture cities, which meant that there could be dozens of top-grade spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>But spiritual prodigies could only produce one or two.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual prodigy in a prefecture city could be considered a once-in-a-generation talent! But Li Qingshan had told Li Che that at the level of a spiritual prodigy, their talents could still be differentiated, with a high and low distinction!</p><p></p><p>Just like the differentiation of spiritual children!</p><p></p><p>That is to say, spiritual prodigies could also be divided into top-grade spiritual prodigies and superior spiritual prodigies...</p><p></p><p>However, the Spiritual Observation Formation of the Spiritual Sect could only detect spiritual prodigies, and as long as it exceeded a hundred feet, it would be considered a spiritual prodigy, but the distinction between high and low spiritual prodigies would be difficult to determine.</p><p></p><p>"So... this is spiritual talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Belonging to the young prince Jie Haiwei?"</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Flame Snake Spear... this mythical weapon... actually extracted such a large strand of Jie Haiwei's spiritual talent?!"</p><p></p><p>After Li Che realized this, his heart was suddenly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He didn't peel the skin, but the tendons... were really extracted! Although it was not real tendons, the spiritual talent being peeled off, the damage... was not small either!</p><p></p><p>No wonder it is a mythical weapon...</p><p></p><p>Well done!</p><p></p><p>Li Che could not suppress the smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Pupils in his Nirvana Aperture flickered slightly, looking at the spiritual purple qi that was like a dragon, gradually merging into Xixia's body, being torn and devoured by Xixia's innate spiritual purple qi talent.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Xixia's greatly enhanced spiritual purple qi talent, his eyes couldn't help but shine brightly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how high Xixia's spiritual talent would reach if it was detected by a high-quality Spiritual Observation Formation?"</p><p></p><p>"It must have exceeded a hundred feet, but nine hundred feet... that's still a hundred feet, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it exceed a thousand feet, ten thousand feet?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>If the spiritual prodigy talent was even higher...</p><p></p><p>Could it directly reach the level of purple qi reaching the heavens? If that were the case, it would be truly terrifying...</p><p></p><p>In the world, is there such a spiritual prodigy? Li Che had a hard time imagining it, a spiritual prodigy with purple qi reaching the heavens, what kind of freak would that be...</p><p></p><p>"Daddy... you're bad!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia hurts, why are you smiling so happily?!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia stared wide-eyed, looking unbelievably at the smiling Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Is this really her own daddy?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xixia is really the one Li Che said he picked up from the trash heap?!</p><p></p><p>Daddy doesn't love Xixia anymore! Li Che's mouth twitched, hurriedly smoothing the corners of his mouth, trying to suppress the gradually uncontrollable smile...</p><p></p><p>This made Xixia's young mind suffer even more harm!</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and patted Xixia's head: "Okay, it's just a superficial wound, Xixia is going to become Xixia the Great's strong little girl... this little injury, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei really got the worse deal, didn't he? He got beaten up and had his spiritual talent stripped...</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's heart stirred slightly, Jie Haiwei's dragon-like purple eyes were able to stimulate the Fire Spear...</p><p></p><p>Could it be because the Third Prince and the Dragon Clan have an old grudge? So, it triggered a certain bond, stimulating this mythical weapon belonging to the Third Prince, automatically triggering and then helping Xixia subdue this evil dragon Jie Haiwei? Li Che felt the possibility was very high...</p><p></p><p>"So, to stimulate the mythical weapon... could I try to get some dragon blood and wave it in front of the Fire Spear?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a bold idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If the Fire Spear could be stimulated a few more times, Xixia's physical body at the Blood Boundary might be able to match his father, the Furnace Sect Master. This kind of thing to lay a good foundation for his daughter...</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally had to take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the blood of the young prince Jie Haiwei will work?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che hugged Xixia and began to drift off.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Great Slope, a clamor had erupted.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if it was going to blow the entire Golden Light Peak away.</p><p></p><p>The son of the Pacification King, the young prince Jie Haiwei, led a powerful sect master to forcefully enter the mountain, but in the one-on-one confrontation, he was subdued by Xixia!</p><p></p><p>He died before achieving his goal!</p><p></p><p>The upper and lower echelons of the Golden Light Sect were all greatly inspired! Because... this was truly inspiring, it boosted their morale so much!</p><p></p><p>When a great sect master came to enter the mountain, his terrifying martial will that could almost block the river and split the mountain, like the great sun burning the sky, made people feel oppressed and almost hopeless.</p><p></p><p>When all the disciples could not see anyone who could stand up...</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Golden Light Sect naturally felt extremely resentful and angry! It was like endless dark clouds rolling in, crushing the city, almost reaching the sky above the city in its oppressive darkness!</p><p></p><p>But the more oppressive the darkness, the more it was torn and shattered, revealing the light that illuminated the world, the more their body and mind would feel refreshed!</p><p></p><p>Their pores were expanding with a refreshing feeling! Even if it was not them who defeated the young prince Jie Haiwei, these disciples of the Golden Light Sect were still extremely happy and comfortable!</p><p></p><p>"Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia the Great!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia the Great!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the surrounding spiritual children had already praised Xixia to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Because Xixia often claimed that she would become Xixia the Great in the future, so these children directly called her Xixia the Great! Since Xixia liked to hear it, they loved to call her that! Focusing on spoiling her!</p><p></p><p>These little radish heads, their faces all flushed red, bouncing and jumping, their eyes visibly burning with fanaticism and admiration! Li Che even saw a few little boys with adoring looks in their eyes! Tsk... where did these little rascals come from!</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, not learning good things, learning to admire others! Li Che swept a glance at a few unfamiliar little boys, deeply imprinting their faces in his mind.</p><p></p><p>As a father, his vigilance against these little rascals was always at the highest level!</p><p></p><p>He had to take a good look, to see if these little rascals had the audacity to ride the ghost fire in the future! Li Che was vigilant, but he still put Xixia down and let her play and show off with her little friends.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, being called out, was also beaming with joy, even forgetting the big matter of her father not loving her.</p><p></p><p>With her hands on her hips, chest puffed out, she was like a child king, gradually losing herself in the chants of "Xixia the Great" from the group of spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>"That little prince's bet hasn't been fulfilled yet, I'll bring him here to be my servant someday, and let you all see!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia said with her hands on her hips.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty was stuffing buns back into his mouth, his eyes full of speechlessness.</p><p></p><p>"This Xixia... she's done for."</p><p></p><p>"Jie Haiwei's son was beaten up like this... can Jie Haiwei tolerate it? Can Jie Haiwei's dragon mother tolerate it?"</p><p></p><p>The little fatty shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Miss Cloud's extremely beautiful eyes glanced at Zhou Peng the little fatty for a moment, and she snorted: "So what?"</p><p></p><p>"Jie Haiwei has been bullied to this extent, and they still can't retaliate?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia dared to stand up, at least... she is a hero!"</p><p></p><p>"She's so cool!"</p><p></p><p>Miss Cloud's words seemed a bit angry, but her voice was still as melodious as a warbler.</p><p></p><p>Then she turned and walked towards Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty's bun even fell out of his mouth, and he was completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>He rushed over, crying.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Cloud, I was wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia the Great is the most awesome, Xixia the Great is the most invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Chao, Gong Yuan, and Gong Yang were about to go over to congratulate Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>They burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yang covered his mouth and laughed: "Yuan, look at him, he wants to be a dog!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Wang Kuyu were there, the two Spiritual Element Perfected Ones' powerful presence directly forced the great sect master Xue Dumu to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo thanked the deputy Luo Yao of the City Heavenly Monitor.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for what? There's no need for such things between us?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao glanced at Nan Liehuo with a somewhat complex expression, and there was even a trace of anger in his brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm not helping you, I'm helping Li Che!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to get close to me! I don't know you!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao said, waving his sleeve and turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was suddenly dazed, did the Sect Master and Deputy Luo know each other? Nan Liehuo couldn't help but chuckle: "After all these years, you're still as aloof as ever..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao was immediately annoyed: "Who are you calling aloof?"</p><p></p><p>"All these years have passed, and you haven't even been able to break through to the Spiritual Element, and you haven't even been able to condense your spiritual soul... I'm disappointed, you know!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao frowned, glaring at Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo couldn't help but burst out laughing, his laughter carrying a hint of comfort.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao felt that Nan Liehuo now had no hope of catching up to him.</p><p></p><p>So he was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But considering that they were once peers as spiritual prodigies, competing against each other at the "Spiritual Awakening Assembly" in the City, Luo Yao still stood out to help Nan Liehuo this time, shielding him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as Xue Dumu said, as the deputy of the City Heavenly Monitor, Luo Yao had no need to get involved in this mess, and would have stood on the opposite side of the Pacification King Jie Molie.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at these strong ones who all had relationships and interactions with each other, his heart was also bewildered.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood that these people... had all once been young.</p><p></p><p>"As for how this incident will turn out, we'll have to wait and see for a while, maybe we'll have to wait until the 'Temple God Resonance' assembly before we can know the attitude of the young prince Jie Haiwei."</p><p></p><p>"As for Xixia wanting Jie Haiwei to be her servant, that's not going to happen, the other party won't accept it, most likely they will just play dead and wait for the Temple God Resonance to start."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo solemnly nodded, a glint of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia this time has completely ruined the young prince Jie Haiwei's face."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I really didn't expect this girl to perform so excellently, it's truly impressive..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao's gaze fell on the distant Xixia, who was surrounded by the children, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo stroked his beard and smiled: "That's because, look at whose disciple she is..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao coldly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"So, I brought my disciple here, and this Temple God Resonance, let's just take it as my last competition with you, comparing our disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo was taken aback, shaking his head with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>This guy, how can he still not give up?</p><p></p><p>Li Che listened to their conversation and couldn't help but think of that Tang Ren, turning his head to look, his face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>This Tang Ren had actually gathered around Xixia, also shouting "Xixia the Great", his little face flushed red, his expression and demeanor changing.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Che's alarm bells ring.</p><p></p><p>This Xixia girl... every time she shows off, she has to gain a yellow-haired one, doesn't she?! Luo Yao also silently watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt a bit like taking back what he said to Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The news of the young prince Jie Molie's failed mountain entry spread quickly in the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>That mountain entry ceremony was grand in scale.</p><p></p><p>Led by the great sect master, it shook the entire city, but in the end it ended in a dramatic way.</p><p></p><p>The young prince Jie Molie was actually beaten up and pinned to the ground by the little disciple just recently accepted by Nan Liehuo, and was beaten until his face was swollen and bruised!</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the great sect master present, the young prince might not even be able to leave the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>How tragic! The remaining four major families of the Golden Light Prefecture were all silent, they also did not expect that Jie Haiwei would be defeated.</p><p></p><p>There is also a gap between spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>But this gap, should be the gap between Xixia and the young prince, right?</p><p></p><p>A spiritual child from the small Feilei City, and a renowned prince heir with the bloodline of a Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>These two are not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Prefecture was shaken, the news rolled on.</p><p></p><p>However, the various forces were also smart, suppressing the news and not overly publicizing this incident.</p><p></p><p>City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai tightly sealed the doors of the City Lord's Mansion, his expression serious and unsightly.</p><p></p><p>He did not go to the Golden Light Peak, because everyone knew of his enmity with Nan Liehuo, so Su Huai did not go.</p><p></p><p>But Su Huai never thought that the young prince's mountain entry this time would fail, and he was definitely able to dampen the spirit of the Golden Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"That brat... how could she have done it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The great sect master Xue Dumu, with his single arm flying, sat coldly in the courtyard, his blood and qi surging, his killing intent boiling.</p><p></p><p>Since returning from the Golden Light Peak, the young prince had shut himself in the room and not taken a single step out.</p><p></p><p>This made Xue Dumu's heart somewhat unsettled, could it be that he was left with some psychological shadow? This made the Prince...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How would he see him?</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's heart kept sinking, along with the oppressive atmosphere in the courtyard, which kept rising.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's expression changed, feeling a bit oppressed, the might of the Grand Master was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until the temple deity resonance is over... At this juncture, if that little girl is harmed, the Imperial Prince's side will have an excuse to stop this temple deity resonance assembly, and the purpose of the young prince's visit this time will be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that Grand Master Xue Dufu planned to directly use thunderous means to grab that girl Li Nuanxi, or even kill her.</p><p></p><p>That would ruin everything.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu glanced at him and said coldly, "Trying to grab that girl is not an easy task, with the two True Immortals of the Deities protecting her, how can it be so easy to get her?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu stopped halfway through his sentence and did not continue.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's heart stirred, he knew the young prince must have another trump card.</p><p></p><p>But he did not ask further.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about it after the temple deity resonance is over..."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is to ensure that the young prince can obtain the inheritance in the temple deity resonance."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu nodded and turned to look at the tightly closed room.</p><p></p><p>This matter...</p><p></p><p>For the young prince, it is a blow, but if he can get through this hurdle...</p><p></p><p>The young prince's mentality will undergo a transformation, perhaps developing a tenacious character, which is extremely important for future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master wants to refine his own martial dao will, which is closely related to his mentality.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room.</p><p></p><p>The young prince Ji Haiwei was frantically grabbing his own hair, his purple eyes were already eerie, constantly flickering.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were disheveled, his hair was messy, and his complexion was pale.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the bed, his whole mentality was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Because... he found that his divine purple qi, seemed to have been cut off by a large portion...</p><p></p><p>His divine purple qi talent had fallen!  "How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to absorb Li Nuanxi's divine purple qi, why... why is this so?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Li Nuanxi also has the power to absorb divine purple qi?</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei was extremely frantic, the more he thought about it, the more confused he became.</p><p></p><p>Anger, redness, unwillingness, shame and other emotions surged in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just a five-year-old child, unable to control his emotions.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with tears, his lips trembling, the pride he had just gained had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>The low roar came from the young prince's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Like a child who was highly praised and spoiled every day, after receiving a beating, he went crazy.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He stabilized his emotions.</p><p></p><p>"That girl... also has a bloodline talent?"</p><p></p><p>"My father said that the strange temple around the temple is born with divine children, cannot be underestimated... Now I have indeed witnessed it."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"I still have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei suddenly raised his head, his purple eyes were filled with bloodiness and madness.</p><p></p><p>His delicate face was filled with craziness.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi..."</p><p></p><p>"I like her so much!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The young prince's mountain worship ended like this.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue carried Nuanxi back to the small courtyard of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master's mountain worship, the entire Divine Sect had a sense of it, Zhang Ya and Old Chen naturally also sensed it, and the hearts of the two could not help but be suspended.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the intact Nuanxi come back, Zhang Ya finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Nuanxi, quick! Mother takes a look at you to see if you are injured..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hurriedly called out.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi ran over with her little short legs.</p><p></p><p>She raised her little fists and said pitifully, "Mother, look, Nuanxi almost got a scrape, it hurts so much! Huh? How come the injury is all healed..."</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi ran halfway, seeing her chubby and tender fists, suddenly felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Then she didn't care, opened her big mouth, and burrowed into Zhang Ya's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, Nuanxi is so scared, Nuanxi wants to eat meat to comfort herself! Want braised pork, stir-fried shrimp, sour and spicy ribs..."</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi rubbed her head in Zhang Ya's embrace, saying sadly and happily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the little girl rattling off the dish names so smoothly, Zhang Ya's heart was finally completely relieved.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue simply described the situation.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya then tenderly rubbed Nuanxi's head.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi put her hands on her hips, full of vigor: "Mother, you didn't see how majestic and powerful Nuanxi the Great Emperor was today!"</p><p></p><p>"That little eel, in front of Nuanxi the Great Emperor, couldn't even stir up a wave!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi held her head high, excited and proud.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya smiled gently and went to make delicious food for Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Li Yue went into the study.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth chessboard trembled and expanded, enveloping the entire study room.</p><p></p><p>His gentle expression from the day completely sank.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince Ji Haiwei..."</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master Xue Dufu!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes flashed with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Intimidation! An extremely strong sense of threat! This feeling was just like the one brought by the Infant Demon when he was in Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>But the Li Yue now is different.</p><p></p><p>He is no longer the weak wood carver in Fei Lei City, who could only rely on Xu Ji's wood carving shop to protect his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry up and develop the Guanyin Lotus main battle array..."</p><p></p><p>"Only in this way can I threaten the Grand Master."</p><p></p><p>"Also, my Dao fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], can also try to upgrade, just lacking a little bit..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes opened and closed, summarizing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He has taken down the Ghost Temple, and killed two Silver Radiance Curse Copper Corpse-level Seventh Element lower-rank Corpse Demon Envoys.</p><p></p><p>For Li Yue, his overall strength has gained a considerable boost.</p><p></p><p>But the advancement of [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra]...</p><p></p><p>Still lacks a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Just a little bit.</p><p></p><p>"If I use the Golden King Ascending Pavilion state... can I fight the Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>The battle should be able to barely hold on...</p><p></p><p>Unless he squeezes out the full power of a temple deity divine force from a Heaven King chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes flickered, estimating in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But just one battle...</p><p></p><p>Not enough.</p><p></p><p>Today, Xue Dufu yelled at his daughter three times, Li Yue recorded it all in his heart, in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't take action then.</p><p></p><p>But as a father, he should still get revenge for his daughter.</p><p></p><p>You dare to yell at my daughter?</p><p></p><p>I'll twist your head off! Ruthlessness surged in Li Yue's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also knows that after this incident, the young prince Ji Haiwei will be disgraced, and his divine talent has also been extracted, he will definitely not easily let Nuanxi go.</p><p></p><p>After the temple deity resonance assembly is over...</p><p></p><p>He is afraid he will target Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue naturally will not allow such a thing to happen, he needs to be prepared!  "First upgrade the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao fruit!"</p><p></p><p>"Just lacking a little bit..."</p><p></p><p>"Also... I still have a Monkey King Mask, which is also a divine weapon... If I fully open my mind and wear the Monkey King Mask... can I fight the Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King Mask is too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>When Li Yue obtained it before, he tried to wear it for a third, and felt the terrifying will trying to assault his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>So, he is still a little wary.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue believes that with the Monkey King Mask on, he will definitely become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Steady a bit... First upgrade the Dao fruit!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue raised his head, and his whole body seemed to be thundering along with his will.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Yue pinched his two fingers together, tearing open the air, and took out a bamboo hat, a black robe, and a cute ox-faced mask from the Qiankun space.</p><p></p><p>Putting the mask on his face, his flesh "boomed" and swelled up.</p><p></p><p>Invisible air waves roared and dissipated in the room.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, grasping the Fei Lei chess piece, his figure disappeared from the study.</p><p></p><p>Only the [Painting Immortal] clone was left sitting at the desk.</p><p></p><p>One knife, one knife.</p><p></p><p>Carefully carving the divine monkey wood sculpture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night wind howled, and the heavy snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue transformed into the Ox Demon, wearing a bamboo hat and covering his face with a mask.</p><p></p><p>His black robe fluttered in the wind and snow, his sleeves like knives, shattering the flying snow.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and tapped his brow.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit throbbed, suddenly forming a huge Heaven and Earth chessboard, enveloping all directions.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense floated in it, flicking his fingers, the untainted heart chess pieces frantically collided with the Seventh Element Corpse Curse parent-child seal under refinement.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue moved the [Monkey King Mask] next to the Seventh Element Corpse Curse parent-child seal.</p><p></p><p>Using momentum to suppress the seal is a move Li Yue is good at.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he used the dark golden Heaven King chess piece to suppress the child seal, and now he is using the Monkey King Mask to suppress the parent seal.</p><p></p><p>It can speed up the refinement!</p><p></p><p>"Once the Seventh Element Corpse Curse parent-child seal is completely refined, the range that can be detected will be much wider."</p><p></p><p>"But now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Now, what he can do is to search in a carpet-like manner, looking for the powerhouses of the Corpse Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue believes that the strongholds of the Corpse Demon Sect in the Golden Light Prefecture City should not be just the Heart Monkey Temple, but there should be other strongholds as well.</p><p></p><p>He wants to fight, naturally the Corpse Demon Sect is the best choice.</p><p></p><p>He can fight freely and quickly improve!</p><p></p><p>If he can kill another Silver Radiance Curse Copper Corpse...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue will have the confidence to completely upgrade [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] to LV4!</p><p></p><p>Undergo a different transformation!</p><p></p><p>At that time, with the enhancement of the innate talent, Li Yue will also have the courage to face the Grand Master directly! Of course, Li Yue is not aimlessly searching in a carpet-like manner, he has the Seventh Element Corpse Curse seal to assist him, and also has the Heaven and Earth chessboard.</p><p></p><p>First investigate the suspicious targets.</p><p></p><p>"The five major sects of the Golden Light Prefecture... Golden Crack Gate, Bamboo Forest Academy, Observation Pavilion, Heart Monkey Temple, and Sand Scorpion Forest."</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Monkey Temple may be a stronghold of the Corpse Demon Sect, what about the others?"</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow blurred for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The black robe fluttered.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue appeared in front of a academy, the Heaven and Earth chessboard enveloped and expanded, encompassing the entire academy, and then trembled the Corpse Curse seal, spreading the death qi ripples for exploration.</p><p></p><p>Bamboo Forest Academy is located a few miles outside the Golden Light Prefecture City, under Li Yue's perception, there is only a trace of Ninth Yang Corpse Curse seal's death qi feedback.</p><p></p><p>There are obviously also members of the Corpse Demon Sect hidden in the academy, but not many...</p><p></p><p>"The academy's Hao Ran is upright, the Corpse Demon Sect really can't easily corrupt it, having two or three Ninth Yang positions is all the corrupt scholars who were exploited..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The small fry of the Ninth Yang Corpse Curse seal, he is not interested in them now, nor does he want to waste time.</p><p></p><p>Tipping his toes, the wind and snow rolled over.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Observation Pavilion, located on the banks of the Nine Dragon River, occupies an extremely large area.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, just like Bamboo Forest Academy, although there are Corpse Demon Sect infiltrations, but not many.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon once again disappeared in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Golden Crack Gate.</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Yue landed.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tearing open the air, the Thousand Miles Divine Communication Mirror immediately trembled...</p><p></p><p>Behind the mask, his eyes were calm and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Crack Gate..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue did not feel strange in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this force, Li Yue has always had doubts, the enemy Qin Yuqing he killed when he first entered the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Seemed to be related to the Golden Crack Gate.</p><p></p><p>And Qin Yuqing, also seemed to have some connection with the Corpse Demon Sect...</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Miles Divine Communication Mirror has some feedback within a certain range, indicating that there is also a mirror holder nearby...</p><p></p><p>The other party has obviously also sensed it.</p><p></p><p>On the divine communication mirror, a "Who?" message was sent out.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue put away the Thousand Miles Divine Communication Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth chessboard instantly expanded, the death qi ripples like a tidal wave, rolling and sweeping towards the quiet and low-key Golden Crack Gate! Inside the Golden Crack Gate.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, an extremely dense death qi aura surged, like a death gas cloud! The entire Golden Crack Gate, in terms of the density of the death qi...</p><p></p><p>Even surpassed the Heart Monkey Temple!</p><p></p><p>Behind the mask, his eyes gradually became cold.</p><p></p><p>The death qi aura is not much, but it is extremely dense...</p><p></p><p>A few degrees denser than the Xuanli of the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>Clearing the evil people of the Corpse Demon Sect, and can also improve the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao fruit...</p><p></p><p>Two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Smiled.</p><p></p><p>Raised his hand, tore open the air and took out a spiritual wood from the Qiankun space with his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife flew, in three strokes.</p><p></p><p>A black mask that seemed to be burning like the rolling flames of hell was formed in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Since I need to use the temple deity divine force of the Monkey Deity Temple...</p><p></p><p>Then naturally...</p><p></p><p>I should change the mask.</p><p></p><p>Spreading his fingers like a fan, he took off the Ox Demon mask on his face...</p><p></p><p>Raising his head, his eyes were bright.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's lips curled into an eerie smile.</p><p></p><p>Slowly placing the Hell Monkey mask on his face.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes, his pupils burst into golden flames!

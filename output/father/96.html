        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! Cao Guang barely had time to react before the terrifying force poured down on him like a raging storm.</p><p></p><p>The peak of his mysterious meridian bones even emitted sounds of being overburdened.</p><p></p><p>The python tendons snapped, the tiger bones cracked, and a blood mist dispersed in the air, washed away by the rain! He was slammed onto the long street, his back sliding across the ground, tearing open the accumulated water, and the blue bricks on the ground were crushed into powder, leaving a pile of stacked broken bricks and mud!</p><p></p><p>Scorching hot air permeated the area, emanating from the high temperature caused by the friction between his back's flesh and blood and the ground.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's head drooped, with blood and rainwater dripping from his hair.</p><p></p><p>How could this be...</p><p></p><p>So strong?!</p><p></p><p>Is this the explosion after harnessing the temple god's power?</p><p></p><p>It's truly so powerful... But this strength should have belonged to him, he had been preparing for so many years, hosting the Thousand Buddha Feast, and in the end...</p><p></p><p>Somehow, the temple god's power had ended up benefiting the Ox Demon instead. Cao Guang tried to mobilize his own divine nature, but the temple god had already sold him out... He could not rely on it at all.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound, a towering and robust figure with a devil's inverted triangle on his back, black and vigorous hair falling to his waist like a cloak, appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The unceasing release of the temple god's divine nature pressure made Cao Guang's divine foundation and divine nature seem to be frozen.</p><p></p><p>He could not mobilize them at all.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang took a deep breath, as if with the struggling power of life, making his blood and qi circulate, even though his sternum was already shattered, and his internal organs were showing signs of being broken, he still gritted his teeth, swallowing blood, and sprang up from the ground, straining to open his eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Thunderbolts split the gloomy hanging clouds, coiling snakes of lightning, the heavens were angered, and the rain poured down heavily.</p><p></p><p>Visibility became extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the surging and scorching blood and qi, the rising hazy heat in the cold winter made everything extremely blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The roar burst from Cao Guang's throat.</p><p></p><p>The steaming blood and qi instantly tore open the haze, and the cute ox-faced mask now appeared so ferocious and demonic!</p><p></p><p>Like the ox-headed ghost in the underworld responsible for taking lives! "Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's roar became softer, and he stared at this scene in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The will to fight that had just surged through his body suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that figure with flowing black hair like a waterfall, a muscular and radiant physique, and golden smoke emanating from the eyes behind the mask.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably...</p><p></p><p>He lost his fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of the time when he had set out full of vigor to the Golden Light Prefecture, only to be slapped by a divine foundation near-collapse and his bones shattered by a young genius of a divine sect, due to the latter's bad mood.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang swayed, soaked by the rain, he had sacrificed everything for his own advancement. But in the end...</p><p></p><p>This was the result he got.</p><p></p><p>This was the one who had ruined so many of his plans. His heart was unsettled, unable to accept it calmly. He now wanted to know, or rather, wanted to see the face behind this Ox Demon mask...</p><p></p><p>Who is it?</p><p></p><p>Is it...</p><p></p><p>Really that muddy-legged fellow!</p><p></p><p>"Can I see it?" </p><p></p><p>There was a hint of hope and curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the Ascending the Tower stance, his physical body growing much taller. Cao Guang was after all a martial cultivator at the Mysterious Meridian realm, and although he was also robust, he was still very small in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Looking down from above, the eyes behind the Ox Demon mask emitted golden smoke, coldly gazing at Cao Guang.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate calmness brought by the Ascending the Tower stance made him completely indifferent to Cao Guang's request.</p><p></p><p>You think you're worthy enough to make me take off the mask? His five fingers suddenly clenched, and at that moment, countless airflows and rainwater were gripped together, as if the surrounding air was emitting a whistling sound, as if it had been compressed into a ball!</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A scarlet tiger emerged from behind the Ox Demon, roaring at the heavens and earth, its claws and fangs bared.</p><p></p><p>White Tiger Raging Wind Fist! Transcendence!</p><p></p><p>However, it should now be called the Scarlet Tiger, as Li Che's inner qi had turned scarlet, surging like burning fire! "You?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang did not expect the Ox Demon to be so ruthless. He had already given up resistance, yet the Ox Demon still did not want to fulfill his last wish.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to know...</p><p></p><p>Whether the Ox Demon was that muddy-legged fellow or not! Cao Guang roared, crossing his arms in front of his chest, but the terrifying punch that slammed down was unstoppable, shattering all his flesh and bones! Boom, an explosive sound! Cao Guang's entire body exploded on the spot, his flesh and blood flying, scattered into several pieces.</p><p></p><p>His skin was stained with blood, and the tadpole-like characters could still be seen wriggling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers, and instantly, countless silver threads sprang up from the ground, floating wildly, appearing soft like spider webs dancing in the wind.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, they were vibrating at an extremely high frequency, unleashing a terrifying cutting force!</p><p></p><p>Poof poof poof poof!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's scattered flesh and the resentful, humiliated, and angry head were instantly cut into even finer pieces.</p><p></p><p>Delivering the final blow.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring Cao Guang was dead beyond any doubt.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then steadily withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>The cold rain fell, splashing on the ground, mixing with the bright red blood, rippling in circles.</p><p></p><p>"The temple god... is a bit of a coward."</p><p></p><p>"Just a temple god of the Ten Mysterious Temples, it's understandable."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, and six more temple god divine nature chess pieces were still floating in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He had only used one.</p><p></p><p>He could have even done without using that one.</p><p></p><p>Because when that temple god saw the seven divine nature chess pieces on display, it simply fled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che estimated that the spiritual essence of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Embryo Temple God could still be squeezed to condense two more pieces.</p><p></p><p>Seven versus two, so the temple god ran away.</p><p></p><p>Just as Cao Guang had said.</p><p></p><p>The pretentious temple god got beaten up, and it was all Cao Guang's fault.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang was beaten to death, too tragic.</p><p></p><p>But... he deserved it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked towards the direction of the Citadel, no, it should now be called the Mysterious Temple, not the Citadel.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple in the city... </p><p></p><p>Soon, Feilei City will become a dead city.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>Li Che could not do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he could do was to drain the temple god's divine nature, preventing it from spreading quickly, giving the citizens of Feilei City some time to evacuate.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the scattered flesh on the ground, Li Che raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Separation Technique! Hm? Li Che's eyes slightly brightened, performing the Thousand Separation Technique under the Ascending the Tower stance... </p><p></p><p>The two divine techniques seamlessly overlapped without any conflict.</p><p></p><p>He even...</p><p></p><p>did not need to touch the corpse, the divine nature from Cao Guang's shattered body was drawn out and condensed into chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Dao Fruits can be combined with each other.</p><p></p><p>And the embryonic forms of divine techniques can also be fused?</p><p></p><p>There is still a lot of room for development.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's strength was not bad, at the Divine Foundation Realm, but unfortunately, he was betrayed by the temple god, and his Divine Foundation was perfectly countered.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even with the Ascending the Tower stance, it might have taken Li Che some time to kill Cao Guang.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Foundation Realm, in total, condensed eighteen chess pieces of the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine nature, all of which were at the Divine Foundation Realm quality, far superior to the Divine Foundation Initial Realm in both divine nature quality and quantity.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, all the divine nature chess pieces were absorbed into the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura gradually subsided, the long hair that had grown to his waist also retracted, and his towering physique returned to a slender form.</p><p></p><p>He faintly sensed some fluctuations in his blood and qi, with a slight stiffness in his muscles, like the pain of lactic acid buildup, indicating that the use of the "Ascending the Tower" stance did have some impact on his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"The temple god has run away, it should have returned to the Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"If the temple god can run away, can it also run away from the temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, finding Cao Guang's Spatial Orb in the pool of blood, but now was not the time to investigate it, so he stored it in the Spatial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the direction of the Citadel's Mysterious Temple, the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" was activated, his aura completely concealed, as if he had merged into the wind and rain, lightly stepping and disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>To cut the weeds, one must remove the roots.</p><p></p><p>The Citadel...</p><p></p><p>There seems to be a Cao Qingyuan as well.</p><p></p><p>This is Cao Guang's root.</p><p></p><p>It must be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Level 3 [Dragon Elephant Golden Warrior] further enhanced Li Che's ability to conceal his presence.</p><p></p><p>However, when he arrived in front of the Citadel, he saw Li Qingshan wielding a ram's horn hammer, pressing down on two experts and beating them.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing a cat-faced mask, was naturally recognized by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>As for the two experts who were constantly coughing blood, one wearing a big nose mask and the other a big eye mask...</p><p></p><p>The divine nature they emanated was quite peculiar, not the seven emotions, but the six desires.</p><p></p><p>Their physical bodies were robust, exuding a dark iron-like color, extremely resilient, but they could not withstand Li Qingshan's ram's horn hammer for long. One of them had his chest smashed, exposing his nearly shattered internal organs, with a reddish-green blood spilling out.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Li Che's mask flickered with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the [Desire Surpasses Corpse Flesh Guanyin] held by Cao He, a chill flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect... Will they target my Xixie as well?"</p><p></p><p>"An exceptional spirit child, Cao Guang missed out, so he sold her to other Corpse God Sect disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was clear, vaguely understanding the reasons.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Curse imprint contained in the wooden sculpture of the Desire Surpasses Corpse Flesh Guanyin was currently suppressed in the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Two Corpse God Sect experts, it seems Cao Guang had close ties with the Corpse God Sect, the situation in the city is not safe..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This Cao Guang is truly rotten to the core!" </p><p></p><p>Li Che grew angrier the more he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>With a cold glint in his eyes, since Cao Guang wanted to kill his daughter, then he would kill Cao Guang and his son! With a light step, Li Che concealed his aura and moved away from the battlefield, circling around to enter the Chengzhu Manor.</p><p></p><p>The Chengzhu Manor was quite large, although the octagonal eaves pavilion had become a ruin, transformed into a strange temple.</p><p></p><p>That strange temple sat atop it, with cracks like vines expanding, but the Chengzhu Manor still had other buildings, although they had been shattered by the aftershocks.</p><p></p><p>He entered the strange temple first.</p><p></p><p>Everything was quiet and in disarray, the pungent stench of blood assaulting his nostrils, causing Li Che's body to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>This blood... </p><p>It was the blood of spirit children, the blood of thousands of infants...</p><p>How many parents' tears.</p><p></p><p>"Filthy thing, no better than a pig or dog," Li Che muttered.</p><p></p><p>He did not find Cao Qingyuan in the strange temple, Li Che's brow furrowed slightly before relaxing.</p><p></p><p>His figure leapt onto the altar, walking up to the carved wooden deity of the temple.</p><p></p><p>He slapped the bald head of the temple deity with his palm, unleashing a powerful suction force with his finger techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he could hear the temple deity's unwilling and furious roar.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che paid it no heed, it was just a coward, and he promptly drained the deity dry, extracting the last two chess pieces of the deity's spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>The entire strange temple fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>The head of the wooden deity statue suddenly exploded, shattering into countless wooden shards.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che knew that he had not destroyed the strange temple, the entire temple structure had not disappeared, indicating that the temple deity was not dead.</p><p></p><p>It would slowly recover.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not know how to destroy a temple... that was a specialized skill only mastered by the Temple Suppression Division and high-level experts.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a mouthful of foul air.</p><p></p><p>He looked deeply at the strange temple.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that a strange temple of the Nine Luminaries or above can even form a 'Strange Citadel', which can trap people inside, unable to escape, and the temple deity can move freely within the Strange Citadel, with extremely powerful strength..."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this strange temple had not yet transformed into a Nine Luminaries strange temple, and had not released a "Strange Citadel".</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the common people of Feilei City... would have suffered greatly.</p><p></p><p>Now, the common people at least still had a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Cao Qingyuan is not here, where has he gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he in hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Under the bovine mask, Li Che's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit pounded rapidly, and the next moment, the heavenly and earthly chessboard thundered down, enveloping all directions.</p><p></p><p>In his lofty Chess Saint eyes, nothing could escape.</p><p></p><p>With a light step, Li Che drifted out of the temple like a gust of wind, merging into the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan rushed out of the Chengzhu Manor treasury, his hands full of the Qiankun Jade, his masked face looking extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>The Cao family... is finished! Second Master Cao He was beaten to a pulp by Li Qingshan, and it seems there was a mishap with his father Cao Guang's temple deity ritual.</p><p></p><p>What could he, Cao Qingyuan, do? He couldn't rely on anyone, he could only collect the good things from the treasury and prepare to flee.</p><p></p><p>Go to the prefectural city, and seek refuge with his mother's family! Cao Qingyuan was able to stand out from the original four young masters of Feilei City and be the first to break through to the Spirit Base, which had a lot to do with his mother's family in the prefectural city.</p><p></p><p>His mother's family was a prominent clan in the prefectural city! When his father Cao Guang went to the prefectural city to study and cultivate, it was relying on his good looks and decent talents that attracted his mother, causing her to marry down.</p><p></p><p>Although his mother's relationship with his father Cao Guang is now extremely poor, to the point that his mother has practically divorced his father, but... what does that have to do with him, Cao Qingyuan?</p><p></p><p>The child is innocent! Rustling...</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were like pillars, the lightning snakes rolling in the dark clouds, occasionally flashing with electric light, illuminating the dim sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan carried a wide-bladed精 iron long sword, wearing black clothes and a mask to prevent being recognized, his entire body's aura suppressed, hugging the wall as he walked.</p><p></p><p>As long as he got out of Feilei City, he would be safe.</p><p></p><p>Feilei City is finished.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't even bother to check whether his father is alive or dead...</p><p></p><p>The reason his mother still let him stay in Feilei City was just for this Thousand Buddha Carving Feast that his father had been planning for years? Now that the scheme has failed, he, Cao Qingyuan, should also fly away on his own.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Chengzhu Manor, a terrifying ram's horn shadow loomed, falling down with a thunderous explosion, the powerful master's true qi raging and surging.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan shrank his neck, not needing to guess to know that the one wearing the cat-faced mask was definitely Li Qingshan, the martial arts master, the fierce person ranked on the Spirit Base list of Cloud State!</p><p></p><p>With only a fraction of spiritual essence, he was already so terrifying! Detour and walk around!</p><p></p><p>After all, he was carrying the entire treasury of the Chengzhu Manor, with too many good things inside.</p><p></p><p>There were things that could even make the high-ranking experts on the Spirit Base list covet. So as long as he could escape the city and get out alive, relying on these things, even if he didn't gain much benefit from this Thousand Buddha Carving Feast.</p><p></p><p>He could still live very comfortably.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the prefectural city, he would even have the capital to curry favor with the powerful figures on his mother's side, and even... have a chance to break through to the Spirit Base Realm!</p><p></p><p>What he couldn't get from the Thousand Buddha Carving Feast, the treasury gave him compensation!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly...</p><p></p><p>That good thing in the treasury...</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's breathing quickened at this thought.</p><p></p><p>He quickly gripped the mid-grade Qiankun Jade, activating the concealment technique, and hugged the darkness to walk along the wall!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan felt a bone-chilling cold, his entire body's hair almost standing on end in an instant!</p><p></p><p>In the darkness he was hugging the wall, a cute bovine mask suddenly appeared, followed by a thunderous long spear, hissing like a dragon snake as it thrust towards him.</p><p></p><p>The air was pierced by the spear, forming a hole as if it had been punctured!  Countless raindrops connected to the spear shaft exploded, forming a dense mist!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>How could this thing be here?!</p><p></p><p>But Cao Qingyuan's reaction was also extremely fast, his eyes bulging, this Ox Demon's concealment technique was far superior to his!</p><p></p><p>He had been sneaking along the wall, yet this thing could still ambush him in the dark!</p><p></p><p>How did it find him?</p><p></p><p>Poof - the speed was too fast, the power too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>As soon as he tried to draw his long sword, it was knocked away by a spear strike, his entire arm holding the sword shattered, the skin bursting, the bones and tendons twisted grotesquely.</p><p></p><p>That power...</p><p>How could it be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>"Li Che!" </p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan didn't have time to think too much, the cold rain slapping his face, he panted heavily, even able to taste the blood in his throat!</p><p></p><p>He roared Li Che's name, intending to expose the Ox Demon's identity, to make him hesitate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But he was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was completely unmoved, like a soulless killing machine, a spear directly piercing through his chest.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force lifted his body, ramming him into the wall, instantly the wall caved in, radiating a spider web of cracks.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's spirit base had just barely risen from the back of his head.</p><p></p><p>Poof -</p><p></p><p>The scarlet spear, as if marked with blood patterns, suddenly withdrew, only to thrust down again.</p><p></p><p>Poof poof poof -</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's body was pinned to the wall like a target, the spear continuously stabbing him over eight times.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ji's Eight Consecutive Bone-Shattering Spear...</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's entire skeleton was shattered, his eyes wide with resentment...</p><p></p><p>But his breath had completely ceased.</p><p></p><p>He never understood until the end.</p><p></p><p>He had been so low-key, why was he still ambushed by the Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked indifferently at the dead Cao Qingyuan, placing his fingers on his face, while absorbing his spiritual essence, he also helped close his resentful eyes, letting him rest in peace.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt he was still quite kind.</p><p></p><p>After snatching the tightly gripped Qiankun Jade from Cao Qingyuan's hand, Li Che's thoughts stirred, this treasure... the Qiankun Jade must have good things inside!</p><p></p><p>But this wasn't the time to explore, after all, the treasury of the Chengzhu Manor... now belonged to the Li family.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carefully searched the body again, confirming he was penniless, then decisively pulled out his spear and left.</p><p></p><p>He did not go to assist Li Qingshan, because it was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Those two Corpse Deity Sect disciples were about to be hammered to death.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had one last thing to take care of.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xu Manor's main hall.</p><p></p><p>The dense scent of blood rolled on endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's head was splitting, his whole body trembling, he opened his eyes wide, forcibly coughing up the blood in his throat, almost vomiting.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You staggered to his feet, his vision gradually clearing.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the smell of death.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered Granduncle, Father Xu Nanming, and Elder Brother Xu He's sunken, seemingly twisted faces, as if they wanted to devour his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>No, they really wanted to eat his flesh and blood! Xu He had even prepared a bone-stripping knife! Xu You felt as if he had fallen into an icy abyss, his heart freezing cold.</p><p></p><p>When he finally regained full consciousness, the pungent smell of blood assaulted his nose, and he looked around the entire hall, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Father Xu Nanming had been beaten to death, and Xu He had also been killed.</p><p></p><p>Dead, they're all dead...</p><p></p><p>He saw the still boiling hot pot next to him, his expression unsure whether to grieve or rejoice.</p><p></p><p>He staggered to his feet.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Lightning flashed, thunder rumbled.</p><p></p><p>At the door.</p><p></p><p>A tall figure, wearing a bovine mask, stood quietly there.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The aftershock of the explosion swept through the dense winter forest, stirring up a raging wind.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a series of shockwaves were constantly colliding between the tree trunks, reverberating endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind swept through, driving the clothes, hair, falling snow, and leaves.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's entire body was burning with pain, his flesh and bones shattered by the powerful shockwaves and force generated from the terrifying hidden weapon's explosion. His internal organs were ruptured to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>He simply could not understand how this hidden weapon could possess such a horrifying explosive power!</p><p></p><p>During the explosion, the innate divine nature seemed to have been ignited, becoming agitated a thousandfold compared to normal. This turbulent and terrifying divine nature bombardment formed shockwaves that not only inflicted harm on his martial body, but also struck and impacted his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This was a dual-strike hidden weapon!</p><p></p><p>The Tangshi Mechanism is unparalleled under the heavens... </p><p></p><p>It truly lived up to its reputation.</p><p></p><p>But Wen Longshan racked his brain, yet could not figure out which specific Tangshi Mechanism this was? Such a terrifying destructive power... </p><p></p><p>It should at least rank among the top ten of the Tangshi Mechanisms, right? Surely...</p><p></p><p>It must already be renowned throughout the world, right?</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan involuntarily coughed up fresh blood from his mouth and nose.</p><p></p><p>His internal organs were shattered, and at the Grandmaster realm, it was not just about tempering the physique.</p><p></p><p>Refining the internal organs was also crucial.</p><p></p><p>When a supreme skill reaches great accomplishment and generates a trace of true intent, one can then proceed to infuse the true intent into the internal organs, refining them to make them unyielding and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating both internally and externally, without any flaws or gaps, only then would one have the qualifications to assault the Grand Grandmaster realm!</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's internal organs had long been tempered by the true intent of the Crimson Flame Divine Arrow.</p><p></p><p>But under this mechanism's bombardment, they had all suffered varying degrees of damage.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan knew that he would not survive.</p><p></p><p>Especially...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon in front of him was unnervingly steady.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the terrifying, almost freezing aura of power emanating from the Ox Demon, it made his soul nearly freeze, the oppressive divine nature pressure rendering him unable to even move.</p><p></p><p>That was... the Shrine Deity realm! Above the Golden Light Peak of the Divine Sect, likely within the Golden Divine Palace [the Seven Treasures Relic Pagoda], the divine nature of the Shrine Deity!  Wen Longshan let out a bitter laugh.</p><p></p><p>A lone snowflake fell solemnly onto his scorched, disheveled and blackened face, a chill spreading through him.</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan actually felt cold.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's voice was low.</p><p></p><p>"I've been afraid of pain since I was young... That's why I learned archery, so I could stand far away and shoot arrows to hurt people, without having to get up close and fight..."</p><p></p><p>"That was my original intention for learning archery..."</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's lips kept colliding, and he slowly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>Struggling to open his lone remaining eye, he looked at the Ox Demon in golden armor, with wild black hair, terrifying like a demonic deity.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"Gently."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Ox Demon mask, did not waste any words.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the Blizzard Gale Halberd immediately fell into his hand, the great halberd trembling.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping it across in a sudden motion!</p><p></p><p>Poofâ€”</p><p></p><p>Wen Longshan's head that feared pain was instantly sent flying, his expression still twisted in the ultimate agony.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"I'll be quick."</p><p></p><p>Abruptly flicking the Blizzard Gale Halberd to shake off the blood, he stored it away in his Spatial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The vertical eye beneath the Ox Demon mask suddenly opened wide!</p><p></p><p>Divine Ability... </p><p></p><p>Plucking the Stars Eye! It was as if a gaze solidified into reality shot out from the burning vertical eye in his brow.</p><p></p><p>One divine essence chess piece after another at the Divine Image Realm floated up.</p><p></p><p>The number... was a staggering ninety-two! Ninety-two Divine Image divine essence chess pieces! Exceeding ninety pieces meant that Wen Longshan's divine cultivation had already reached Divine Image Perfection, just one step away from stepping into the Primal Realm!  "A bountiful harvest!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the floating ninety-two divine essence chess pieces and chuckled as he collected them all.</p><p></p><p>After his Divine Ability Thousand Analyses Hand had advanced to Plucking the Stars, he no longer needed to activate the Ascending Towers to collect the divine essence chess pieces from the deceased's body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, aside from the Divine Image chess pieces, Li Che also unhesitatingly collected Wen Longshan's Spatial Jade and Divine Bow without any courtesy.</p><p></p><p>These were all things he, the Ox Demon, had obtained through his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Heavy snow was falling, the icy wind like blades.</p><p></p><p>The carriage was speeding rapidly along the snow-covered official road.</p><p></p><p>The spirited horses neighed.</p><p></p><p>Several spirited horses surrounded the carriage, the black-robed cultivators on them all with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shattering explosion sound echoed from the distance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far away, the rippling divine energy waves that spanned across were enough to startle even the demon-blooded demon horses pulling the carriage! The one-armed carriage driver on the carriage shaft, however, furrowed his brows as he looked towards the direction the divine energy shockwaves were surging from.</p><p></p><p>The carriage curtain was lifted.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince also seemed to have sensed something, walking out with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Granduncle Shu, has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>The aged and weathered-faced Shu Dufu, with his single arm, tugged on the reins, a grave expression appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>As the strong cultivator guarding the Young Prince, Shu Dufu did not want any unexpected incidents to occur.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are cultivators in battle, the divine energy waves... are very intense."</p><p></p><p>"But Old Master has never sensed such a turbulent divine nature before, what kind of cultivator's body can withstand and bear such divine nature?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... a Grand Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Dufu murmured.</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Prefecture... </p><p></p><p>A Grand Grandmaster?! His aged and murky eyes suddenly flashed with a keen light, like a freshly polished and gleaming long sword slicing through the void.</p><p></p><p>"Granduncle Shu, you should go take a look."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince stood with his hands behind his back, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master must prioritize ensuring the Young Prince's safety. Although the news of the Young Prince entering the Golden Light Prefecture city has just spread, one can't be sure there aren't ill-intentioned ones already lying in wait."</p><p></p><p>The old man spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince proudly smiled: "Granduncle Shu, rest assured, with my father the King's deterrence, there are not many ruffians daring to attack me.</p><p></p><p>They cannot withstand my father the King's wrath."</p><p></p><p>"My father is the Pacifying King, after all."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince was extremely proud, the snowy wind seemingly becoming more fervent.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then... the Young Prince shall wait."</p><p></p><p>Shu Dufu also knew that the King must have prepared some life-saving methods for the Young Prince.</p><p></p><p>There were many in this world who wanted to kill the Young Prince, but succeeding was far from easy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>He would return quickly.</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man stood up, lightly tapping his toes, instantly generating a ring of invisible shockwaves that tore through the swirling snow curtain.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood qi was like a true dragon undulating and roaring.</p><p></p><p>His speed was too fast, not leaving any footprints in the snow, but rather tyrannically trampling the snow.</p><p></p><p>With just a few steps, the snow on the ground would violently explode.</p><p></p><p>Countless snow mists were kicked up.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man soon charged into the dense forest, swift as lightning, his speed reaching the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The old man narrowed his eyes, his powerful vision allowing him to see, even from tens of miles away, a towering figure like a mountain in the forest.</p><p></p><p>In front of that figure, a headless corpse leaned against a tree trunk, powerless.</p><p></p><p>The rich and boiling blood was flowing unceasingly, melting the snow on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The armor pattern is that of a Cloud State Divine Guard Campus Sergeant, the Divine Arrow Sergeant Wen Longshan?"</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>With a boom, countless blood qi seemed to suddenly pile up on his back, violently exploding into shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>The entire person's speed was so fast it was like a thunderbolt!</p><p></p><p>Too fast! Swift as lightning, like the Heavenly Deity's roar!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the entire air seemed about to be crushed and exploded.</p><p></p><p>However, when the one-armed old man arrived, he found that the towering figure wearing a cute ox mask and straw hat had vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed old man landed.</p><p></p><p>His powerful blood qi, like a furnace, caused the entire forest's temperature to rise.</p><p></p><p>The old man calmly looked at the deceased Wen Longshan.</p><p></p><p>His brows unconsciously furrowed.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he had deeply imprinted that adorable ox mask.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Prefecture, Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>A wave of invisible shockwaves, expanding in ripples, burst open.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure of the Ox Demon suddenly appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Standing for a long time, his chest heaving violently.</p><p></p><p>"Who was that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che removed the Ox Demon mask, revealing an extremely grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Even from over ten miles away, the swift approach had given him a sense of oppression that was difficult to breathe.</p><p></p><p>That was a... </p><p></p><p>Grand Grandmaster! Absolutely a Grand Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che, with his Dragon Elephant Nine Transformations, had already stepped into the Furnace Grandmaster realm, a martial prodigy. For someone to make him feel such terror and dread with their blood qi...</p><p></p><p>It could only be a Grand Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>"How could there be a Grand Grandmaster in the Golden Light Prefecture city?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he recalled the words spoken before the Southern Depart Fire Operation.</p><p></p><p>The reason Wen Longshan left the city was to receive the son of the Pacifying King Yimo Ritual. It seems this Grand Grandmaster was likely the strong cultivator escorting the Pacifying King's son.</p><p></p><p>Well, given the Pacifying King's status and strength, dispatching a Grand Grandmaster to escort his son was indeed reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"For the Shrine Deity resonance, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che mused.</p><p></p><p>This "Shrine Deity resonance" of the Four Guardians Eight Arms Prison Lotus Enraged Third Prince's Mysterious Shrine, had attracted far more people than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the divine children arriving at the capital, even the divine children from the various prefectures were continuously gathering.</p><p></p><p>After all, those daring to participate in the Shrine Deity resonance were definitely the most talented divine children in each prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie's competitive pressure is much greater than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought of his daughter, the corners of his lips curling up slightly.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>What no one knew was...</p><p></p><p>His daughter Xixie had a huge trump card.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even started to look forward to the scene of Xixie pulling out that [Purple Flame Snake Spear Divine Halberd] during the Shrine Deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Che also understood that the current Xixie did not have the ability to wield that Divine Halberd, so he could not be too carefree.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stroked his chin, pondering how to help his daughter try to master that Divine Halberd.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>This divine legendary weapon, hidden within Xixie's arm, was like it had completely fallen into a deep slumber, without the slightest movement.</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being a divine legendary weapon, it had quite a temperament.</p><p></p><p>The main issue was that Xixie was still too young.</p><p></p><p>"But... Third Prince is also a little thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>They were both little things, so why couldn't his daughter Xixie control the Divine Halberd?</p><p></p><p>Not delving too deeply into this topic.</p><p></p><p>Li Che attributed everything to his own inadequacies as a father.</p><p></p><p>After confirming through the Flying Thunder Chess Pieces' sensing that Gong Yunli's carriage heading to Heart Monkey Temple had not encountered any major incidents...</p><p></p><p>He was in no rush to immediately return to the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he sat cross-legged in the courtyard, bathing in the pure white snowfall.</p><p></p><p>Taking out Wen Longshan's Spatial Jade and that crimson, patterned Divine Bow! The Plucking the Stars Eye in his brow slightly heated up.</p><p></p><p>Information about the Divine Bow immediately flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Seven Element Supreme Grade): Crimson Flame Shattered Star Bow]</p><p></p><p>[Craftsmanship: Forged from Heaven and Earth Flowing Flame Crystal, soaked in Blizzard Dragon Sinews using a unique secret technique, increasing its toughness. Arrows fly like crimson flames, with force capable of shattering stars!]</p><p></p><p>[Wielder: Blood Qi Grandmaster and above, Divine Image and above]</p><p></p><p>A Seven Element Supreme Grade divine weapon Divine Bow! This was Wen Longshan's Divine Bow! Li Che's eyes gleamed, archery... he could also use it, as he had mastered the Wrathful Howling Hundred Ghosts Thunder and Lightning Arrows.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Wen Longshan's archery, it was vastly inferior.</p><p></p><p>"A good bow!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit in his chest cavity was slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Drawing the bow, plucking the string, he silently pulled the Divine Bow.</p><p></p><p>His entire body's blood qi surged, the Furnace Grandmaster physique revealing itself without a doubt, as if an enraged dragon was roaring.</p><p></p><p>Creak creak</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Creak...</p><p></p><p>The muscles on his arm were like twisted steel bars, containing an explosive power that roared within.</p><p></p><p>Scorching heat suddenly surged in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Crimson flames flickered on the bow, as if a fiery dragon was forming and roaring.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were bright, and his black hair was flying wildly.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the vague shadows of a dragon and an elephant appeared, roaring!</p><p></p><p>This seven-element top-grade divine bow, although very tough, was still pulled open by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Good bow!" Li Che praised it again, reluctant to let it go.</p><p></p><p>Truly a divine bow befitting a divine archer.</p><p></p><p>Now, it belongs to the Li family!</p><p></p><p>His powerful divine consciousness tore open the Qilin Mountain's Qiankun Jade, taking stock of the harvest.</p><p></p><p>"One seven-element divine essence crystal, ten eight-extreme divine essence crystals, eighteen nine-brilliance divine essence crystals... This is the wealth of a divine archer? So abundant!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was shocked!</p><p></p><p>How could the resources prepared by Qilin Mountain be so rich? Qilin Mountain had not yet stepped into the Primal Realm, which means... these resources were prepared for him to break through to the Primal Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Apart from this divine bow, there is also an eight-extreme Tiger Roar Saber, which is also good."</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal pills are ordinary, all common Wyrm Blood Warrior Pills, of varying grades from eight-extreme to nine-brilliance."</p><p></p><p>"A top-grade true meaning supreme art!"</p><p></p><p>"'Scarlet Flame Flowing Fire Divine Arrow Art', a matching supreme art for the Scarlet Flame Flowing Fire Comet Bow?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>Adding this supreme art, Li Che now possessed six types of supreme arts!</p><p></p><p>Diverse and balanced, including sword arts, tempering arts, and formation arts, and now an archery art as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, not intending to study this archery art right away, planning to find an opportunity to learn it slowly.</p><p></p><p>Reviewing this battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Everything went according to his arrangement, proceeding in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Qilin Mountain also cooperated well, falling into his traps again and again.</p><p></p><p>"It's mainly because Qilin Mountain never thought that the eagle he had left in the thousand-meter high sky would be noticed by me."</p><p></p><p>"Killing the eagle is like blinding one of his eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Qilin Mountain was like a headless fly, naturally falling into my traps again and again."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the divine essence crystal powder, the Seeing Hand Green Powder, and the Crane Battle Tactic, coupled with Qilin Mountain's extremely intense killing intent towards Ma Mian, which almost made him lose his senses.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, it gave Li Che the opportunity to use the 'Great Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Blast' to give him a big surprise.</p><p></p><p>"But in reality... to truly hit a Patriarch-level cultivator with the 'Great Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Blast' is extremely difficult."</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned, not becoming complacent due to the victory.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to hurry up and research the 'Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Formation'..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not let the victory cloud his mind, but maintained caution and introspection.</p><p></p><p>This world is too dangerous, he must be vigilant and not make mistakes.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che is not just an individual now, but has a family.</p><p></p><p>A wife, a daughter...</p><p></p><p>His life is connected to his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>If he were to encounter any mishap, how heartbroken would his wife and daughter be?</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not want his wife and daughter to be saddened.</p><p></p><p>That would make him an incompetent husband and father.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Flowing light emerged before him.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv3, 90%)]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit reflected before him, Li Che's mood instantly improved.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little bit more to reach Lv4, for the divine ability to evolve into a true divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the intense and surpassing-level battle had stimulated the rapid growth of the peerless Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine consciousness expanded, sensing the location of the 'Painting Immortal' avatar that was riding in the carriage with Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>He then took control of the avatar, saying he wanted to get off the carriage for some fresh air.</p><p></p><p>During this brief respite, Li Che grasped the hidden Flying Thunder Chess Piece that was embedded within the avatar's body, completing the transfer and relocation.</p><p></p><p>As for the situation on Southé›¢Fire and Li Qingshan's side, Li Che did not participate.</p><p></p><p>Because through the Heavenly Earth Chess Board, he could clearly sense that the two had already begun to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire did not want to fight to the death with Su Huaili for now.</p><p></p><p>Without the confidence to kill Su Huaili, Southé›¢Fire chose to find another opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire's face always wore a gentle smile, but was actually as venomous as a snake.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Qingshan, it goes without saying. With the cooperation of the three Divine Guard Generals, Li Qingshan, who had just broken through to the Divine Realm, was at a severe disadvantage, despite having the strength of a late-stage Divine Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After a few exchanges, Li Qingshan crushed the Burrowing Talisman and instantly fled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che retracted his gaze, his black robe fluttering in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the carriage, and Gong Yunli was still eating candied fruits, her cheeks puffed out like a little squirrel.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's habit of eating snacks was probably learned from Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli seemed to notice Li Che's gaze and paused: "Ache, want some?"</p><p></p><p>Offering a handful of sunflower seeds to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently and waved his hand, turning his head to look out the window at the fluttering snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>After killing Qilin Mountain, the resentment in his heart had dissipated greatly, and his mood had become much better, even the snowy scenery seemed more vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli also seemed to sense Li Che's cheerful mood.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Steward, we should be arriving at the Heart Monkey Temple soon, right?" Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>"We've already entered the vicinity of the Heart Monkey Temple... We will stay at the Heart Monkey Temple and then directly proceed to the Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Monkey Temple, as one of the five major sects of the Golden Light Prefecture, is still quite powerful."</p><p></p><p>"With their assistance in suppressing the Mysterious Temple, we can travel there safely."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>His mind, however, couldn't help but recall the monk who had previously bought the Zhong Kui wooden sculpture from him.</p><p></p><p>He had a slight doubt in his heart, this monk from the Buddhist sect, who specialized in subduing demons and capturing ghosts, why did he still need Li Che's Zhong Kui wooden sculpture? But he didn't dwell on this matter too much.</p><p></p><p>The caravan continued to sway and move forward, tearing through the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Palace of the Golden Light Peak, Southé›¢Fire's surrounding yellow aura suddenly dissipated, and he leapt out of the ground.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine energy waves kept spreading outward.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the stone steps of the main hall, removing the white fox mask from his face.</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat somber and sad.</p><p></p><p>The sadness was because his hidden agent planted in the City Lord's Mansion had been killed, with Su Huaili crushing his head right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire's heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>The solemnity was because this plan had failed...</p><p></p><p>Huh? Southé›¢Fire's expression suddenly became strange.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... it's not a complete failure..."</p><p></p><p>"Qilin Mountain is dead."</p><p></p><p>"Killed by the Ox Demon and Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire thought about how Su Huaili's sudden rage had disrupted the rhythm of the battle, giving him the chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>The reason was the news of Qilin Mountain's death.</p><p></p><p>"Qilin Mountain... such a formidable divine archer..."</p><p></p><p>"Killed by the Ox Demon and Ma Mian?!"</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire shook his head.</p><p></p><p>What a pleasant surprise!</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought this plan would fail.</p><p></p><p>But the result turned out to be so wonderful.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Ox Demon and Ma Mian manage to do it?"</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Qilin Mountain was no weak opponent, a seven-element divine archer... Within a hundred-zhang range, he was almost invincible.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ma Mian possessed long-range formation shooting techniques, he would still be inferior to Qilin Mountain at close range.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon might not have been able to stop Qilin Mountain, as Qilin Mountain's martial cultivation was also not weak, having refined the supreme art 'Scarlet Flame Flowing Fire Divine Arrow Art' to the peak of the Grandmaster realm, almost reaching the Transformation Realm. Once the divine archer's true meaning realm manifested, his killing power would be terrifying, like a reaper of life on the battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the long steps, the empty palace suddenly heard his light laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Su Huaili... must be furious to death."</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire's smile was hard to suppress.</p><p></p><p>The angrier Su Huaili became, the better Southé›¢Fire's mood.</p><p></p><p>After laughing for a while, Southé›¢Fire no longer dwelled on how the Ox Demon and Ma Mian had killed Qilin Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon and Ma Mian from the Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>He had originally just called them to help, to ensure that he could kill Qilin Mountain without any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems...</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to pay them more."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire changed into a fresh Sect Master's white robe and walked out of the tightly closed Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Dao Cultivator Wang Kuyu was suddenly startled, looking puzzledly at the departing Southé›¢Fire.</p><p></p><p>He's back already? </p><p></p><p>Is it done?</p><p></p><p>Looks like it's not about assassinating the young master of the Yimo Clan, so what was he doing? Wang Kuyu shook his head, whatever Southé›¢Fire had done, he would know soon enough.</p><p></p><p>After all, an event that could make the Sect Master move must be no small matter.</p><p></p><p>News would spread quickly in the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire was in a good mood, like a gentle spring breeze, and Wang Kuyu glanced at him, it seems the plan was successful, the target must have been killed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Southé›¢Fire would not be smiling so pleasantly.</p><p></p><p>Southé›¢Fire looked at the messy courtyard, then at the disciple Zhong Liushou lying on a wooden board and receiving treatment from Elder Zhang Qingzheng.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of hesitation, his thoughts turned, and he understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"That girl Xixie... too impolite."

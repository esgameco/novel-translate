        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The silence lasted for almost three seconds! The ground behind the Ox Demon was soaked with water, and the suspended raindrops in the air suddenly burst into white waves, as if two extremely powerful streams of energy had collided at high speed, erupting with scorching heat! Sizzling sounds...</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to be stretched infinitely in this moment! Yang Jia Lao Deng, a cultivator at the Divine Foundation realm, a terrifying being like a mountain of flesh, at this moment... his originally frenzied will showed signs of lucidity.</p><p></p><p>Why... can't a non-Divine Foundation cultivator block his punch? But soon, the rampaging "Heart Shocked and Hardened" divine power sprouted tentacles from the divine millstone floating behind him, viciously piercing into Yang Jing's fleshy body.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh... Ahhh, Ox Demon!"</p><p>"So shocking, ahh—!"</p><p>"Die—!"</p><p></p><p>The piercing screams of terror instantly formed a terrifying sonic impact!</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that his eardrums were about to be torn apart!</p><p></p><p>But the expression on his masked face was devoid of joy or sorrow, with no emotional fluctuations! Profound Realm...</p><p></p><p>This Yang Jia Lao Deng, his martial cultivation... is only at the Profound Realm!</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound! On top of Yang Jing's fleshy body, countless semi-transparent divine powers, like the soft tentacles of an octopus, were entangled around the flesh.</p><p></p><p>The punching force became increasingly heavy! Li Che "rumbled" like a suddenly inflated balloon, and his originally robust and mighty physique suddenly expanded even further! The second transformation of the Vajra! The surging energy of blood and qi spreading through his bones and muscles made his inner qi suddenly grow stronger, refining his flesh to near perfection!</p><p></p><p>The abdomen, chest, and back rose high, the skin turning blood-red, the bones and muscles trembling and rolling like a dragon. His arms grew thick, the muscles like braided ropes, and the muscles on his back piled up, as if two pairs of wings had grown! Like a dragon-snake with wings!</p><p></p><p>Profound Realm...</p><p></p><p>You are.</p><p></p><p>I am too! The Ox Demon roared, his terrifying inner qi gushing out, forming a powerful force that could shake mountains, rippling the air and shattering countless raindrops and snowflakes! Boom—</p><p></p><p>The fleshy mountain was knocked away, and the agile Li Che rolled and landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, with his physique expanded even further, felt an unprecedented sense of exhilaration, and his flapping hands suddenly clenched into fists!</p><p></p><p>The "Dragon Elephant Vajra" Dao fruit, through battle, can increase its maturity...</p><p></p><p>The more intense and full-out the battle, the greater the increase.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Che felt that his condition was better than ever before!</p><p></p><p>He could even feel the strange sensation of his maturity soaring.</p><p></p><p>The knocked-away Yang Jing was not surprised, but at this moment he had completely lost consciousness, with only one thought left - to brutally kill the Ox Demon, to hear the terrifying scream of facing death from the Ox Demon's mouth!</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared hotly at the towering fleshy mountain.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the positional pressure brought by the Divine Foundation divine power, the three divine powers in his Nirvana Realm seemed to be frozen by the icy river, unable to flow at all.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the positional suppression?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Divine Foundation... the absolute suppression of cultivation level and position!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the towering divine power floating behind the other party, at least ten times that of the river-like divine power of cultivation... The quantity is ten times, and the quality is even higher!</p><p></p><p>Clearly another level! However, Li Che slightly sensed that the "Untainted Heart" divine power was completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Deity Shrine" divine power in the "Chess Saint" Dao fruit was also unaffected...</p><p></p><p>It seems... there is a chance.</p><p></p><p>The fleshy mountain Yang Jing also seemed to have discovered that this Ox Demon was at the same level as him, a Divine Foundation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But that's all.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet eyes suddenly expanded, the five fingers clenched, and invisible divine power howled and gathered the falling rain and snow into a crescent-shaped blade! Rotating at high speed, it slashed towards the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's towering figure was launched into the air, his feet tapping the ground, blurring and twisting, evading left and right! The blue stones on the street instantly exploded, and the scattered debris flew like bullets in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was cold, and his heart slightly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>The long-range attack fused with Divine Foundation divine power...</p><p></p><p>The power is very strong, even surpassing the single-shot strength of his "Namo Gatling Crow Crossing"!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's feet suddenly accelerated, and with a powerful push, the water in front of him splashed up like a mushroom umbrella.</p><p></p><p>And he quickly retreated! Trying to escape?!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The furious roar of the white-haired Yang Jing, his swelling fleshy mountain body, was surprisingly agile as he pursued, the thick legs like elephant pillars stepping quickly, creating wave-like splashes, and the fat arms suddenly spreading open...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Hawk Treading Cloud! The divine martial art of the Yang family! Li Che glanced back, and with a spread of his arms, he also performed the Cloud Hawk Treading Cloud in an imitative manner.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soaring through the clouds like a hawk!</p><p></p><p>Under the blessing of the Dragon-Elephant-Golden Vajra Dharma Attainment, Li Che's martial arts comprehension was extremely high. </p><p></p><p>Spiritual martial arts are also a form of martial arts... He was already able to manifest them, though he could not channel the spiritual essence. But in terms of pure martial arts, he had already made a breakthrough!  "Ah ah ah! Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Ox Demon manifest his family's spiritual martial arts, Yang Jing felt a sharp pain, as if his most precious possession had been desecrated. Thinking of the experts of the Yang family who had been exterminated, his crazed fury only grew deeper! And this was exactly what Li Che wanted. How could he charge in recklessly against a Spiritual Foundation Cultivator? Originally dashing forward, the light in Li Che's eyes behind his mask suddenly flashed. With a heavy stomp, he bent his body and slapped the ground, swiftly sliding in an arc and shooting into a pitch-black alley beside the main street.</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing, lost in his crazed frenzy, paid no heed to this.</p><p></p><p>He followed, plunging into the alley as well.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the alley, Yang Jing's madness showed no signs of abating. The terrifying spiritual pressure of the Spiritual Foundation Cultivator erupted!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon stood at the end of the alley, feeling the oppressive force of the Spiritual Cultivator's level, his eyes behind the ox mask betraying no emotion.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised his arms, spreading his fingers like playing a stringed instrument. In the next moment, his hooked fingers sharply pulled. Instantly... </p><p></p><p>The entire alley was filled with countless silver threads, exploding into a misty haze like raindrops. It was a hunter's web, sharp as blades!</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Threads! All the taut, cutting threads entered the flesh of the "Meat Mountain" Yang Jing.</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds... </p><p></p><p>The grating noise of metal cutting through. At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Li Che extended his finger, slicing through the void. </p><p></p><p>One by one, the poisoned traps of "Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus" were released from his snapping fingers, bursting open in the air. Countless poisoned ox-hair needles like rain poured down upon the "Meat Mountain".</p><p></p><p>After setting the traps, launching the poison darts, and throwing the hidden weapons...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon grabbed with five fingers, pulling out the "Namo Gatling Wooden Raven" from his spatial storage. Instantly, six thousand wooden ravens manifested, hovering in the air, aimed at the Spiritual Foundation Elder of the Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Setting traps was the Ox Demon's specialty - he was a master of mechanical devices!</p><p></p><p>"Welcome to my domain."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rain mixed with cold snow flakes drifted down.</p><p></p><p>The commotion on the main street fell silent, the white waves crashing against the black boots, shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"What a formidable Ox Demon, refining his strength to the pinnacle, actually reaching the Mysterious Vein level in meridian cultivation - it is well known that spiritual cultivation is easy but qi and blood are difficult to refine. This person was actually able to penetrate the Mysterious Vein in such a short time, truly a martial arts prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan, his waist girded with a saber, watched the battle between the Ox Demon and the Yang family Elder Yang Jing. Even though Yang Jing was in a crazed state under the control of the Spiritual Cultivator, his Spiritual Cultivator cultivation was real and substantial. The level of pressure was also very real.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had not been instantly annihilated, and was able to resist...</p><p></p><p>"But he won't be able to resist for long. Spiritual Cultivators excel at killing, even if the martial arts cultivation is at the Mysterious Vein level, it would only take a few moves."</p><p></p><p>Behind Cao Qingyuan was the remaining lone Divine Constable Zhang Xiangyang. At this moment, Zhang Xiangyang had his head lowered, his expression changing, filled with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had not turned back to join Zhou Ruoguan in trying to counterattack, otherwise... he would now be just a corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, so what do we do now..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan smiled, not looking at the Ox Demon and Yang Jing fighting.</p><p></p><p>"We... will go to Li Che's residence."</p><p></p><p>"Whether Li Che is the Ox Demon... is still just my conjecture."</p><p></p><p>"Three years, from a mere commoner to becoming the terrifying Ox Demon, I still can't bring myself to believe it..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If it were true, how would he balance his emotions... he would be consumed by jealousy!</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, the Ox Demon and the Spiritual Cultivator are engaged in battle... he will surely be unable to escape, and may even be killed."</p><p></p><p>"So we will go to the Li family residence, using the pretext of having Li Che carve a wooden sculpture before, to see if that Li Che exists..."</p><p></p><p>"If he is not there..."</p><p></p><p>"Then the mystery will no longer be a mystery."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan paused, then couldn't help but break into a crazed laugh.</p><p></p><p>"I am about to..."</p><p></p><p>"See the truth."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Peak, Great Slope!</p><p></p><p>The heavy snow fell rapidly, flakes swirling between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The howling air and blood were suddenly torn apart, exploding into a hazy snow mist!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's figure suddenly sprang out, his crimson blood transformed into two scarlet tigers, which were beaten and scattered by Xixi's riding and pounding.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhong Liushou, who had come from the Dao City and considered himself superior to the talents of the Fu City, look extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The dissatisfaction in his heart surged up layer upon layer! This little girl...</p><p></p><p>He must teach this little girl a good lesson!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's eyes flashed with a fierce color! He was from one of the thousand-year-old families of Dao City, and had been cultivated with top-notch resources since childhood. At the age of seven, he had already mastered the perfected martial arts. How could he be suppressed by a little girl?!</p><p></p><p>However, in addition to his anger, Zhong Liushou was also surprised, four years old... truly a monster!</p><p></p><p>But a monster is a monster, he cannot lose! He came with the glory of Dao City!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's hair flew, his eyes flashing. Since his brute force could not subdue this girl...</p><p></p><p>Then he would change his strategy! Magical arts... in addition to personal strength, it also requires brains! Zhong Liushou stepped down, his eyes shining...</p><p></p><p>Since it is so, he will use divine weapons to win!</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he fought with Haitao Sheng, he disdained to use divine weapons, because Haitao Sheng's strength, he could easily defeat him with bare hands.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be true, but this genius from the Jin Guang Mansion...</p><p></p><p>It's different! He has to bring out the divine weapons! He clenched his five fingers, and a long spear was immediately grasped in his hand...</p><p></p><p>The Seven Element Divine Weapons!</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura of the Seven Element Divine Weapons spread out.</p><p></p><p>Although...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou was temporarily unable to activate the Seven Element Divine Weapons, unable to release their power, but... relying solely on the pressure of the divine weapon's rank, he would be able to gain the advantage! Zhong Liushou dragged the Seven Element Long Spear and suddenly started to run wildly, then stepped down heavily, and the spear shot out like a fierce tiger! On the Seven Element Divine Weapon Long Spear, there was a scarlet glow flashing and blooming!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhong Liushou's other arm trembled, and two more divine weapons were taken out from the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>They were two constantly rotating suspended swords!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's lips curled up, using divine weapons to suppress people, he didn't believe that the genius from the Mansion City could win over him, the talent from the thousand-year-old family, in terms of the essence of divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Great Slope.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Zhong Liushou, there were two other geniuses from Dao City.</p><p></p><p>One was the fat little boy brought by the Taoist Wang Kuyu, who was currently grabbing a bag of buns and stuffing one after another into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The rich aroma of the meat buns permeated the surroundings, making many of the spiritual children from Dao City move their steps away in disgust.</p><p></p><p>It was the genius girl who had a gentle smile on her face and did not despise the fat boy.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yunye, Zhong Liushou is done for!" </p><p></p><p>The fat boy said with a full mouth, his cheeks bulging.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why do you say that, Brother Zhoufeng?" The little girl was tranquil and cute, and although she was only six years old, a dazzling beauty could already be seen.</p><p></p><p>The fat boy chuckled: "Li Nuanxi's specialty is not close-quarters combat... but mechanisms."</p><p></p><p>"She has a second master called Niu Mo, who has stirred up the Jin Guang Mansion City, and is good at using mechanism weapons."</p><p></p><p>"If Zhong Liushou simply uses martial arts and spiritual power to fight, perhaps Li Nuanxi would not be so unethical as to use hidden weapons."</p><p></p><p>"But Zhong Liushou actually plans to use the number and rank of divine weapons to suppress people... then he's done for."</p><p></p><p>The fat boy kept shaking his head and chuckling.</p><p></p><p>The genius girl called Yunye was startled for a moment, her exquisite features as if they were the masterpiece of the Creator Goddess Nüwa.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanism... hidden weapons?" </p><p></p><p>Yunye paused, her long lashes and eyes that seemed to contain the galaxy flickered.</p><p></p><p>It sounds... very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Yunye turned her head back to the Great Slope.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the little girl Xixi, who was even younger than her, her eyes brightened slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixi smashed the two scarlet blood fierce tigers.</p><p></p><p>Then she felt an extremely strong divine weapon aura, the long spear lashing out, the air seemed to be torn apart and exploded!</p><p></p><p>Although Zhong Liushou was unable to activate the power of the Seven Element Divine Weapons, relying solely on the rank of the Seven Element Divine Weapons was already an enormous threat.</p><p></p><p>But Xixi was fearless, her eyes becoming even brighter and more dazzling! She slapped the golden ring around her neck, and the golden ring howled and flew out, which she grabbed in her hand and threw at Zhong Liushou's Seven Element Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Seven Element Divine Weapon!</p><p></p><p>Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring! Bang—</p><p></p><p>The two Seven Element Divine Weapons collided.</p><p></p><p>Violent sound waves spread out, Xixi nimbly flipped and landed on the snowy ground, opened her short legs, and started running at high speed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Two breaking-the-air sounds rang out, Zhong Liushou gestured with his fingers, controlling two rapidly rotating flying daggers, quickly slashing towards Xixi.</p><p></p><p>"Hidden weapons! You used hidden weapons first!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi's eyes suddenly brightened!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't Xixi who was unethical first!</p><p></p><p>"Big Crane Crane!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi excitedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the intelligent wooden crane actually had a spirit-like nature, striding with its long crane legs.</p><p></p><p>"Tap tap tap" it ran quickly towards Xixi.</p><p></p><p>Then it spread its wings and took flight, Xixi suddenly stopped, a small figure in the snow, bent her knees, and squatted down.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a powerful push! The rebound force formed a ripple of waves, sweeping away a circle of flying snow! And her figure actually leaped up, landing on the back of the flying wooden crane.</p><p></p><p>Even from ten meters in the air, one could almost hear Xixi's unrestrained crazy laughter! "Come, come, Xixi is going to set off fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>"Niu Niu Master gave Xixi the upgraded fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi took out the Immortal Gatling Gun that Li Che had upgraded and enhanced for her from the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>Xixi directly twisted the button on it like a spring, directly raising the firepower of the Immortal Gatling Gun to the third gear! The Immortal Gatling Gun that Li Che had upgraded for Xixi had a total of five gears! The third gear...</p><p></p><p>Even a Qi Dao cultivator would scream in agony if hit by one.</p><p></p><p>As for the fifth gear, with the [Great Snow Avalanche] Wood Dove Crow added, the firepower at the highest gear... even a Sect Master would be blasted into a mess.</p><p></p><p>Several enhanced third-gear Immortal Wood Dove Crows were taken out by her, flapping their wooden wings, floating in line beside the Immortal Gatling Gun.</p><p></p><p>Load, load the bullets! Xixi's face was full of joy.</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Xixi originally planned to fight with you in the identity of a four-year-old blood warrior.</p><p></p><p>But you refused...</p><p></p><p>Actually used hidden weapon daggers to stab the Great Emperor Xixi!</p><p></p><p>Then no more pretense! </p><p></p><p>Playing with hidden weapons, Xixi was taught by Niu Niu Master, and she is a professional!</p><p></p><p>The Heroic Fireworks Master! Fire! Above the Great Slope, Zhong Liushou was suddenly at a loss, looking at Xixi flying up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanism beast?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a scion of a thousand-year-old family, how could he not know the name of the mechanism beasts? That was a great family like the Tang Clan that once stood at the top! This girl...</p><p></p><p>How could she have a mechanism beast?!</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Those black-mouthed metal tubes, what are they? Zhong Liushou came from Dao City, naturally seeing the Immortal Gatling Gun for the first time.</p><p></p><p>He had not seen Xixi's previous battle.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou narrowed his eyes, becoming a little wary in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Spiritually controlling the two flying daggers that obeyed his will like his own limbs, he quickly shot them towards the wooden crane that Xixi was riding and flying at ten meters high.</p><p></p><p>But the flying daggers climbed up about seven or eight meters, and could not go any further.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou frowned.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw Xixi shouldering those six metal tubes bundled together, aiming at him.</p><p></p><p>When the first round of golden flames bloomed like a brilliant lotus at the muzzle of the mechanism cannon, Zhong Liushou immediately felt a chill all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang—! The ground beneath him on the Great Slope exploded!</p><p></p><p>The snow seemed to be blown up into flying snow columns, shooting up high, then crashing down with a splash.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou rolled and ran on the Great Slope, evading the first round of sweeping fire! However, this was just the beginning of the nightmare! Zhong Liushou felt that his blood had been frozen.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the deep craters exploding on the ground.</p><p></p><p>If he got hit by one...</p><p></p><p>Would he die? Zhong Liushou finally realized that he had made an extremely wrong decision, which was to engage in a weapon battle with Xixi. Xixi not only had Seven Element Divine Weapons...</p><p></p><p>But also this strange and terrifying mechanism!</p><p></p><p>How to fight? </p><p></p><p>This four-year-old girl has cheats!</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang bang bang bang—</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi sat on the back of the Immortal Wooden Crane, continuously firing at the panicked Zhong Liushou below.</p><p></p><p>Golden light, like countless golden needles, spewed out from the cannon muzzle.</p><p></p><p>Shooting towards the extremely disheveled Zhong Liushou!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou had been running for about two breaths, but he couldn't dodge anymore.</p><p></p><p>He summoned an eight-extreme armor to completely wrap himself up.</p><p></p><p>When the first Immortal Wood Dove Crow hit his body and exploded with a thunderous sound, the impact wave and terrifying collision force were almost enough to make Zhong Liushou's bones and tendons shatter...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou couldn't even speak.</p><p></p><p>Only continuous screams came from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah—"</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang bang!</p><p></p><p>The screams were soon drowned out by the roar of the explosions, black smoke mixed with gunpowder smoke, rolling up in billows, with golden light flashing constantly inside.</p><p></p><p>Like the sparkling fireworks blooming in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Xixi, riding the Immortal Wooden Crane soaring and circling ten meters in the air, realized the all-round attack from the air to the ground without dead angles.</p><p></p><p>The entire Great Slope suddenly fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Great Slope.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual children who came from Dao City were dumbfounded, slightly opening their mouths, watching the arrogant genius Zhong Liushou...</p><p></p><p>Disheveled like a stray dog.</p><p></p><p>They could not imagine the horror that Zhong Liushou's heart had suffered!</p><p></p><p>If only the late Shangguan Qingliu were still here, he would definitely have released a soul-shaking resonant sigh!</p><p></p><p>This girl Li Nuanxi... is just a lunatic!</p><p></p><p>The fat boy Zhou Peng was holding a bun, and even forgot to take a bite.</p><p></p><p>His chubby face also couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>"So terrible, so violent..."</p><p></p><p>Next to her, the lively big eyes of Yunye were full of the reflected fireworks.</p><p></p><p>She directly ignored the fact that these beautiful fireworks were built on Zhong Liushou's suffering.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"How beautiful."</p><p></p><p>"That girl... so handsome, I like her so much!"</p><p></p><p>Yunye's voice was soft and extremely gentle.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the fat boy Zhou Peng's heart almost melted.</p><p></p><p>However, he recalled something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yunye, who do you like?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the viewing platform.</p><p></p><p>Taoist Wang Kuyu almost couldn't help but pluck out his own beard.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The mechanism of the Tang Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"So terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>His vision was naturally broad.</p><p></p><p>Mechanism beasts, Immortal Wood Dove Crows... these were things developed by the mechanism research of the Tang Clan, but they were not things that ordinary people could control and use.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Zhong Liushou who was hiding under the divine weapon armor, howling and crying...</p><p></p><p>And then looking at the little girl riding the Immortal Wooden Crane mechanism beast, flying high and continuously bombarding the ground...</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu suddenly had an illusion.</p><p></p><p>If the Patriarch doesn't accept this eccentric...</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be the Patriarch's loss?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che gradually dispersed the chessboard of heaven and earth, observing the situation of Xixi.</p><p></p><p>The image dissipated like smoke.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after Xixi took out the Immortal Gatling Gun that he had improved for her, this battle basically had no suspense.</p><p></p><p>The genius from Dao City, Zhong Liushou, was indeed very good.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the talents of the Jin Guang Mansion City, he was far superior.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xixi had him cheating in the dark, in terms of martial arts and spiritual cultivation, she could only barely match him.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of divine weapons, in terms of mechanism and hidden weapons...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou was far from being able to compare with Xixi.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the [Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear], a divine myth weapon of the Four Sovereigns grade that Xixi had hidden in her arm! Just the five-gear firepower, and the three thousand different firepower Immortal Wood Dove Crows that Li Che made for Xixi using the [Immortal in the Painting] Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou had no chance at all! Unless Zhong Liushou completed the spiritual blood transformation and reached the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>The only path he can take is to be beaten to tears by Xixi! Collecting his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression also gradually became cold and solemn on the chessboard of heaven and earth, the black chess pieces burning with dense black smoke-like aura.</p><p></p><p>Rapidly moving towards the chess position where he was.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind it."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's actions, after all, lack some stability."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought it was an ambush against Wendlong Mountain, but instead he was plotted against by the other party.</p><p></p><p>Suhuai, the Three Great Generals of the Divine Guard Army...</p><p></p><p>Plus Wendlong Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Almost all the Divine Generals of the Mansion City have been deployed!</p><p></p><p>Five Divine Generals, including the powerful Suhuai who has realized the Primordial Spirit!</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch should be able to escape... I'm not sure about Li Qingshan, with the Three Great Generals attacking him, he just broke through, I don't know if he can hold on."</p><p></p><p>Li Che observed the situation through the chessboard of heaven and earth of the High Virtue Chess Saint, and judged it.</p><p></p><p>"But now I have to face..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Arrow Colonel, Wendlong Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Li Che</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly thought of something and abruptly lifted his head.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was sharp, and he saw a soaring eagle high up in the sky, spreading its wings and circling.</p><p></p><p>The eagle's eyes were like high-powered telescopic lenses, shining brightly and locking onto his position.</p><p></p><p>"I see..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled. He stood up, his blood surging, the spiritual energy in his Nirvana Pulse overflowing. The pure heart painting paper he had prepared earlier suddenly flew up.</p><p></p><p>The divine ink splashed, and one after another, wooden spirit crane mechanical beasts emerged from the painting, spreading their wings and taking flight.</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>In an instant! </p><p></p><p>About sixteen wooden spirit crane mechanical beasts suddenly soared upwards, flapping their wings and rushing towards the eagle in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Eagle Eye Interconnection, huh? In that case... let me poke out your eyes first."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Then his footsteps landed, and his entire figure blurred and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain...</p><p></p><p>His raw strength was extremely powerful. </p><p></p><p>Although he was a divine archer, his blood vitality and physique were terrifying, a master-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his spiritual energy was also extremely strong, just a step away from the Primordial Realm...</p><p></p><p>Very strong, the strongest opponent Li Che had faced so far.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the plan was for Nan Li Huo, Niu Mo, Ma Mian, and Li Qingshan to act together to kill Wen Long Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But the plan has changed.</p><p></p><p>It has become Li Che facing Wen Long Mountain alone.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was too eager to kill Ma Mian.</p><p></p><p>That day when he shot through Wen Long Mountain's shoulder was like a shameful stamp imprinted on Wen Long Mountain's body! Wen Long Mountain could not tolerate it, and he had to wash away this shame, so he could only kill Ma Mian! So, he didn't even bother to join forces with the three great divine generals of the Divine Guard Army to kill Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after locking onto Ma Mian's position with his Eagle Eye, he rushed over frantically, unleashing the unique lightness skill and speed of a divine archer.</p><p></p><p>Rushing over at high speed.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was fully confident that as long as he got close to Ma Mian, he could kill Ma Mian with his thunderous methods!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Wen Long Mountain believed that the closer he was to Ma Mian, the more his archery would have the upper hand!</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>As long as his arrows killed Ma Mian and used Ma Mian's blood to consecrate the arrows, </p><p></p><p>his Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Divine Archery would be able to step into the Transformation Realm and form a True Meaning Domain!</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>even cultivators who have manifested their Primordial Spirit would be threatened by him!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed Wen Long Mountain's murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, he naturally wouldn't be merciful and surrender.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter just let off some fireworks..."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's time for Father."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down his hat, and a faint laughter came from behind the horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>He snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>In the sky thousands of meters above! </p><p></p><p>Sixteen mechanical wooden spirit cranes flapped their wings in rhythm, gliding, surrounding the eagle!</p><p></p><p>The eagle tilted its head, its eagle eyes reflecting the sixteen wooden spirit cranes, seeming a bit puzzled, a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>These spirit cranes, why do they look so weird.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>The sixteen wooden spirit cranes tilted their heads, and their long crane beaks opened almost simultaneously...</p><p></p><p>From each wooden spirit crane's beak, a long slender cannon barrel extended.</p><p></p><p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat—</p><p></p><p>Golden light burst forth in the sky, like a series of brilliant golden lotuses suddenly blooming.</p><p></p><p>The eagle could only manage a mournful howl before it was blown into a cloud of blood.</p><p></p><p>Countless feathers flew.</p><p></p><p>The eagle in the sky was riddled with bullets and, accompanied by a dense mist of blood, plummeted rapidly from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the forest.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain, gripping the Crimson Flame Divine Bow, slammed down, and with a thud, the snow in the entire forest surged up like waves.</p><p></p><p>He slowly raised his head, and the blood energy in his body seemed to have turned into a bloody mist, diffusing outwards, circulating around him.</p><p></p><p>He covered his left eye with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Fresh blood seeped out from his left eye.</p><p></p><p>His Eagle Eye Spiritual Technique...</p><p></p><p>was ruined! "How is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's whole body was trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Eagle Eye Spiritual Technique he cultivated required establishing a spiritual connection with a blood-lineaged eagle. </p><p></p><p>Mastering it was extremely difficult, and it was precisely with this Eagle Eye Spiritual Technique that he had become one of the Seven Primordial Divine Archers...</p><p></p><p>Now, his Eagle Eye was destroyed! "What are those spirit cranes... exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>From the eagle's transmitted vision, he only saw those strange-looking spirit cranes opening their crane beaks.</p><p></p><p>Then the vision completely blurred.</p><p></p><p>All that remained was blood-red...</p><p></p><p>He knew that his beloved eagle was likely doomed.</p><p></p><p>His bird, dead before it could accomplish its mission! "Ah—!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was so heartbroken that he was trembling, with a murderous aura rising in his head, making it hard to breathe.</p><p></p><p>He was almost about to lose his mind.</p><p></p><p>The demonic bird he had painstakingly raised!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain painfully opened his other eye, his vision blurred, his Eagle Eye Spiritual Technique ruined, and his other eye's vision also affected.</p><p></p><p>In the blur, he seemed to see... a crane?! Folding its wings, like an ostrich, stretching its neck, its streamlined body silently rushing through the forest!</p><p></p><p>Without any sound, it was like a piece of wood approaching noiselessly! If it weren't for the divine archer's vigilance, he might have missed it! Almost letting it get close to him!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this crane, he was immediately enraged!</p><p></p><p>He quickly drew his bow! The creaking sound echoed, the bowstring pulled into a full moon, and his fingers released.</p><p></p><p>Wail—</p><p></p><p>A long cry, the arrow shaft burning with crimson flames, rapidly shooting towards that wooden spirit crane!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The wooden spirit crane even had the intelligent intention to try to dodge the arrow.</p><p></p><p>But the divine archer's shot was truly too fast.</p><p></p><p>This wooden spirit crane was directly shot and exploded.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>In the forest! </p><p></p><p>One after another, the wooden spirit cranes with folded wings, only running with their legs, quickly approached.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain opened one eye and closed the other, continuously drawing feathered arrows from his quiver.</p><p></p><p>Wail wail wail—</p><p></p><p>Injured in one eye, the shooting accuracy of a divine archer was indeed greatly affected! One by one, the wooden spirit cranes that seemed like mad dogs were shot and exploded by his divine archery!</p><p></p><p>Flames swept, the explosive shockwaves roared, the howling airflow...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain slightly changed color, he felt the powder from the exploded wooden spirit cranes being whipped up by the raging airflow...</p><p></p><p>There was even some powder floating! Pinching a bit of the powder, Wen Long Mountain just sniffed it and was horrified! He only felt that the divine energy within him, which was almost at the Primordial Realm, suddenly subsided, and communicating became extremely slow!</p><p></p><p>"This is... Octagon Divine Essence Powder?!"</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>He had fallen for the trap! Waves of wind carrying Octagon Divine Essence Powder, and mixed in were various kinds of poison powders.</p><p></p><p>Even including the powder made from drying the hallucination-inducing poison mushrooms!</p><p></p><p>"Despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain roared.</p><p></p><p>The Octagon Divine Essence Powder could have a great inhibiting effect on the divine energy of Primordial Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His hair stood on end, his body suddenly swelled up, a series of blue veins throbbing like dragons, his skin reddened by the surging blood energy!</p><p></p><p>As a divine archer, Wen Long Mountain rarely had to resort to using his blood energy like this!</p><p></p><p>He was wearing a divine armor, and the blood energy was amplified, making it even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to blow away the Octagon Divine Essence Powder and poison powders surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>To restore the subsided divine energy.</p><p></p><p>His divine energy was restricted...</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only use the martial dao cultivation at the Mastery Realm!</p><p></p><p>For any Primordial Realm cultivator, it was an extremely terrifying situation.</p><p></p><p>He regretted it.</p><p></p><p>He should have cooperated with the three great divine generals of the Divine Guard Army, first killed Li Qingshan, and then together dealt with this Niu Mo and Ma Mian! That would have been the safest! He never expected that this Ma Mian... would also be so cunning!</p><p></p><p>"No! It's not Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>"It's Niu Mo!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain let out a long roar, his true qi gushing out, the snow surging like waves. He slapped his hand, relying solely on his powerful blood energy, constantly drawing his bow and shooting arrows!</p><p></p><p>Powerful true qi attached to the arrows, continuously exploding and shooting out, bombarding in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Frustration, anger, pain...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of emotions surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain didn't even see the figures of Ma Mian and Niu Mo, and his mentality was already on the verge of collapse, almost exploding!</p><p></p><p>Blood energy, true qi, spiritual awareness...</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain did not spare his own strength, pouring them all into the arrows, shooting them out, hoping to blow away the Octagon Divine Essence Powder and poison through the explosive wind gusts of the arrows.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo and Ma Mian...</p><p></p><p>Still did not appear.</p><p></p><p>Where are they?! "Come out!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's left eye dripped with fresh blood, tightly closed, his right eye painfully opened, but filled with killing intent and fury!</p><p></p><p>The majestic blood energy at the Mastery Realm kept surging, plowing out deep furrows in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's single eye flashed with a gleam, his body crouching down, looking towards a position hundreds of feet into the forest.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>He heard a sound like the explosion of an arrow!</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was overjoyed, finally finding him, his body suddenly rushing out like a descending mountain tiger, his overwhelming blood energy like billowing wolf smoke!</p><p></p><p>Thud—! A Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet shot, hitting Wen Long Mountain's chest.</p><p></p><p>The Octagon Divine Armor on his body let out a grating sound.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain stubbornly took this Dragon Tooth Bodhi sniper hit.</p><p></p><p>But there was no discouragement or anger, only excitement and savagery in his gaze! Found him...</p><p></p><p>Finally, he fucking found him!</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain stomped his Cloud Boots, the tree branches shattering, his body catapulting, repeatedly stepping on several tree branches to leap.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he saw a tall figure hiding behind a thick tree trunk. </p><p></p><p>That figure was holding a strange long-barreled mechanism, wearing a hat and a horse-faced mask! Ma Mian!!!</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all his blood energy burst out from the large tendons on his back, his figure pulling a bloody shadow! Like a soaring eagle from the high sky diving to hunt! The blood energy and cultivation at the Mastery Realm were fully displayed! In just one breath, he caught up to the panicked and retreating Ma Mian! "Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>"Give me your life!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain showed no mercy, suddenly slashing out his waist saber, ruthlessly chopping down! The saber light was like a dragon, like a cascading silver waterfall!</p><p></p><p>Cutting open Ma Mian's hat!</p><p></p><p>Cutting open Ma Mian's horse-faced mask!</p><p></p><p>Cutting open Ma Mian's calm gaze...</p><p></p><p>No drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Fake.</p><p></p><p>This Ma Mian was a fake!</p><p></p><p>He still hadn't seen the real Ma Mian!</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's hot blood instantly turned cold, his heart a desolate plain.</p><p></p><p>Fuck...</p><p></p><p>This scheme...</p><p></p><p>He fell for it again.</p><p></p><p>In the abrupt silence of Wen Long Mountain's laughter, Ma Mian exploded into a dense black mist, blown away by Wen Long Mountain's surging blood energy.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before Wen Long Mountain's eyes...</p><p></p><p>was a benevolent-looking Guanyin with a mudra.</p><p></p><p>A Merciful Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Bomb with the power of three hundred illusory divine essence chess pieces! Boom—!!! The wooden carving of the compassionate Guanyin's face instantly swelled, cracked, and countless golden lights...</p><p></p><p>gushed out, instantly engulfing Wen Long Mountain's eyes and pupils.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying explosion, accompanied by an earth-shattering destructive shockwave, rolled and surged.</p><p></p><p>A mushroom cloud over ten meters high slowly rose.</p><p></p><p>Countless flames rolled, then like the falling debris after a volcanic eruption, fireballs came shooting down! Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>In the mushroom cloud of the explosion.</p><p></p><p>A figure emerged, its whole body emanating scorching heat, accompanied by a sizzling sound, shooting out like a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>It slammed hard into a large tree trunk and slowly slid down, collapsing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's skin was torn and his flesh was mangled, not a single inch of his body unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Coughing up large mouthfuls of blood, his blood energy was almost depleted, his vital energy and spirit fallen to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The Octagon Divine Armor he was wearing was intact, but unable to withstand the high temperature that burst out in the instant of the explosion, under the impact of the small mushroom cloud and the intense heat.</p><p></p><p>His flesh and blood were almost completely dissolved.</p><p></p><p>Is this a mechanism? Wen Long Mountain's mood was desperate.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he didn't even see the faces of Ma Mian and Niu Mo...</p><p></p><p>He only had one breath left.</p><p></p><p>He, Wen Long Mountain, the Divine Guard Army Divine Archery Sergeant, one of the Seven Primordial Divine Archers...</p><p></p><p>When had he ever fought such a humiliating battle? What kind of thing did he encounter?!</p><p></p><p>Leaning against the big tree, his chest rising and falling weakly.</p><p></p><p>"You're injured, aren't you..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a deep voice, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's pupils involuntarily constricted, his whole body stiff and trembling.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar...</p><p></p><p>The snow in front of him exploded, countless flying snow like a waterfall curtain rolling.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying level of divine energy, pressing down on the heavily wounded Wen Long Mountain, leaving him without the strength to even move a finger.</p><p></p><p>In his tightly constricted single eye pupil,</p><p></p><p>it reflected the towering figure that leaped down from the tree and slowly straightened up in front of him, bringing a terrifying pressure like a collapsing mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Golden King Ascending the Tower Stance·Niu Mo! Since you're injured, I'll take the stage! Wen Long Mountain looked at it numbly...</p><p></p><p>They had already blasted and tormented him to this state.</p><p></p><p>And still came with a big move to kill him?!</p><p></p><p>7,000 words chapter!

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The violently shaking [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit reacted with unprecedented intensity, as if it had encountered something extremely delicious and longed for.</p><p></p><p>Just like the first time he encountered the mysterious temple deity whose head he had rubbed bald in the strange temple outside Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit was also very excited, but not as passionately as it was now.</p><p></p><p>It made Li Che's emotions surge.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was facing a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The chess pieces condensed by the Chess Saint Dao Fruit, through Xixi as a medium, sensed the scent of the opportunity and transmitted the feedback to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>That was Xixi's opportunity, and as her father, Li Che naturally could not snatch it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che himself was not lacking in opportunities, Xixi's birth was his greatest opportunity.</p><p></p><p>And with one Dao Fruit a year, as long as Xixi was safe and sound for a year, he could condense a Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Given such a great opportunity, how could he abandon his face and snatch the opportunity that belonged to his daughter? But if his daughter couldn't take in this opportunity...</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the opportunity from being wasted and taken by others.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Che could only reluctantly consume this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Fei shui bu liu wai ren tian (Keeping the family's resources within the family).</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che also noticed another point...</p><p></p><p>"Temple deity?"</p><p></p><p>Under the ox demon mask, Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was on Mount Jingang, which was the main peak of the Divine Sect's branch, how could there be a temple deity? </p><p></p><p>There would only be temple deities in mysterious temples, could it be that there was a mysterious temple on top of Mount Jingang, making Xixi currently in a dangerous place?</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, but the chess pieces had not warned that Xixi was in danger.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit's judgment of danger was extremely accurate, and Li Che still trusted it.</p><p></p><p>The division of spoils was over, and the three of them had nothing else to talk about, so they planned to leave separately.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, next time call Ma Mian as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu looked at the burly Ox Demon and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che thought for a moment, his voice hoarse under the mask: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu pushed the peacock mask on the bridge of his nose and stretched.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to sense something, leaping up to the black-tiled roof, looking out into the distance.</p><p></p><p>That was the gate of the Divine Sect, the direction of Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>A straight golden beam of light shot straight into the clouds, very prominent in the night.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Niu Mo also leaped up to the roof, looking up.</p><p></p><p>"This is... this is the opening of the temple deity's divine hall in the Heaven King Tower!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan couldn't help but exclaim, a hint of amazement flashing in his eyes as he glanced at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"On the main peak of Mount Jingang, there is a mysterious temple, which is the relic left by the founding patriarch of the Qianyuan Divine Sect on Mount Jingang, the plundered mysterious temple, with only the sleeping temple deity remaining."</p><p></p><p>"That temple deity is very special, not in human form, but a sentient divine weapon."</p><p></p><p>"The divine weapon is called: the Seven Treasures Sarira Wish Golden Tower, we mostly call it the Heaven King Tower."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was introducing it to Li Che, so that Li Che would not be too worried about Xixi's situation.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven King Tower contains many good things, such as divine weapons, divine foundation techniques, divine appearance techniques, and even divine foundation secret arts, divine appearance secret arts, etc."</p><p></p><p>"Every sect master's true transmission has the opportunity to obtain the temple deity's teachings, which is a chance to pass the Heaven King Tower's test."</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven King Tower will provide various kinds of rewards according to one's divine nature talent, like the sect master's junior disciple, oh, not the youngest one anymore, that is Sanguan Yin..."</p><p></p><p>"The divine appearance technique she cultivates is the [Compassionate Six-Armed Guanyin Divine Appearance] bestowed by the Heaven King Tower, which is a low-grade divine appearance technique of the Six Bureaus! Extremely precious... that girl, I heard the sect master say, she almost managed to activate the divine hall back then!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked up at the vibrating Mount Jingang emitting ripples of energy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Jingang Prefecture City was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Temple Bureau, the Qin Tian Observatory, the City Lord's Mansion, and the five major families and sects all had divine appearance experts releasing majestic divine consciousness to observe the golden light descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, it is rumored that this 'Heaven King Tower' is a remnant temple deity, divided into three, the one left on Mount Jingang is one-third of the temple deity, but it has also reached the Six Bureau level."</p><p></p><p>"The other two Heaven King Towers, one is in the Qianyuan Divine Sect's main sect in the Lingnan Road, and the other one, I think, is in the Divine Capital..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu clicked his tongue and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded: "Indeed, the Heaven King Tower in the main gate of the Qianyuan Divine Sect is the second Heaven King Tower, with a higher rank, reaching the 'Five Elders' level."</p><p></p><p>"As for the last Heaven King Tower, it is in the mysterious Siyu Subduing Demon Heaven King Temple outside the Divine Capital..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu naturally knew more, as he often resided in the Qin Tian Observatory, seeing the vast collection of books, knowledgeable about astronomy and geography, and had also extensively studied the mysterious temples.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that when the dynasty was first established, there was a general at the Divine Embryo Realm who personally came to Jingang Prefecture, wanting to recover this Heaven King Tower, but failed..."</p><p></p><p>"The sect master of the Qianyuan Divine Sect's main sect also once tried to recover it, but also failed."</p><p></p><p>"Because this Heaven King Tower is located here, it seems... to be related to the Four Sovereigns Three Princes Temple in the heart of the Nine Dragons River."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Supervisor of the Divine Capital once said that if the three Heaven King Towers were reunited, the complete Golden Heaven King Tower might be able to enter the Three Pure Ones level of divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this, his heart couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit was so excited, even though it was only one-third of the Heaven King Tower, it was indeed a huge opportunity for the current Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"That's all, farewell." Li Che cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his figure directly merged into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>A white Fei Lei chess piece appeared in his palm, which he gripped tightly, and the whole person instantly vanished without a trace! Lin Xiu suddenly turned his head, his eyes looking towards the direction where Niu Mo had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Such a high-level evasion technique, my divine consciousness has been locking on, but I couldn't even sense the spatial fluctuation, yet Niu Mo has already disappeared, I can't even judge whether he has concealed his presence and left, or has moved away."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu took a deep breath, this Niu Mo... and that long-range sniper Ma Mian, he was quite curious about them.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was magnanimous, everyone had their own big secrets.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che came from Fei Lei City and was of humble origins, he obviously also had secrets.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes even narrowed slightly, was Li Che... really of humble origins?</p><p></p><p>A commoner could give birth to a daughter with divine talent? And be able to cultivate to such a realm in such a short time? He shook his head, not paying too much attention to these.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan believed in his own judgment of people, Li Che or Niu Mo would not be some ruthless and evil person, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has their secrets in this life, Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan also subsequently shot off, disappearing into the night.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>The temple's main hall.</p><p></p><p>The pagoda hovered in the air, flashing with golden light, as if countless beams of light were bursting out from it, illuminating the Buddha statue above, making it lifelike and vivid.</p><p></p><p>The entire hall was shrouded in an extremely oppressive aura, making it difficult even to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang stood there, his white robe being blown tightly against his body by the surging wind currents, standing with his hands behind his back, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Below him were Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin, the two standing quietly with their hands hanging, also revealing astonishment in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior sister... is she really alright?"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin still cared about Xixi and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan's beautiful and enchanting face also showed an expression of astonishment, and he also perked up his ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>"This is the opening of the divine hall, only those with pure and untainted divine nature will be recognized and allowed to enter the divine hall... to select the opportunities that belong to her."</p><p></p><p>"The opportunities of the Heaven King Tower cannot be underestimated, because the divine hall of the Heaven King Tower is rumored to be connected to the divine hall of the Heaven King Tower in the Qianyuan main sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Being able to enter the divine hall and obtain the rewards and inheritances, at the lowest... will also be at the Six Bureau level."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang's gentle voice echoed in the hall.</p><p></p><p>He was quite appreciative, with a gleam of brilliance in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I also entered the Heaven King Tower in my day."</p><p></p><p>"Your big brother also entered the Heaven King Tower."</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin's bodies both trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?!"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother also went in?"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What about second brother?"</p><p></p><p>The second brother Bian Yuanlong who went to cultivate in the Qianyuan main sect, could he have also entered the Heaven King Tower?</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin both felt their emotions stirring.</p><p></p><p>"Your second brother did not enter the Heaven King Tower, but after going to the Qianyuan main sect, he should have the opportunity to enter it, the Qianyuan main sect's Heaven King Tower has a special divine nature secret art to enter it."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang said softly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin heard this and both let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>That's good, it's not that they are too trash, their second brother hasn't entered it either, their second brother has gone to the Divine Sect's main sect to cultivate, and he hasn't entered it either...</p><p></p><p>Then they won't feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>But their little junior sister, worthy of being a divine talent born in the auspicious year, her talent is truly terrifying! "The more terrifying your little junior sister's talent, the more dangers she will face in the future, the Corpse God Sect will definitely not let go of such a talented divine child..."</p><p></p><p>"As her senior brothers and sisters, you must protect your little junior sister well... even if... you have to sacrifice your lives."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang looked at Sang Guanyin and Liu Yangyuan, his voice as gentle as ever.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixi felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Mother... save Xixi..."</p><p></p><p>"Stinky father, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixi is going to be taken away, father, come save Xixi!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At first, Xixi was very scared, and she almost called out to everyone she could.</p><p></p><p>She even had Lü Chi called.</p><p></p><p>However, when the dizziness disappeared, Xixi's tightly closed eyes slowly opened, her long eyelashes fluttering, with tears still hanging on them.</p><p></p><p>She curiously looked around, the thick smoke swirling, with purple mist and white cranes spreading their wings, the sound of flowing water rippling.</p><p></p><p>The air was extremely fresh, just taking a deep breath made her feel like her whole person had been cleansed and elevated.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the underworld that father talked about? The place where people go after they die?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi blinked her eyes, a small figure getting up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>She started toddling with her short legs and began walking.</p><p></p><p>The ground was very clean, free of dust, and Xixi felt that even if she took off her shoes and ran around barefoot, she wouldn't get her feet dirty.</p><p></p><p>If she was at home, if she walked around barefoot and dirtied her feet, she would be beaten on the butt by her stinky father and not allowed to jump on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Wow... such beautiful flowers."</p><p></p><p>Xixi had lost her initial fear, perhaps the tranquility of this place had lifted her mood.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the many beautiful flowers growing by the side of the road, her eyes shining brightly, and she even saw a rainbow-colored butterfly, flapping its wings and dancing among the flowers.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly seemed to sense Xixi, flying over to her, circling up and down around her, and even scattering some glittering powder-like fairy dust as it flew.</p><p></p><p>This fairy dust falling on Xixi's body actually made Xixi's inner qi and blood surge, reaching the pinnacle of bone refining.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Dao was slowly progressing.</p><p></p><p>"Wow - Butterfly, are you helping me cultivate?" Xixia raised her chubby little hands, and a butterfly landed on them, gently flapping its wings.</p><p></p><p>Xixia giggled, and the butterfly flew away, with Xixia chasing after it, her hands outstretched.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual particles continuously scattered, and Xixia's martial cultivation was imperceptibly improving. At the same time, within Xixia's Nirvana Realm, the divine nature of the "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" that Li Che had taught her was constantly expanding.</p><p></p><p>It had reached the level of "Cultivating Nature like a River"!</p><p></p><p>Because Xixia had originally cultivated the divine nature of the Xu Family's Sect when she entered the Xu Family's Divine Cultivation Monastery, she was also cultivating the "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" of the Xu Family.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after this, Xixia's Cultivating Nature method would naturally be modified.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xixia did not obtain the divine nature inheritance from the Heavenly King Tower this time, the Southern离Fire would still pass on to her a higher-level divine nature method.</p><p></p><p>After all, the "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" was only a divine nature method of the Xu Family in Fei Lei City, which was too low.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Xixia seems to have gotten stronger!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia sensed the divine nature in the Nirvana Realm, and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Her father had told her about the cultivation of divine nature, so she could perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"When Xixia gets stronger, she can beat that stinky father. That stinky father still wants to hit Xixia's butt, but Xixia will hit him back!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's ambitions were lofty! Following the little butterfly, the mist in front of her gradually parted like a curtain.</p><p></p><p>A majestic and grand golden palace suddenly appeared before Xixia's eyes, dazzlingly bright, almost blinding her.</p><p></p><p>"So much gold, how many sugar hawthorns can Xixia buy with it!" Xixia exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly led Xixia to continue flying towards the palace. The butterfly flapped its wings, rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>When they were about a hundred meters away from the palace, a formless barrier suddenly appeared, like flowing water, with rippling waves.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly flew through it without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>But when Xixia tried to pass through, she was blocked by the invisible barrier, feeling a great resistance that made it very difficult for her to advance.</p><p></p><p>"Little butterfly, wait for me!" Xixia, blocked, became anxious and waved her hands frantically.</p><p></p><p>The little butterfly fluttered in the distance, as if waiting for Xixia, or encouraging her, urging her to keep going.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's little face flushed red with effort, and in the Nirvana Realm space, countless white divine particles, like flickering fireflies, rose and merged into Xixia's river of divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Wah wah wah -"</p><p></p><p>Xixia waved her hands wildly and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Because the invisible barrier in front of her suddenly disappeared, almost causing her to fall face-first.</p><p></p><p>Xixia got up, and the little butterfly danced joyfully, as if delighted that Xixia had crossed the barrier.</p><p></p><p>Xixia stood up, hands on her hips, chest and belly puffed out: "Little butterfly, don't look down on Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>The human and the butterfly continued forward and stepped into the golden palace.</p><p></p><p>The golden palace was very large, extremely large.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xixia stepped inside, she felt incredibly small, like a tiny grain of sand in her own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xixia let out a loud cry, and the sound echoed and reverberated endlessly within the golden palace.</p><p></p><p>Wah wah wah, Xixia cried louder and louder, feeling it was so much fun.</p><p></p><p>The little butterfly landed on Xixia's shoulder, and after playing for a while, Xixia stopped shouting and looked around.</p><p></p><p>There were golden mists billowing out.</p><p></p><p>Then she saw a towering golden statue, almost reaching the top of the golden palace!</p><p></p><p>The statue was majestic and magnificent, wearing golden armor, with a fan-shaped helmet, a benevolent and kind expression, holding a halberd in the left hand and a pagoda in the right, the pagoda being golden with seven layers, each engraved with a Buddha statue, the light shimmering. Xixia stared at the statue for a long time, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>She thought about how her father would react if he saw the statue.</p><p></p><p>Her father loved gold the most, and would probably go and touch it, right?</p><p></p><p>Yes! Her father would definitely go and touch it!</p><p></p><p>Following her father's example must be right!</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes brightened, and then she clapped her chubby little hands together, imitating a prayer.</p><p></p><p>Then, wiggling her little butt, she scurried towards the towering and majestic statue.</p><p></p><p>The little butterfly on her shoulder didn't know at first what Xixia was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>When Xixia reached the base of the statue and stretched out her chubby little hands to gently stroke the surface of the statue's shoes, the little butterfly on her shoulder was almost startled to the point of bristling its feathers! It frantically flapped its wings, wanting to fly away, but...</p><p></p><p>The statue suddenly erupted with an overwhelming divine pressure, firmly pinning the little butterfly down on Xixia's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The golden divine energy surged forth like a torrent, continuously washing over Xixia's body.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's entire little chubby body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Her big eyes flickered, as if she saw a strange scene.</p><p></p><p>In the vision...</p><p></p><p>There was a child with a Nezha braid, stepping on the Wind Fire Wheels, holding a golden long spear burning with towering flames, galloping across the vast sea!</p><p></p><p>Then the child thrust the spear into the sea, violently stirring it up! Xixia's eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>She felt as if her soul had taken flight, merging with the child using the long spear to stir the vast sea! It was so free, so unrestrained, so unbridled!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Wretched child..."</p><p></p><p>In the golden palace, a melancholic voice echoed, reverberating endlessly, thunderous and deafening.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden divine energies poured down.</p><p></p><p>Beside the closed-eyed Xixia, who was caressing the statue, they coalesced into one golden light orb after another, suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>However, as the white divine energy in Xixia's Nirvana Realm was gradually depleted, she could no longer draw the golden divine energy to form the golden light orbs.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the opportunity was about to end.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>There was a silent, imperceptible disturbance in the space.</p><p></p><p>Then, a figure as towering as a mountain, with a triangular back, knotted muscles that pulsed like a raging dragon, gripping a white chess piece, appeared beside Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The wide-brimmed hat lifted, revealing a figure wearing a cute ox mask.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had not even had time to change his clothes, and the first thing he did was crush the Flying Thunder Chess Piece to teleport here.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene, he felt the terrifying, oppressive divine energy of the temple deity surging like a storm. Li Che's gaze fell on the gigantic golden statue.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly King..." Li Che murmured, looking at the statue's benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, the originally smiling face of the statue suddenly changed, becoming a furious and fearful expression, as if the roar of heaven and earth was about to shatter and destroy one's divine sense! Li Che was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This change of expression... was too fast, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>When looking at Xixia, it was a benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>When seeing him, the Ox Demon, it became a furious and fearful expression, as if it was about to subdue a demon.</p><p></p><p>He, the Ox Demon... was not really a demon at all, was he?</p><p></p><p>Li Che removed his hat and mask, dissipating the aura around him, and did not make the statue's expression change back.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also at a loss, looking at Xixia, his brow furrowing as he immediately noticed Xixia's current state.</p><p></p><p>The "Untainted Heart" divine nature that he had cultivated for Xixia had been exhausted! With the depletion of the Untainted Heart divine nature, the golden radiance no longer poured down.</p><p></p><p>"So it's not that Xixia can't take it, but that it's not enough..." Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he, Li Che, had not come, Xixia's opportunity might have ended here.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I came."</p><p></p><p>"This family can't do without me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a step forward, appearing behind Xixia, and placed his palm on her small back.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the furious and fearful statue.</p><p></p><p>"Let you glare at me!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit in his chest pounded, and the Untainted Heart divine nature flowed out calmly and gently, seeping into Xixia's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't dare to output the Untainted Heart divine nature too violently, afraid that the divine energy would be too fierce and harm Xixia.</p><p></p><p>With the replenishment of the Untainted Heart divine nature, the golden radiance that had almost dissipated...</p><p></p><p>Began to gather again.</p><p></p><p>One golden light orb after another appeared around Xixia, and they continued to bathe Xixia's flesh, bones, and other parts! Li Che felt the Untainted Heart divine nature in his body rapidly depleting. Fortunately, he had forged the Untainted Heart Divine Foundation, so the total divine energy was much more than before.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom...</p><p></p><p>The golden light continued to pour down.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden light balls condensed around Xixia, more and more, and Li Che carefully counted them, there were over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be amazed, so many... were they all opportunities for Xixia?</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, these golden light orbs fused together.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>They transformed into a massive golden light orb!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xixia's body began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Her little face was suddenly filled with tears, and she finally opened her mouth and let out a wailing cry.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what sad thing she had seen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He also felt that the depletion rate of his Untainted Heart Dao Fruit's Untainted divine nature was a bit fast.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had condensed the Untainted Heart Divine Foundation, at this moment, it was almost exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed, this was all the Untainted Heart he had accumulated.</p><p></p><p>As a father, this was all he could do.</p><p></p><p>When the last trace of Untainted Heart divine nature entered Xixia's body, summoning the pouring golden light.</p><p></p><p>The father-daughter collaboration was just this much.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was satisfied, as he had forcibly raised the opportunities Xixia could obtain by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>The harvest... would certainly be extremely bountiful!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! When the myriad golden radiance pouring down from the statue finally dissipated,</p><p></p><p>The opportunity that had condensed from the fusion of the hundred golden light orbs around Xixia...</p><p></p><p>Gradually began to lose its luster.</p><p></p><p>A scorching heat suddenly erupted! Then, it was terrifyingly intense heat!</p><p></p><p>Frantically shooting airflows, surging heat waves, as if a giant fire python was spitting its forked tongue, the scorching heat rolling, fierce winds blowing! Making Li Che's clothes barely cling to his body.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the golden spear suspended beside Xixia, with its spearhead flickering with purple flames, like a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>The concentrated divine energy assaulted Li Che, making the hairs on his arm stand on end.</p><p></p><p>His arm instantly turned jade-colored.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Craftsmanship: Thousand Separation Hands activated! Capturing the scorching and searing divine energy in the air, it instantly conveyed information to his mind, weaving a vision before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>【Divine Weapon (Four Sovereigns Superior Grade): Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear】</p><p></p><p>It's almost 50,000 words now, still running naked, the recommendation hasn't been voted up yet, everyone please support Old Li with monthly votes, recommendations, and continued reading!

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I might die..."</p><p></p><p>"How could I possibly die?!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes were bloodshot, and his previously turbulent martial will suddenly became resolute and unbreakable.</p><p></p><p>The threat of death was indeed present.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>As a grand master, how could he waver in the face of a little danger? Xue Dufu felt that he had been living too comfortably lately, losing his familiarity and perception of danger.</p><p></p><p>Countless silver-bright spirit qi tore through the air, stirring up the airflow and making Xue Dufu's dark hair flutter.</p><p></p><p>The spirit qi was constantly gathering at the gaps in his arms.</p><p></p><p>It was as if bones, meridians, and blood were being born there!</p><p></p><p>Truly, two brand new arms seemed to have grown out of the gaps in Xue Dufu's arms!</p><p></p><p>Solidified spirit qi arms! Although the divine monkey had forcibly shattered his single arm, as a grand martial arts master, Xue Dufu still had ways to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Half of Xue Dufu's face was swollen, giving him a ferocious appearance. As a grand martial arts master, he was actually beaten by a monkey, and his face was slapped - could he endure this? No, he could not! He must kill this monkey! Xue Dufu roared.</p><p></p><p>In his dantian, the great elixir in his body seemed to be violently compressed, then suddenly exploded, with terrifying spirit qi gushing out from every pore on his body!</p><p></p><p>The spirit qi around him was tinged with a layer of red, becoming frenzied and turbulent - this was a fighting method where a grand martial arts master burned his life force to the fullest. The secret art of blood sacrifice!</p><p></p><p>Making the spirit qi even more violent, making the martial will even more formidable! Rumbling—</p><p></p><p>In the entire ruined pit, countless blood-colored spirit qi coiled around Xue Dufu, similar to about three-quarters of the blood qi aura surrounding the divine monkey!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu tilted his head back, his scattered hair whipping wildly in the deep pit, and his distorted face was filled with an icy killing intent that could not be dispelled. Humiliation...</p><p></p><p>It could only be repaid with blood!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>The entire Jin Guang Prefecture City had fallen into quietness.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators watching this battle were greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the combat power of the divine monkey from the Underworld to be so terrifying, with one trump card after another.</p><p></p><p>It even had the terrifying ability to transform into the Golden Divine Monkey! It had forcibly shattered the single arm of Xue Dufu, a grand martial arts master under the command of Prince Ping'an.</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Dufu was not among the top grand masters under Prince Ping'an, and was only a newly ascended grand spirit qi master, his refined martial will was almost able to influence the environment with his "divine" presence. This "divine" was the martial will of a grand master! The will of the Dao, man conquering heaven!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Luo Yao and Wang Kuyu, the two Immortal Elders, had gleaming eyes.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao was fine, as his hard power was above Xue Dufu's, and he was confident he could suppress Xue Dufu, after all, he was only a newly ascended grand master.</p><p></p><p>Although grand masters could be compared to Immortal Elders, at the same level, Immortal Elders were still a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>The only chance for a grand master was to use an extremely powerful physique, with lightning-fast speed, to get close to an Immortal Elder. Only then could they have a chance to win.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao was surprised by the endless tricks of the divine monkey from the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Not even a grand master, yet it can suppress a grand master, even to the point of being able to kill one!" Luo Yao's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>"And that final... Golden Divine Monkey? Why does it seem so familiar..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>Not only Luo Yao, but also the nearby spectator Nan Li Huo, had his face twitching uncontrollably, his silver hair flying in the night wind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had an expression as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>That familiar feeling... was too strong! "Is that... the Golden Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit like the power of the Golden Emperor Shrine's temple deity in the Golden Divine Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was always in the divine palace, worshiping the [Seven Treasures Sarira Wish-Fulfilling Golden Pagoda] shrine deity, which was the Emperor's Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the power of the Golden Emperor, he was extremely familiar.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor's Shrine Deity? This divine monkey from the Underworld has had contact with the Golden Emperor's Shrine Deity?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo took a deep breath, exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>To have contact with the Golden Emperor, there were only three Emperor's Pagodas that could have the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>And the three Emperor's Pagodas, one was in the Jin Guang Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was certain that this monkey had no chance of touching the Emperor's Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>First, he could rule out this monkey touching the Jin Guang Prefecture Emperor's Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Then the remaining ones were the second Emperor's Pagoda in the Qian Yuan Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's Pagoda in the Divine Capital!</p><p></p><p>"The Sect's Emperor's Pagoda... has three great divine elders guarding it, this monkey... likewise could not have had contact with the Sect's Emperor's Pagoda," Wang Kuyu said with great certainty.</p><p></p><p>As one of the three major foundations of the Qian Yuan Sect, the Emperor's Pagoda was naturally guarded extremely strictly.</p><p></p><p>"So, this divine monkey from the Underworld... could it be from the Divine Capital?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Capital...</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Lotus Abyss's furious Third Prince...</p><p></p><p>Had it already attracted the attention of the experts of the Divine Capital?! The Divine Capital, was not lacking in the Four Mysterious Temples...</p><p></p><p>"It can only be said that the origins of this Underworld are extraordinary, perhaps different from the small local forces we imagined."</p><p></p><p>"But it is a large force spanning from the Divine Capital to the local area." Wang Kuyu flicked his fly whisk, saying indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"But it's also strange, why have we never heard of such a force before?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao said gravely: "Not only that..."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't the stick technique used by this divine monkey from the Underworld seem familiar to you?"</p><p></p><p>"It is the peerless martial art of the Qi Tian Monastery, the Chaos Qi Tian Staff! There are rubbings in the Qin Tian Observatory, but this supreme martial art is already incomplete, and although it is a martial saint's supreme art, it is rarely practiced, and few can master it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yet this divine monkey can actually practice it... Could it be that the divine monkey is also related to the Qi Tian Monastery?!"</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... could it be from that once grand and majestic Qi Tian Monastery?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao took a deep breath and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As the deputy supervisor of the Qin Tian Observatory in the Dao City, his eyesight was extraordinary, and his words immediately shocked everyone like a thunderbolt falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Tian Monastery? This... how is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu was greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao shook his head: "Of course, it's still too early to draw a conclusion... The Underworld, it's doing the same assassin's work as the Hunting God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"If the Hunting God Sect gets wind of this, the Underworld might..."</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Nan Li Huo, hearing this, had his gaze fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld... the Qi Tian Monastery...</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a divine monkey.</p><p></p><p>Completely washed away the world's perception of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld.</p><p></p><p>It seems it's about to become famous!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the long street, the dust was rolling.</p><p></p><p>A scarlet divine staff was stuck in the ground, and the divine monkey stepped on it, standing steadily on the staff.</p><p></p><p>The golden radiance was extremely dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue, wearing the divine monkey mask, could even hear his own breathing under the mask.</p><p></p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>After he had completely crushed the divine chess piece of the Golden Emperor's Shrine Deity, his current physique...</p><p></p><p>Could barely hold on, he could even feel that under the black robe, a lot of flesh and blood could not bear the burden, bursting out wounds and oozing blood.</p><p></p><p>But at least...</p><p></p><p>He had endured it!</p><p></p><p>Endured the divine chess piece of the Golden Emperor's Shrine Deity! Unleashed its power! This was enough! Lightly tossing Xue Dufu's Qian Kun Jade, he retrieved it into the Qian Kun space, Li Yue in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had casually picked up while continuously beating up Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue originally didn't have this intention.</p><p></p><p>But his hand couldn't help but have a mind of its own...</p><p></p><p>Well, just consider it looting the corpse in advance.</p><p></p><p>It's not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes were bloodshot as he watched the divine monkey shamelessly collect his Qian Kun Jade, his heart bleeding!</p><p></p><p>This is simply...</p><p></p><p>The ultimate humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Slapping his face, robbing his treasure!</p><p></p><p>This grudge!</p><p></p><p>Irreconcilable!</p><p></p><p>A long howl.</p><p></p><p>The silver spirit qi arms suddenly spread open, like a volcanic eruption, the spirit qi bursting out from his body!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the crescent moon blade stuck in the distance trembled and flew towards him, and he firmly grasped it again.</p><p></p><p>His resolute will was burning the void.</p><p></p><p>The martial will seemed to swell and explode, becoming somewhat twisted and frantic.</p><p></p><p>Under the invocation of the secret art of blood sacrifice, Xue Dufu's combat power soared directly! Even if this monkey had a bit of the power of the Six Heavenly Kings of the Golden Emperor, so what?</p><p></p><p>"Come on! Die, monkey!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu let out a long howl.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored spirit qi lashed the ground around him, instantly shattering the ground into pieces, continuously erupting and raising clouds of dust.</p><p></p><p>Blood was also constantly spurting out from his body, the secret art of blood sacrifice, the ultimate sublimation of a grand master's martial will! The crescent moon blade danced as if it weighed nothing, like a madman!  Blood, fighting spirit, killing intent—</p><p></p><p>All unleashed!!!</p><p></p><p>Divine monkey, die! Boom—!!! Stimulated by the humiliation of having his Qian Kun Jade stolen, his single arm shattered, and his face slapped, etc.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu was like a war god, the blood-colored spirit qi surging and fluctuating, the grand master's supreme art being displayed to the fullest, the lone smoke in the vast desert, the setting sun falling on the long river!</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored blade light, like the solitary setting sun distorting the endless yellow sand and the sky and earth!</p><p></p><p>Li Yue felt the ferocious and unparalleled Xue Dufu at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His heart slightly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Under the frenzy of a grand master, risking his life...</p><p></p><p>It was indeed terrifyingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>If he were to meet it head-on, even with the support of a divine chess piece of the Golden Emperor, he would still risk being seriously injured! Exchange life for life?</p><p></p><p>He, Li Yue, the twenty-three-year-old possessor of extraordinary divine abilities and five Dao fruits, with his outstanding talent and limitless bright future, would exchange life with you, this old man who lost two arms? Since you yelled at my daughter... I've already vented my anger.</p><p></p><p>I've beaten you and slapped your mouth too.</p><p></p><p>The compensation you gave was also straightforward...</p><p></p><p>Since it's like this.</p><p></p><p>Only a fool would exchange life with you.</p><p></p><p>Although wearing the divine monkey mask, Li Yue's temperament had become arrogant and overbearing...</p><p></p><p>But he was not a fool.</p><p></p><p>Not only that...</p><p></p><p>In his chest.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao fruit was frantically pulsing with warnings, making Li Yue realize that in addition to the frenzied and blood-sacrificing Xue Dufu, there was an even greater danger! "Hehe hehe—"</p><p></p><p>Under the divine monkey mask, Li Yue chuckled softly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the blood qi aura surged, and he grabbed the blood-red shocking spear stuck in the ground, then shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Clenching and unclenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>In Xue Dufu's powerful and restless martial will perception.</p><p></p><p>The divine monkey... just disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Vanished! Boom—!!! The crescent moon blade slammed down, creating a crack about a hundred zhang long on the long street.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's hair was disheveled, and the spirit qi-formed arms kept pounding the air.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn bastard! Die, monkey!"</p><p></p><p>"Damned abomination!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu gripped the crescent moon blade and kept hammering the ground!</p><p></p><p>He was so angry! Ah! He was so angry that it was killing him!</p><p></p><p>He had opened the secret art of blood sacrifice!</p><p></p><p>At the cost of injuring his vital energy and flesh and blood elixir, he wanted to risk his life to fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>But this damned monkey...</p><p></p><p>Ran away!</p><p></p><p>It fucking ran away!</p><p></p><p>It felt like feeding his hot blood to the dogs!  Depressed, painful! Xue Dufu's body was so twisted that his whole body could not vent his energy, and he could only slash the long street wildly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the spirit qi arms gripping the crescent moon blade exploded, turning into countless vents spreading in all directions, cutting the ground into knife marks.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's body trembled and shook.</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth and vomited a thick mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>Damn, it was so frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>A figure that seemed to be fused with Xue Dufu's shadow suddenly appeared, and a palm pressed against Xue Dufu's back.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's turbulent blood qi slowly returned to calm, and his frantic martial will cooled and quieted down, but an unprecedented sense of emptiness was surging through Xue Dufu's mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu exhaled, spitting out the blood on his lips and teeth.</p><p></p><p>"The main purpose is to protect the young prince."</p><p></p><p>The faint voice came from the black figure.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I was about to lend you a hand to kill that monkey, but just as I was about to act, that monkey seemed to sense something and escaped."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To kill this monkey, we must use the divine secret art of sealing the void."</p><p></p><p>The black shadow said faintly.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu was startled, his face trembling. The black shadow then merged back into the dark shadow and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu knew that he had returned to the side of the young prince.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the qi in his body being soothed, the great elixir of his flesh that was originally in danger of being greatly damaged by the blood-burning secret art was also able to recover a lot of its injuries.</p><p></p><p>But he was still angry...</p><p></p><p>"Damn monkey!"</p><p></p><p>"Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Just as the black shadow said, in order to kill the monkey, he needed to prepare a divine secret art that could seal the space.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, Horse Face, and Monkey King in the Underworld... they all seemed to possess this secret art of spatial relocation.</p><p></p><p>"Similar to the time-space burial art of the Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>But if there is a next time...</p><p></p><p>He must kill the monkey!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's eyes narrowed, his spiritual sense trembling, and his divine nature uncontrollably spreading throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>That shadow that appeared behind Xue Dufu...</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial Immortal Master?!"</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial Immortal Master and a great master of qi and blood... Jie Molie really loves this son, giving him such a powerful protective formation."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's heart suddenly sank.</p><p></p><p>"This black shadow... I don't know what kind of background it has?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's eyes flickered: "It should be a powerful member of the Shadow Guard among Jie Molie's Black Armor Four Guards!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard?</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The most mysterious of Jie Molie's Black Armor Four Guards - the Shadow Guard!</p><p></p><p>Troublesome, difficult to deal with! But fortunately...</p><p></p><p>When they paid respects to the mountain before, this Shadow Guard's Celestial Immortal Master did not make a move.</p><p></p><p>"The purpose of the Shadow Guard should be to secretly protect Jie Haihui, the young prince. As long as his life is not in danger, they will not easily make a move."</p><p></p><p>"If they don't expose themselves, we may not even be able to detect them."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>No wonder...</p><p></p><p>When the young prince Jie Haihui was attacked by assassins from the Hunting God Sect, he was actually able to come out unscathed.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this powerful expert hidden in the darkness, the Shadow Guard, had stepped in and made a contribution.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital city, in the Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a burst of blood qi as vast as a net, like a red electromagnetic field, erupted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a monkey mask, appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>In his palm, he crushed a flying thunder chess piece.</p><p></p><p>He teleported back.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who was sitting on the ground, panted heavily.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Monkey King divine chess piece had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>His physical body felt overburdened, and the feeling of hating the heavens and earth that came with the second tribulation of the Dao Fruit suddenly faded.</p><p></p><p>Only emptiness remained.</p><p></p><p>The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit pounded.</p><p></p><p>Quickly recovering the wounds on Li Che's body caused by the overload of bearing the Golden Monkey King Temple divine chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Li Che not only had a powerful physical body, but with the help of the Dao Fruit, his physical recovery was far beyond that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Removing the monkey mask, Li Che let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"There are still experts..."</p><p></p><p>"The Chess Sage Dao Fruit gave an early warning, and that threat... is even greater than the qi and blood great master Xue Dufu."</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial Immortal Master hidden in the darkness..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>When Xue Dufu challenged him to a fight to the death, the Chess Sage Dao Fruit quickly gave an early warning, letting Li Che know that in addition to the threat of death from fighting a great master, there was another threat attacking him.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che unhesitatingly chose to retreat, beat up Xue Dufu, vented his anger, and got the compensation he should have...</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally left in a very satisfied manner.</p><p></p><p>"In my current state... if I don't have the Temple divine chess piece, even against an ordinary great master, I would still be struggling, not even able to achieve a 50-50 chance, and perhaps only a 20-80 chance."</p><p></p><p>"But with the Temple divine power, I can significantly increase my chances of winning."</p><p></p><p>"When I fully adapt to the sixth-level Golden Monkey King Temple divine power, and my physical body can fully bear its power, I should be able to kill even a great master like Xue Dufu at the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>There are also differences in the strength of great masters.</p><p></p><p>Because he had just touched this realm, Li Che did not go into detailed understanding.</p><p></p><p>But the realm of great masters also has high and low levels.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious is the distinction between great masters who have cultivated the Celestial Immortal Golden Elixir and those who have not.</p><p></p><p>Facing a great master at the Celestial Immortal Golden Elixir level, perhaps only a great master who has refined the Martial Sage's supreme cultivation and tempered his five viscera and six bowels can contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat on the ground, his physical body boiling, and the surging qi waves caused the winter rain falling from the sky to evaporate.</p><p></p><p>This winter rain was a change caused by the battle at the great master level.</p><p></p><p>The flying snow was dispersed and melted, turning into a heavy rain.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Monkey King divine power is only at the sixth-level... my physical body can barely withstand it. If it was the fifth or even the fourth level..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood the importance of a strong physical body.</p><p></p><p>Why it is said that in the cultivation of divine power, the strength of the physical body must also keep up.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... this battle using the Golden Monkey King divine chess piece has exhausted it all... I don't know when I'll be able to enter the Golden Monkey King Temple again."</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if the Heavenly King's qi had dissipated yet.</p><p></p><p>Without the Heavenly King's divine chess piece...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a complete lack of a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King... gave him a deep sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but want more.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a few days, when my condition has fully recovered, I'll go to the Golden Divine Temple again..."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the Golden Heavenly King will welcome me, otherwise I can only hitch a ride with Xixia."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly closed his eyes and began to review this extremely precious battle with the great master.</p><p></p><p>Scenes played out in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He carefully observed Xue Dufu's techniques, learning some martial arts skills in the battles of great masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's qi and blood martial arts cultivation had no teacher...</p><p></p><p>So every opponent became his best teacher.</p><p></p><p>Each review was an excellent opportunity to improve his combat awareness, combat techniques, and combat cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the review ended, and Li Che suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be dazzling flowing light quickly sweeping through the bottom of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he sprang up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers gripped the blood-stained shocking spear, which was wrapped in a qi and blood halo and transformed into a long staff.</p><p></p><p>After a few shakes, the air burst and was smashed into a deep pit, with countless staff shadows intertwined!</p><p></p><p>The Mixed Origin Heavenly Staff! It seemed that Li Che had, with the help of his powerful martial arts insight, just firmly grasped this Martial Sage supreme cultivation that had just reached the advanced level.</p><p></p><p>Even, he had comprehended the killing techniques of this supreme cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Mixed Origin, Heavenly Staff! These were the two killing techniques of this Martial Sage supreme cultivation! But comprehending the killing techniques was not an easy task, and it was not something that could be done immediately after just reaching the advanced level of the supreme cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It not only required talent, but also a flash of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>And under the enhancement of the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit's martial arts insight, Li Che's talent was not bad, and the inspiration...</p><p></p><p>Today's battle with Xue Dufu was the inspiration!</p><p></p><p>The staff shadows overlapped densely, as if covering the entire small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The void kept emitting cracking and shattering sounds, and the surging air howled.</p><p></p><p>Gradually...</p><p></p><p>The countless staff shadows disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was drenched in sweat, the qi and blood of the Furnace Sect Master boiling, with beads of sweat the size of beans constantly breaking and dripping down.</p><p></p><p>"The killing technique 'Mixed Origin Single Staff'...

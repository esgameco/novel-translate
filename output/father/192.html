            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint's Peerless Art!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered as he held the golden foil paper, feeling the immortal and inextinguishable will contained within it!</p><p></p><p>This was also a Martial Saint's will, but different from the one he had just clashed with in the mysterious mist - the former was hidden in the bloodline of the Ji Sea Sect, while this one belonged to a transmitted will, a Martial Dao inheritance left in the golden foil!</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes slightly, he felt the surging powerful will.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not try to activate it.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that activating this Martial Saint's will was not easy. </p><p></p><p>He needed to cultivate the "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" Martial Saint's peerless art to the great accomplishment before he could do so.</p><p></p><p>And after reaching the great accomplishment...</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint's will hidden in the golden foil would assist the Ji Sea Sect, guiding and deducing the Martial Saint's peerless art to the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously a test left by Ji Molei for the Ji Sea Sect.</p><p></p><p>But now, this test...</p><p></p><p>Belonged to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"This Martial Saint is truly generous..." Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered, because he not only mastered one Martial Saint's peerless art, but also his self-created "Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant" and the "Primordial Unifying Heaven Staff" obtained by chance in the mysterious Fiery-Eyed Spiritual Monkey Temple, both of which had reached the great accomplishment level.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Unifying Heaven Staff had even comprehended the "Primordial" killing move.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if Li Che wished, he could directly use the great accomplishment realm of the Primordial Unifying Heaven Staff to stimulate the Martial Saint's will left by Ji Molei.</p><p></p><p>But... it was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly activating it would only waste this opportunity, without any meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint's peerless arts... five of them, all gathered!"</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Unifying Heaven Staff, the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant, the Thousand Mountains Solitary Blade, the Soaring Void Eight Extremities Steps, and now... this 'Subduing the Myriad Dragons'!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che held the golden foil paper, his eyes flickering, the corners of his lips curling up.</p><p></p><p>With the true essence of the Martial Saint, he would cleanse and temper his five viscera, and then give birth to the divine aura...</p><p></p><p>Li Che would then be able to complete the cultivation of the Grand Master realm, and begin to refine the Martial Dao will, stepping into the realm of the Grand Master of the Divine Aura! His emotions surging, Li Che took a deep breath to calm himself down.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he began to quietly study the cultivation method of "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" recorded on the golden foil paper.</p><p></p><p>This was a technique, mainly a fist art, but it could also be integrated into spear, sword, saber, and staff arts...</p><p></p><p>All techniques could be fused! Li Che's breathing became heavier, his pores expanding and exuding, his heart pounding rapidly.</p><p></p><p>His entire being became energized.</p><p></p><p>The more he read, the more he immersed himself, and the blood in his body seemed to be boiling.</p><p></p><p>His emotions were inexplicably surging.</p><p></p><p>Because from this Martial Saint's peerless art, Li Che had a strange sense of familiarity, seeing the shadow of the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a pure Martial Dao peerless art, it had integrated divinity...</p><p></p><p>It seemed... to have the divinity of the seven emotions and six desires at its foundation, and then made different arrangements and combinations to form different martial arts.</p><p></p><p>It could be a fist art, a saber art, a sword art...</p><p></p><p>And the origin was the divinity of the seven emotions and six desires! Yes, this "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" not only possessed the divinity of the seven emotions, but also the divinity of the six desires...</p><p></p><p>It had integrated the divinity of the seven emotions and six desires into this martial art.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be a martial art product that perfectly fused the divine law and the Martial Dao!</p><p></p><p>Like the Primordial Unifying Heaven Staff, it belonged to the purest Martial Saint's peerless art, without involving any divinity.</p><p></p><p>It was a Martial Dao technique, related to the circulation of qi and blood, the use of true qi, and at a deeper level, it involved the subtle control of the skin, tendons, bones, and muscles! Under the feedback of the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao fruit, Li Che's martial dao comprehension was greatly enhanced, although he had not yet opened the floodgates to enter a state of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But just based on the description of the martial art on the golden foil paper, Li Che had some realizations!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant followed the fusion of various martial arts, without the idea of integrating the divinity of the seven emotions and six desires.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Li Che was the one who was most suited to walk this path.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che had forged the seven divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>"Does Ji Molei have the seven divine foundations forged as well?" Li Che's eyes shone brilliantly, deducing backwards, and he could confirm that Ji Molei, who created the "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" Martial Saint's peerless art, absolutely could not have forged the seven divine foundations, and even according to the plan, he would need to integrate the six desire divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>What a huge project?</p><p></p><p>"Presumably... he only cultivated one divine nature based on the powerful divine nature of the Great Divine Deity, and could cultivate the remaining divine natures to the level of nurturing the nature, able to exert the meaning of this divine nature would be enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Che leaned against the carriage, pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"But I... can be different."</p><p></p><p>"Because I have the Immaculate Heart Divine Nature, which can soothe the repulsive forces between the divine foundations, and then forge the seven divine foundations, completing what others cannot."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan told me that the Seven Treasure Divine Sect of the Dragon Abyss Dao can achieve the cultivation of multiple divine foundations, but... they cannot reach the level of forging the seven divine foundations."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, there should be extremely few, if any, people like me..."</p><p></p><p>"Clearly, this 'Subduing the Myriad Dragons', I am more suited to it than Ji Molei!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up slightly, just by looking at it, he understood that he might be more suited to this Martial Saint's peerless art than Ji Molei.</p><p></p><p>Because he could achieve what Ji Molei could not!</p><p></p><p>"The six desire divine foundations..."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation method of the six desire divine nature is not non-existent, it's just that fewer people cultivate it, and the impact it brings is more severe than the seven emotion divine foundations! If one is not careful, they will become a slave to the divine nature of desire!"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Divine Sect's Corpse Deities do cultivate the six desire divine nature..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was wandering, and he had actually collected quite a few six desire divine nature techniques after killing so many Corpse Divine Sect experts...</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the golden foil paper, on the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual Li Che stepped out on the chessboard, and immediately began to practice this "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" peerless art!</p><p></p><p>The entry of any Grandmaster peerless art is by no means easy, let alone a Martial Saint's peerless art, the difficulty is even ten times greater than a Grandmaster peerless art! Many extraordinary martial artists may only cultivate one martial art in their lifetime, starting from childhood, and it would take years to enter the door...</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was different, with the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao fruit, as the maturity of the Dao fruit continued to improve, the Dao fruit underwent constant metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's horizontal tempering talent had been greatly enhanced, and his martial dao comprehension far surpassed ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The more a martial art was in line with horizontal tempering, the faster he could cultivate it, and some martial arts, he could even achieve entry in one day and small accomplishment in three days.</p><p></p><p>This was the extraordinary martial dao talent brought about by the transformation of the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che's divine nature talent was not bad either...</p><p></p><p>Although the Immaculate Heart Dao fruit was not specifically to enhance divine nature talent, it could still give a subtle enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Li Che often complained that his divine nature talent was average, but that was in comparison to his martial dao talent, naturally it was very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But if compared to others, Li Che's talent in the divine nature realm could be called a genius without exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>A 23-year-old prodigy was no joke.</p><p></p><p>Being able to complete the forging of the seven emotion divine foundations in such a short time, although he had the "Painting Immortal" clone's diligent effort.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che's own divine nature talent was also a factor.</p><p></p><p>However, living in this world, danger always accompanied him, so Li Che naturally could not be arrogant, he had to be low-key and humble, and underestimate his own strength, and see the opponent as more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he treat the opponent with due seriousness.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he fully protect the safety of his little family.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It was as if there was a rolling smoke haze! The spiritual Li Che simulated and outlined the fist art of "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" on the celestial chessboard!</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang! </p><p></p><p>One white Immaculate Heart divine nature chess piece after another exploded, turning into a rolling smoke-like haze.</p><p></p><p>"Subduing the Myriad Dragons, taking the form of myriad dragons, with the nature of the seven emotions and six desires as the dragon's nature, qi and blood as the flesh, and strength as the bones, the myriad dragons roar, captivating the heart and soul, magnificent and grand..."</p><p></p><p>While punching, the spiritual Li Che was also feeling the true essence and basic theory of the "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" peerless art!</p><p></p><p>As the fists moved, countless Immaculate Heart divine nature clouds rolled on the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual Li Che stepped his feet horizontally, clenching his five fingers, the airflow shot out, the fist fell and struck horizontally, rising and falling in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>The two fists were like divine brushes, painting on the cloud map!</p><p></p><p>Behind the clouds, the dragon's roar resounded, the azure dragon poked its head out, and the dragon's might lashed out from the mist, like a thunderbolt striking! However, since it was the spiritual Li Che practicing the simulation, there was no integration of qi and blood, or strength.</p><p></p><p>But a thread of divine nature was mobilized, the seven emotion divine natures intertwined, and fused into the dragon form, making the azure dragons behind the clouds seem to come alive, with vigorous vitality!</p><p></p><p>Boom! A punch struck, the dragon's roar exploded, the dragon's shadow undulated and covered, making the celestial chessboard in front seem to be slightly distorted!</p><p></p><p>"The divine nature fused into the dragon form, one divine nature can transform into multiple dragon forms, joyful joy, happiness, ecstatic joy, sorrowful joy... one emotion can have many variations!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly had an enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>With his seven divine foundations, fusing them into dragon forms, he could directly make this "Subduing the Myriad Dragons" peerless art reach the entry level, and then the small accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>As for the great accomplishment... it would still take some time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual consciousness withdrew from the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>On the carriage, the wind and rain were swaying, blowing his ink-black robe.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his eyes seemed to have a dazzling light, and his pupils seemed to have dragons tumbling in them.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Subduing the Myriad Dragons' suits me very well... Although Ji Molei is a Martial Saint, and created this martial art, he doesn't understand a damn thing about 'Subduing the Myriad Dragons'."</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The fusion of this Martial Saint's peerless art and the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant was simply... so in sync!</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant has now reached the great accomplishment, if it is combined with this 'Subduing the Myriad Dragons'... perhaps it can step into the Grand Master realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Help me give birth to the true essence of the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were radiant.</p><p></p><p>"Five Martial Saint's peerless arts, tempering the five viscera, but also need to be distributed..."</p><p></p><p>"This requires careful research, no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>His mood was very pleasant, this Martial Saint's peerless art had given him great inspiration.</p><p></p><p>And also allowed him to unleash the advantage of his seven divine foundations for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as Li Che's divine nature cultivation continued to improve, the power this Martial Saint's peerless art would display would become more and more terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"The six desire divine foundations... perhaps I can also try to forge them."</p><p></p><p>"I have the 'Painting Immortal' clone, let the clone slowly cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flowed bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>The rain in the sky was becoming more and more violent, like the scorching hot waves surging in the Nine Dragon River, completely melting the white snow above the sky.</p><p></p><p>Hearing from the Angry Cliff, the various forces had all fallen into silence, quietly waiting for the mist to tear open, and the result of the Temple God's resonance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also happy to be quiet, finding that everyone was safe, he continued to immerse himself in the research of the "Subduing the Myriad Dragons".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also trying to integrate this martial art into the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar exploded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, sitting on the carriage, suddenly opened his eyes that had been closed.</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the mist-shrouded great river.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Zhang Ya and Shangguan Qinghong also poked their heads out.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, is the Temple God's resonance about to have a result?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's face revealed a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>The previous unsatisfactory result of Xixie's Temple God's resonance, and the subsequent burst of Grand Master-level aura from within the mist, had left Zhang Ya with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what had happened in the mist, but she seemed to have heard someone shouting that the young master was dead.</p><p></p><p>Someone died...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's heart became even more anxious, and she couldn't help but worry about her daughter's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... it should be about to have a result."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was also very nervous, puzzled as she looked at Li Che: "Che-ge, how come you're not worried about Xixie at all?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at Shangguan Qinghong, where was he not worried? He had already personally intervened.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since he could observe Xixie's real-time situation in the mist, he naturally knew whether she was in danger or not.</p><p></p><p>Because he could monitor and observe his daughter's safety in real-time, he naturally became calm.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm worried, but... sometimes..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's no use worrying about it," Li Che said gently with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya climbed out of the carriage, anxiously gripping Li Che's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"My lord... it's opening, the thick mist is about to open!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's words made Li Che and Shangguan Qinghong shift their gaze.</p><p></p><p>Not only on this side, but the cultivators of many factions were also shaken in spirit.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they all raised their eyes to look.</p><p></p><p>On the cliffs above, Nanlihuo, with his white hair flying, stood with his hands behind his back. He suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze fixed intently on the mysterious mist.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful aura rumbled.</p><p></p><p>The True Man of the Shadow Guard took a step forward, his entire body shrouded in darkness as he appeared at the edge of the cliff, his dark eyes staring fixatedly at the mysterious mist!</p><p></p><p>Su Huai and the six black-armored Blood Guards were also staring at it, their gazes filled with fervor and unease.</p><p></p><p>The death of the Prince had made them self-reproaching, but the appearance of the Martial Saint's will had both dispelled their unease and filled them with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>This indirectly demonstrated the deterrent power of Wushengli, the Martial Saint who pacified the rebellion!</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu, Lu Yao, Zhu Chaoyang, and other powerful figures also furrowed their brows, staring at the situation within the mysterious tower.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to know what had happened inside the mysterious tower.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! It was as if heavy leaden clouds were rolling, and between the friction, there seemed to be lightning sparking, with the sound of ancient bells booming!</p><p></p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p></p><p>As a Divine Element True Man, the Shadow Guard True Man's spiritual perception was keen. The moment the mysterious mist began to change, he sensed it, his emotions surging.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Flames flickered, as if a phoenix of fire was spreading its wings and emerging from the depths of the mist.</p><p></p><p>Then, it transformed into a Hellfire Lotus Wheel of Golden Light!</p><p></p><p>The flames were dazzling! </p><p></p><p>As it spun at high speed, it began to tear open the mist from the cliff's edge, like the curtain on a stage, slowly pulling it apart to the left and right sides.</p><p></p><p>All eyes trembled, and then they hurriedly climbed out of the carriages, looking towards the gradually revealed mysterious tower.</p><p></p><p>The river water roared and surged, splashing into waves that crashed and shattered into a thousand pieces of snow.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious mist parted in a "人" shape, revealing the scene clearly.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred zhang from the Mysterious Temple, many children who had entered to resonate with the temple deity were visible. Compared to the first dispersion of the mist, the scene was now more distinct.</p><p></p><p>This time, it basically represented the final result of this temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>At the starting point, three hundred zhang from the Mysterious Temple, many spirit children were still sitting on the ground, drenched in sweat, their expressions dejected, some even crying bitterly, grieving that they could not resonate with the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred zhang from the starting point, on the path leading to the Mysterious Temple, the elite spirit children from various places were scattered.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanli, Gongyangyu, Huang Sixiang, Hai Chaosheng, and others were dotted among them, as well as the spirit children brought by Wang Kuyu from the Qianyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Huang Sixiang had gone the farthest, followed by Gongyangyu, then Gong Yuanli and Hai Chaosheng.</p><p></p><p>They were currently sitting in meditation, their bodies emanating divine energies, receiving the temple deity's blessings.</p><p></p><p>This was the third echelon, having achieved a certain degree of temple deity resonance, and they would likely receive blessings such as Seven Element or Eight Extreme divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>The mist continued to part, and another hundred zhang ahead was the second echelon.</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, the second echelon was composed of children from Daocheng.</p><p></p><p>First was Lu Yao's Tao Ren, and then the true disciples of the Divine Sect - Zhong Liushou, Zhou Peng, and Yun E. Yun E had gone the farthest, almost reaching the final hundred zhang distance to the first echelon.</p><p></p><p>However, they still could not step into the first echelon. They were also sitting on the ground, receiving the temple deity's blessings.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao let out a sigh of relief, at least Tao Ren had squeezed into the second echelon.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu flicked his whisk, his expression grim.</p><p></p><p>"Only the second echelon? What a pity."</p><p></p><p>The little fatty Zhou Peng and Yun E, whom he had placed high hopes on, had only managed to enter the second echelon and not the first, which was somewhat disappointing.</p><p></p><p>Their resonance with the temple deity was not bad, but only average.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity's blessings might grant them Six司-level divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the mist slowly parted, revealing the first echelon.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>When everyone's gaze fell on the first child in the first echelon, their expressions all froze.</p><p></p><p>A chill enveloped all their bodies, bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard True Man's eyes narrowed, and even his body shrouded in darkness trembled, his divine energies surging and overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! The Prince!"</p><p></p><p>A roar came from the Shadow Guard True Man's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had sensed it earlier, when the truth was revealed before their eyes, the spiritual impact was overwhelming, like a sharp steel blade piercing the heart, dripping with blood. The six black-armored Blood Guards also let out trembling howls, gripping their saber-axes and kneeling on the cliff, their hearts and gall shattered.</p><p></p><p>A bloodied corpse lay a hundred zhang from the Mysterious Temple, cold, lifeless, and devoid of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Covered in fine dragon scales, although no longer human in form but half-human, half-dragon, there was no doubt that this was Jie Haihui, the son of the Pacifying King!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all eyes were drawn to this corpse. The entire Thunderous Cliff fell silent, only the Shadow Guard True Man and the six black-armored Blood Guards' howls echoing.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was stunned, his face deathly pale and bloodless.</p><p></p><p>Dead... He had truly been killed...</p><p></p><p>The son of his teacher, truly perished in Jinguang Prefecture, the territory under his command.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled uncontrollably, and his every pore was standing on end.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao, Wang Kuyu, and Zhu Chaoyang all took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"So he's really dead?"</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, who killed him? The terrifying aura of a furious Divine Element True Man was being unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya covered her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"He's really... dead?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's expression changed several times: "This is going to be a big problem..."</p><p></p><p>She naturally knew Jie Haihui's identity.</p><p></p><p>The death of Grand Master Xue Daofu in Jinguang Prefecture could be big or small, but the death of a prince... that was too big!</p><p></p><p>Especially the strongest current general of the Great Scenery Dynasty, the Pacifying King Jie Woli's son.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong could only shudder at the thought.</p><p></p><p>However, in the silence, most people's gazes shifted to the area in front of the first echelon.</p><p></p><p>In front of Jie Haihui was a figure that surprised everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was a figure engulfed in three-colored flames.</p><p></p><p>The divine child brought by Zhu Chaoyang, from the Thousand-Foot Purple Qi of the Divine Capital - Tie Shancai! This child's face was constantly changing, sitting cross-legged on the ground, his body flickering with three-colored flames, twisting the air and even burning the mist with a sizzling sound! He held a banana fan in his hand, his expression agonized. Around him, a mighty temple deity's divine energy coiled like a dragon, enveloping him!</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, he was receiving the temple deity's blessings, even its inheritance! The first echelon had the opportunity to obtain the temple deity's blessings and inheritance. The blessings would be at least at the Five Elder level of divine techniques, and they might even receive the divine techniques and divine weapon inheritance of the "Eight-Armed Hell Lotus Wrathful Third Prince" temple deity lineage!</p><p></p><p>Being in the first echelon meant their temple deity resonance had exceeded seventy percent. However...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was not satisfied with Tie Shancai's level of temple deity resonance! "The last in the first echelon?"</p><p></p><p>If not counting the deceased Jie Haihui, Tie Shancai's resonance was at the very end of the first echelon!</p><p></p><p>After all, Tie Shancai was a divine child of the Thousand-Foot Purple Qi divine energy from the Divine Capital! Zhu Chaoyang took a deep breath, his gaze continuing forward.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo, Wang Kuyu, Li Qingshan, Zhu Hongdou, and other Jinguang Branch Sect members were already curious.</p><p></p><p>After Tie Shancai, there was a figure that surprised everyone even more.</p><p></p><p>All their expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be him?"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Fenghuо?! The Qin family's Qin Fenghuо? Just an ordinary excellent spirit child who hasn't even obtained a true disciple position in the Jinguang Branch Sect?"</p><p></p><p>On the Thunderous Cliff, many people exclaimed in surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qin Fenghuо was sitting cross-legged on the surface of the river, with dark circles under his eyes and the corners of his lips raised high. Powerful divine energies fell down, coalescing into a blurred figure.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A strong aura suddenly rumbled from the Qin family's carriage.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it returned to calm. But there was a hint of disappointment slowly spreading.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо was ranked third.</p><p></p><p>But this was already enough to cause a stir.</p><p></p><p>An absolute example of an underdog's rise.</p><p></p><p>However, Nanlihuo, Wang Kuyu, Li Qingshan, Zhang Qingzheng, and other divine cultivators of the Jinguang Branch Sect furrowed their brows, their eyes flashing with confusion and doubt.</p><p></p><p>How could it be Qin Fenghuо?</p><p></p><p>They could not understand.</p><p></p><p>Because this name was not at all within their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Further ahead, everyone continued to exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was genuine amazement.</p><p></p><p>They saw the figure of a bloodied, large-headed boy.</p><p></p><p>The boy had his eyes closed, his entire body covered in blood, with tear tracks on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at him, everyone fell silent, feeling a sense of suffocation, not knowing what he had experienced, what had happened to him...</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's stooped figure trembled slightly, his expression stunned.</p><p></p><p>On the cliff, in the carriage, even Li Che was somewhat horrified looking at Lu Chi at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Little Chi... what in the world did he go through?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Shangguan Qinghong both covered their mouths, their eyes filled with terror and pity.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was covered in blood, as if riddled with countless wounds...</p><p></p><p>As if he had been torn apart...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spirit was shaken, and he let out a breath. "How ruthless."</p><p></p><p>He guessed what Lu Chi had experienced.</p><p></p><p>Stripping the bones to return the father, cutting the flesh to return the mother! What Xixing didn't do, Lu Chi did!</p><p></p><p>And the reason he could achieve such a high level of temple deity resonance was because... he was ruthless enough!</p><p></p><p>"Why do this?" Li Che did not understand.</p><p></p><p>He could not fathom it.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed as his gaze hardened.</p><p></p><p>Because... such a choice was like severing everything, extinguishing all his emotions in the act of stripping the bones and cutting the flesh! This Lu Chi... it seems he has given up on becoming a Huangmao?</p><p></p><p>Exclamations of amazement were erupting all around, clearly many people in the Jinguang Branch Sect recognized Lu Chi's identity.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's disciple, one who had participated in the temple deity resonance the previous session.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the second time participating in the temple deity resonance would be more difficult.</p><p></p><p>But he was actually ranked second! That's right, who was first?</p><p></p><p>Who could be first?!

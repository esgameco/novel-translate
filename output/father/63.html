        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xixis birthday had just passed, and the weather was becoming increasingly frigid.</p><p></p><p>The winter plum blossoms stood defiantly in the cold, dusted with pristine white snowflakes. The bluestone pavement of the inner city's long streets was piled high with thick snow, dazzlingly white.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had seen off Xu You, who had led a team out of the city to eliminate evil forces, and returned to his small courtyard home on Qingfeng Alley.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sat in a wicker chair, drinking aged wine under the eaves, staring blankly at the bare old tree in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, what are you thinking about?" Li Che asked curiously after returning, shaking the accumulated snow off his oiled paper umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's gaze refocused, and he shook his head. "When one gets old, it's easy to space out..."</p><p></p><p>"In a while, the Divine Sovereign will send people to Feilei City to select spirit children... If Xixis safe during this period, she will most likely be selected to enter the Divine Sovereign's sect."</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, I'm... afraid I may not see Xixi much in the future."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sighed, picking up the wine gourd and taking a few gulps.</p><p></p><p>After being with the child for so long, the sudden prospect of a long separation truly weighed on his heart, filled with endless loneliness and worry.</p><p></p><p>Concerned that when he passed on, he would not be able to see the child.</p><p></p><p>"Then why don't you come with us to the Divine Sovereign's sect to accompany Xixi in her cultivation?" Li Che suggested softly.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen rolled his eyes, looking at Li Che as if he were a fool. "Ah Che, you're still too young."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sovereign only allows family members to accompany disciples. Since I'm not Xixi's family, how could I have the qualifications to go with her?" Old Chen shook his head, for he was well aware of the inner workings of the Divine Sovereign's sect.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che couldn't help but chuckle lightly. "Don't worry, Xixi won't abandon you."</p><p></p><p>"Going to the Divine Sovereign's sect is no problem at all..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen shook his head. How could the rigid rules of such a colossal organization as the Divine Sovereign's sect be easily changed for their sake? Li Che and Old Chen chatted a bit more, then Li Che planned to head to his independent workshop to cultivate and work.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could leave, rustling footsteps were heard from outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up, the wind and snow parting.</p><p></p><p>Two figures in crane cloaks stepped through the deeply snowed-in courtyard gate, lightly knocking.</p><p></p><p>"Is Master Li here?" </p><p></p><p>The visitors were none other than Xu Heli and Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Master Li on being promoted to the 'Top Ten' wood carving masters, a joyous occasion indeed, a stroke of good fortune for our Xu family." Xu Heli wore a warm smile, a divine spiritual sword hanging at his waist.</p><p></p><p>His gaze held a hint of surprise and intensity as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli had never imagined that an outsider who had struggled and risen up would become a wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>"Just luck." Li Che responded with a cupped-fist salute.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Xu family did not value this wood carving master as highly as Li Che had expected, otherwise the family patriarch Xu Nanming would have come, not just Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>A wood carving master was not worthy of the patriarch's personal greeting?</p><p></p><p>The ever-astute Chen Daobao, hearing that Li Che had become a wood carving master, suddenly sprang up from his wicker chair, his jaw dropping open in shock.</p><p></p><p>What's this? He didn't even know that he had taught Li Che wood carving. Had he lost his trust? Old Chen stared at Li Che, filled with doubt and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>But being an old hand, he quickly calmed down, keeping many thoughts to himself without voicing them.</p><p></p><p>Beside Xu Heli, Xu Beihu also had a complex expression, the shock in his heart not yet fully digested.</p><p></p><p>"A wood carving master relies on true skill and craftsmanship, not just luck to achieve such a status," Xu Heli said with a cupped-fist salute. </p><p></p><p>"Master Li need not be so modest. I've heard that Master Li carved a 'Three Immortals Riding a Ox Suspending Thought and Sword' sculpture for my third brother yesterday? I wonder if... Heli could request a divine spiritual wood carving from Master Li?"</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred gold leaves, I'll provide the design, and you the spiritual wood. Although Master Li is our Xu family's wood carving master, according to the rules for wood carving masters, the Xu family won't take a cut..."</p><p></p><p>Five hundred gold leaves for a single wood carving. Truly an astronomical price.</p><p></p><p>But for spiritual cultivators, a divine spiritual wood carving that could aid them in their arduous cultivation was well worth it.</p><p></p><p>After all, to forge a divine foundation and cultivate... every moment counted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Xu Heli with surprise, directly requesting a divine spiritual wood carving? The Xu family's attitude and reaction after learning of his promotion to wood carving master was truly... beyond Li Che's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen also furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carefully considered it, and the [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit had greatly enhanced his reasoning and analytical abilities.</p><p></p><p>He quickly understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I just became a wood carving master and spent a lot of mental energy carving that sculpture for Xu You. For now, I won't be taking any more commissions..." Li Che shook his head, declining the transaction.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't want to earn those five hundred gold leaves.</p><p></p><p>Rather, in the next few days, he planned to formally break through to the Meridian Cultivation Realm, so that he could have more confidence in his cultivation of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had said he would take Li Che to the mysterious temple, and Li Che valued this greatly but was also cautious. The stronger his strength, the safer he would be.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's smile gradually faded, not expecting Li Che to refuse, even though the reason was reasonable and understandable.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Still a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll trouble Master Li, the Crane Cry will come another day to request the statue..." Xu Heli restrained his emotions and cupped his fists in a bow.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che returned the greeting, Xu Heli and his brother Xu Behu turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen watched the two leave, his brow furrowed: "Ah Che, this order... you should have taken it."</p><p></p><p>"Feiluo City is likely to undergo great changes, so the Xu family's attitude towards the wood carving master has changed, fearing that if they invest resources, you'll just leave... But if you take the order, at least the Xu family's attitude will soften a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his oiled paper umbrella and smiled: "No matter."</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, I now have the confidence to refuse orders."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stepped into the snow, holding the umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao stared blankly at Li Che, momentarily disoriented.</p><p></p><p>He could not reconcile the calm and confident young man before him with the nervous and timid figure who had once sought his help at the Xu family's wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Has time really brought about such a profound change?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the luxurious carriage, the brazier was boiling.</p><p></p><p>Billowing steam filled the carriage interior.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli sat impassively on the soft chair, gazing out at the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>"I misjudged... I never imagined that the muddy-footed fellow would one day become a wood carving master..."</p><p></p><p>"He has leapt over the dragon gate, a complete transformation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu poured Xu Heli a cup of tea and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"This is all due to his talent... To have produced a genius like Li Nangxi, his own talent must be extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." Xu Heli shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the old master's words, a hint of malice flashed across Xu Heli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>You carve wood sculptures for the third son for free, but you won't even take an order from my old man for 500 gold leaves...</p><p></p><p>What a big face you have!</p><p></p><p>Giving face but not taking it...</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes slowly, Xu Heli said to Xu Behu, "Go to the City Lord's mansion, find Zhao Xuanhai, and tell him about Li Che becoming a wood carving master. Hasn't he always wanted Li Che to carve wood sculptures for him?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just fulfilling his wish."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu's hand holding the tea cup paused abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The scalding tea spilled out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sky gradually darkened, with snowflakes falling like goose down.</p><p></p><p>The biting cold enveloped the world, blanketing the streets.</p><p></p><p>There were fewer and fewer pedestrians on the main street.</p><p></p><p>Although the inner city was more prosperous than the outer city, the population was also much smaller, so when night fell, hardly any people could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, had one hand tucked into his chest, his towering figure like a walking bear. Yet despite the deep snow, he left no footprints in his wake.</p><p></p><p>"This Li Che... has actually become a wood carving master, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>"He is truly a genius, the City Lord will surely be delighted. If the City Lord's 'Thousand Buddha Carving Feast' can obtain a wood carving master, it will surely be a success."</p><p></p><p>Most wood carving masters have been bound to aristocratic families for years, difficult to obtain.</p><p></p><p>A newly emerged, wild wood carving master is simply too tempting.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family is also straightforward, knowing they cannot stop the City Lord's 'Thousand Buddha Carving Feast', they have directly chosen to sell this new-risen wood carving master."</p><p></p><p>"True to their merchant roots, they are truly cold-blooded, only pursuing profit."</p><p></p><p>Glancing towards the independent workshop in the alley, the Xu family had directly revealed its location to him.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I invited you to drink with me, but you refused. Now... it's time for you to drink your punishment wine."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai took a step forward, pulling a mask of an angry child from his pocket and covering his face with it.</p><p></p><p>The blizzard raged on.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have fallen into a state of stagnation, as if consumed and melted by the flames.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat quietly, the swirling snow shaking and swaying.</p><p></p><p>Yet just as the snowflakes were about to land on his hair, an invisible force twisted and tore them apart.</p><p></p><p>Before him, Li Che had carved a chessboard from nanmu wood, the intersecting lines laid out, but there were no chess pieces on the board, it was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>His palm gently rested on the closed chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>In his chest.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit [Chess Sage], trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual awareness soared, the divine lines intertwining and converging in the space between heaven and earth, delineating an invisible chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He saw...</p><p></p><p>At the mouth of the alley, Zhao Xuanhai slowly pulled out a mask of an angry child and covered his face with it...</p><p></p><p>Saw him step by step, approaching the workshop in the alley.</p><p></p><p>Like a black chess piece on the board.</p><p></p><p>Impatient...</p><p></p><p>To move towards a confrontation with death.</p><p></p><p>PS: A bad news, the new book list has been released, rushing to the top three... it will be more challenging. Good news, our background has reached nearly 3,000 fake readings, if we can maintain it, the hope will increase a bit. So, Old Li continues to seek more readings! Tomorrow is Monday, the day to rush to the top three, everyone please support a wave! Old Li is deeply grateful!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

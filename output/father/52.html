        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered, followed by a thunderous roar, and a flash of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Then, heavy rain began to pour down from the sky, landing on the black tiles, drawn by their curved arches, weaving and converging at the eaves into a hanging curtain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had transformed his body using the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" technique, altering his appearance and concealing his aura.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the rain-soaked bluestone path in the inner city, he kicked up splashing water droplets.</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of weather suitable for killing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his eyelids, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and slowly walked along, carrying a large object on his back.</p><p></p><p>A fire was gradually igniting within him.</p><p></p><p>Although it had been over two months, this fire not only had not been extinguished, but had grown even more intense.</p><p></p><p>That night, although he had killed Zhao Chuanxiong, killed Guo Zhan, and killed three high-level blood-refining experts from the Lingying Sect...</p><p></p><p>Li Che remembered that Simo Bai was going to personally come and capture Xixie...</p><p></p><p>If it hadn't been for a powerful expert blocking him and severely injuring him...</p><p></p><p>Li Che could not imagine the danger of that night.</p><p></p><p>So, how could he forget?</p><p></p><p>The fire in his heart... how could it be extinguished?!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the direction he was heading was towards the Jinhuang Pavilion, where Simo Bai had been hiding for a long time after being severely injured, as if he had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che had been waiting, waiting for him to be unable to bear the loneliness and come out.</p><p></p><p>Most young masters, after enjoying the luxurious and indulgent life, find it difficult to settle down and cultivate diligently, to endure the prolonged loneliness.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Li Che finally learned that Simo Bai had booked a luxurious private room at the Jinhuang Pavilion a day earlier, and had also booked the top courtesan to accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Was Simo Bai really unable to bear the loneliness? Daring to leave the Simo Mansion meant his injuries must have improved.</p><p></p><p>But thinking negatively... this grand display, even booking the private room in advance, was it too high-profile, was it Simo Bai's trap? Li Che did not want to think about it.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai wanted to kill Xixie, wanted to use Xixie as a spirit child talisman... Now that he was injured, he might be even more relentless.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Simo family had schemed against the Xu family, causing the Xu family's spiritual cultivators to be recalled to the Spiritual Cultivation Institute, and the Xu family had become vigilant, making it difficult for the Simo family to use the same trick again.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, continuing to stay in the lightly guarded outer city Xu family estate would be far more dangerous than entering the Spiritual Cultivation Institute.</p><p></p><p>At least the Spiritual Cultivation Institute would be safe for the time being. If they waited until the Lingying Sect fully erupted, then the danger would exist, and at that time... Li Che could seize the opportunity to take Xixie away.</p><p></p><p>This was another consideration for Li Che in sending Xixie to the Spiritual Cultivation Institute, in addition to actively cultivating her spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>And it would also free up Li Che's hands...</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a trap set by Simo Bai using himself as bait... he had to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>If Simo Bai had set a trap... Li Che felt that it was probably not for the Ox Demon, the Ox Demon... probably still didn't have the qualifications for a spiritual cultivator to use himself as bait.</p><p></p><p>It should be for the spiritual cultivator who had injured Simo Bai.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case... even better, muddying the waters and fishing, which Li Che loved the most.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, having missed the opportunity to kill Simo Bai earlier, now that Simo Bai had left the mansion, this was Li Che's only chance.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was an intentional opportunity given or not, Li Che had to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The security at the Jinhuang Pavilion was much more serious than when Li Che had killed Lei Chunlian. The patrolling guards, composed of bone-tempering warriors, were striding with intertwined vital energies, like a large net encompassing the area.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" concealment ability had become even stronger, his entire existence almost completely disappearing, his vital energy suppressed to the point of being as still as a dead person.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Jinhuang Pavilion in the guise of an ordinary person, Li Che ordered a seat in the main hall, and requested wine and dishes.</p><p></p><p>The Jinhuang Pavilion had three unparalleled treasures: wine, cuisine, and courtesans.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's pockets were now full, so he didn't mind spending. The wine and dishes were quickly served.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai should not have arrived yet, so Li Che had entered early to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>Eating the dishes and drinking the wine, Li Che was calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gust of cool wind came, and an old man in a gray robe sat down across from Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, it's lonely to drink alone, would you join this old man for a few cups?"</p><p></p><p>The old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slightly raised his eyelids, involuntarily startled.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating martial arts, Li Che's memory had become extremely strong. The old man's face... seemed vaguely familiar, as if he had seen him before.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall that when he had just obtained the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit, he had felt a sense of being watched on the long street, and at that time, he had seen this old man, who had been accompanied by a big-headed little boy with a Nezha braid.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? The big-headed little boy was not here, but Li Che could still vaguely remember the old man's face.</p><p></p><p>That sense of being watched, combined with today's encounter...</p><p></p><p>A coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fingers gripping the wine cup suddenly tightened.</p><p></p><p>He then resumed a normal expression and joined the old man in drinking.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, have some dishes," Li Che said gently, extending his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, this old man should have come to see you earlier, last time I helped you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I stopped that [Furious Crying Ghost], but accidentally got targeted by it. In order to kill that one who targeted me, I ran to the mysterious temple outside the city... Unfortunately, I didn't kill it, I only disabled it, and I also got entangled with the awakened temple deity for a while."</p><p></p><p>The old man put down his cup and cup, bared his teeth, picked up a slice of sour and crispy meat, and said.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious temple? Temple deity? Professional terms... Li Che didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't prevent Li Che's heart from tightening.</p><p></p><p>This old man... was the high-level expert who acted that day?!</p><p></p><p>"Young man, the old man admits that he misjudged you at first... Your secret technique of concealing your own blood cultivation has some substance."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not the old man's fault for misjudging, the divination technique sees the divine nature, not the blood..." The old man muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his deep gaze fell on Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Concealing the breath and hiding the bones, the sudden burst of power to kill some brainless warriors is still feasible, but to become a great hero and eliminate the evil in the city... it's far from enough."</p><p></p><p>"Retreat, young man."</p><p></p><p>"The bait today is too big, you with your bone-tempering cultivation can't control it, even if you burst out your secret technique, you have the strength to exchange blood."</p><p></p><p>"After this is over, the old man will come to find you, and give you an opportunity... As for this city, it is about to collapse, what needs to be cleaned up must be cleaned up, and those who need to leave must leave."</p><p></p><p>The old man finished speaking and no longer spoke, quietly drinking wine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was pounding like a drum! "Senior, this Simubai wants to kill my daughter, I... just want to protect my daughter."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's voice was hoarse and he said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The implication was that he wanted to muddy the waters and kill Simubai.</p><p></p><p>The old man heard this, raised his eyelids, and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know who the one the old man disabled was?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The old man laughed heartily, took a sip of wine, and whispered, "That old thing of the Simubai family who has established a divine foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior is brave, farewell."</p><p></p><p>"One day, your junior will wait for you to destroy the peace."</p><p></p><p>Li Che decisively stood up, cupped his hands, and left.</p><p></p><p>The old man looked at Li Che's back, carrying a large black cloth, leaving without any hesitation, and stroked his beard with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The child can be taught."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain poured down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the long streets and alleys of the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood upright and still, the rain like columns, like a barrage of arrows shooting down on the world, watching a luxurious carriage with the Simubai family emblem slowly stop at the door of the Golden Splendor Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Watching the pale-faced Simubai, supported by two warriors whose blood qi was almost solidified outside their bodies, enter the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was cold and calm.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious old man told Li Che that he had disabled the divine foundation of the Simubai family, and for the Simubai family... the sky had fallen! Now Simubai was used as bait... who was it luring? Most likely those forces that wanted to swallow the Simubai family!</p><p></p><p>In short, the mysterious old man had already warned him that this fishing and eating fish... was not something he could get involved in.</p><p></p><p>"Disabling is not killing... which means that Simubai is the bait, and the divine foundation of the Simubai family may be behind it, planning to clean up the Simubai family's troubles before dying?"</p><p></p><p>"So, there is a very likely chance of a divine foundation battle?!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine foundation battle... indeed not to be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>"But... I'm not going to fight the divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Let the raging storm, let the conspiracy and tricks..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm only interested in that Simubai."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that mysterious old man? Is it possible that he is a powerful figure from the Spirit Infant Sect? Probably not... then it can only be someone from the court or... the Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"But no matter which powerful figure it is..."</p><p></p><p>"He said my cultivation has only reached bone-tempering completion... which means he may not be able to see through the concealment of [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], since that's the case... this bait, I can still eat a bit."</p><p></p><p>Like that Zhao Chuanxiong, he ate it so happily.</p><p></p><p>"Eating bait, the Ox Demon is a professional."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured, even if he can't eat it...</p><p></p><p>He still wants to watch Simubai die.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! As he finished murmuring, he suddenly looked up...</p><p></p><p>He saw that within the Golden Splendor Pavilion, the majestic divine power erupted, countless particles formed waves, causing all the raindrops falling into the Golden Splendor Pavilion to be suspended back into the sky!</p><p></p><p>Cracking and popping, they evaporated in the air like popping beans.</p><p></p><p>Various divine power anomalies erupted, completely enveloping the entire Golden Splendor Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>It has begun...</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked on with a deep gaze.</p><p></p><p>His aura became increasingly concealed, he leaned against the wall of the alley, merging with the darkness, and with the torrential rain washing over him...</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had disappeared from this world.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The electric snake slithered, roaring through the sky!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, dark clouds revealed azure lightning like a spider's web, the bulging veins on the skin of the ultimate warrior! The torrential rain poured down, shrouding the entire Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>The incident at the Golden Brilliance Pavilion was so abrupt that the entire inner city was instantly plunged into a state of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>Those unaware of the various forces at play dared not make a sound or move.</p><p></p><p>In the Xu Family Mansion, in the Inner Cultivation Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Xu You, who was sitting under the eaves reading the "Great Landscape Record", was suddenly startled awake by the thunderous roar in the sky, his body covered in cold sweat. He looked towards the direction of the Golden Brilliance Pavilion, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>From afar, the four massive divine foundations, as grand as the sun, were still radiating the utmost brilliance!</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator of divine nature would have sensed this. Xu You's divine cultivation was not high, and at the age of twenty-four, he had just barely reached the "Cultivating Nature like a Stream" stage.</p><p></p><p>Although he had stepped into the second realm of Cultivating Nature, he had already lost the possibility of assaulting the divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>Unlike his elder brother Xu Heli, whose talent was extraordinary, and who had been named one of the Three Young Masters of Flying Thunder City, had already cultivated his "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" divine foundation to the "Cultivating Nature like a River" stage, not far from forging a divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>"A battle of divine foundations?" </p><p></p><p>Xu You was struck by lightning, instantly realizing that a great event was about to unfold in Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>He did not ponder further on the specifics of what was happening.</p><p></p><p>He quickly turned his gaze to the Inner Cultivation Monastery, sweeping over the young disciples quietly cultivating their nature, and his gaze finally rested on the well-behaved Xiu Xiu, feeling relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xu You was not the only one who had noticed.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Cultivation Monastery, an elderly Xu family matriarch slowly approached, one of the senior divine cultivators responsible for teaching the young disciples, a powerful figure who had cultivated their nature to the "River-like" stage.</p><p></p><p>"Ayu, lock the doors of the Inner Cultivation Monastery, and do not let anyone in. Come back and stand guard with me to protect the safety of the children."</p><p></p><p>The old matriarch, holding a phoenix-headed cane, her face wrinkled like old tree bark, was extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>Xu You hurriedly nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Ache is doing in the workshop... I hope he stays put and does not go out of curiosity to watch the commotion."</p><p></p><p>"The clash of divine cultivators, even the slightest backlash, can be fatal, dooming one to eternal damnation..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You shook his head, suppressing the worry in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Xiu Xiu, come to your Uncle Xu."</p><p></p><p>Xu You waved to Xiu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Xiu Xiu was very obedient and immediately ran to Xu You's side.</p><p></p><p>But behind Xiu Xiu, a large-headed boy immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>"Chizi, come quickly, stay behind me, and we'll be safe!" Xiu Xiu stretched her neck and waved.</p><p></p><p>Xu You glanced at the large-headed boy following behind Xiu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>This boy had a Nezha-style braid, which, combined with his large head, was quite eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but take another look.</p><p></p><p>"Sumu Grandma, whose disciple is this?" Xu You couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The old Sumu, leaning on the phoenix-headed cane, glanced at the Nezha-braided boy and coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Entrusted by an acquaintance..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying vital energy, like a serpent spitting venom, spread all around.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a straw hat and a bovine-faced mask, his eyes burning with anger, the elastic clothes tightly binding his body, seemed to outline every pulsing vein and knotted muscle!</p><p></p><p>He stomped down hard! The vital energy rolled like thunderous rage!</p><p></p><p>Like a sudden explosion of a bomb!</p><p></p><p>The standing water at his feet was instantly drained, like a giant stone thrown into a lake, the rippling water wall reaching several feet high, the bluestone tiles on the ground cracking and deeply indented! Unprecedented terrifying power was unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The raging air currents, in the turbulent waves of water!</p><p></p><p>A figure shrieked and shot out, the splashing semi-transparent water distorting into a blurred human form, the divine energy violently fluctuating and manifesting.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai, soaked to the bone like a drowned rat, had long lost the calm and composure he had when facing Li Che.</p><p></p><p>As he was single-mindedly trying to flee towards the city outskirts...</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that halfway, such a terrifying vital energy would suddenly erupt!</p><p></p><p>Transcending Meridians realm! A Transcending Meridians martial artist... had ambushed him in advance?!</p><p></p><p>Whose family's?</p><p></p><p>No... how could a Transcending Meridians martial artist detect the traces of his divine energy-powered evasion technique?!</p><p></p><p>This secret technique was passed down by the divine foundation's old patriarch, and under the right time and place, no divine cultivator... could possibly track his whereabouts during the evasion!</p><p></p><p>Splash...</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai slid several meters in the street water, half-kneeling on the ground, panting heavily, the rain water distorting as it streamed down his face.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at that burly figure.</p><p></p><p>The black, trembling, powerful veins, like magma-red vital energy!</p><p></p><p>The pure and mighty condensed spiritual energy rushing towards him!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!!!"</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai stared at the majestic aura, the vital energy burning the rain like mist, and the hazy heat rising, his eyes filled with undisguised murderous intent! But in his eyes, there was also a deep sadness, countless tears rolling down his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai never imagined... that the one blocking his path would be the Ox Demon, a self-proclaimed hero that he should have easily eliminated. How dare he obstruct a "River-like" divine cultivator like himself? Although he now sensed the Ox Demon's aura had reached the ultimate Transcending Meridians level.</p><p></p><p>But a cultivator who has reached the "Cultivating Nature like a River" stage can rival a Transcending Meridians martial artist, and those who have reached "Cultivating Nature like a Stream" or "Cultivating Nature like a River" can easily subdue a Transcending Meridians martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Warrior Penetrates the Meridians!</p><p></p><p>Now, the aura of the Ox Demon is merely at the level of the initial stage of meridian penetration...</p><p></p><p>He, Simu Bai, even though his divine nature has been diminished, still possesses the cultivation of a stream-like perfection! "Wuwuwu... Ox Demon... How dare you?!"</p><p></p><p>Tears rolled down Simu Bai's face, mingling with the rainwater and dripping into the water.</p><p></p><p>"Rainy weather is more fitting for sorrow..."</p><p></p><p>"You can't tell if it's the rain of the heavens or my tears!"</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai did not dare to delay, as the Ox Demon's reckless attack was just right...</p><p></p><p>He had long wanted to kill the Ox Demon! As Simu Bai released his divine nature, countless raindrops seemed to coagulate in the air.</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai sobbed and cried, spreading his five fingers and aiming them at Li Che's head.</p><p></p><p>Across dozens of meters, countless divine natures were manipulated, the "Wrathful Weeping Demon-Subduing" divine nature, with its maddening sorrow and heart-wrenching emotions, launched a fierce assault towards Li Che!</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless sharp, invisible needles had pierced into his mind across the distance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's nose stung, his head throbbing with pain, and his expression seemed to be on the verge of tears. For the first time, he faced the unrestrained attack of a divine cultivator, whose divine nature directly assailed his spirit.</p><p></p><p>The pinnacle of physical refinement cannot forge the spirit, and thus... Martial warriors are inherently weaker against divine cultivators. However...</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not panic or completely lose the initiative.</p><p></p><p>His arm... suddenly burned hot! Jade-colored mist slowly swirled and drifted around it! In an instant, like sweet dew in heavy rain...</p><p></p><p>The mental pain in his mind disappeared without a trace, as if swallowed by a whale, all of it flowing into his arm...</p><p></p><p>The embryonic form of a divine technique, the Immortal Craftsmanship: Thousand Shattering Hands! His entire hand... seemed to have become something not his own, the terrifying divine nature almost uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>The original anger-based divine nature within him was instantly suppressed...</p><p></p><p>But because he had absorbed too much divine nature!</p><p></p><p>To refine and transform it all at once seemed a bit difficult, his tendons, bones, and flesh feeling a tearing pain... even his entire hand seemed to have a will of its own, quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>But... it had alleviated Li Che's spiritual suffering! That's enough! Li Che's gaze sharpened, his body suddenly crouching down, and he bent forward, like a patterned white tiger baring its fangs.</p><p></p><p>With a heavy stomp, the blue flagstones trembled, and boiling water burst forth around his thick footpads, the water like slithering snakes, constantly coiling up along his massive feet!</p><p></p><p>Relying on the powerful recoil of his wrathful vajra-like stance, Li Che shattered countless exploding raindrops that were shot out.</p><p></p><p>As his body touched the ground again, he had already closed the distance by dozens of meters, appearing before the still outstretched Simu Bai releasing his divine nature. And on Li Che's towering figure, countless raindrops had gathered into "little ghosts", as if crawling out from the underworld and merging with the rain, howling and wailing, clinging to his arms, legs, shoulders, and head...</p><p></p><p>Crying and biting at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expressionless face was hidden behind the ox mask.</p><p></p><p>His palm-like hand, five fingers curled like hooks...</p><p></p><p>Boundary-breaking martial technique! </p><p></p><p>White Tiger Raging Wind Fist! His entire body resonated with a chorus, his qi and blood gushing out from his pores, and the countless "little ghosts" attached to Li Che's body instantly exploded into water vapor! And the water vapor... swirled and intertwined with Li Che's fist, forming a patterned white tiger!</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai was horrified and desperate! He never expected that the Ox Demon, a mere martial warrior, not only was unaffected by his divine nature but could also unleash a boundary-breaking martial technique!</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster is this?</p><p></p><p>His growth... is too fast! Previously just at the bone-tempering stage, and now, after seeing him again, he has already reached the meridian penetration stage!</p><p></p><p>And he has mastered a boundary-breaking martial technique!</p><p></p><p>Without an extraordinary martial talent, without decades of unwavering cultivation, it's impossible to master a boundary-breaking martial technique!</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... what kind of extraordinary being is he?!</p><p></p><p>But in the critical moment, Simu Bai had no time to ponder further, as countless divine natures were piled up on his arm, and every falling raindrop turned into a howling and wailing "little ghost", stacking up and covering his arm like armor!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The white tiger fist slammed down, crashing into Simu Bai's arm.</p><p></p><p>Countless "little ghosts" exploded, accompanied by the shattering of Simu Bai's arm, flesh, and bones, forming a dense blood mist! Simu Bai's arm was shattered, and the terrifying backlash sent him flying like a bouncing ball, but he had not yet fallen to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The blood mist parted, and the adorable ox mask closely followed, the sleeves fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Containing the divine-nature-infused crossbow bolts, the poisoned Avalokiteśvara blood lotus, and the high-speed pulling silk threads...</p><p></p><p>All of them rained down on Simu Bai's horrified pupils...</p><p></p><p>Poof poof poof! His body was still in the air when it was pierced by the arrows, turning purple from the poison. </p><p></p><p>Before he even hit the ground, he was dismembered by the razor-sharp spider silk threads...</p><p></p><p>Crashing and shattering like bait thrown into a pond, devoured by hungry fish...</p><p></p><p>He fell to the ground, reddening the rain.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Li Che landed, hefting the black cloth-wrapped package on his back, which was the upgraded version of the "Wood Raven" he had not yet used to kill Simu Bai.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was sharp as he scanned the scattered flesh, maintaining his habit of checking the corpse.</p><p></p><p>But in the pool of blood, he only found a faintly glowing jade pendant with an extremely dense divine nature, not bothering with too much, he muddied the water and stuffed it into his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Pressing down his hat, he darted into the rainy curtain amidst the angry hissing.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

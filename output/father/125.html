        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A dense divine aura permeated the surroundings, and Li Che felt his [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit in his chest pounding rapidly, as if he had spotted something extremely delicious.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to when he first encountered the mysterious temple outside Flying Thunder City and stared at the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spirit Infant Deity Statue].</p><p></p><p>The divine aura of the temple deity had a remarkably sweet fragrance.</p><p></p><p>The two Dao fruits seemed to open their mouths, waiting to be devoured by a giant beast.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath and looked at the [Suspended Thought Slaying Evil Thunder Vajra Deity Statue] - a seventh-level deity statue! "No... it's not a temple deity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze shifted, filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>Although this deity statue gave him an extremely strong stimulation, tempting him like the temple deity in the mysterious temple, upon closer inspection, Li Che realized...</p><p></p><p>This statue was not a temple deity! </p><p></p><p>But a divine wooden sculpture! His hands in his sleeves were already itching, ready to touch its head... but alas.</p><p></p><p>"A seventh-level divine wooden sculpture!"</p><p></p><p>However, after his initial disappointment, Li Che was shaken.</p><p></p><p>It meant the one who carved this deity statue was a seventh-level divine sculptor!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan also sensed Li Che's arrival, slowly opening his eyes and rising from the meditation cushion, as if a divine being emerging from the water.</p><p></p><p>The divine aura in the heaven and earth was boiling, like a person walking out of a swimming pool, with the splashing water making thunderous crashing sounds. "You've arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan turned around, his physical body seemingly separated from the huge divine shadow, like a shedding dragon.</p><p></p><p>With each breath, the airflow in the heaven and earth was drawn and expelled, accompanied by the divine aura.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a true dragon was exhaling, and every twitch and movement of his skin contained a fierce and terrifying power, as if the entire person was transformed into a dragon.</p><p></p><p>True Intent! </p><p></p><p>This was the True Intent of a Grandmaster, a perfected supreme technique, fused into his every action like the divine vein melting boundary.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes were brilliant, like two dazzling fireballs in the night, and with his body movements, the sweat evaporated, his qi and blood scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>"The True Intent of a Grandmaster is to practice a supreme technique to the extreme, integrating it into one's daily actions, movements, resting, and sitting, merging the supreme technique's intent with the self and the divine."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme technique I cultivate is the Forging Body Grandmaster Technique of the Golden Light Branch of the Qianyuan Divine Sect, the 'Eight Dragon Overturning the River Technique'. Each dragon represents a True Intent, and if one can manifest all eight dragons, it can rival that of a Divine Rogue Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan lightly stepped on the ground, gently dragging and sliding, his five fingers curled like dragon claws, his spine arched like a great dragon.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Li Che felt a fierce river dragon rushing towards him, glaring at him with rage.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense that if he made any movement, the dragon would instantly pounce on him, using its sharp fangs to tear him to shreds, spilling his blood into the river! Li Che's hairs stood on end, and the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao fruit was almost automatically activated.</p><p></p><p>With a "boom", his body swelled up, his qi and blood hazy, like a smoky mist surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>Nine great tendons coiled like angry dragons on his back, and his muscles undulated like a twisting dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not fully activate the Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao fruit and enter the Wrathful Vajra state, he only experienced a slight stimulation, causing his body to swell up.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan also restrained his qi and blood, returning to a hunched appearance, squinting at the swollen Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Good kid, you've hidden it quite deep. This qi and blood strength... you must have reached the Mysterious Vein realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Qingshan's impression, Li Che's qi and blood cultivation should still be at the initial stage of the Qi Vein realm, just entering the Qi Vein.</p><p></p><p>But in such a short time, he had already stepped into the Mysterious Vein realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took out a booklet from his Qiankun Jade and handed it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme technique of the Golden Light Branch of the Qianyuan Divine Sect, the 'Eight Dragon Overturning the River Technique'. Since you have joined my Thunder Peak, I shall impart it to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also restrained his qi and blood, his body returning to normal, and upon hearing this, he was startled but accepted it reverently.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for bestowing this technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was one of the few who knew Li Che's true strength, but... he did not know everything.</p><p></p><p>Not only his divine cultivation, but even his qi and blood cultivation, the understanding was not entirely accurate.</p><p></p><p>Now that he knew Li Che had reached the Mysterious Vein realm, he generously gifted him the supreme technique, truly appreciating him and beginning to prepare him for the breakthrough to Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the deity you have been observing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the supreme technique and turned the topic back to the Slaying Evil Thunder Vajra deity statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his sleeve and nodded, "That's right, I don't intend to condense a divine shadow, but to directly enter the divine form realm."</p><p></p><p>"Observing the divine, is a crucial step in transitioning from the perfected divine foundation to the divine form realm. The divine shadow... is just a transitional stage, and one can directly cross over it."</p><p></p><p>"Only those lacking confidence in themselves would condense a divine shadow! Mediocre people do that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan led Li Che to a simple wooden house about a hundred meters away from the deity observation temple.</p><p></p><p>The wooden house was very simple, with a bed, a table, and two chairs, nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took out a charcoal stove and a package of tea leaves from his Qiankun Jade, ignited them with his qi and blood, boiled the water, and brewed the tea, then took out the tea set.</p><p></p><p>After pouring the tea, he pushed a green tea cup, held between two fingers, towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"I have been observing the divine for two and a half years, and my divine foundation has already transformed into the divine form, lacking only one step to complete the fusion of divine intent, to directly cross over the divine shadow and attain the divine form realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a sip of tea and exhaled the hot air, speaking proudly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow twitched. Directly crossing over the divine shadow and entering the divine form realm? Only mediocre people condense the divine shadow! Such a boastful and self-confident statement! But Li Che did not think so, the condensation of the divine shadow realm requires stability and a gradual progression. If he could smoothly transition to the divine form, why choose the high-risk path of direct crossing?</p><p></p><p>"The only regret is that my qi and blood martial dao has not broken through to the Grandmaster realm, otherwise, with the physical strength of a Divine Rogue Grandmaster, I would have a ninety percent chance of supporting the six divine forms, and I wouldn't be limited to just observing a seventh-level deity."</p><p></p><p>"The Grandmaster realm... is so difficult." Li Qingshan's eyes flashed with a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and squinted his eyes, "You started late, only beginning martial arts at nineteen, although you've progressed extremely quickly, I'm afraid reaching the Grandmaster realm will be difficult for you... It's quite a pity, but it's alright, you have a divine daughter."</p><p></p><p>"If you had started martial arts at three like Xiu Xiu, with your talent, you could have reached the Grandmaster realm before the age of fifty."</p><p></p><p>"Xiu Xiu is a divine prodigy, most likely she can reach the Grandmaster realm before the age of twenty-five."</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't mind, smiling, "Although I started late, I maintain a calm and steady pace. Who knows, maybe I'll break through to the Grandmaster realm while just practicing along?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan laughed dryly, "What do you think the Grandmaster realm is?"</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the Grandmaster realm just by practicing? You're really dreaming big, how many Grandmaster martial artists have reached that realm by the age of twenty, yet still couldn't break through until death..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Grandmaster realm requires a certain level of enlightenment, to comprehend the true meaning of heaven and earth, to understand the essence of one's own martial dao, only then can one break through the boundary."</p><p></p><p>"Attaining the divine form is easy, but the Grandmaster realm is difficult to achieve."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan poured a cup of tea for Li Che, "After all, in the cultivation of the divine form, you have the temple deities to observe, the form is in front of your eyes, the path is clear, you can model and sculpt the divine form in your inner realm, and activate the divine intent."</p><p></p><p>"But the path to the Grandmaster realm... is in the vast heaven and earth, requiring the comprehension of the elusive true meaning of heaven and earth, the difficulty is indeed higher."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what the future holds? Senior, is that a temple deity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che squinted his eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Although he already had the answer, his Thousand Analysis technique had captured and analyzed the divine aura of the statue, determining it to be a seventh-level divine wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>But he still wanted to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you guessed wrong, didn't you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a sip of tea, his face once again filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's not a temple deity, I actually want to directly bring a temple deity statue back home to use for divine observation, that way my breakthrough to the divine form would be much faster."</p><p></p><p>"This is a divine wooden sculpture, which I spent a great deal to commission from a master sculptor on Divine Carving Peak."</p><p></p><p>"You have quite the talent in the divine carving art, in the future I'll take you to meet that senior, if you can gain his favor and be taught the craft, your future wealth and nobility will be assured."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, the high-level divine sculptures Xiu Xiu will need for her cultivation, if you can carve them to provide, it will save a lot of resources..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression tightened upon hearing this, "Does Xiu Xiu's cultivation consume a lot of divine wooden sculptures?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, sipping his tea, smiled, "That's definitely the case, Xiu Xiu has extraordinary talent, the sect master wouldn't possibly give her low-level sculptures like the Ten Greats, Nine Luminaries, or Eight Extremes."</p><p></p><p>"The higher the level of the divine technique, the more divine aura it requires... Relying solely on the divine aura permeating the heaven and earth is far from enough..."</p><p></p><p>"Extracting from divine wooden sculptures is the fastest way..."</p><p></p><p>"And the high-level divine techniques are best paired with high-level divine wooden sculptures, for a higher compatibility of the divine aura."</p><p></p><p>"But those wood carvers on Divine Carving Peak... charge an exorbitant price, even though Xiu Xiu is the sect master's direct disciple, there won't be any discounts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his head, shuddering at the thought of the resources spent on this seventh-level divine wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, solemnly making a note of this matter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, it concerns Xiu Xiu's future cultivation, this is a very important matter! Divine Carving Peak, it seems he needs to find an opportunity to infiltrate it, so that he can produce the resources for Xiu Xiu himself, without having to worry about the costs.</p><p></p><p>As a doting father, there's nothing wrong with trying to earn cultivation resources for his daughter, right?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get to the main matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan put down his tea cup and waved his hand, summoning a powerful divine aura around them.</p><p></p><p>"Have you obtained the list?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The lucrative business deal had not yet begun, and he was waiting for Li Che's list.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not beat around the bush, taking out a small booklet from his Spatial Ring and handing it to Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"On the day of the sect entry examination, I observed the Corpse Curse seals of the various strong cultivators present, and compiled this list."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan eagerly flipped it open, his pupils contracting as he quickly scanned through the list.</p><p></p><p>"Is it authentic?"</p><p></p><p>He closed the list booklet and looked intently at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Qingshan was prepared, the impact of the list Li Che presented still made his mind tremble.</p><p></p><p>How dare they?!</p><p></p><p>"It is authentic, but the methods I could detect only cover those who chose the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse seal and below. If they had received higher Corpse Curse seals, I would not have been able to detect them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath, speaking with certainty, taking responsibility for his words.</p><p></p><p>With the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit, covering the world with a divine chessboard for detection, Li Che was absolutely confident in the accuracy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's self-assurance was felt by Li Qingshan, which only made him more solemn.</p><p></p><p>He trusted Li Che and knew he would not do anything...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He hastily scribbled a list to deceive him, but leaving aside the fact that Li Che is not that kind of person, if he later confirms the target and takes action, and the other party does not have the mark of the corpse curse, Li Che will lose trust in him here.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Great Families, the Five Major Sects... the Divine Guard Army, the Temple Guardians... there are actually authorizers among them all?"</p><p></p><p>Almost all the powerful forces in the entire Jin Guang Prefecture have been infiltrated by the Corpse God Cult! The infiltration power of the Corpse God Cult is actually so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>These people have reached such high positions, enjoying boundless glory, wealth and power, why would they still make such a choice?</p><p></p><p>Incomprehensible, completely incomprehensible...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan closed his eyes, even for him, his mood could not be calm at the moment, he needed to calm down.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Qingshan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"On the day of the sect assessment, did you detect anything in the direction of the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's voice was a little hoarse.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head: "No..."</p><p></p><p>"Because, the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Li's divine sense was almost transformed into a primordial spirit, with extremely keen perception. That day, when Li Che used the Heaven and Earth Chessboard to stimulate the detection of the corpse curse mark, he was sensed even before he got close.</p><p></p><p>Just in case, Li Che did not delve deeper, and dispersed the detection in that area.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Qingshan, his eyes slightly narrowed: "Are you suspecting... the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think there are also those corrupted by the Corpse God Cult within the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>This matter could be quite serious, would it affect Xixie's safety?</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes, tapping his fingers lightly on the table: "I'm just guessing, I can't guarantee there aren't..."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I can confirm that among the top echelons of Jin Guang Prefecture, there are definitely those who have been seduced by the Corpse God Cult."</p><p></p><p>"The three Divine Guard Army Generals, the three Temple Guardian Superintendents, the two Vice-Monitors of the Imperial Observatory, the four Divine Sect Elders..."</p><p></p><p>"Among them, there must be those who have defected to the Corpse God Cult."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was very certain, obviously he had suffered a beating and been tricked before.</p><p></p><p>However, the list Li Che gave did not include these people.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was slightly regretful, but he was very sure of his guess.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the list, his fingers gently caressing it.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind those, let's start with the Five Great Families... Ox Demon, you choose a target."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che picked up the teacup and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Che wanted to choose the Qin family, after all, when he first came to the prefecture, the Qin family had put a lot of pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>And he had also killed Qin Yuqing of the Qin family, with a deep grudge against the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>But since the Qin family had taken the initiative to send gifts and apologize a few days ago...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt he could change the target.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the name of Shangguan Zhenghen on the list, thinking of the scene that day when he burst forth his aura trying to suppress Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, tapping his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>"The Shangguan family it is."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The breeze blew gently, and in the blink of an eye, several days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Inside the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The morning breeze was cool, in the courtyard, wood chips were flying and swirling, driven by an invisible force, rubbing on the ground, making a rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the blood qi was like a furnace, the sweat steam rising like clouds.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the swirling mist, Li Che was bare-chested, revealing his muscular and chiseled physique, with perfect lines.</p><p></p><p>His pores were wide open, slowly pushing forward with his fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>The moves were slow, but powerful and heavy, as if he had become a Buddha, adorned with brilliant golden robes.</p><p></p><p>The undulating muscle lines exuded explosive power, accompanied by the rising and falling, like a furious dragon rumbling and roaring!</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—"</p><p></p><p>"Exhale—!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing was long and drawn out, sometimes present, sometimes absent, intertwined and changing, enveloped in golden light, as if his sleeves were fluttering.</p><p></p><p>With one step down, the entire courtyard shook, and the countless undulating carved wood chips were pressed down by the pressure, tightly adhering to the ground, like an invisible air wave pressing down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che finished his move, and countless heat waves gushed out from his pores, like the hissing sound of a boiling kettle! He suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes brilliant like a shooting star streaking across the night sky.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha Golden Robe, finally entering the Transformation Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Li Che's aura suddenly changed, his bones and muscles clanging, his palms pushing and slapping, the air seemed to rise in waves.</p><p></p><p>There was the roar of a dragon and the scream of an elephant!</p><p></p><p>The supreme skill "True Dragon-Elephant Might"! Li Che's divine meridian blood qi suddenly changed, as if he had transformed into a terrifying beast!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The air in the courtyard suddenly erupted with a roar, and the surging air flow only calmed down after a long time.</p><p></p><p>Four Transformations of the Divine Meridian Blood Qi!</p><p></p><p>Amitabha Golden Robe, Cloud Hawk Treading Clouds, White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, Eight Consecutive Bone-Shattering Spear!</p><p></p><p>Four martial arts had been cultivated by him to the Transformation Realm, fused with the divine meridian blood qi, realizing the transformation of the blood qi!</p><p></p><p>With the four transformations of the divine meridian, Li Che only felt that his physical strength had increased tremendously, far beyond what he was capable of when he first entered the divine meridian.</p><p></p><p>"If I reach the Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian... how powerful would I be? Combining the just-learned supreme skill 'True Dragon-Elephant Might', even without activating the [Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra] amplification, I should be able to kill an initial Sect Master, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's flesh and bones trembled, his aura rising step by step, exhaling a breath like rumbling thunder.</p><p></p><p>"There are still five more blood qi transformations, and the five martial arts are all at the Great Master level, not yet reaching the Transformation Realm... but it's almost there."</p><p></p><p>"Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian, and supplemented by supreme skills, breaking through the Sect Master bottleneck..."</p><p></p><p>"Within a year, I should be able to achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"Then I should start collecting supreme skills, perfecting the 'True Dragon-Elephant Might', in order to have a chance to break through to the Great Sect Master realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, Great Sect Master... was too far away for him.</p><p></p><p>Even with the help of the Dao Fruit, he could not reach that realm in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Well, my divine cultivation... obtained from the [Chaotic Temptation Deity] divine nature of Flying Thunder God Capture Zhou Ruoguan, through the absorption and refining of the Ten Divinities Crystals, has also reached the level of 'Cultivating Divinity like a River'... I can start forging the Divine Foundation."</p><p></p><p>"I have forged four wheels of the Divine Foundation with the Seven Emotions, and the Chaotic Temptation Deity has formed one, making a total of five wheels of the Divine Foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"With the pressure of the five wheels of the Divine Foundation, I won't be weak in illusions anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, as for how powerful it was specifically, he hadn't actually tested it in battle.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hurry, there would be plenty of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the sky, Li Che did not continue cultivating, but instead pinched his fingers and drew a line in the void.</p><p></p><p>From it, he took out a bamboo hat, a cute ox mask, and a black robe.</p><p></p><p>Putting on the bamboo hat and the black robe, covering his face with the cute ox mask, his physical body suddenly swelled up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire demeanor underwent a earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>Unrestrained, crazy, reckless, without any taboos! Fierce winds swept, his aura concealed.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon tapped his toes, and vanished without a trace!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jin Guang Peak.</p><p></p><p>At night, the mountain was still bitterly cold, even colder than the early winter.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin, in a peach-colored long dress, her figure graceful, held Xixie's hand, the big and small figures walking in the mist on the half-mountain path of Jin Guang Peak, as if riding the mist.</p><p></p><p>The two walked along the blue stone path, chatting as they went up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin was often amused by Xixie's childish and interesting words, her whole person becoming much brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yin Yin, are we going all the way to the top of the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie looked up, her chubby little face slightly flushed in the cool mountain wind, her long eyelashes fluttering, her big eyes full of liveliness.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your teacher plans to pass on the teachings to you, teaching you Cultivation, Divine Foundation, and Divine Appearance."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin's gentle and graceful senior sister voice was very pleasant to hear.</p><p></p><p>Xixie nodded, raising her little fist: "My father has taught me Cultivation, and I'm already very good at it!"</p><p></p><p>"Father said that to become the Great Emperor Xixie, I need to be really good at both Cultivation and martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin smiled and said, "Your father is right."</p><p></p><p>The two continued chatting as they walked up the mountain path.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the top of Jin Guang Peak, where a black-tiled, arched-eaved temple stood.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xixie reached the top of the mountain, she felt a heavy pressure in her chest, and her little face revealed a look of fear.</p><p></p><p>She quickly grabbed Sang Guanyin's soft hand: "Sister Yin Yin... where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin quickly squatted down and used her divine nature to soothe Xixie's discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Xixie soon calmed down, but there was a hint of curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Mysterious Temple that our Jin Guang Peak suppresses, and your teacher often cultivates here. Xixie, do not be afraid, this Mysterious Temple has long been conquered by the Patriarch, the temple deity is dormant, and no more evil will arise."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin picked up Xixie and comforted her.</p><p></p><p>She really liked Xixie, and naturally did not want her to be frightened and startled.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was not afraid, her big eyes full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps came from the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's third senior brother, Liu Yangyuan, walked out, his handsome and demonic appearance making Xixie look at him a few more times.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xixie, Liu Yangyuan couldn't help but smile, quickening his pace.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is here? The teacher wants you to go in."</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior Brother!" Xixie sweetly called out.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan felt like his heart was melting.</p><p></p><p>The two held Xixie's hand and stepped into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the main hall, Xixie was attracted by the wooden sculpture on the high platform, because the statue of the temple deity on the altar was not a temple deity, but a pagoda! A seven-story pagoda, gleaming in a dim golden color, with a lot of dilapidated areas, seven-jointed and eight-pillared, with a powerful aura of killing intent circulating within.</p><p></p><p>And under the temple deity, there was a cushion.</p><p></p><p>On the cushion,</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Li, in his robe, hands forming a pagoda seal, sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Golden Pagoda of Relics], the temple deity of this Mysterious Temple, containing precious treasures within. Each Sect Master's true transmission can worship the pagoda, and the pagoda will bestow light, granting secret techniques, divine natures, or even divine weapons..."</p><p></p><p>"The more the pagoda's light shines, the more bountiful the pagoda's blessings..."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin squatted down gracefully and gently introduced to Xixie.</p><p></p><p>As if hearing the soft voice, Nan Li opened his eyes and turned his head, his gaze gentle.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin and Liu Yangyuan stopped in their tracks, respectfully saluting, leaving the remaining path for Xixie to walk on her own.</p><p></p><p>Xixie took her little short legs and walked about a hundred steps or so, arriving at the center of the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>He appeared next to Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he bent down and tapped Xixie's brow.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a flame divine mark appeared on Xixie's brow.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie, you have been in our Jin Guang Peak for seven days, and today your teacher will awaken the temple deity to pass on the Sect Master's true transmission divine nature cultivation method to you..."</p><p></p><p>Seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes, seeking continued support! Thank you, Old Li!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

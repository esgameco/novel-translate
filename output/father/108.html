        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on the long-missed Ox Demon mask, and his entire body crackled and roared as the nine great tendons writhed and growled, as if a demonic python was struggling to break through the tough skin underneath.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che walked out of the alley, he tilted his head back, and his eyes under the mask shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Million Gambling Hall... the three major factions in the Golden Light Prefecture City, the power under the Fishermen's Gang, and the Black Snake Gang that has been lurking around my family's place all have the same source."</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], and his physical body grew tall and burly, but he had only activated the first state, and he was already filled with an oppressive presence.</p><p></p><p>His powerful blood and qi almost became like smoke and mist, gathering around his body, as if they had evaporated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Even the divine sense of cultivators would find it difficult to detect his presence. It was as if he had completely concealed his own existence.</p><p></p><p>"However, the divine sense of cultivators can still sense something strange, so they will sweep the area repeatedly, but they won't be able to find the source of the problem..."</p><p></p><p>"If we are within ten meters of each other, my concealment will be easily seen through."</p><p></p><p>"It means that my 'Sleeping Dragon Elephant' is still not perfect enough..."</p><p></p><p>Wearing the Ox Demon mask, Li Che looked at the distant Million Gambling Hall with calm and indifferent eyes, without any joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>On the long street, people were bustling about, some gamblers were coming out of the gambling hall, and new gamblers, not knowing where they had scraped up the gambling money, were stepping over the almost threshold-less entrance of the gambling hall, full of hope.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>A fierce light flashed in Li Che's eyes. He had no good feelings towards this sect, because the Soul Infant Sect was a branch split off from the Corpse God Sect, and the Thousand Infant Sacrifice was something they had stirred up and bewitched.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guangzhi had to sacrifice the entire Fei Lei City because the Corpse God Sect was pushing and supporting it from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Million Gambling Hall have people from the Corpse God Sect? Or rather, is the Fishermen's Gang the power of the Corpse God Sect in the Golden Light Prefecture City?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Shrine Guardianship Bureau know about this? Do the Golden Light Prefecture City's Divine Guard Army know about this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured. Probably they knew, but there must be some reason why they didn't move against them, perhaps they wanted to catch a bigger fish, or perhaps they were afraid of alarming the snake.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the rumors Li Che had heard, the Corpse God Sect had already broken through the defenses of several prefectures and occupied one prefecture as their base. While dispatching powerful experts to attack the Great Scenery Divine Capital region, they had also scattered their claws and fangs towards the many prefectures under the Great Scenery Eleven Regions.</p><p></p><p>Under the Corpse God Sect's secret instigation, armed forces in many regions had already risen in rebellion...</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect was a truly formidable force, with a terrifying threat.</p><p></p><p>So, since the Corpse God Sect's power had appeared in the Golden Light Prefecture City, the forces of the prefecture city could not have been completely unaware of it. They must be trying to catch a bigger fish.</p><p></p><p>"But... what does this have to do with me, the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Since you all know that the Corpse God Sect is accumulating power in the Golden Light Prefecture City, why don't you take action? Are you letting my daughter be targeted... with the possibility of her being harmed? Afraid of alarming the snake?</p><p></p><p>But the Corpse God Sect has already set its sights on his loved ones, on his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't imagine what kind of fate his lovely and lively Xixia would suffer if she fell into the hands of the Corpse God Sect. He didn't dare to think about it, and as a father, he should shield his daughter from all dangers.</p><p></p><p>Let the old father do the killing.</p><p></p><p>The big picture... He, Li Che, was just an ordinary father. In front of his daughter, there was no big picture that could outweigh his daughter's life!</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, and the next moment he opened them, the murderous aura surging like turbulent waves, the mask concealing his face, as if releasing a second personality from within him!</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a deep breath, like a rumbling thunder.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped forward on the long street, his black robe fluttering in the spring breeze. The people on both sides hurried by, but it seemed as if no one noticed his towering and burly figure, no one sensed his presence.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sleeping Dragon Elephant, he was isolated from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's burly figure stepped across the threshold of the Million Gambling Hall.</p><p></p><p>However, after entering the gambling hall, Li Che gently raised his hat brim, and the fierce and powerful gaze from under the mask swept across the scene. His mighty heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Sage] Dao fruit suddenly blossomed, and the chessboard of heaven and earth unfolded before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Ox Demon figure disappeared into the darkness, silently and stealthily making his way deeper into the gambling hall.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom! The muffled thunder roared as the black clouds rubbed against each other, the lightning snakes rolled, and the howling wind whirled! The Million Gambling Hall.</p><p></p><p>The backyard.</p><p></p><p>In the spacious backyard, dozens of powerful fighters had gathered, all of them having reached the level of Qi Vein Penetration. Their powerful blood and qi intertwined, like a blazing furnace, causing the temperature in the courtyard to rise by several degrees.</p><p></p><p>At the front of the courtyard stood a burly middle-aged man with a long beard, wearing a black robe and standing with his hands behind his back. His bulging muscles strained against the black robe, outlining the lines of his muscles.</p><p></p><p>His narrow eyes had a sharp, viper-like glow.</p><p></p><p>This man was Lian Da, the second-in-command of the Million Gambling Hall.</p><p></p><p>His keen gaze had a touch of liveliness, and although his physique was towering and robust, he was like a venomous snake flicking its tongue.</p><p></p><p>Lian Da was a Spiritual Vein Martial Artist, his spiritual nature at the initial Spiritual Vein realm. His spiritual talent was limited at this level, and he was only at the level of a patriarch in a smaller city.</p><p></p><p>But in the Golden Light Prefecture City, where powerful experts abounded, he could only be the second-in-command of the Fishermen's Gang, a lower-level faction.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Emissary, the task you arranged has been successfully completed. That Li Zhengran... has been implanted with the Corpse Curse Seal. If desired, it can be activated at any time to turn him into an obedient 'Cursed Walking Corpse'."</p><p></p><p>Next to Lian Da was a figure shrouded in a white robe and hood, wearing a smooth white wooden mask with only two dark eye holes.</p><p></p><p>Bloody ink had written a huge "Ten" character on the mask, as if it was meant to divide the mask's cross into four parts.</p><p></p><p>Lian Da was quite respectful, even reverential, towards this Corpse Divine Emissary. "Well done."</p><p></p><p>The faint voice came from under the white-robed Corpse Divine Emissary's white mask. Lian Da was overjoyed, rubbing his hands together. "It is our honor to serve the Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"The scheme laid out by our Sect's branch in Fei Lei City... has failed."</p><p></p><p>"The ritual to sacrifice the entire Fei Lei City and summon the power of the Shrine Deity to refine a 'Cursed Bronze Corpse' was disrupted by someone called the 'Ox Demon'."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon... his identity has not been revealed so far, I don't know who he is?"</p><p></p><p>"But we do have some guesses..."</p><p></p><p>"In Fei Lei City, an 'Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal' has gone missing... Senior Yuan suspects that the precious Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal, which should have been used by Fei Lei City Lord Cao Guangzhi to mark the exceptional spiritual child Li Nuanxi, has been intercepted."</p><p></p><p>"The one who intercepted the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal must be the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"Since he cannot erase the Corpse Curse, he can only conceal the aura of the Curse Seal by suppressing it."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon is indeed audacious, daring to take the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal. He will eventually be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiangyang said that the Ox Demon is most likely Li Nuanxi's master, and if that's the case... we'll start from Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>"An exceptional spiritual child, how wonderful..."</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in the mask.</p><p></p><p>"That Li Zhengran is Li Che's cousin, and he has the opportunity to contact Li Nuanxi. As long as he makes contact, the Corpse Curse Seal will transfer to the exceptional spiritual child's body..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi will be in danger, and the Ox Demon... should not be able to hide anymore."</p><p></p><p>The voice carried a sense of confidence and control.</p><p></p><p>Lian Da's hairs stood on end, and a chill ran through his body. That Corpse Curse Seal... could be transferred just by making contact? The Corpse God Sect's methods were truly terrifying! And their infiltration of the Golden Light Prefecture City... was much faster than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>That Corpse Curse Seal...</p><p></p><p>Lian Da's heart sank heavily, feeling the small seal imprinted in his Nirvana Cavity, growing its ominous roots like an ancient tree, constantly extracting his spiritual nature and devouring his blood and qi...</p><p></p><p>Lian Da felt a cold sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, if you perform well, you can obtain the 'Ten Capital Corpse God Statue' carved by the masters of our Sect. The Corpse God Statue can help you extract the corpse qi from the Corpse Curse Seal, so you won't have the risk of becoming a Corpse."</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Emissary seemed to know Lian Da's concerns and comforted him.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, you can even get a boost in your cultivation talent due to the Corpse Curse Seal. Your spiritual nature is stuck at the initial Spiritual Vein realm, but with the help of the Seal, you may be able to break through and become a True Qi Master."</p><p></p><p>"And your physical body will also be nourished by the Corpse Curse Seal, becoming even stronger. In the future, you may even be able to break through the Spiritual Vein and achieve the realm of the Divine Vein."</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Emissary's voice had a bewitching power.</p><p></p><p>"Just look at them, they were originally just Blood Refinement cultivators, but after obtaining the 'Ten Capital Corpse Curse Seal', they have all stepped into the Qi Vein Penetration realm. In the future... the highest they can reach is the Divine Vein!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you desire this power that can help you break through your limits?"</p><p></p><p>Lian Da's original worries dissipated, and he became somewhat fanatical.</p><p></p><p>Below, the Qi Vein Penetration martial artists in the courtyard also revealed excited expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lian Da's body was even trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because all of this was the best proof. The Corpse God Sect could rise like a wildfire, making the vast Great Scenery Kingdom at a loss. Rumor had it that the powerful Marquis Princess Wumo had personally gone to suppress and pacify the Corpse God Sect, but had not succeeded.</p><p></p><p>If Lian Da could gradually rise to the higher ranks within the Corpse God Sect...</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Divine Emissary, won't we be afraid of the Divine Sect's faction clearing if we act like this?"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Emissary replied indifferently, "The waters here are deep, don't ask any more."</p><p></p><p>Lian Da's eyes narrowed at this, and he no longer dared to ask further.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Emissary wearing the white mask suddenly turned his head to look in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Patter—</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, a black object about the size of a palm fell from the corner of the wall, tracing an arc trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Emissary's gaze immediately locked onto it, slightly taken aback. It was a... carelessly carved wooden crow.</p><p></p><p>A crow?</p><p></p><p>Not good!</p><p></p><p>Corpse...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dark eye sockets of the god's mask suddenly erupted with a dazzling and eye-catching scarlet beam of light! Boom!!! A deafening explosion, and in the next moment, accompanied by a howling gush of turbulent flow, the wooden crow was shattered into pieces, with dense dust flying up.</p><p></p><p>The dust was raging wildly in the rushing airflow, enveloping the entire courtyard. Visibility also dropped sharply.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Messenger lightly tapped the ground with his toes, and his white robe suddenly billowed. The Nirvana Palace under the mask faintly glowed, about to summon the divine foundation!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Where is the divine foundation?!</p><p></p><p>Not only the Corpse God Messenger, but also the second-in-command of the nearby Million Gambling Den, Lin Da, was in the same state.</p><p></p><p>His face twitched violently, and he was extremely horrified.</p><p></p><p>Fuck... Where is my divine foundation?! "This is..." </p><p></p><p>"Divine crystal powder?"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Messenger of the Corpse God Sect, however, reacted quickly, his whole body bursting with vital energy, wanting to disperse these divine crystal powders! These divine crystal powders, like lime, will affect the divine nature... making the divine nature operation stagnant, difficult to activate!</p><p></p><p>What a vicious trick!</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, he felt a sense of oppression like a mountain collapsing, making him extremely suffocated, as if his throat was tightly squeezed! Suddenly, a towering figure appeared at the gate of the courtyard, wearing a cute ox-faced mask, appearing extremely bizarre in the hazy divine crystal powder.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom-</p><p></p><p>It was like muffled thunder exploding, accompanied by a "hum and bang" sound.</p><p></p><p>The body of the Ox Demon kept expanding!</p><p></p><p>[Dragon Elephant Vajra]... </p><p></p><p>Angry Vajra!</p><p></p><p>The shackles are broken!</p><p></p><p>The rich blood qi seemed to be spewing and coiling on his body like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>The double pupils under the mask were without joy or sorrow, without any emotional fluctuations! "Ox Demon-!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Messenger's eyes narrowed, and his voice burst out furiously from his mouth!</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to dispel these divine crystal powders so that his divine nature could recover and be activated, and then unleash his strength!</p><p></p><p>The divine crystal powder can actually have such an effect? This Ox Demon... is really as treacherous and vicious as the rumors say, without any heroic demeanor! Boom!!! But just as he finished shouting, the ground of the courtyard suddenly trembled. The Ox Demon just took a step, and the blue bricks were shattered and collapsed. It was as if a blood-colored angry dragon was rushing down at high speed, as if it had completely crushed the obstructing air! Ruthless, frenzied, and reckless killing intent permeated the courtyard!</p><p></p><p>No hiding at all! Boom boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast. The Ox Demon's physical body was unparalleled. Under his towering figure of over two meters, the steel muscles coiled like a dragon contained a terrifying destructive force! Several bursts of blood mist and several bodies were shot out like cannon shells.</p><p></p><p>Those were the qi-path martial artists in the courtyard who were prepared to block the Ox Demon. They all unleashed their martial arts, roaring continuously, trying to stop him.</p><p></p><p>But they simply couldn't keep up with the Ox Demon's speed, and there was even a terrifying and oppressive divine power that made them unable to circulate their blood and qi, and they couldn't even move their hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>Their blood was frozen, and the pressure of the divine rank suppressed them... so they were killed before they could even act. And the Ox Demon killed several people, crossing the courtyard, appearing in front of Lin Da and the Corpse God Messenger of the Corpse God Sect!</p><p></p><p>Under the divine crystal powder, the Ox Demon could still use his divine nature, because... his [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit was bursting forth, and the white divine nature fusing into the [Three-Eyed Angry True Lord] divine nature directly shielded the suppression of the divine crystal.</p><p></p><p>"Coming at me?"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Messenger of the Corpse God Sect narrowed his eyes! He wanted to activate the Qiankun Jade and summon his own weapon.</p><p></p><p>But that Ox Demon didn't waste any words at all, decisive in killing, rushing towards him with a killing intent like raging waves!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon-!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Messenger roared, how did this Ox Demon appear so quickly?!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion, an enormous elbow slammed hard into the white mask of the Corpse God Messenger, the mask made of spiritual wood shattered into four pieces in an instant, and the face beneath the mask was deeply sunken and distorted, wrapped in broken flesh and shattered bones!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Che soon noticed that there was no blood!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the Qiankun Space spat out the Bloodstained Shocking Spear, the scarlet color like a bloody flower blooming in hell.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thrust out a spear.</p><p></p><p>Ding-! It hit the flesh of the Corpse God Messenger, the white robe exploded, revealing a grayish-black, muscle-covered body...</p><p></p><p>As if he had forged his own flesh and blood into grayish-black steel, the spear fell on it, emitting a metallic clang.</p><p></p><p>The powerful force violently impacted the Corpse God Messenger's body, knocking him back like a cannon shell, slamming him onto the ground of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"My body is tempered into a cursed iron corpse! You are not a Patriarch... how can you kill me?!"</p><p></p><p>Thick corpse qi suddenly burst out from the Corpse God Messenger's flesh, the broken mask revealing a sunken, shattered, and frenzied face.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon looked at him indifferently, and the next moment, his eyes emitted a golden smoke-like mist, the mist slowly dispersing from the depths of his pupils, his black hair flying wildly and falling to his waist.</p><p></p><p>A terrifyingly high-level pressure, like a collapsing mountain, heavily slammed onto the Corpse God Messenger's body.</p><p></p><p>But then the scarlet long spear suddenly rose, although it was a spear, it burst forth with endless brilliant sword light! It was like a scarlet three-blade sword humming and vibrating! The Three-Eyed Angry True Lord's Three-Blade Sword!</p><p></p><p>A perfected divine martial art! The ruthless sweep of a sword instantly exploded on the flesh of the Corpse God Messenger's divine messenger. The terrifying power contained in the spear-turned-sword, like a roaring tide, exploded on the divine messenger's body!</p><p></p><p>Spreading and detonating from his head, shoulders, head, and back, exploding throughout his entire body inside and out!</p><p></p><p>His tempered cursed iron corpse, which could not be slain by anyone but a Patriarch...</p><p></p><p>Instantly sprayed out countless blood, flying out dozens of meters like a scarecrow!</p><p></p><p>"Such power..."</p><p></p><p>"This... this is... the power of the Temple God... of Zhi..."</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger of the Corpse God Sect, his entire body broken and shattered, his iron corpse body now like rotten mud, only hanging on to a breath.</p><p></p><p>Poof! A scarlet long spear, like a venomous snake, shot out.</p><p></p><p>Piercing through his head, the terrifying power caused the head of this Corpse God Sect divine messenger to explode like a fragile watermelon, shattering into pieces, with blood mist and air spraying all over the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened too fast, from the Ox Demon's attack to the divine messenger's death, in just a few breaths, and their exchange was less than ten moves.</p><p></p><p>This Corpse God Sect's Ten Commanders Corpse God Messenger was directly... crushed!</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lin Da was still in a stiff state at the moment, that was the terrifying level pressure released from the Ox Demon that had suppressed his divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Making him unable to even move a finger!</p><p></p><p>In the floating hazy divine crystal powder mist.</p><p></p><p>Two golden smoke strands swung, and the next moment, Lin Da felt a violent explosion-like pain, and then lost consciousness, feeling the world drifting away from him.</p><p></p><p>This second-in-command of the Million Gambling Den... </p><p></p><p>His head was directly crushed!</p><p></p><p>In the Ascending Tower state, Li Che possessed the level of the Ten Commanders Temple God, and his combat power had soared to an extremely high degree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Da was only at the divine foundation initial realm, and in the situation where he could not use his divine nature, although his qi and blood could be exerted, how could he match Li Che's Ascending Tower tempering.</p><p></p><p>The faint golden smoke dispersed from his pupils, Li Che's indifferent gaze swept over the martial artists in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In his cold eyes, there was a cold killing intent, without any emotion, as if he had extinguished his humanity, leaving only killing.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers twitched slightly, and instantly, the sound of countless silver threads pulling, accompanied by the bursting sound of broken bones.</p><p></p><p>The upgraded version of Thousand Spider Silk... </p><p></p><p>Thousand Spider Domain!</p><p></p><p>Poof poof poof! These martial artists who had been promoted to the qi-path realm by the Corpse Curse Seal, let out agonizing screams one by one, under the terrifying domain of the divine Thousand Spider Silk controlled by Li Che in the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood vapors rose, swaying in the courtyard like blooming blood-colored flowers in the spring breeze! Wearing the ox demon mask, his towering figure with a reverse triangle back, his black hair like a waterfall cloak...</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was standing in the hell on earth blooming with Mandara.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists in the courtyard were slaughtered! Clenching his five fingers into a fist.</p><p></p><p>Ascending Tower·Thousand Shattering Palm...</p><p></p><p>Threads and threads of divine nature gathered from the corpses, forming black chess pieces that floated around him, all of which he devoured.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the divine nature, Li Che began to skillfully loot the bodies, one Qiankun Jade after another was found and stored in the Qiankun Space.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, the towering figure of the Ox Demon suddenly stomped heavily on the ground, spraying the courtyard full of flesh, and the ground suddenly sank, like a radioactive spider web crack spreading.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's body shot up, landing on the rooftop!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Temple Guardianship Office.</p><p></p><p>Leisurely drinking tea and checking the documents, the Chief Inspector Zhang Lianhao suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The documents and tea cup lightly floated down.</p><p></p><p>The whole person, however, had disappeared, appearing on the roof of the Temple Guardianship Office.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the fleeting towering blood slaughter in the distance! His eyes narrowed, his toes lightly tapped, and the surrounding scenery whizzed by and disappeared at his side!</p><p></p><p>Like a high-speed train, he quickly rushed towards the direction of the bursting aura.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao, wearing the Inspector uniform, clenched his five fingers, diagonally gripping a silver-plated tiger-headed long spear, and his blood qi seemed to turn into real thick mist swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>His Inspector robe was fluttering, gazing far away at the one standing on the roof of the Million Gambling Den.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure like a mountain, his black hair whirling like a cloak.</p><p></p><p>In that cute ox-faced mask, two eyes with faintly flowing golden smoke, as cold and merciless as a deity! It's the Ox Demon! The Ox Demon... has appeared!</p><p></p><p>Is he deliberately waiting for me?!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao narrowed his eyes, a cold feeling surging, his illusory aura bursting into the sky, his powerful and domineering divine sense rippling like concentric circles constantly expanding.</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon didn't even bother with him.</p><p></p><p>With a shake, the moment his body fell, he instantly shot away with an extremely terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Disappeared without a trace! Even though Zhang Lianhao's illusory divine sense quickly swept through, he could not capture any aura or trace, the Ox Demon seemed to have simply vanished into thin air! Zhang Lianhao's face turned cold, leaping down to the roof of the Million Gambling Den.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he narrowed his eyes at the scene of severed limbs and broken bodies in the courtyard, like a hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>The cold spring wind blew through Zhang Lianhao's hair and Inspector robe.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"A lawless rogue."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che's series of actions were fluid and extremely familiar.</p><p></p><p>The speed was at its peak, from the sudden attack to killing Si Mu-bai, it took around ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>But the confrontation within this short period of time was extremely dangerous. If Li Che could not withstand the spiritual impact of Si Mu-bai's divine nature, it might have been him lying on the ground at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The only regret Li Che had was that there was not much good stuff on Si Mu-bai's corpse.</p><p></p><p>The imagined divine cultivation method, the superior inner strength technique, and so on, all left no trace, not even a golden leaf! Unreasonable! This should not be the appearance of a young master from a prestigious family!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Li Che gathered his spiritual energy, his foot heavily stomping the ground, instantly causing a wall of water to explode like rain. His figure had already shot out like a cannon.</p><p></p><p>The "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" was also driven to its limit by him, his entire being seemingly erased of all presence from the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!!!"</p><p></p><p>A piercing scream burst forth from the Golden Radiant Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>Three figures broke through the air, both surprised and furious, parting the rain curtain, rushing over rapidly. The rain curtain was instantly torn apart! Powerful divine will, sweeping across the sky, whipping up wind and rain! They were wearing masks of a tiger, a leopard, and a goat respectively...</p><p></p><p>Under the rain, they appeared extremely ferocious!</p><p></p><p>Surging divine will intertwined, as if forming a majestic river-like phenomenon around them!</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his hat, not uttering a single word in response.</p><p></p><p>Like a black shadow, he swiftly moved along the wall in the raging wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Tap tap tap tap...</p><p></p><p>His footsteps were extremely light, each step barely causing a ripple in the rainwater.</p><p></p><p>Yet despite this, Li Che still felt the three figures were getting closer and closer! Not only that, from the direction of the outer city, a scorching and terrifying divine aura was also sweeping over and pressing down.</p><p></p><p>He was like a conspicuous beacon, unable to hide at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if he fully unleashed the Sleeping Dragon Elephant...</p><p></p><p>"I've been exposed the entire time... Even the concealment and bone-hiding of the Sleeping Dragon Elephant cannot help me escape..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately thought of the jade pendant he had obtained from the corpse.</p><p></p><p>It must be that jade pendant...</p><p></p><p>That had exposed his whereabouts! And these people had actually abandoned Si Mu-bai's corpse and were directly coming after him...</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly sent out a signal.</p><p></p><p>The jade pendant...</p><p></p><p>A good thing!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the rain seemed to have completely distorted. Boom! With a stomp of his foot, his figure abruptly drew a large circle in the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated water gushed out like a water wall in front of him, everything seemingly frozen.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha... It's the Ox Demon... There's something good..."</p><p></p><p>A figure wearing a cheerful laughing child mask, carrying a long spear on their back, parted the rain curtain above their head like an umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Intense divine will permeated the surroundings, strangely bringing a joyful emotion, as if every raindrop contained happiness and delight, making one... unable to resist the urge to laugh heartily.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows furrowed, his eyes extremely ice-cold, but under the divine aura's infection, he couldn't help but want to open his mouth and laugh.</p><p></p><p>The rain, seemed to have frozen.</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain abruptly congealed in the air, controlled by the powerful divine will.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the figure in the child mask, there were two other figures, standing on either side, blocking his escape path.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two were armed with waist-hung blades, one with a burly bear-like physique, glaring with fury, their divine will seemingly igniting the rainwater!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already recognized this person...</p><p></p><p>One of the Three Divine Hunters, the [Wrathful Amitabha] Zhao Xuan-hai!</p><p></p><p>The other two...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes under the ox-mask glanced at the two.</p><p></p><p>These two should be the other two members of the Three Divine Hunters.</p><p></p><p>[Awe-Inspiring Radiance] Zhang Xiang-yang, [Chaotic Joy Bewitching Spirit] Zhou Ruo-guan!</p><p></p><p>Xu You had previously briefed Li Che on the divine bases mastered by the Three Divine Hunters, as their characteristics were too distinct, making them easily identifiable.</p><p></p><p>[Wrathful Amitabha], [Awe-Inspiring Radiance], [Chaotic Joy Bewitching Spirit]! The three divine base sequences were imparted by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>They had now unleashed their divine powers, no longer caring about concealment.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Divine Hunters... All have the identity of the Spiritual Infant Sect, this Spiritual Infant Sect..." Li Che's expression under the mask was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>This city... is rotten to the core!</p><p></p><p>The sky was windless and rainless, divided by the divine powers.</p><p></p><p>It was as if three raging rivers were obstructing and spanning before him.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that Si Mu-bai would actually die at your hands..."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Fei Lei, haha, he died so miserably... Dismembered into countless pieces of flesh... Haha, well done!"</p><p></p><p>The figure wearing the cheerful laughing child mask stared at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... you kill the people of the Lingying Sect? We are the three great abbots of the Lingying Sect, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Come and try to kill us then."</p><p></p><p>The imposing figure wearing the angry child mask, Zhao Xuanhai, sneered and provoked coldly.</p><p></p><p>There was another figure wearing the fearful child mask, not speaking, looking up towards the distance. Tigers, leopards, and goats... all arrived.</p><p></p><p>The six cultivators of the divine nature, all of them cultivating their nature like a river, in an instant, seemed to have formed six great rivers blocking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>They confronted each other, at this moment, the Ox Demon... seemed to no longer be their concern.</p><p></p><p>For the six cultivators of the divine nature, the Ox Demon, a mere warrior... could be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Si Mubai died was probably because he was already injured, and in his hurry to escape, he was ambushed on the way and injured by a hidden weapon... directly killed by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>But they would not, that was their absolute confidence in themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Suspended Thought Flowing Sword, Heart Startled and Firm, Hundred Turning Worried Dream... the Xu family, the Yang family, and the An family..."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Hele, An Ruosu, you and Si Mubai are all third young masters of the Flying Thunder, so eager to strike at your own brother, aren't you ashamed?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che had unleashed the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], his aura directly approaching the level of a cultivator who had broken through the meridians, but under the six powerful divine spiritual auras, he became insignificant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was ignored...</p><p></p><p>Although he was the infamous Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>But these people obviously did not take him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>This is really...</p><p></p><p>Great.</p><p></p><p>Li Che liked that they ignored him, obviously they were confronting each other, and whoever attacked him first and snatched the jade pendant in his hand, would certainly break the current confrontation.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling of being controlled, Li Che did not like.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his five fingers, grasping the jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>He was hesitating whether to abandon this jade pendant, because as long as he carried this jade pendant, he would be discovered and unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che was struggling and thinking.</p><p></p><p>In his chest...</p><p></p><p>The [Unsullied Heart] Dao fruit, suddenly started to beat violently, as if it was about to burst out of his chest.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled, and he felt that the divine nature that had been nurtured in the [Unsullied Heart] for so long, suddenly gushed out powerfully, and forcefully entered the jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>The divine aura in the jade pendant instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And the entire jade pendant also disappeared directly from Li Che's hand...</p><p></p><p>Huh? At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Even the six confronting figures, were also greatly shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes, locked onto the Ox Demon's body at the same time, but they were completely unable to sense the aura of Si Mubai's jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>"The Qiankun Jade is gone, the aura of the old master of the Si family's divine foundation fragment... has also disappeared into thin air!"</p><p></p><p>The faces under the masks of several people changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... what did you do?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally shifted their attention back to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>A divine foundation fragment of a divine foundation cultivator, that could allow them to comprehend the divine foundation and touch the divine foundation, was a huge opportunity, and also one of the goals of this gathering of the various families targeting the Si family.</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Si family, with his divine foundation damaged, would certainly divide his divine foundation fragment before his death, to continue the Si family.</p><p></p><p>And the one who could obtain the divine foundation fragment... would only be Si Mubai, the most promising successor of the Si family to forge the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Li Che's lips under the ox-faced mask, however, couldn't help but rise slightly.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the divine foundation fragment has disappeared? </p><p></p><p>Equivalent to the positioning being lost?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly slammed the heavy thing he was carrying onto the ground, splashing the muddy water.</p><p></p><p>His towering figure, his qi and blood raging like a dragon, his big tendons trembling and roaring...</p><p></p><p>Li Che swept his gaze over those cultivators of the divine nature who obviously did not take him seriously...</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, I'll give you a big surprise!"</p><p></p><p>"Feel the art of explosion."</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his voice, deep and full of madness.</p><p></p><p>The black cloth was lifted, Li Che single-handedly shouldered that enhanced [Crow of the Wood]...</p><p></p><p>It was seen that the cylindrical belly made of superior ebony wood, had five black metal round tubes protruding, and the belly was filled with thumb-sized [Crows of the Wood], neatly arranged.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's arms trembled with big tendons, the surging qi and inner strength, were crazily infused into the strange mechanism he was shouldering, aiming at them...</p><p></p><p>You have divine nature...</p><p></p><p>I have firepower!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Craft · Namo Gatling · Crow of the Wood!"</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen..."</p><p></p><p>"Enjoy the fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

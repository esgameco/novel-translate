        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Grace of Nurturing the Prodigy!</p><p></p><p>The Grace—! The waves of sound surged like the tide, undulating and echoing, as if transmitted from the distant mountains and returning, resounding at the edges of everyone's eardrums!</p><p></p><p>Like a thunderclap behind the clouds! Clamorous, shocking, envious, eyes reddening...</p><p></p><p>Almost every kind of emotion burst forth in an instant, and even many cultivators could not control the seven emotions and six desires of their spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>Causing various spiritual energies to surge and intertwine, forming a storm that permeated the entire Shenzhong Sect!</p><p></p><p>Blessed are the parents of a daughter!</p><p></p><p>This can truly be said to be the parents being blessed with unparalleled wealth and honor because they raised Xixia, the true disciple of the Sect Master, who was granted the Nine Luminous Divine Weapons, the Eight-Tier Martial Elixir, and the permit to enter and exit the Sect!</p><p></p><p>What does this signify? It shows that Li Che and Zhang Ya, this married couple, have a "get-out-of-jail-free card".</p><p></p><p>Even if they committed a crime in the prefecture city, they could take refuge within the Sect using the permit to enter and exit, and obtain protection. As for the ten thousand taels of gold and the three shops in the prefecture city, they were also not bad, enough to make the Li family a wealthy clan in the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Liehuo had a warm smile on his face, his sleeves billowing as the wind blew through them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly taken aback, then a smile appeared on the corners of his lips as he pulled the slightly dazed Zhang Ya, who had been overwhelmed by the sudden wealth.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Li Che, who had even developed the Qiankun Jade of a Void Cultivator, this level of wealth was still something Zhang Ya could accept calmly.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Ya was not like that, this was the first time she had been struck in the head by such wealth.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Luminous Divine Weapons, the Eight-Extreme Martial Elixir, she had no great concept of them.</p><p></p><p>Just the ten thousand taels of gold and the three shops in the prefecture city... completely dazzled her.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Master, for the gifts."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his fists and bowed in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hurriedly imitated him, also bowing in response.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo looked at the honest and upright couple, and the warmth in his eyes grew even deeper, greatly appreciating them.</p><p></p><p>"The rest of the gifts are ordinary, but that permit to enter and exit the Sect should be more useful for you. If you miss Xixia, you can use this permit to go to the Jinguang Peak of the Sect."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said warmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che thanked the Sect Master again. Indeed, this permit to enter and exit was extremely important.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was just ordinary, after all, Li Che had left a flying lightning chess piece on Xixia, so he could just move and go see her.</p><p></p><p>But for Zhang Ya, the mother, if she didn't have this permit to enter and exit, she would have to be separated from her daughter for a very, very long time...</p><p></p><p>Cultivators cultivate without regard for days and months, and as a mother, how much Zhang Ya must miss Xixia.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che was truly grateful to Sect Master Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo returned Xixia to Li Che and Zhang Ya: "Three days later, someone will come to take Xixia up the mountain, and you can follow and send her up the mountain."</p><p></p><p>"After that, every month, with the permit to enter and exit the Sect, you can go to Jinguang Peak to accompany Xixia twice."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hugged Xixia, and the family of three thanked Sect Master Nan Liehuo together.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo looked at them with a slightly dazed expression, the sweet family of three, then came back to his senses, and a trace of envy and sorrow flashed unconsciously in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, three days later, prepare for the ceremony of becoming my disciple, remember to address me as 'Master' then."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master!" Xixia called out cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo was at a loss for words, then suddenly burst into laughter, truly a clever and quick-witted little rascal.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo lightly tapped Xixia's head three times with his palm, then with a sweep of his sleeves, he turned and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>"The Qianyuan Shenzhong Sect, the Jinguang Branch Sect, the entrance examination..."</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's family had become the focus of attention, being envied by countless people.</p><p></p><p>However, the attention did not last too long, as everyone's focus returned to the Sect entrance examination.</p><p></p><p>Although the selection of the true disciples from the fifteen top-grade spirit children had ended, the examination for hundreds of high-grade spirit children, as well as more middle-grade and low-grade spirit children, had just begun.</p><p></p><p>For the many parents who had brought their spirit children from afar to participate in the Sect examination, this was the most important matter.</p><p></p><p>If they could be accepted into the Sect, it would be a guarantee for their future cultivation, as the resources within the Sect were countless, and their growth would certainly be much better than in the towns and villages outside the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Li Liang put away his tobacco pipe and came to Li Che's side, first sincerely congratulating him, then somewhat embarrassedly asking for help.</p><p></p><p>Holding Xixia, Li Che smiled when he saw Elder Brother Li Liang: "Elder Brother, don't worry, I've already arranged for your son Li Chongzhou to enter the Sect by boat."</p><p></p><p>Xixia's entry into the Sect was a done deal, but Li Chongzhou was different. Li Chongzhou's spiritual talent...was only a low-grade spirit child.</p><p></p><p>Even entering the Outer Sect would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, now that Li Che had such status, getting Li Chongzhou into the Outer Sect was not a difficult task at all.</p><p></p><p>Getting him into the Inner Sect might be a bit tricky, as the talent of a low-grade spirit child was indeed not enough.</p><p></p><p>But entering the Outer Sect was no problem, he just needed to mention it to Li Qingshan, and Li Qingshan would directly arrange for his admission.</p><p></p><p>As the Peak Master of the Zhenglie Peak, who possessed Void Cultivator combat power, the Outer Sect disciples under Zhenglie Peak were his to command, and he directly accepted Li Chongzhou.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother heard Li Che's words and was extremely excited, grabbing Li Che's hand and exclaiming repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, don't worry, I'll also join the Zhenglie Peak under Senior Qingshan, I'll take good care of Chongzhou, he won't be bullied on the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother's family had raised him, and his cousin had treated him like a real brother, this small favor was something he had long been thinking about.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ahe..." Elder Brother Li Liang pressed his lips together.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother brought the news back, and Liu Chunming immediately rushed over with Li Chongzhou and the somewhat embarrassed Elder Brother Li Zhengran to thank Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran had been a little embarrassed since Li Che had brought him back from the million-tael gambling den, although he had returned to the right path, he still felt ashamed and couldn't quite look Li Che in the eye.</p><p></p><p>However, Sister-in-law Liu Chunming was a bit angry: "Although Ahe treats you as family, he has done such a big favor for our family, it's only right to go and thank him!"</p><p></p><p>"Chongzhou's future is closely related to Ahe, you as the father, why are you so hesitant? Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran remained silent, being pulled over by Liu Chunming.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, Chongzhou... in the mountain, please take good care of him, he's still so young, only three years old..." Sister-in-law Liu Chunming said, her voice choking with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the somewhat awkward Li Chongzhou, smiled and picked him up, saying to Liu Chunming: "Don't worry, Chongzhou... is only a few months younger than Xixia. At such a young age, which parents would be willing to let their child be separated from them if it weren't for the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I just receive the Sect's permit to enter and exit? Later, when you want to go to the Sect to see Xixia, just go find Yaya, and you can go up the mountain together with the permit."</p><p></p><p>Sister-in-law Liu Chunming heard this and covered her mouth, her face flushed red with excitement and tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran stood by and watched his wife's expression, his heart filled with complex emotions. He looked at Li Che and solemnly said, "Ahe... thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said, "Elder Brother, don't be so polite."</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother's wife was also unable to hold back her tears.</p><p></p><p>"Come, after Chongzhou's Outer Sect examination is over, come to my courtyard, we'll have a feast to celebrate tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Auntie, also invite Senior Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>Auntie Shu, holding Xixia, smiled warmly in response.</p><p></p><p>"Li Ge, what about me?" </p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong, with a mouthful of honey-preserved fruit, suddenly called out.</p><p></p><p>"You... just come and have a bowl." Li Che teased.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong didn't mind the teasing, immediately grinning and going to play with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's family had become famous throughout the Tinghua Alley.</p><p></p><p>The news that Xixia had become the true disciple of the Sect Master spread throughout the entire Jinguang Prefecture City in half a day.</p><p></p><p>A spirit child with a hundred-foot spiritual nature, one in a generation in this prefecture! This was a shocking revelation! Li Che's family could be considered a prime example of one person achieving the Dao and the whole family ascending.</p><p></p><p>In three days, the news had fermented even more rapidly, and the threshold of Li Che's Tinghua Alley courtyard was almost worn down.</p><p></p><p>Almost every day, there were people coming to congratulate them.</p><p></p><p>Among the Five Great Families, the Hai Family, the Gongyangfamily, and the Gong Family all sent people to congratulate them and brought valuable gifts.</p><p></p><p>Even the Qin Family, to Li Che's surprise, sent gifts, and it was Qin Haonan, the important figure of the third generation of the Qin Family, who had sent the gifts, the same one whose sister Qin Yuqing had been killed by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, my sister... may have unjustly caused you and your family distress and fear... the Qin Family apologizes."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan's attitude was very sincere.</p><p></p><p>It's better to make friends than enemies, and since Li Che had already killed Qin Yuqing, and the Qin Family had come to apologize, he naturally smiled and let it go. In the beginning, when he came to the prefecture city, Qin Yuqing had indeed brought him no small amount of pressure.</p><p></p><p>But now that Qin Yuqing had been killed by him, and the Qin Family had come to apologize, he naturally wouldn't make unnecessary enemies.</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan Family didn't send anyone, which was not unexpected, as Shangguan Qingliu had been almost killed by Xixia.</p><p></p><p>And Shangguan Zhenghen had planned to use Void Cultivator suppression to oppress Xixia.</p><p></p><p>This enmity, Li Che had recorded it in his little notebook.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to his daughter, Li Che had no petty mind! The Zhenmiaosi and the Qintianxiang also had people come, and they all had the feast.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the major powers in the prefecture city had come.</p><p></p><p>This suddenly made Tinghua Alley the focus of attention in the prefecture city, and the residents around Tinghua Alley couldn't help but click their tongues, each reflecting and recalling if they had accidentally offended Li Che's family in any way.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze brought warmth, and the late spring chill had dissipated, the air becoming warm.</p><p></p><p>All things were beginning to revive, the grass and trees growing new buds.</p><p></p><p>In Tinghua Alley, the spring breeze wafted the willow catkins and the fragrance of the soil.</p><p></p><p>The alley was bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, it was already crowded with people. Zhang Ya had dressed Xixia in new clothes and tied her hair into a cute braid with a red ribbon.</p><p></p><p>She also lightly dotted some red powder on Xixia's brow.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, when you go up the Sect mountain, you must listen to your Sect Master teacher. You know? Don't be naughty, your mother won't be by your side, you have to be good."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, you'll miss your mother, but your mother will miss you too. Without your mother to coax you to sleep, you'll have to learn to sleep on your own at night..."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, you must get along well with your senior brothers and sisters. But if they bully you, you must tell your father and mother, and tell your Sect Master teacher... you're still young, your Sect Master teacher will definitely stand up for you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hugged Xixia tightly, biting her red lips, talking nonstop.</p><p></p><p>There were tears already forming in the corners of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't want to part with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>But Sect Master Nan Liehuo said that for Xixia's safety, she had to live on the Jinguang Peak, otherwise Li Che could be responsible for taking Xixia to and from the main peak.</p><p></p><p>The carriage was already prepared outside, a woman in a pink dress, with bright eyes and white teeth, a divine mark on her brow, sitting calmly on the carriage shaft waiting.</p><p></p><p>This woman was the fourth disciple of Sect Master Nan Liehuo, Sang Guanyin, eighteen years of age, with a complete spiritual foundation. She was also the only female disciple among Nan Liehuo's four disciples, but now with Xixia, she was no longer the only one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also felt a little reluctant to part with Xixia, and the couple, with the already wailing Xixia, walked out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to go, Xixia wants her father and mother, Xixia wants her mother, Xixia wants her stinky father!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia cried sadly, tears streaming down her face.</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted Xixia's back, transmitting his pure spiritual energy to soothe her emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, your parents will come visit you often. You must cultivate diligently... become extremely powerful, so that you can protect your parents in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is a prodigy, she will definitely become incredibly powerful, undefeatable under heaven. She must become the number one in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted her gently. Xixia cried with a runny nose and corrected Li Che, "I want to become the Great Emperor Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but laugh, the feeling of sadness was instantly dispersed, even Sang Guanyin sitting in the carriage couldn't help but cover her mouth and chuckle "tsk tsk".</p><p></p><p>Xixia became displeased at once, "Xixia will truly become the incredibly powerful Great Emperor Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>"All the treacherous subjects must kneel before Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia can set off fireworks whenever she wants, no one can stop her!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and went along with her words to soothe her.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, come here to your shijie (senior sister)."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin's voice was very gentle, with a sweet charm of a mature beauty.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, who liked good looks, immediately looked at her a few more times, but soon she embraced Zhang Ya's long neck and started wailing.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, Xixia will miss you, miss the stinky father, miss the scooter, miss the chicken legs, miss the braised pork..."</p><p></p><p>Xixia kept rubbing her runny nose and tears on Zhang Ya's lapel.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was both amused and exasperated, gently patting her butt, "Alright, go on, Mother knows, every time I see you I'll bring braised pork and chicken legs!"</p><p></p><p>"Made by Mother, okay?" Xixia raised a finger, tilting her head, very seriously.</p><p></p><p>Understood.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhang Ya handed Xixia to Sang Guanyin, and she sat in the carriage behind with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the reluctant Old Chen and the big uncle's family, the two carriages crushed the spring dust, accompanied by the fragrance of spring flowers and mud, and left the Listening Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen watched the departing carriages, suddenly feeling a sense of being drained of strength.</p><p></p><p>Leaning against the door, he stared blankly at the departing carriages.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he picked up the wine gourd, took a sip, and when putting it back, he used the back of his hand to wipe the turbid tears from the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixia, take good care of yourself."</p><p></p><p>"From today on, Grandpa Chen can no longer teach you martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Remember to think of Grandpa Chen..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Peak, the main peak of the Qianyuan Shenzu Sect's Yunzhou Branch. </p><p></p><p>Towering into the clouds, with mist and clouds wrapping around the mountain, it seemed ethereal and transcendent, overlooking the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the branch sect's mountain gate would be located in the Yunzhou city, but the Golden Light Sect's branch, the Golden Light Peak, was an exception, situated in the Golden Light Prefecture, not in the city.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was this Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Peak, due to its proximity to the mysterious temple at the heart of the Nine Dragons River, seemed to be a lightning rod attracting divine energies, constantly absorbing the spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the mountain, the spiritual energy was extremely dense, considered a blessed land.</p><p></p><p>And on top of the Golden Light Peak, a "Golden Light Calamity" was refined, which was the complementary divine object for cultivating the supreme martial art of the Golden Light Sect, the "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Calamity Sword Technique".</p><p></p><p>This Golden Light Calamity took three years to condense one bloom, extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the mountain gate of the Golden Light Sect was located here, to facilitate the condensation of the Golden Light Calamity and harvest it in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>Once every three years, during the yin-yang convergence when the heavens and earth were dark, the Golden Light Calamity would form. Only at this moment could it be harvested, otherwise the Golden Light Calamity would dissipate into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>But once the supreme "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Calamity Sword Technique" was cultivated, the destructive power unleashed would be terrifying. If one reached the true qi master realm relying on this supreme technique, their true qi would be tyrannical and sharp, exuding the awe-inspiring might of the Golden Light Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The two carriages followed the winding mountain road upwards, the hooves of the spirited horses lightly touching the ground, the carriage swaying, quite uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>After traveling for about half a day, and another half day climbing the mountain, they finally reached the large plateau on the middle slopes of the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>On the large plateau, the rising mist from the Nine Dragons River gathered, forming a hazy cloud belt.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a white robe, with his hair scattered, Nan Lihuo sat cross-legged on the blue stone.</p><p></p><p>By his side was a tall and handsome young man, with a somewhat ethereal beauty, who was one of Nan Lihuo's four main disciples, Liu Yangyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the junior sister has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan, dressed in a Confucian robe with wide sleeves, his handsome and ethereal face slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo opened his eyes, and suddenly the entire middle slope became brightly lit, the clouds and mist surging and dispersing.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of Nan Lihuo's sleeve, all the mountain mist dissipated, revealing a vast clear expanse.</p><p></p><p>On the plateau, the two carriages slowly came to a stop, the dust kicked up by the wheels no longer flying.</p><p></p><p>The curtain was lifted, Sang Guanyin led Xixia down from the carriage, Xixia's curious eyes darting around, taking in the sights.</p><p></p><p>Behind, Li Che also led Zhang Ya down from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he got off the carriage, Li Che felt his pores expand, the extremely dense divine energy making his heart involuntarily shudder!</p><p></p><p>The concentration here... was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Golden Light Sect's mountain gate was established here.</p><p></p><p>In addition to overlooking the mysterious temple of the Four Sovereigns, it was also because this place was an excellent cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even had the urge to sit down and cultivate...</p><p></p><p>He gathered the four divine foundations of anger, sorrow, contemplation, and shock, almost trembling instantly, greedily and excitedly absorbing the dense spiritual energy on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's gaze opened and closed, as if he had sensed the flow of spiritual energy on the mountain, his gaze filled with doubt.</p><p></p><p>However, the flow of spiritual energy soon returned to calm, it turned out that Li Che had restrained his greed.</p><p></p><p>As the highest cultivator in the Shenzu Sect, Nan Lihuo was almost about to condense his spiritual consciousness, his perception was extremely acute.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking too much, Nan Lihuo and Liu Yangyuan walked over, with warm smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's parents, this is my third disciple, Liu Yangyuan, and this is Sang Guanyin, I believe you are also acquainted with her."</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya nodded and greeted Liu Yangyuan with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"I also have a second disciple, but he has gone to the main sect to cultivate, and doesn't often return."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo said.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Teacher, Sister Yinyin said you have four disciples, where is the eldest disciple?" </p><p></p><p>Xixia, held by the hand of Sang Guanyin, tilted her head and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's gentle expression did not change, but Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin's faces changed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dao Elder Brother... has already perished."</p><p></p><p>Xixia immediately pursed her lips, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly apologized for Xixia, but in his heart he was startled, making a mental note of this matter.</p><p></p><p>As the sect master's eldest disciple, how could he have perished so easily? Li Che's brow furrowed slightly, this matter... needed to be clarified.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Li Che would also be worried about Xixia's safety.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Light Peak, it seems not as safe as imagined!</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, the dead are gone." Nan Lihuo calmly took Xixia's hand and led her to tour the main peak where the sect master cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin followed along, Li Che and Zhang Ya also walked behind.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Nan Lihuo was also introducing it to Li Che and Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>He introduced Xixia's future residence, since Xixia was too young, she would be cared for by Sang Guanyin and live together.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the cold and beautiful Sang Guanyin, who seemed like a goddess, and clasped his hands, "Then I must trouble Senior Sister Sang to take good care of Xixia, Xixia is mischievous, please bear with her."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin nodded in greeting, "Xixia and I hit it off immediately, I will take good care of her, in the Golden Light Sect, no one dares to bully her."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the group went to the ancestral hall, Nan Lihuo led Xixia to pay respects to the Sect Patriarch, and thus completed Xixia's formal ceremony of entering the sect.</p><p></p><p>It was quite simple, without too many tedious formalities.</p><p></p><p>As the day drew to a close, the sunset was like fire.</p><p></p><p>Li Che received the reward that Nan Lihuo had promised on the day of the sect entry examination, and then he and Zhang Ya prepared to take their leave.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was full of reluctance, clinging to Zhang Ya's long legs and refusing to let go.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya also comforted her with tears for a while before the couple finally boarded the carriage and bumped their way down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya both leaned out the window, looking back, they could see Xixia being held in Sang Guanyin's arms, crying bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya couldn't help but cry, leaning against Li Che's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... will Xixia be able to eat and sleep well alone on the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"What should I do, I miss Xixia?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was a bit heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, we'll go to Elder Qingshan's Zhenglie Peak, Elder Qingshan promised to let me enter Zhenglie Peak, you can also enter the peak, so we can come see Xixia often in the future."</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Light Peak is truly a cultivation treasure land, Xixia will grow stronger there quickly."</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted Zhang Ya, also expressing his purpose.</p><p></p><p>As for safety, he had left a flying thunder chess piece on Xixia, if Xixia was in danger, he would immediately sense it and teleport over.</p><p></p><p>The sect mountain gate pass allowed free entry and exit of the sect mountain, but there were restrictions on ascending the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>But if they entered the Zhenglie Peak, it would be much easier to see Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Zhenglie Peak, the big-headed Lu Chi, with a Nezha braid, was waiting at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, Aunt Zhang!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Chi waved excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenglie Peak was much shorter than the Golden Light Peak, also shorter than the four elder peaks.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious difference was in the concentration of divine energy, of course, it was still much higher than the city area of the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the middle slopes of the Zhenglie Peak, there was a continuous cluster of buildings.</p><p></p><p>"The teacher told me to arrange a place for you, the Zhenglie Peak doesn't have as many rules as the main peak, the middle slopes are where the inner sect disciples gather, there are many houses here, you can live and cultivate here."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked at Li Che, cupping his hands, "Uncle Li, the teacher is waiting for you at the Observation God Temple, you can go find him."</p><p></p><p>"I'll take Aunt Zhang to tour around, and then go find Auntie Su."</p><p></p><p>The Observation God Temple?

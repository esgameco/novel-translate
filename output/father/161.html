            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Righteous Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>The night was dark and deep.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was in the room with Mu Popo, lighting a flickering oil lamp and whispering.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he broke through to the Divine Physiognomy Realm, Li Qingshan had more time to accompany Mu Popo, and he did not begrudge his time.</p><p></p><p>Basically, apart from consolidating his Divine Perception, most of the time he accompanied Mu Popo, or strolled around the disciple town on the Righteous Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>Or he would go to the streets of the Golden Light Prefecture, wandering around the jewelry stores and so on.</p><p></p><p>He greatly enjoyed this leisurely life.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining an appearance of aged frailty, accompanying his youthful beauty, growing old together, holding a paper umbrella, strolling amidst the drizzling snowfall.</p><p></p><p>Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter.</p><p></p><p>It had a unique flavor.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo seemed a bit tired, and as she chatted with Li Qingshan, she gradually fell asleep on the bed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan carefully tucked the quilt around her.</p><p></p><p>The beauty's rosy complexion had faded, but the traces of her youthful appearance could still be seen.</p><p></p><p>That was a part of the beautiful memories in his recollection.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Qingshan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He slowly got up, stirred the firewood in the stove, adjusting the temperature in the room to a comfortable level, then walked out of the house.</p><p></p><p>The snow outside was falling ceaselessly under the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a glance and knew that with such heavy snowfall in the depths of winter, a major snowstorm was bound to come this year, taking the lives of many innocent people.</p><p></p><p>He walked through the corridor and saw Lü Chi still sweating profusely in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Big-headed Lü Chi, his eyes shining, his blood and qi surging, every move he made was filled with unwavering determination.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the shock that Xixie had suffered, the four-year-old Xixie had already undergone five blood replacements, while Lü Chi had not yet stepped into the Qi Vein Realm, making him quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of being chased and panicked.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered when they were in the Flying Thunder City, Xixie was just a delicate little girl.</p><p></p><p>"A sense of crisis, huh..." Li Qingshan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Having a sense of crisis is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>It will motivate one to strive to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi's identity was special, and Li Qingshan's cultivation of him was more like letting him grow on his own.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Chi was also one of his few disciples.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Qingshan did not dare to take in true disciples, after all, the things he did in the first half of his life had made too many people hate him.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that the disciples he took in would all meet with untimely deaths.</p><p></p><p>So, he did not want to harm his disciples.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Chi was different, his constitution was too tough, he could endure it.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is a divine child, and not just any divine child, she is the daughter of that little fellow Li Che. I can't imagine how high she can go in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che started cultivating at the age of twenty as a spiritual child, and he was able to reach his current height in a short period of time, being able to cooperate with Ma Mian to annihilate the Wen Long Mountain's seven-element spirit arrow masters.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show that Li Che's talent and bloodline were excellent.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's talent was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even among the divine children, she belonged to the top-grade, even the extreme grade.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi... wanted to catch up to Xixie.</p><p></p><p>It was really not easy.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan did not disturb Lü Chi's cultivation and returned to the study, lighting a candle.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Underworld Spirit Exchange Mirror that Li Che had given him.</p><p></p><p>He knew that by accepting this Spirit Exchange Mirror, he, Li Qingshan, had acquired another identity.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld's Cat-Faced Assassin! The emotionless killer.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingshan glanced at the messages on the Underworld Spirit Exchange Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He was immediately shocked and alarmed!</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Niu Mo didn't take me with him!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>But he saw two sentences displayed on the Underworld Spirit Exchange Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"The situation has changed, I have already acted."</p><p></p><p>"Come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan did not bother with leisure and directly put on the cat-faced mask, quickly descending the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was not too far from here to the Heart Monkey Monastery.</p><p></p><p>By the time he arrived...</p><p></p><p>The yellow flowers might have already wilted!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was dark and the wind was high, with heavy snowfall.</p><p></p><p>The earth and sky were frozen cold.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Niu Mo mask, stood on the eaves, his eyes under the mask deeply profound.</p><p></p><p>He emerged from the darkness, making a few silent leaps, and landed on the high place.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura of the Zhong Kui statue that the Heavenly Earth Chessboard had detected, the killing intent in his heart could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>It was a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Looking out from a high vantage point, piercing the black night.</p><p></p><p>One could see in the courtyard a scene of extreme cruelty, with countless piles of skeletons, densely packed, wearing various tattered clothes, both men and women, old and young.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was a group of refugees who had survived the snowstorm of this winter, but had ended up as dry bones in this ghost monastery.</p><p></p><p>A scene like hell, with countless piled-up corpses, a deathly stillness, a chilling aura, as if the gates of hell had opened, and the lost souls of the dead refugees were slowly rising from their bodies, becoming vengeful ghosts.</p><p></p><p>The endless death qi surged like waves, from all directions, like the fire in a refining furnace, except this fire was black, refining the refugees in the courtyard into the souls of vengeful ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not consider himself a hero, but seeing such a cruel scene still filled him with shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Corpse Deity Sect's killing intent, it had reached an unprecedented intensity.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted.</p><p></p><p>He was searching for the sense of the Zhong Kui statue and Dharma Master Faxkong.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the courtyard entrance, in the endless rolling black death qi.</p><p></p><p>There was a thin and emaciated figure, palms together, bound in cold chains, sitting in meditation, reciting the Rebirth Mantra.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be trying to use his meager power to deliver these rampaging vengeful ghosts.</p><p></p><p>A cracked and broken statue.</p><p></p><p>A withered and exhausted monk.</p><p></p><p>Like a faint glimmer of light in the endless darkness, though small, it carried a ray of hope.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Faxkong was also imprisoned, thrown into this courtyard, like the many refugees, to be refined into a vengeful ghost.</p><p></p><p>But he had taken out the Zhong Kui statue, attacking the Corpse Deity Sect's ghost refining formation, suppressing the many vengeful ghosts, not letting them truly break free.</p><p></p><p>He even used his own feeble power to purify and deliver the endless resentment of these dead refugees.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel respect for Dharma Master Faxkong.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had to subdue the ghosts.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Dharma Master Faxkong had already made preparations, no wonder he didn't care whether the statue was a Buddhist or Taoist one, it was because he had lost faith in the ghost monastery, and no longer cared about the Dao or the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>As long as it could suppress the vengeful ghosts and deliver the lost souls, it would be a good statue.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the courtyard, endless death qi rose, surging into a figure.</p><p></p><p>That figure had an ancient bronze color, but it was extremely ominous and cold, without any sense of vitality, and there were two flickering silver spirit runes on the corpse body, like silver snakes darting about.</p><p></p><p>Silver Spirit Rune Copper Corpse! Li Che's gaze narrowed, the death qi generated by the slaughtered refugees was being led by this person to refine the physique, producing the silver spirit runes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, in front of the Corpse Deity Sect's Silver Spirit Rune Copper Corpse, there was also a flag, the flag was ominous, driving the formation to refine the refugees and monks.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the person's eyes opened and closed, the cold gaze sweeping over Dharma Master Faxkong, revealing a faint disdain and sneer.</p><p></p><p>"You actually have some ability, that statue can actually suppress the refined vengeful ghosts, not entering my Detachment Flag..."</p><p></p><p>"But this statue is ultimately just a nine-star wooden carving, it won't last long."</p><p></p><p>"Faxkong, wait to become a vengeful ghost together, and become the capital for my teacher to achieve the silver spirit runes."</p><p></p><p>The figure laughed, the voice drifting and echoing.</p><p></p><p>He could have killed Faxkong long ago, a small monk at the Divine Foundation Realm posed no threat to him.</p><p></p><p>But he was toying with him, wanting to slowly crush the last glimmer of hope in Faxkong's heart, gradually torturing Faxkong.</p><p></p><p>Even hoping that Faxkong would choose to defect like him, join the Corpse Deity Sect.</p><p></p><p>Everyone worships the Buddha, he has defected, why don't you defect? If you defect, my heart can also be at peace.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Faxkong was extremely emaciated, completely different from the rough appearance he had first seen.</p><p></p><p>His palms were together, his flesh and blood seemed to have been gnawed away by the vengeful ghosts, he swayed unsteadily, but still maintained the recitation of the Rebirth Mantra.</p><p></p><p>A trace of melancholy appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>One of the three major Dharma lineages that split off from the Celestial Monastery, the Heart Monkey Monastery, although it had long since lost the glory that once overshadowed the world, at least it still had some dignity.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>That dignity had long since vanished with the passing of the Abbot.</p><p></p><p>Those renegade monks, unwilling to sit in meditation and await the end like the Abbot, instead chose to join the Corpse Deity Sect in pursuit of power breakthroughs, turning the Heart Monkey Monastery into a ghostly monastery, a place for the Corpse Deity Sect's demonic people to wreak havoc and take lives.</p><p></p><p>Countless refugees, refined to death.</p><p></p><p>Faxkong's heart was sorrowful and numb.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to try his best, until his last ounce of strength was exhausted, to die together with these refugees.</p><p></p><p>At least, he persisted to the end, holding on to the light in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The Zhong Kui statue in front of him seemed to be glowing.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the power was growing stronger and stronger, a milky white glow flickering within the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>Then, the illusory form of the Zhong Kui statue appeared in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the originally drained Dharma Master Faxkong to regain the power to continue suppressing.</p><p></p><p>Faxkong's emaciated eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his lips curled up.</p><p></p><p>He continued to recite the Rebirth Mantra.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che retracted the finger he had flicked.</p><p></p><p>He had released a pure heart-spirit chess piece, entering that Zhong Kui statue, awakening and enhancing the divine aura of the statue.</p><p></p><p>Providing the greatest support for Dharma Master Faxkong.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down on his hat, the Niu Mo mask in the darkness becoming increasingly profound and fierce.</p><p></p><p>Not a trace of cuteness could be seen, it was as if he was the solemn and cold judge from hell, come to reap souls.</p><p></p><p>He had already recognized the figure refining the many lost souls as who it was.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Xuanli.</p><p></p><p>A Silver Spirit Rune Copper Corpse, placed in the Corpse Deity Sect, would likely be at the level of a lower-ranked Corpse Deity Sect Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Although the silver spirit runes had increased by one, it was not much different from the previous Corpse Deity Sect Envoy that Li Che had killed with a little mushroom.</p><p></p><p>But this time, trying to use the same method to trap and kill the Corpse Deity Sect Envoy was unlikely to work.</p><p></p><p>The previous Corpse Deity Sect Envoy had escaped through the Time-Space Teleportation Technique, completely unprepared.</p><p></p><p>And the moment he emerged from the death qi vortex, he had nowhere to dodge.</p><p></p><p>He was directly hit by the mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>And that Seven-Element Corpse Deity Sect Envoy had exhausted his silver spirit runes, leaving only his corpse body, naturally unable to withstand the mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>But Venerable Xuanli was different, his current state was powerful, incomparable to the Corpse Deity Sect Envoy that Li Che had trapped.</p><p></p><p>The Avalokitesvara Lotus Bullet alone, although its power was strong, the prerequisite was being able to hit him.</p><p></p><p>But if he couldn't hit him, it would just be a waste of essence.</p><p></p><p>If there was an Avalokitesvara Lotus Main Battle Tank to bear the brunt, and the Heavenly Earth Chessboard's terminal guidance...</p><p></p><p>Then precise strikes would be possible.</p><p></p><p>But now, that was not an option...</p><p></p><p>But no matter, he could switch to a simpler and more direct method.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his hat, Li Che's figure merged into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He first sent a message to Li Qingshan, telling him to hurry over to handle the cleanup.</p><p></p><p>As for the other matters...</p><p></p><p>He would start working on them first.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Immaculate Heart Drawing Paper rustled in the darkness, and one Niu Mo after another appeared.</p><p></p><p>Carrying Immortal Crafted Gatling Guns, they hid in the many dark corners of the monastery, aided by the Heavenly Earth Chessboard's concealment of their auras.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also drew Ma Mian.</p><p></p><p>Carrying an Immortal Crafted Barrett, along with a single Snowstorm Dragon Tooth Bodhi Seed bullet, for short-range sniping.</p><p></p><p>The Ma Mian he created only had one shot of power, and after that one shot from the Barrett, it would be shattered into ink mist.</p><p></p><p>But that was enough, that was all Li Che wanted.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Che was truly relying on his own strength to hunt down a Seven-Element Corpse Deity Sect Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Whether he would succeed or not, Li Che could not guarantee.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>He would give it his all.</p><p></p><p>Stepping lightly, the Niu Mo-masked Li Che merged into the darkness, swift as a black dragon, quickly approaching that courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Venerable Xuanli was bathing in the endless death qi and corpse qi, the faint black death qi slowly rising, like venomous snakes, entering his body and pores.</p><p></p><p>Refining his viscera and organs, making his physique increasingly resilient and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>Once he captured the Monastery God, completing his mission, he would be able to obtain the 'Death Qi Condensed Spirit Pill' at the Six Bureaus level in the Sect, and then fully propel his Copper Corpse to the half-step Silver Corpse stage!</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be ranked as an upper-tier Seven-Element Corpse Deity Sect Envoy!</p><p></p><p>With more power and resources under his control.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Xuanjiu's injuries are recovering, it's about time to prepare the Monastery God capture plan..."</p><p></p><p>"One more step, and I'll be able to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuan Ji had one more Silver Halo Curse Bronze Corpse, so his control over the natural world would be a bit greater.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li's eyes opened and closed as he pondered while exhaling the death qi.</p><p></p><p>After the old abbot's passing, the Heart Monkey Monastery had completely fallen under his control. He had long since joined the Corpse God Sect and seized power, slowly beginning to erode the Heart Monkey Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Heart Monkey Monastery's monks had chosen to join the embrace of the Corpse God Sect, gaining greater power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some stubborn and obstinate ones.</p><p></p><p>Like his shidi, the monk Fa Kong...</p><p></p><p>He resolutely refused to submit.</p><p></p><p>Like a stone in a cesspit, both stinky and hard.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li could easily kill him, but what Xuan Li wanted was to change Fa Kong's mind.</p><p></p><p>If everyone was complicit, he would feel at ease, without any sense of guilt.</p><p></p><p>To erode that tiny bit of guilt in his heart, he had been waiting for Fa Kong to surrender under the threat of death.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li opened his mouth, and two Silver Halos surged from his burly body, rushing towards his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li's hazy eyes suddenly focused! A flash of light, silent and invisible, approached! Fast! Too fast! Boom—! The flash of light struck his chest heavily, and even the Curse Bronze Corpse-level powerful flesh body seemed to struggle to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>However, the two Silver Halos quickly mobilized, gathering at the chest to block the high-speed rotating, terribly penetrating power of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet.</p><p></p><p>Countless sparks scattered in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The powerful airflow tore through the death qi smoke, forming a fierce hurricane!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of an explosion finally echoed from afar.</p><p></p><p>Before the sound arrived, the killing had already occurred! "Who?!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li the old monk roared.</p><p></p><p>Pu chi!</p><p></p><p>The two Silver Halos withstood to the extreme, but then, the bullet suddenly erupted with terrifying divine power.</p><p></p><p>What a turbulent divine power! Like a volcanic eruption, like hot oil poured into some water, it crackled and boiled.</p><p></p><p>Divine Skill Embryo: Great Avalanche!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Xuan Li's body was knocked flying, accompanied by the turbulent divine power's bombardment, the Silver Halos were dispersed, and then the Dragon Tooth Bodhi pierced into his Curse Bronze Corpse body.</p><p></p><p>A sound of metal being torn apart echoed harshly in the night!</p><p></p><p>However, Xuan Li the monk did not die from this, his powerful flesh body clamped down on the coiled force of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi, unable to cause him further injury.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?! Sneak attacking and assassinating this poor monk?!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li was furious and terrified.</p><p></p><p>There was actually an assassin who had infiltrated the Heart Monkey Monastery, and he was completely unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A fierce and tyrannical aura suddenly surged up from behind him.</p><p></p><p>The towering, burly figure was like a mountain, the veins on his body pulsing and throbbing, like a dragon on the ground about to turn over!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, a Bluedragon Wind Thunder Halberd fell into his hand, the aura of a Furnace Sect Master erupting!</p><p></p><p>Hammering down fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying true qi gushed out on the Bluedragon Wind Thunder Halberd, like a saw constantly churning and twisting!</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to be pulled into a vacuum several feet wide by this single swing!</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li the old monk's hairs instantly stood on end!</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect someone to sneak up and get so close to him! But Xuan Li was not an ordinary cultivator, he had experienced many bloody battles after joining the Corpse God Sect with a ruthless heart and hands.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that he had suppressed the power of the Bodhi threads within him, the corpse qi on his Curse Bronze Corpse surged, with black curse marks constantly climbing up.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Realm? Extremely powerful blood qi, like a furnace... But... just a mere Sect Master Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li clenched his five fingers into a fist, the Silver Halos sparking like electric arcs on his knuckles, and with a twist of his body, he charged towards the descending Ox Demon Halberd! Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li's eyes narrowed! But he saw that the Ox Demon's figure was actually expanding and growing larger again.</p><p></p><p>His hair suddenly grew long, falling to his waist, and his eyes seemed to emit a dense, lingering sandalwood smoke!</p><p></p><p>Ascending the Tower Stance! Li Che crushed three talismans that absorbed the divine power of the Fire-Eye Mysterious Startled Monkey Temple's deity! Instantly!</p><p></p><p>The muscles under Li Che's black elastic clothes bulged again, and it seemed that even the fuzz on his face had grown out.</p><p></p><p>Speed, strength, explosiveness... </p><p></p><p>And the surging waves of the temple deity's divine power! Exploding!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Silver Halo Dragon Elephant True Qi!</p><p></p><p>All the trump cards were unleashed in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The sweeping halberd strike was actually further accelerated by the terrifying propulsive force.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering explosive sound! Xuan Li the monk only felt a sense of oppression, which was the oppression of the temple deity's divine power, causing the circulation of the death qi in his body to become sluggish.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Halos?!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"How can you have Silver Halos?!"</p><p></p><p>The Bluedragon Wind Thunder Halberd seemed to be fully ignited, and suddenly there was the roar of an angry dragon, burning with scorching heat!</p><p></p><p>The halberd collided with Xuan Li's fist! The Silver Halo Dragon Elephant shattered the silver halos on his knuckles!</p><p></p><p>Then, wrapped in the power of the temple deity, it ruthlessly crushed his entire arm!</p><p></p><p>Slamming heavily into Xuan Li's chest, the terrifying force was like the majestic true dragon and demon elephant.</p><p></p><p>Like a dormant volcano, it erupted silently, as if heaven and earth were collapsing!</p><p></p><p>Boom—!! Xuan Li's Curse Bronze Corpse flesh body was heavily dented, and even the Curse Bronze Corpse's ribs were broken one by one, with varying degrees of damage to his internal organs! The entire person was violently knocked away by the terrifying giant force.</p><p></p><p>Too tyrannical!</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon—! In a fleeting glimpse, Xuan Li saw the cute ox-faced mask under the hat! The nightmare of the Corpse God Sect in the Golden Light Prefecture City! Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>He had finally come! Xuan Li was shocked, angry, and afraid! No, all the Corpse God Sect's experts had withdrawn from the Golden Light Prefecture City to avoid this Ox Demon, but... the Ox Demon still didn't let go, finding him outside the city! How outrageous! However, Xuan Li only had time to flash through this thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, with his full firepower unleashed, charged in again.</p><p></p><p>Boundary-level spearmanship, Three-Blade Sword Art, fused into a single halberd, like the tyrannical Ox Demon King rushing forth!</p><p></p><p>Furnace blood qi combined with temple deity power, unleashing violently, the steel blade-like airflow tore through the surrounding snow, blowing away the hazy dust! Boom—! The entire ground collapsed, revealing radiating cracks, and hot steam rose up!</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li the monk was furious beyond measure, he was a Seven-Element Lower Position Corpse God Envoy, a Silver Halo Curse Bronze Corpse-level expert! In the Qi and Blood Dao, he was a Sect Master Realm Perfection! How could he be suppressed and hammered like this by a Sect Master Realm?!</p><p></p><p>"Despicable!"</p><p></p><p>He attributed everything to the Ox Demon's sneak attack!</p><p></p><p>But in Li Che's heart, he had an extremely savage killing intent.</p><p></p><p>After the Fire-Eye Mysterious Startled Monkey Temple deity's divine power fused into the Ascending the Tower Stance, Li Che found that the surging killing intent could not be suppressed at all.</p><p></p><p>It was the temple deity's killing intent towards Xuan Li...</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not suppress this killing intent, but let it bloom completely! Kill!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>The ultimate skill erupted, the ground beneath his feet cracking and pulsing, with one step he swept across the Bluedragon Wind Thunder Halberd, crossing ten zhang in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The long halberd trembled, like a roaring dragon serpent!</p><p></p><p>Loosening his five fingers, he suddenly slapped his palm on the halberd's tail!</p><p></p><p>This halberd strike was even more terrifying, like a divine crossbow in the army firing at close range!</p><p></p><p>The air waves seemed to be torn apart, emitting a sound unable to withstand the load! Xuan Li had just stabilized his posture, and could only hurriedly activate the Silver Halos, coughing up a mouthful of black blood, gripping the Silver Halos with his remaining arm, and pushing forward horizontally! Thud—! His last Silver Halo was also consumed by the Silver Halo Dragon Elephant True Qi!</p><p></p><p>Then, the halberd ruthlessly pierced through his already sunken chest, forcefully driving him, causing Xuan Li's figure to stagger back more than ten steps!</p><p></p><p>Wherever he stepped, the ground surface rolled, as if it had been plowed over. But he had just stabilized his posture, when the terrifying surging killing intent froze every inch of his bones and muscles! Roar—! Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant's Heavenly Thunder Body, Eight Dragons Overturning the River! Two ultimate skills, fused into the Dragon Elephant, erupted simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was almost completely wrapped in scarlet blood thunder, instantly pulling out hundreds of majestic and oppressive afterimages, appearing before the tottering Xuan Li.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers into a fist, the knuckles cracked like a volley of cannon fire! Stepping down heavily, the shattered stones flew to the sky, and the dust rose high! Fist out!</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to be emptied! The terrifying Dragon Elephant power, all merged into this heaven-shaking and earth-shattering punch! Even Li Che, at this moment, had a kind of spiritual transcendence! This punch contained too much of his essence, spirit, and will, as if it were the culmination of his Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant ultimate skill!</p><p></p><p>Spirit, blood qi, and heart and mind all merged into it, the surging killing intent rolling and surging!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Ten Dragons Ten Elephants!</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Demon mask, the golden smoke rolled, and in an instant he clenched his fist and struck down. Slap—!!! Ruthlessly, irresistibly! Xuan Li the monk's heart was filled with endless terror and despair, as well as anger and unwillingness!</p><p></p><p>He was about to completely transform from a Grand Master-level Curse Silver Corpse to a Boundary Silver Halo Curse Bronze Corpse!</p><p></p><p>But now he was going to die?</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to die!</p><p></p><p>He had sacrificed the entire Heart Monkey Monastery, he had sacrificed so many fellow disciples, he had just tasted the flavor of power, how could he just die like this?</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon didn't bother to reason with him!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous boom!

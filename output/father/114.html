        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crack! </p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds and thunderstorms rage, with lightning flashing and thunder roaring! Raindrops fall from the dark clouds, pouring down upon the earth.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle—</p><p></p><p>The arcing electricity, on the azure-colored ram's horn hammer, seems to have a life of its own, with a majestic and domineering divine power intertwining upon it.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Black Snake Gang, a powerful cultivator who has refined his physical body using corpse seals to the level of a Cursed Iron Corpse! Even Grandmasters would find him extremely troublesome and difficult to easily destroy.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this howling ram's horn hammer easily shattered his head, blasting it into pieces, revealing the tremendous power and divine might contained within!</p><p></p><p>The entire territory of the Black Snake Gang instantly erupted in bloody chaos, with many gang members trembling in fear and terror.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the direction of the lightning and thunder.</p><p></p><p>There they saw the figure of a person wearing a cat-faced mask, striding with hands behind his back, twisting the wind and rain, stepping lightly on the black tiled rooftops as he approached.</p><p></p><p>After landing outside the gang's courtyard, he lifted his foot and began walking calmly.</p><p></p><p>With each step, the earth seemed to tremble in sync, like the pounding of a drum against their chests, causing the Black Snake Gang members' blood to nearly freeze and their heartbeats to be pulled and connected.</p><p></p><p>Pah! One sturdy warrior couldn't endure it, drenched in sweat, coughing up blood and collapsing to the ground, the fear in his eyes uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>Many bloodline-refined warriors also had their blood surging, almost unable to steady themselves!</p><p></p><p>Cat-faced mask, ram's horn hammer... </p><p></p><p>Ram's Horn Shattering the Heavens, Li Qingshan!</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang members' souls were shaken, for they knew all too well the weight of Li Qingshan's name.</p><p></p><p>That ram's horn hammer, how many experts had it killed in the capital city? How much of their blood had it tasted! Compared to the Ox Demon, they were even more terrified of this long-infamous existence!</p><p></p><p>The raindrops falling from the sky were completely twisted and scattered before even reaching Li Qingshan's body by the invisible spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In front of Shu Auntie, Li Qingshan always appeared hunched over, just to prevent her from having any other thoughts, to tell her that he too had grown old.</p><p></p><p>But when it came to killing, Li Qingshan was not like that.</p><p></p><p>Stretching out lazily, the divine powers of heaven and earth converged, like a coiling electric snake and dragon, wrapping around him, opening its mouth to yawn and stretch its limbs. "The capital city is still the most comfortable, I can mobilize as much divine power as I want..."</p><p></p><p>"True qi and blood essence can also be used recklessly."</p><p></p><p>A faint laughter drifted out from behind the cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity you didn't take the chance to kill me while I was away from the capital city..."</p><p></p><p>The voice echoed in the deathly silent Black Snake Gang courtyard.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to answer.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Gang members knew that Li Qingshan was not actually conversing with them.</p><p></p><p>The two deputy gang leaders of the Black Snake Gang, terrified to the point of despair, their legs trembling, directly threw down their weapons and knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Spare us..."</p><p>"Lord Li, please spare us!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps taking the lead, the Black Snake Gang members one by one threw down their weapons and knelt on the ground, no longer having any thoughts of resistance.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Li Qingshan's mask glanced over them indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Ram's Horn Shattering the Heavens hammer, crackling with lightning arcs, suddenly shot back from the deep pit it was embedded in, shattering the heads of the two deputy gang leaders on its return, spraying blood and brain matter everywhere.</p><p></p><p>With a clap, Li Qingshan grasped the Ram's Horn Shattering the Heavens hammer. Ignoring the Black Snake Gang members, he stomped his foot, causing his majestic blood and qi to erupt, as if transforming into three raging spiritual dragons roaring and surging into the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The Primal Spiritual Sect, the Grandmaster's supreme skill of Body Tempering, the Eight Dragons Overturning the River!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The entire earth instantly shattered, with countless crisscrossing cracks rolling, and countless scattered stones being blown into the air by the rising heat from below.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wrapped in the three raging spiritual dragons of blood and qi, charged out like an ancient fierce beast! A house instantly exploded!</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan—!"</p><p></p><p>A heavy voice, tinged with fear!</p><p></p><p>It was the Fishing Gang's Void Appearance Realm deputy leader, Liu Jinsong!</p><p></p><p>Hidden here, he had originally set up a heavenly net to target the Ox Demon, cooperating with the experts of the Corpse Deity Sect.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, instead of the Ox Demon, it was this Ram's Horn Shattering the Heavens that had been caught in the net! Li Qingshan was far more difficult to deal with than the Ox Demon! Not only his identity, but also his strength!</p><p></p><p>The majestic true qi rampaged and surged, sweeping away all the scattered debris from the exploded house. Li Qingshan stood there, gripping the ram's horn hammer with one hand.</p><p></p><p>With him as the center, the surrounding airflow was forcefully squeezed out by the three raging spiritual dragons of blood and qi!</p><p></p><p>Rising into the air, the blurry and illusory divine form of Liu Jinsong had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon slaughtered seven forces under my Fishing Gang, and I set this trap just to kill the Ox Demon! Why are you, Li Qingshan, interfering?!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong angrily shouted.</p><p></p><p>Ranked seventh in the Divine Foundation Ranking of the Cloud State!</p><p></p><p>Possessing the [Suspended Thought Thunder Annihilation of Evil] sixth-grade divine foundation, and having even cultivated the Primal Spiritual Sect's Grandmaster supreme skill, the Eight Dragons Overturning the River! Ordinary Void Appearance Realm cultivators would have no chance against Li Qingshan!</p><p></p><p>Unless they too had forged a sixth-grade divine foundation in the Void Appearance Realm, they would not be able to suppress Li Qingshan with their realm.</p><p></p><p>And in terms of Grandmaster physique, who could be a match for Li Qingshan who had cultivated the Primal Spiritual Sect's supreme skill, the Eight Dragons Overturning the River?</p><p></p><p>"I am a wandering Grandmaster, who dares to stop me?!"</p><p></p><p>Behind the mask, Li Qingshan laughed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, exhaling like thunder, his voice like a startling wild goose! Without any nonsense, Li Qingshan knew who the Ox Demon was, and the reasons behind the Fishing Gang's forces being slaughtered, he had also learned the ins and outs from the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>This Fishing Gang... colluding with the Corpse Deity Sect, harming the common people, cultivating evil arts, they deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Today, upon returning to the Capital City, he wanted to instill fear, to display his might!</p><p></p><p>To make those people in the Capital City remember his Ram's Horn Shattering the Heavens hammer once again!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a step forward, the three raging spiritual dragons wildly dancing, like flickering flames! It seemed as if countless lightning arcs were erupting and surging, instantly sweeping forth with his spoken words! "Who dares to stop me?!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The ram's horn hammer broke through the air, in an instant, like a giant hammer striking a drum, the heavens and earth as the drum, countless thunderbolts rising, the lightning arcs soaring into the clouds, like a thunderstorm lashing the mortal realm! Just one strike, overwhelming and suppressing! Within a hundred zhang, everything was dazzlingly bright with thunderbolts! The thunderbolts entwined with the Grandmaster's blood and qi dragons, making the heavens and earth seem to lose their luster in this moment! Liu Jinsong's illusory divine form was dimmed and obscured by this strike! This strike! Such a strike! The divine powers of the six realms spanned the heavens and earth, coiling within the hammer's shadow, Li Qingshan's spirit, true qi, and heroic bearing all vented through this single strike!</p><p></p><p>I'll die! </p><p>I'm going to die!</p><p>"I'm in the Divine Appearance Realm!"</p><p>Liu Jinsong roared, pushing his hands forward forcefully, his divine appearance seeming to condense in the heavens and earth, glaring angrily at the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the cat-masked Li Qingshan merely let out a snort of laughter.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sound of the hammer echoed, accompanying his laughter as it reverberated through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Appearance? Just an illusion, and what divine foundation have you forged..."</p><p>"What divine foundation have I forged then?"</p><p>"My divine foundation was earned by exchanging my life before the temple gods..."</p><p>"Do you think you can compare to me?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Li Yue, wearing a cute ox mask, restrained his spiritual energy, blending into the surroundings, watching Li Qingshan's actions from afar.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's pupils contracted slightly, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>Just feeling the faint surging thunderbolts, he felt his physical body go numb, as if his very cells had been shocked into paralysis!</p><p></p><p>Shattering the darkness with thunderbolts! Dispersing all evil spirits!</p><p></p><p>Tyrannically powerful!</p><p></p><p>And that Grandmaster blood and qi, so mighty, the three raging dragons dancing, about to overturn the rivers and seas, making the heavens and earth change color! Far more powerful than when he was in Fei Lei City, completely on a different level.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue knew that the Li Qingshan in Fei Lei City had not yet fully integrated his divine powers, relying solely on his physical body, and it seemed his physical blood and qi could not be freely unleashed either.</p><p></p><p>Yet even then, he had smashed three Corpse Deity Sect's Cursed Iron Corpse experts.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue had thought that with Li Qingshan's divine powers now in place, his blood and qi unleashed, he wouldn't be that much stronger...</p><p></p><p>But the gap turned out to be so huge!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan... was just at the divine foundation realm! However, Li Yue soon calmed down, his eyes narrowing, his mind churning with countless thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he let out a breath, rumbling like rolling thunder.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly merged into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Silently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Pah! In the night sky, countless falling spring rain were shattered and exploded into a dense mist! The illusory divine form, like a porcelain sculpture, covered in cracks, then exploded into pieces, dissipating into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Gang deputy leader Liu Jinsong let out a miserable howl, spraying out mouthfuls of blood that echoed through the night sky, tearing through the darkness!</p><p></p><p>One strike fell, the thunderbolts in the pitch-black night sky bloomed like a spider web, as if shattering the very void!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong's body was sent flying in midair, his bones and joints cracking and popping, spewing out thick, mercury-like blood from his mouth in an uncontrolled manner! Thud!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong crashed onto the long street, shattering numerous blue bricks, the ground sinking, billowing clouds of dust spreading out in a circular pattern.</p><p></p><p>Just one strike, and the Void Appearance Realm Liu Jinsong was defeated!</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough..."</p><p>"The Corpse Deity Emissary still won't make a move?!"</p><p></p><p>In the sunken pit on the long street, Liu Jinsong clutched his chest, tottering. His eyes bulging with rage, he let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>Just one strike, and he had been beaten bloody, if they truly fought, he would definitely be hammered to death!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unhesitatingly exposed the hidden identity of the Corpse God Envoy. "Dead comrades, I'm not a poor Taoist! The expert of the Corpse God Sect, come and attract the firepower!" He wasn't ashamed at all, as he had been hammered by Li Qingshan's illusion too many times, one more wouldn't make a difference, and being unable to defeat him was normal.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he had truly and vividly felt the power of that strike, and he was truly terrified.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was a top expert on the Cloud State God Base Ranking!</p><p></p><p>How terrifying must those in the top three be? He just wanted to flee now! Liu Jinsong's body swayed, and the moment he finished speaking, he immediately unleashed a divine secret technique, directly transforming into a streaking blood line and swiftly departing!</p><p></p><p>As Liu Jinsong's roar faded, Li Qingshan did not bother to pay attention to the fleeing Liu Jinsong. His eyes were filled with murderous intent. Compared to Liu Jinsong, the experts of the Corpse God Sect were the bigger fish! His unleashed divine sense accompanied the clenching of the ram's horn hammer as he slammed it fiercely into the ground, unleashing electric currents that scattered in all directions from the earth. "Come out, damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan roared.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, a millstone-like divine base emerged, seemingly formed from thunderclaps. On the divine base, countless ancient symbols composed of thunderbolts were flickering, and an aura unique to a temple god was spreading out!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, an extremely dense aura of corpses and death rose to the heavens, and the sky and earth seemed to grow even darker.</p><p></p><p>A temple god floated up, its appearance extremely bizarre, with a huge nose that swung like a hammer of the heavens, and a strange fragrance began to emanate from that nose.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Desires... Vairocana Nose Corpse God!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine image of the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>A black shadow emerged from the sky and earth, and the pressure of its realm swept across, causing the eyes of Li Qingshan, whose face was hidden behind a cat-like mask, to instantly freeze.</p><p></p><p>The true Realm of the Divine Image was not as easily hammered as the illusory cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Although the illusory ones were called Divine Image cultivators, they did not possess the realm pressure of the Divine Image cultivators, so Li Qingshan still had a chance to counterattack with his Six司Divine Base.</p><p></p><p>But for the true Realm of the Divine Image, once the realm pressure was unleashed, Li Qingshan would find it difficult to swing his hammer freely.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Image should naturally be dealt with by another Divine Image.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I've hooked a big fish."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo had really forced the Corpse God Sect to the brink, actually using a Corpse God Envoy of the Eighth Extreme to lay an ambush and make a move! Wow, what a grand occasion? He, Li Qingshan, was not much compared to this!</p><p></p><p>How long had that guy been in the prefecture city? "Everyone, still watching the exciting show? The Divine Image of the Corpse God Sect, this is undoubtedly a great merit. Li Qingshan won't compete with you all."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan put down his hammer and smiled.</p><p></p><p>In the void, the Corpse God Envoy, shrouded in dense corpse qi and wearing a white mask with a huge "eight" character written in blood, had cold, lifeless eyes.</p><p></p><p>The divine image with the huge nose behind it suddenly swung its nose, as if striking the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The void was instantly shattered, about to break through and flee.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had been arranged to ambush Niu Mo. As long as Niu Mo made a move, he would use the pressure of his divine image realm, combined with divine talismans and divine weapons, to seal the void and suppress and capture Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo had an eighth-tier Corpse Curse Seal, and this Corpse Curse Seal had to be recovered!</p><p></p><p>But Niu Mo never showed up, and instead, a crazy sheep had come.</p><p></p><p>How inauspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you, Li Qingshan, just came back and caused such a big commotion."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint laughter echoed through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>A scholarly-looking young man in a robe, seemingly like a youth, stepped into the void. Although he had not released his divine image, the terrifying pressure had already distorted the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Causing the Corpse God Sect expert to have an extremely unsightly expression.</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Director of the Heavenly Observation Bureau... Lin Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>This Corpse God Sect expert had his hackles raised. He had been lying in ambush for Niu Mo, but Niu Mo was just bait, used to lure him out.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly calmed down, and the eyes behind the eight-character mask were extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>"The divine might of our sect is surging, and Cloud State will be the next Zhi State. You will all bow before the divine might of the Corpse God, and bask in the divine grace!"</p><p></p><p>The indifferent voice came from the Corpse God Envoy of the Eighth Extreme.</p><p></p><p>"You are nothing but a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Even Jimo Li was blocked by our sect. You all... will ultimately be reduced to ashes under the great tide!"</p><p></p><p>"Great tide? You all are nothing but a great tide!" </p><p></p><p>Deputy Director Lin Xiu sneered, and the next moment, without further ado, he hooked his five fingers, and countless surging air currents erupted, the divine image pressure thundering and rolling, like a thunderstorm pressing down.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan silently retreated, as the divine image battle was not something he should interfere with.</p><p></p><p>Today, he could be considered to have fished out a big fish, which was the greatest harvest of his glorious return.</p><p></p><p>However, the Corpse God Sect's infiltration and encroachment on the various forces of the prefecture city was even worse than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>As for how this Corpse God Sect divine image cultivator would be captured, it was not his business. Since this Corpse God Envoy had openly revealed himself, he was a rat running in the open.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect's secret actions were none of anyone else's business, and each family had their own plans, but once exposed, no one wanted to openly admit to an alliance with the demonic sect. Therefore, everyone would take action, and the prefecture city had divine image cultivators guarding each family. This Corpse God Sect divine image... was truly impossible to escape.</p><p></p><p>Even the Fishing Clan Chief Jing Wudao could not hide it anymore and had to come out cursing and swearing, and in the Temple Guardians, there were also divine image cultivators releasing their pressure.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, the prefecture city was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>A divine image battle that originated from fishing for Niu Mo had erupted.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>The Niu Mo who was supposed to be fished out never even showed a single hair.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The divine image realm pressure collided, as if raging thunders were rolling in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The night sky over the prefecture city seemed to have become much brighter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A blood-red thread flashed across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>After shooting out of the city, it continued to explode dozens of yards, finally slamming hard into the official road, plowing a furrow in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong's body seemed to have been violently thrown out by a huge force, crashing to the ground like a water skipping stone, bouncing a few times before finally coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Steaming haze permeated the air, and thick smoke spread uncontrollably. A deep pit appeared on the official road, with interwoven cracks and fissures, and within the pit, scorching hot air lingered, and a dense bloody stench made one almost vomit, impossible to dispel.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong stood unsteadily in the pit, looking back at the city, where the divine image battle was rising into the sky.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed several times.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan..." Liu Jinsong gritted his teeth, extremely annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Pulling out his leg, he wanted to turn and flee.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was distracted by the divine image battle, this was the best time for him to escape.</p><p></p><p>He had deliberately exposed the Corpse God Envoy in order to create an opportunity for himself to escape.</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, with the divine image battle in the city, Li Qingshan will have no time to care about me. He won't come to chase me down..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, cough... Damn Li Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>"Good Thunder Smite Evil!"</p><p></p><p>"When I join the Corpse God Sect and refine a Corpse Copper Corpse, I will definitely come back one day. When the Corpse God Sect attacks and conquers the Golden Light Prefecture City, when they attack and seize the Divine Sect's Zheng Lei Peak, I will personally twist off your head, Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong was full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered, and a Corpse Curse Seal that emanated a dense aura of death appeared on his Nirvana Palace.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless corpse qi like dragon snakes surged under his skin, helping him quickly recover his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he unleashed a secret divine technique that used blood as the basis for escape. At the moment, his consumption was extremely great.</p><p></p><p>His entire body seemed to have been drained of blood.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his powerful Patriarch physique was continuously producing new blood, giving him new vitality, but he still had to quickly find a place to heal, or his injuries would become too severe, and he would be cut off from his path to the Realm of the Divine Image.</p><p></p><p>"The Six司-level divine base is indeed not bad..."</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, I am not a true Divine Image, otherwise, under the pressure of the realm, how would you, Li Qingshan, dare to act so recklessly!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong coughed up a mouthful of foul blood, his expression gloomy and resentful.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Dark clouds covered the sky, the ink-black color invading the night sky, as if countless thunder snakes were rolling and crawling in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The long-suppressed torrential rain finally burst forth, pouring down on the mountains, lands, and rivers of the Golden Light Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were hazy and pitch-black, making people's senses become blurred.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong's entire body was soaked through by the rain as he tried to climb out of the pit to escape.</p><p></p><p>But the movement of withdrawing his foot from the pit suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>As a powerful divine sense cultivator at the Illusory Realm, he felt something was wrong...</p><p></p><p>From all directions, it was as if a tide of terrifying and suffocating killing intent was surging towards him... Like a tame deer grazing in the forest, being targeted by a skilled hunter, the hair-raising sensation.</p><p></p><p>The rain water gathered into threads on Liu Jinsong's chin, dripping endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The clouds rolled with electric snakes, illuminating endless white light.</p><p></p><p>In the dazzling white light,</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong's hackles rose, but he suddenly saw, just two yards in front of him, a figure wearing a rain hat had silently appeared.</p><p></p><p>As his gaze fell, the face under the rain hat suddenly raised, splashing countless water droplets.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a cute cow-like mask that seemed even more lively in the rain.</p><p></p><p>(Please give me monthly votes and recommendation votes, and support my reading, thank you, Old Li!)</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

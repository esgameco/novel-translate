        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The risk is too great, and it's just fishing... If the bait isn't eaten, how can you fish?</p><p></p><p>Even if the bait is just bitten once, it will be severely damaged! "Blood exchange... You actually are a blood exchange warrior..."</p><p></p><p>The boy's mask shattered into pieces and flew in all directions under the powerful force of the Ox Demon's devastating punch.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's face flushed deep red, like a wooden stake driven into the ground by the Ox Demon's punch, his knees kneeling on the ground already had his kneecaps shattered, the cruciate ligaments torn and broken!</p><p></p><p>Blood seeped from his chest, the shattered fragments of the broken iron long sword embedded in his sunken chest cavity, the flesh rotting, the organs and bare ribs almost visible! Just one move...</p><p></p><p>Just one move alone!</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon has grown stronger again!</p><p></p><p>The first time they met, the Ox Demon was only at the initial stage of bone tempering, facing his and the Bagua Staff's combined attack, it still had to flee to save its life.</p><p></p><p>The second time, although he didn't see it, the Bagua Staff was already brutally killed, proving the Ox Demon's strength had reached the peak of bone tempering...</p><p></p><p>And now, the Ox Demon has undergone blood exchange!</p><p></p><p>Each increase in strength is a leap!</p><p></p><p>The bone tempering eight-year barrier! Many martial artists need at least eight years to temper their bones before they are qualified to step into the blood exchange realm, and the transition from peak bone tempering to blood exchange is even more difficult, known as the "thousand-day blood exchange", requiring a full three years! No matter how talented, it is impossible to achieve such a terrifying leap in just one year!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly..."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong kept spitting out fresh blood, staring fixatedly at that adorable ox-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>The cuter the mask, the more his heart was filled with dread! He couldn't recognize it...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't recognize it at all! If this was a martial artist from Feilei City, with such rapid progress, it would be impossible to keep it hidden, the news would have spread throughout the entire city! Even if it was a powerful clan, they would be going crazy over it! But there is no such person, there is no information about this person in the entire Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Zhao Chuanxiong indifferently, not responding, his cold eyes like two sharp blades of frost in the winter.</p><p></p><p>The arm that had crushed Zhao Chuanxiong's chest suddenly withdrew, spraying a gush of blood, about to strike down again.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of a blood exchange warrior, one more punch, and Zhao Chuanxiong believed he would die! "The fish has been hooked! Save me!!!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong let out a roar like thunder, expelling all the air he had left, the thunderous sound echoing all around!</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Li Che's mask remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Zhao Chuanxiong was just bait, a lure to hook him in, Simo Bai had colluded with the Lingying Sect... The one they actually wanted to eliminate was him.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon who dared to seek freedom in Feilei City, under the control of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>After shouting, Zhao Chuanxiong poured all his remaining strength into rolling into the snowy ground, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's unwavering gaze terrified Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>He knew...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had known all along... that this was an ambush to fish him out! But he still wanted to swallow this bait!</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Zhao Chuanxiong had underestimated the Ox Demon's determination to kill him...</p><p></p><p>How could it be so strong? What grievance, what resentment? Just because they had bullied him a bit in Liu's courtyard with the Bagua Staff back then? Didn't the Ox Demon even suffer any injuries? Yet he could hold such a deep grudge! His physique is so towering and mighty, yet his heart is so small!</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked indifferently at the rolling Zhao Chuanxiong in the snow, his bloodied palm suddenly raised, the five fingers hooking, making a screeching sound like chalk on a blackboard in the night. Barely visible silver threads suddenly sprang up.</p><p></p><p>In the twinkling of an eye, the air burst, a wailing cry like a ghost's lament. Pshh!</p><p></p><p>On the ground...</p><p></p><p>Scalding blood spurted up three feet high!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's head and neck were torn apart, his bulging eyes still flashing with resentment and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Why? Why! Even in death, Zhao Chuanxiong still had endless resentment and anger! In this moment, the only one Zhao Chuanxiong hated was Simo Bai!</p><p></p><p>He had endured for so long, why force him to come to his death?! You Simo Bai, you bastard, using him as bait, but making him the fish! Hateful!</p><p></p><p>The silent threads swayed, coated with round blood droplets.</p><p></p><p>In the twitching, the blood droplets exploded into a blood mist.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of threads! Around the mighty Ox Demon, countless silver threads intertwined like electric currents, whipping the air, tearing the drifting snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His spine stood upright, like a dragon's roar, and his vital energy surged out from his pores, coiling around his body like a fierce dragon.</p><p></p><p>Behind the mask, his eyes were as still as water.</p><p></p><p>There, three figures wearing various expressions of children's masks stood on the rooftop, as the rain and snow fell obliquely, whipping the air into a fierce, murderous frenzy. And further in the distance,</p><p></p><p>A cold, unmasked figure held a finely crafted, engraved great bow, with icy, sharp eyes, tilting his head to look at the burly figure of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the great bow was fully drawn, the bowstring trembling, and his vital energy surged up into the night like a fierce dragon!</p><p></p><p>Majestic and awe-inspiring!</p><p></p><p>This person... Li Che recognized him! It was the assistant by the side of Simo Bai, the one Li Che had seen when he visited the Golden Brilliance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's capable assistant, the blood-transforming warrior Guo Zhan!</p><p></p><p>Four of them! A total of four blood-transforming warriors!</p><p></p><p>Such a formidable lineup, how highly valued! And that Guo Zhan standing in the distance, drawing the bow and aiming... he was a fully realized blood-transforming warrior!</p><p></p><p>Just by drawing the bowstring, the air seemed to thicken, filling Li Che with a spine-chilling sensation, as if he was being targeted by a ferocious wild beast in the wilderness!</p><p></p><p>Compared to these four, Zhao Chuanxiong was truly a small fry.</p><p></p><p>"Simo Bai... really values me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, facing the four blood-transforming warriors without fear, but with a unique excitement.</p><p></p><p>The "Dragon-Elephant-Golden-Vajra" Dao fruit in his chest was pounding frantically, as if his surging emotions were urging it... it seemed to crave this kind of battle.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he stomped heavily, and the mud mixed with white snow exploded upwards, then fell back like a curtain! The "Dragon-Elephant-Golden-Vajra" pounded intensely, driven to its limits by him.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his body cultivation reaching the peak of Refined Bone, under the Golden Vajra transformation, he was capable of unleashing the formidable power of a fully realized blood-transforming warrior...</p><p></p><p>His spine arched, and nine great tendons roared like nine furious serpents, guarding his dragon-like spine, while his entire skeleton, tempered under the Tiger Bone Refining method, was like the powerful ribs of a fierce tiger, bursting with boundless strength! "The battlefield... cannot be here."</p><p></p><p>Behind him was his own courtyard. Zhang Ya was still holding Xixia there, and if the battle were to spill over, those arrows aimed by the fully realized blood-transforming warrior...</p><p></p><p>They would be like a sweeping machine gun, too dangerous! Li Che was certain, and his figure suddenly shot forward, fleeing towards other areas of the Xu Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>"You killed Zhao Chuanxiong, swallowed the bait... and still want to escape?"</p><p></p><p>The voices of the three blood-transforming warriors from the Lingying Sect, sounding like a mix of laughter, anger, and sorrow, echoed between the courtyard walls.</p><p></p><p>Inside the dimly lit houses of the Xu Family Mansion, many woodcarving masters were secretly watching, but dared not intervene... </p><p>To interfere with the battle of the blood-transforming warriors would mean certain death.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing the peerless, explosive power, Li Che's speed reached its peak, his feet pounding the ground, shattering the rain and snow, crushing the air! With a few leaps, he had already gone far away.</p><p></p><p>But the blood-transforming warriors were also extraordinary, quickly chasing after the Ox Demon! With Zhao Chuanxiong dead, they had to kill the Ox Demon and bring his severed head as proof, or else... they would face the wrath of a divine hunter.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black night, the rain mixed with snow raged furiously! The deep darkness obscured any light.</p><p></p><p>Yet five streams of vital energy, like five blood-red lanterns, were shooting and racing through the inky blackness!</p><p></p><p>In the narrow alleys of the Xu Family Mansion, the chase was in full chaos and out of control.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu Family Woodcarving Workshop.</p><p></p><p>In the dark alley, the rain mixed with snow fell coldly to the earth.</p><p></p><p>The old man's ears twitched, listening to the chaotic sounds coming from within the Xu Family Woodcarving Workshop, a strange gleam flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"The lone hero of this city, huh? Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>The old man chuckled, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth.</p><p></p><p>At the other end of the street, the sound of the wind and snow was suddenly drowned out by the sound of footsteps on the cobblestone ground, the friction of soles against the bricks, approaching lightly but with the rhythm of a bell and a drum.</p><p></p><p>The old man's brow furrowed with displeasure.</p><p></p><p>He gently patted the child Lü Chi, whose eyes were wide like copper bells, hiding in the dark alley.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

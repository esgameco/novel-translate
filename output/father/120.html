        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spring rain was drizzling down, and due to the cold air from the north, the temperature had dropped quite a bit, bringing a chill of late spring.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the wooden platform.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, it suddenly became noisy and bustling.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! My son!" </p><p></p><p>A woman dressed in fine clothes suddenly stood up, wailing and beating her chest in distress, staring at Liu Changqing on the platform who had been made to cry by Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's punch had landed directly on his abdomen, causing the woman's whole body to shudder.</p><p></p><p>"This wicked little bitch!"</p><p></p><p>The woman shrieked, wanting to rush onto the platform, but before she could take two steps, she was stopped by the soldier from the Divine Guard responsible for maintaining order.</p><p></p><p>On the platform.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing, dressed in a Confucian robe, gave the woman a faint glance, just a single glance, but it was enough to make the shrieking woman fall silent, making her feel the most terrifying thing in the world had descended upon her heart in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With a single divine gaze, even if restrained, it was more than this ordinary woman of simple temperament could bear. </p><p></p><p>If he was not restrained, if he wished, with just a single glance, Zhang Qing could make the woman's spiritual river in her Nirvana Realm collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Mind your tongue," Zhang Qing said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation of martial arts, injuries are inevitable. If you treasure your son so much, then take him home and do not enter my Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>The cold words, coupled with Zhang Qing's foul expression as if the Patriarch of the Tao owed him money...</p><p></p><p>The woman was immediately frightened and dared not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing patted Xixia's little head.</p><p></p><p>"Continue defending the platform, you've done well. The cultivation of martial arts is for the sake of victory, without victory... even if one speaks of martial morality, it would be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Although Zhang Qing was of Confucian scholar background, and a metropolitan graduate of the Great Scenery Dynasty, he was by no means a rigid and outdated person.</p><p></p><p>While he had his own principles, he did not care about the methods used in the battles, what he cared about was the meaning of an affair.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's big eyes suddenly brightened, nodding repeatedly: "Grandpa is right, Xixia understands."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing smiled, but in Xixia's eyes, the old man's stern expression seemed to have become even more severe.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Changqing has failed in the challenge, based on his combat performance, he is rated as Grade C."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing said indifferently, then gently waved his sleeve, and a gust of clean wind suddenly surged from under the dejected Liu Changqing, sending him down from the platform and landing beside the silent woman.</p><p></p><p>"Mother..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Changqing's aggrieved tears flowed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>He had been careless, deceived by Xixia's three-year-old appearance!</p><p></p><p>"The child is fine, we can still compete for the inner sect quota, don't cry, you've already done very well."</p><p></p><p>The woman supported Liu Changqing back to the viewing area.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing's divine power had already soothed Liu Changqing's injuries, and now Liu Changqing basically had no pain.</p><p></p><p>Only the lingering fear in his spirit, which could not be erased.</p><p></p><p>Causing a dull pain in his kidneys, faint and elusive.</p><p></p><p>"That girl is truly wicked, being so wicked at just three years old... what will she be like when she grows up!"</p><p></p><p>Although the woman was intimidated by Zhang Qing, the resentment in her heart could not be vented.</p><p></p><p>She cast a cold gaze at her husband, but her husband shook his head: "That little girl's father is Li Che, although he comes from Flashing Thunder City, he has entered the Imperial Observatory in the capital city and become a third-rank guest official..."</p><p></p><p>"This identity is not low. I know your family has influence in the capital, but don't do anything reckless."</p><p></p><p>The husband, who was the head of the Liu family, was now extremely solemn, and his tolerance and cowardice made the woman's heart even more stuffy and dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>She had originally thought that her son could become a true disciple of the Divine Sect with his talent as an extraordinary spiritual child.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything was in vain.</p><p></p><p>In the first round of the first battle, he was defeated, and received a Grade C rating.</p><p></p><p>"I can't accept it, Changqing's performance was not just that, he was just tricked by that stinky girl!" the woman said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch spoke in a deep voice: "No matter how unwilling you are, what can you do? Do you think the Divine Sect's assessment is child's play? Because of your unwillingness, you want to start over? At home I may pamper you, but out there, heaven and earth do not turn according to your will!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't cause trouble, the capital city is not like the East District, every word and action may invite disaster! Be careful with your words!"</p><p></p><p>The woman had never seen her husband so angry, and she immediately pursed her lips.</p><p></p><p>But she still muttered a bit defiantly: "Everyone is focused on the assessment, who would bother to eavesdrop on our conversation?"</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch's expression softened a bit: "What's the rush, Changqing hasn't lost all his chances, this is only the first round, there are still two more rounds, Changqing still has a chance to turn the situation around!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman's expression eased slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, grasping his wife Zhang Ya's delicate white hand and gently playing with her slender fingers.</p><p></p><p>But in his eyes, a flash of sharpness and coldness flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Calling her a 'wicked little bitch', calling her 'a wicked and vicious girl', such a shrew, does she think my Xixia has no parents?"</p><p></p><p>"Injuries are normal in a martial arts competition, but to hold such a grudge is ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>"Vicious woman!"</p><p></p><p>The cold intent rolled in Li Che's eyes, the last vicious woman... her grave had already grown weeds.</p><p></p><p>However, the Liu family patriarch was somewhat clear-headed and quite stable.</p><p></p><p>But this vicious woman scolding him Li Che was fine, but scolding his daughter... he couldn't tolerate it!</p><p></p><p>His daughter Xixia, she could not bear even the slightest grievance! If, when his daughter was bullied, he could not stand up for her, what kind of parent would he be? Li Che had never considered himself a good person.</p><p></p><p>He was just a petty person who only wanted to protect his daughter's safety and would take revenge for the slightest offense! A father will always be the great hero in his daughter's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Releasing Zhang Ya's hand, patting her hand back, Li Che stood up in Zhang Ya's puzzled gaze, and then that black robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched lazily, then with a gentle expression, walked towards the seated Liu family.</p><p></p><p>The woman was still comforting the sobbing and sniffling Liu Changqing in her arms.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch sat solemnly, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Liu family patriarch was startled, turning his head to look, and saw a young man in black robes, with a warm smile, walking straight towards them.</p><p></p><p>"It's Li Che!"</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch's eyes flashed, but there was also a hint of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>What did this man come for?</p><p></p><p>His daughter had just brutally beaten his son, was he here to apologize?</p><p></p><p>Yes, he should be here to apologize...</p><p></p><p>The rumors said Li Che was a gentle and timid person, he should be here to apologize for his daughter's recklessness.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch took a deep breath and stood up, intending to go and accept Li Che's apology.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che's position as a third-rank guest official in the Imperial Observatory in the capital was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he stood up, his eyes suddenly blurred, and he found that Li Che's blood was surging, shooting out at the speed of blood refining mastery, appearing beside the woman.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying and majestic blood energy, like a mountain pressing down, or a crouching fierce tiger suddenly rising and roaring! The woman just raised her head in bewilderment when she felt the suffocating oppressive force, and then saw a palm slap viciously on her face, the terrifying powerful force distorting her flesh and blood, transmitting to her cheekbone, even knocking out several bloodstained teeth.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of blood refining mastery directly sent the woman flying several meters away, and the Liu Changqing in her arms fell to the ground, completely dumbfounded, his sobs even frozen.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch of the East District was furious.</p><p></p><p>"Wretched thing, vicious and wicked girl... you said it so smoothly, do you think my daughter has no parents?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his hand lightly, his expression becoming a bit colder.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch suddenly burst out his divine power, fiercely suppressing Li Che, this Liu family patriarch actually had the cultivation of the initial divine foundation realm, although the solidified was the ten-path divine foundation... the pressure was weak to the point of being almost negligible for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Che just gave him a faint glance, and the big-headed Lu Chi, who didn't know when he had appeared, was now standing behind the Liu family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch immediately restrained his divine foundation pressure, his face gloomy and resentful.</p><p></p><p>He knew the identity of this child with the Nezha braid behind him, he was the disciple of Sheep Horn Break Sky Li Qingshan!</p><p></p><p>Unbeatable! At least in the capital city, he could not provoke him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, how majestic you are," the Liu family patriarch clenched his fist and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the woman who had her teeth knocked out by Li Che's slap was terrified and kept screaming.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, he hit me, he hit me, this wretched person hit me, ah ah ah - woo woo, husband, help me!"</p><p></p><p>The woman was screaming, but the Liu family patriarch had become a coward.</p><p></p><p>Watching his wife being beaten, he dared not retaliate, like an ostrich burying its head.</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to stand up for my daughter, just to tell your wife that in the future, when scolding someone's daughter, don't do it in front of the child's parents..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch clenched his fists and said nothing more, because in this matter... his wife was indeed in the wrong.</p><p></p><p>Scolding someone's daughter, and then getting beaten by them... didn't you deserve it? How humiliating!</p><p></p><p>They all said Li Che was a gentle and timid person, but where was the gentleness now? He was clearly very arrogant! But thinking about it, it was also understandable.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved Li Che's daughter, a father encountering someone bullying his daughter, he would probably be able to go completely crazy!</p><p></p><p>The Liu family patriarch let out a sigh, and could only swallow this humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to his original position with Lu Chi.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes, however, were shining brightly, staring at Li Che, unable to stop looking.</p><p></p><p>My protective husband, how can he be so handsome?!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya found that she was becoming more and more admiring of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Hmm! Tonight I'll prepare a few more opening postures to request guidance from my husband! Li Che reached out and ruffled Zhang Ya's head, then sat back down leisurely, leaning against the armchair, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was unfazed, although Li Che's temperament was gentle, but once it involved his family, he would become extremely fierce. Back in Flashing Thunder City, when the Spiritual Infant Sect targeted Xixia, although Li Che was afraid to kill, he still unhesitatingly struck them down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's first time killing someone was when Old Chen guided him! So, don't bully kind people. </p><p></p><p>When you push a kind person to the limit, their craziness can be more terrifying than a madman.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This little incident, although it attracted a lot of attention, did not cause much concern.</p><p></p><p>More people were still focused on the elite spiritual children on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Xixia had won a battle and could choose to rest, for a maximum of half an hour, but she had not consumed much blood energy in defeating Liu Changqing, so she only rested briefly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing released a touch of divine power, completely restoring Xixia's condition to perfect state! "Continue."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing swept his gaze over the remaining fourteen elite spiritual children and said.</p><p></p><p>Xixia had defeated Liu Changqing in a thunderous manner, and although she was only three years old, it made the other spiritual children no longer dare to underestimate her.</p><p></p><p>Because Xixia had displayed the strength of bone tempering mastery, she was no weaker than Hai Chao Sheng, Qin Feng Huo, and Huang Sixiang and the others.</p><p></p><p>This three-year-old child was no longer a soft persimmon, but a hard bone, extremely difficult to crack! It was the Gongyang family's Gongyang Xiu who had replaced Xixia as the soft persimmon.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu was only five years old, his cultivation only at the opening of meridians level, not yet at bone tempering.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, Gongyang Xiu was challenged.</p><p></p><p>On the platform, the blood energy surged, Gongyang Xiu glared with reddened eyes, exerting his full strength, his extremely sophisticated martial arts techniques being...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He displayed it.</p><p></p><p>It was the supreme skill of the Gongyang family, the Twelve Seals of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Although Gongyang Xiu was only five years old, he had already successfully mastered one seal, successfully entering the door of this supreme skill! It is known that entering the door of a supreme skill is not an easy task! Unfortunately, Gongyang Xiu was still defeated and fell off the stage.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, patted off the dust, his expression solemn, and did not cry in pain like Liu Qingcheng.</p><p></p><p>After getting off the stage, he returned to the Gongyang family's area.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I lost." Gongyang Xiu came to Gongyang Liancheng's side, lowered his head, and finally revealed a bit of the grievance of a child.</p><p></p><p>"You have performed very well. After all, challenging Jin Ao is only a small success... and he is two and a half years older than you. That you could fight him for over a hundred moves before being defeated is quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>"He is a gifted child secretly cultivated by the Jin Lie Gate, and also knows some of the unique martial arts of the Jin Lie Gate... You couldn't defeat him normally."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the Divine Ancestor still give you an 'A' rating based on your performance?"</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng patted Gongyang Xiu's little head.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu was indeed comforted, standing obediently next to Gongyang Liancheng, looking towards the stage, his gaze bright and shiny towards Xixis direction.</p><p></p><p>He was five years old, and was defeated.</p><p></p><p>Xixis was three years old, and had defeated her opponent.</p><p></p><p>Although their opponents were different, but... Xixis was so powerful!...</p><p></p><p>After a round of defending and challenging the stage, there was only one change in the five defenders on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu was defeated, replaced by Jin Ao, another exceptional gifted child at the small success realm.</p><p></p><p>And now, the cultivation of many of the defending gifted children has also been basically revealed after a round of challenges.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng, seven years old, small success realm perfected! Qin Fenghuos, seven years old, small success realm mastered! Huang Sixiang, six years old, small success realm! Li Nuanxi, three years old... small success realm mastered! Even Huang Sixiang, who only had small success realm, had innate divine strength, and his explosive power even surpassed those at the small success realm mastered!</p><p></p><p>There were still five exceptional gifted children left, including Gong Yuanli from the Gong family and Shangguan Qinglei from the Shangguan family, who had not yet made a move.</p><p></p><p>Basically, after this round of challenges, the five exceptional gifted children who will succeed in the first round of defending the stage and receive an 'A' rating can be determined.</p><p></p><p>And these five exceptional gifted children have a high probability of becoming the Divine Ancestor's true disciples! The fine drizzle poured down in the suddenly hurried wind.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei from the Shangguan family stepped out, his toes touching the ground, his qi and blood bursting forth, and he leapt onto the stage where Xixis was.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gong Yuanli from the Gong family looked deeply at Shangguan Qinglei, then chose Huang Sixiang's stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gong Yuanli felt that this three-year-old girl could be much more difficult to deal with than Huang Sixiang.</p><p></p><p>Observing the scene of her defeating Liu Qingcheng, Gong Yuanli had a vague scalp-tingling sensation.</p><p></p><p>Cunning, malicious, suppressed, and explosive, once she finds an opportunity, she will beat the enemy to death! This kind of opponent is the most terrible.</p><p></p><p>His aunt Gong Yunli worked in the Astronomical Observatory, and had taken him to see many cultivators roaming the jianghu, those cultivators... just gave him this hair-raising feeling.</p><p></p><p>So, he specifically waited for Shangguan Qinglei to make his choice before he chose.</p><p></p><p>"Dong--"</p><p></p><p>The black gong was struck again, the waves of the bell resounding.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy drizzle, the gentle breeze brought a touch of refreshing spring.</p><p></p><p>Around the high platform, the spectators watching the battle also knew that this assessment of the exceptional gifted children was about to come to an end.</p><p></p><p>"I want to challenge her." Shangguan Qinglei's hair flew, his eyes full of aggression. Although he was only seven years old, his appearance was like a teenager, with long and slender arms and strong and powerful legs.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Zhang Qing's figure floated off the stage, and Xixis looked up at Shangguan Qinglei.</p><p></p><p>This Shangguan Qinglei... is much more robust than Liu Qingcheng.</p><p></p><p>His height almost reached 1.7 meters, compared to the three-year-old Xixis... the visual impact was indeed quite large.</p><p></p><p>"I am Shangguan Qinglei, little sister, don't cry if you lose."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei squinted and smiled, the qi and blood on his burly body constantly flowing and condensing, as if there was a dragon snake slowly winding. The crisp cracking of bones and tendons, like popping soybeans! Small success realm mastered!</p><p></p><p>Xixis clenched her chubby fists, and the excitement gradually appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Rebellious subject! Kneel down!"</p><p></p><p>Xixis took a fighting stance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xixis thought of something and looked at Shangguan Qinglei: "By the way, you also have the surname Shangguan? What is your relationship with Sister Qinghong?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's five fingers were like hooks, with electric arcs flickering, and he was stunned by the words, then sneered, a trace of disgust flashing in his eyes: "Shangguan Qinghong? Just a bastard."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei naturally knew who Shangguan Qinghong was, but she was just his half-sister born to a different mother.</p><p></p><p>But his mother had told him that this Shangguan Qinghong was just an accidental bastard... </p><p></p><p>His mother was born a lowly maid, and she seduced his father to give birth to Qinghong, so Shangguan Qinglei was very disgusted with this name.</p><p></p><p>Xixis' little head frowned: "Don't you dare say that about Sister Qinghong!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei, however, grinned: "Little brat, I'm giving you face... so you're friends with my bastard sister? That's quite fitting... two bastards together."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's words made the fire of anger flash in Xixis' eyes.</p><p></p><p>Below the stage.</p><p></p><p>In the Astronomical Observatory's viewing platform, Shangguan Qinghong was leisurely cracking melon seeds, and when she heard Shangguan Qinglei's words, her seed-cracking action only paused for a moment, then she continued cracking the seeds without any concern.</p><p></p><p>She was already used to the attitude of the Shangguan family towards her.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's wives and concubines, their hatred for her even exceeded their hatred for her mother.</p><p></p><p>Even though she was noticed by the deputy director of the Astronomical Observatory and has now become a civil servant eating an iron rice bowl, it is the same.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong also doesn't care about their opinions.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this a kind of disappointment and numbness?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the stage, the battle began! Xixis became serious, she wanted to beat the hateful Shangguan Qinglei to tears.</p><p></p><p>Although he is the brother of Sister Qinghong, Xixis will not hold back! </p><p></p><p>People with foul mouths should be beaten to death! Bang--! Xixis' body moved, instantly launching herself, the small figure, actually using the rebound force of a stomp on the stage, to shoot out at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter--</p><p></p><p>Xixis' soles hit the ground at an extremely fast frequency, her body spinning rapidly, kicking up smoke and dust, appearing at the position behind Shangguan Qinglei's waist.</p><p></p><p>Just like when she defeated Liu Qingcheng, she repeated the same trick!</p><p></p><p>"Puny tricks, do you think I'm that country bumpkin trash?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei, however, laughed madly, his waist twisting, his body crouching down, and he suddenly whipped out a leg in a huge arc, viciously lashing towards Xixis.</p><p></p><p>Countless lightning arcs flickered on that leg, emanating a terrifying aura! "The supreme skill of the Shangguan family... Azure Thunder Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I've just started learning it, it is already quite extraordinary, with a great enhancement of the flesh body and qi blood!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei glared with raging eyes, and there was even an erupting divine nature roar behind him, like a surging stream divine nature.</p><p></p><p>However, facing Shangguan Qinglei's almost suffocating counterattack, Xixis' eyes were filled with unwavering determination, not the slightest panic.</p><p></p><p>She shook her little hand, a miniature wooden dove grasped in her hand, and she flung it out, slamming towards Shangguan Qinglei's heart! Boom boom--</p><p></p><p>Instantly, explosions erupted on the stage! But countless electric arcs flickered, accompanied by Shangguan Qinglei's angry roar as he lashed his leg down again, with a terrifying bone-shattering force! But the dove ultimately bought Xixis some time.</p><p></p><p>Xixis also let out a high-pitched cry.</p><p></p><p>Little Kitty, come out! Clenching her five fingers, pushing out a punch, the Little Kitty taught by her father...</p><p></p><p>It was like the roar of a young tiger! Xixis punched out, slamming towards the lashing whip-like leg of Shangguan Qinglei! The punch and the leg collided! It was as if a young tiger phantom appeared behind Xixis, swiping a paw at the flickering azure thunder body! Boom--</p><p></p><p>Xixis' body shot out, landing steadily after taking a step back, accompanied by a crisp sound, Xixis took out a big thing from the jade pendant around her neck.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the leg Shangguan Qinglei had lashed out retracted, the pants on his leg already torn, the cloth hanging, the entire leg trembling uncontrollably, as if the bones and tendons were all in pain, perhaps... it was fractured.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed an incredulous look.</p><p></p><p>"Superb martial arts... master level?"</p><p></p><p>What Xixis just displayed was the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist that Li Che had improved and perfected! Normally, a three-year-old child would not be able to cultivate a recondite superior martial art to the master level, that would require so much bitter cultivation, so much tempering, and such high martial arts attainments and talent! But...</p><p></p><p>The three-year-old Xixis just now, in displaying the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, had actually formed the embryonic form of the realm! </p><p></p><p>This is already at the master level, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Not only was Shangguan Qinglei shocked, but the Divine Ancestor Nanlihuo, Elder Zhu Hongdou, and others on the high platform, including Li Qingshan, were also alarmed, their eyes becoming grave.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really a master-level martial art?"</p><p></p><p>"A three-year-old master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>No, how long has it been? How did this girl grow to this extent? During this period, how did she cultivate? Based on what Lü Qi said, the little girl who complained about being tired every day, who slacked off three days a week and sunbathed two days, how could she cultivate a martial art to the master level? A three-year-old mastering a master-level superior martial art...</p><p></p><p>Girl, are you the reincarnation of a martial saint?</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a warm smile on his lips, the corners of his mouth involuntarily rising.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that Xixis had enough trump cards in this true disciple assessment, and to guarantee that she would not be harmed, Li Che, while using the [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit to refine Xixis' body, had activated the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao fruit, and infused his own insights into the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist into the divine nature of the Untainted Heart Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Subtly and imperceptibly, he passed it on to Xixis.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a three-year-old child would indeed find it very difficult to cultivate a master martial art, being able to just enter the door of a martial art would already be very good.</p><p></p><p>But Xixis is different...</p><p></p><p>She has cheats!</p><p></p><p>Her father is always giving her cheats! The situation on the stage suddenly reversed, the majestic aura of Shangguan Qinglei weakened after being dealt a blow.</p><p></p><p>But it also ignited a bit of his ferocity.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was very clear about his advantages, he was seven years old, older, with a stronger physique and greater endurance. </p><p></p><p>Dragging it out, he would definitely win!</p><p></p><p>However, a gust of airflow shot out, tearing through the hazy smoke and rain.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei then saw Xixis grab something almost as big as her own body.</p><p></p><p>Those six black metal tubes, their gaping muzzles aimed at him, like six venomous snakes ready to spit out their fangs.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Qinghong is your own sister, yet you call her a bastard?!"</p><p></p><p>"You kind of foul-mouthed person..."</p><p></p><p>"Master Niu Niu said!"</p><p></p><p>"Can use fireworks..."</p><p></p><p>"To block your mouth!"</p><p></p><p>Xixis stomped her foot, as if a wind had risen, her already messy hair dancing wildly in the spring breeze and rain, her clothes clinging tightly to her body.</p><p></p><p>Her face was filled with endless excitement, her eyes bright and shining, suddenly radiating a dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>"Time to set off the fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>The true disciple storyline will end in the next chapter, please vote for monthly tickets, recommend tickets, and support the continued reading! Naked running, collecting a little doesn't increase, please vote a little, thank you Old Li!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The deafening rumble!!! The explosion instantly erupted!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying amount of blood qi, surging out like the bursting of the Yangtze River, the scorching hot temperature burning everything, evaporating all the raindrops within dozens of yards! It was as if there were hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of blood qi spirit dragons, howling and rushing out, the violent aura instantly exploding the air, the sky seemed to be engulfed in towering flames! This was Li Che's full-powered punch.</p><p></p><p>No holding back! Unleashing the full force after just breaking through to the Grand Master realm, the black robe fluttering, the dark hair floating, the robust physique, the distinct muscles, the divine might seemed to be burning violently with the blood qi, a horizontal push of the fist, completely striking out the Grand Master-level Myriad Dragon Subduing Divine Might! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sound waves burst open, rumbling loudly! It was as if something had been exploded! The flesh and blood dissolved, the primordial spirit screamed!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a substantial blood mushroom cloud had risen, soaring straight up, sweeping away the countless raindrops that were falling back down.</p><p></p><p>Such a momentum, too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person never thought that the Ox Demon could unleash such a brilliant Myriad Dragon Subduing Divine Might.</p><p></p><p>So he instinctively thought it was the old lord who had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dragon Subduing Divine Might mastered by the Jie Hai Club and the one displayed by the Ox Demon were vastly different, completely two different Myriad Dragon Subduing Divine Mights!</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person's strength was not weak, with the Divine Element Real Person plus the hidden Grand Master cultivation, although he was just an ordinary Grand Master, relying on the power of the primordial spirit to assist the tempering of the five viscera and six bowels, and broke through to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of Grand Master combat power, he was even inferior to Xue Dufu, but... after all, he was a Grand Master, possessing such a level of power.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with the terrifying divine might unleashed by the Ox Demon, it was like a firefly seeing the sun, instantly extinguished, without any resistance.</p><p></p><p>And the Divine Element Real Person should be best at keeping his distance, using divine techniques for reckless bombardment.</p><p></p><p>But the Envoy Immortal Real Person, relying on the hidden Grand Master strength, planned to quickly approach the Ox Demon with divine secret techniques, and then unleash the Grand Master blood qi to achieve instant annihilation!</p><p></p><p>The ideal was good, but the reality was too cruel.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person could never have imagined that the Ox Demon of the Underworld, with his malicious schemes and cunning calculations, would have such powerful divine might, capable of unleashing a Grand Master-level Myriad Dragon Subduing Divine Might! In the moment of losing his mind, it was the Envoy Immortal Real Person's death sentence.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Pill shattered, the primordial spirit wailed! The flesh body was also blown into pieces under the punch, and then completely dissolved by the terrifying blood qi! Just one punch.</p><p></p><p>And he was instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The air suddenly sank down, as if a deep pit had exploded, the terrifying destruction mixed with the exploded blood mist, constantly rolling in the deep pit, gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>A devastating punch! The dragon's roar was too overbearing, deafening, extremely ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of yards away, the six Black Armor Blood Guards were working together to resist Xue Dufu, trying to entangle Xue Dufu, waiting for the Envoy Immortal Real Person to be free, so they could easily suppress and kill the traitor Xue Dufu! Suddenly, the sound of a violent explosion, the blood qi-filled balloon instantly burst! The rippling shock wave almost made the six Black Armor Blood Guards' eyes go dark! Boom—!!! The lingering aftershock of the terrifying fist force ravaged the muddy and scattered sky, tearing a ravine in the rocky road.</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armor Blood Guards saw the result of the collision.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts instantly sank to the bottom, and it even became a luxury for their hearts to beat once.</p><p></p><p>They were almost frozen! </p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person...</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person who hid the Grand Master cultivation... was blown up! The flesh and blood exploded, turned into a blood mist, the dense bloody smell made their hearts tremble! And the cold and indifferent Xue Dufu, who had been suppressed by Li Che's spirit howl, had now become a completely emotionless killing machine!</p><p></p><p>At the moment when the six Black Armor Blood Guards' hearts were intimidated and horrified by the Envoy Immortal Real Person being blown up, Xue Dufu's crescent moon saber suddenly erupted with power.</p><p></p><p>The divine might covered the saber blade, powerful and heavy, suddenly sweeping down, like the angry roar of the Heavenly God, the substantial saber qi lashed out.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! One of the Black Armor Blood Guards was instantly hit by the saber blade, his chest suddenly caved in, the black armor instantly shattered, torn open, the blood sprayed! The terrifying striking force shattered the bones, the blood mist burst out.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the blood-colored divine general's aura was weakened by a few points, equivalent to being torn open a large gap!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu, wearing the Ox One mask, the ferocious scratches, seemed to be filled with the ultimate coldness! He was now resurrected, only by Li Che's spirit suppression, everything he had was given by Li Che, Li Che's orders were his commands!</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox One mask, Xue Dufu's eyes emitted an extremely blood-red light, the crescent moon saber swung violently, the sudden gale shot out! The army that had been broken open was immediately unstable.</p><p></p><p>The remaining five Black Armor Blood Guards felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>The army formed by the six Black Armor Blood Guards could just barely withstand a Grand Master, but once a gap was broken open, the balance would be shattered, completely unbalanced! One-on-one, Xue Dufu could easily defeat any of the Black Armor Blood Guards.</p><p></p><p>For a Grand Master to deal with a Master, although it was not as absolutely dominating as the Divine Element Real Person dealing with the Divine Foundation Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the level gap could still bring about a crushing defeat.</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon saber suddenly thrust out, a tremor, shattering the raindrops, while also exploding the scattered blood drops! </p><p></p><p>A straight, lone smoke on the desert-like saber light burst out! The Desert Lone Smoke Saber!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's signature martial technique, the Grand Master supreme skill!</p><p></p><p>Puff puff puff puff!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the sound of bones and flesh exploding rang out!</p><p></p><p>These Black Armor Blood Guards were also quite ruthless, without too much talk, one by one burning their true qi, temporarily raising their flesh and blood to the Furnace Master realm!</p><p></p><p>Although they brought some trouble to Xue Dufu, but with the army broken, it was just a minor inconvenience.</p><p></p><p>The raging saber light, the violent ravaging, the ground sand and mud churned, mixed with the rain, blown in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of flesh and blood exploding, one Black Armor Blood Guard after another was slaughtered on the spot!</p><p></p><p>The scorching hot blood that could evaporate the rain water splashed and scattered, falling on Xue Dufu's cold body, but he didn't show the slightest reaction.</p><p></p><p>When the last Black Armor Blood Guard's severed head was swept away by Xue Dufu's saber.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious head soared into the sky, full of anger, and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu then stood the crescent moon saber obliquely, standing amidst the mountain of corpses and sea of blood, towering like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>The two battles had all come to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person and the six Black Armor Blood Guards, all perished.</p><p></p><p>Not a single one escaped.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth returned to silence, the roar subsided, the wind and rain driven away by Xue Dufu's divine might, poured back, the rain water splashing on the muddy ground, creating ripples.</p><p></p><p>But it could not wash away the blood qi of the six Black Armor Blood Guards who had burned out their true qi.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The exhausted air waves had long since flowed back, the rain water fell, pattering on the straw hat Li Che was wearing, dripping down the edges like a curtain of pearls.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Ox Demon mask, maintaining the posture of a punch, the dazzling divine might, flashing rapidly, like a blood-colored lightning.</p><p></p><p>That punch just now was Li Che exhausting all his physical strength in a single strike.</p><p></p><p>Driving the Dao Fruit's Diamond Body to the extreme, just short of unleashing the divine technique's embryonic form.</p><p></p><p>However, with the Temple God's divine nature added, the divine technique would be even stronger. Without the Temple God's divine nature, it was just a simple refining and enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Combat is always the best practice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che struck out a punch, blowing up the Divine Element Real Person of the Grand Master realm, even though the other party's Grand Master cultivation did surprise Li Che, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>Slowly lowering his fist, the seven-wheeled peacock-like divine foundation behind him gradually retracted, all returning to the Nirvana Cinnabar Field in his brow.</p><p></p><p>The bones and joints throughout his body cried out, the bones colliding with a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master-level physique was too powerful, and Li Che had risen to the Grand Master realm based on the Furnace Master's constitution, with a solid foundation, even more formidable! A tremor of the palm, he suddenly waved his sleeve, blowing away all the blood mist.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping with his divine sense, clenching his five fingers, a Spatial Orb quickly shot over, caught in Li Che's hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the numerous cracks on the Spatial Orb, vaguely on the verge of being unable to withstand the powerful force and about to shatter, Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I'll have to be more restrained in the future, just blowing their heads off would be fine, blowing the whole person up, if my strength gets even stronger in the future... won't I even destroy the gifts from my opponents?"</p><p></p><p>Under Li Che's cute ox mask, his eyes flashed with serious light, summarizing and reflecting.</p><p></p><p>If the Spatial Orb was blown up, the internal space would tear apart all the stored items, and those were all Li Che's things...</p><p></p><p>Li Che would be heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Envoy Immortal Real Person's Spatial Orb, the distant Xue Dufu, who had just slain the Black Armor Blood Guards, seemed to have noticed his master's preference, immediately turned the crescent moon saber into a kitchen knife, and hung it at his waist.</p><p></p><p>He then quickly rushed to the six Black Armor Blood Guards' corpses and began to search for Spatial Orbs.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he had collected the six Spatial Orbs, cupping them in his hands, he fawningly approached Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "... I'm not that kind of person."</p><p></p><p>"Necessity of life."</p><p></p><p>Li Che explained briefly, and then collected the six Spatial Orbs.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu immediately stood behind Li Che with his hands on his hips, wearing the Ox One mask, nodding his head left and right, extremely proud.</p><p></p><p>He was the ox that his master valued the most!</p><p></p><p>Li Che ignored him, raising his hand, pointing at the brow through the mask.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood tore open, the Dipper Eyes reflected the flowing light! "Spirit Suppression."</p><p></p><p>"Spirit, return."</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Sweeping over the area where the Envoy Immortal Real Person was blown up by Li Che's punch, the dense divine nature immediately coalesced into divine nature chess pieces, forming as many as a hundred divine element spirit chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Next, a flash of black light, and then it transformed into the appearance of the Envoy Immortal Real Person.</p><p></p><p>Still fused within the shadow, only now it was even blacker.</p><p></p><p>Appearing as if he had not died once, and had returned to life through spirit suppression.</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmly scanned the spirit-suppressed resurrection body of the Envoy Immortal Real Person.</p><p></p><p>The faint black qi was constantly surging.</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Che, Xue Dufu was also eagerly anticipating.</p><p></p><p>As if hoping that the Envoy Immortal Real Person would struggle a bit, resist a bit, just like Huang Xishui, and then... his master could reward this disobedient thing to Ox One, letting Ox One have a good meal!  Li Che did have such an idea.</p><p></p><p>Raising a spirit-suppressed being is a kind of nurturing feeling, and it can also be a good helper.</p><p></p><p>Because spirit-suppressed beings do not need to consume his divine sense power to control them like the [Painting Immortal] clones, they have their own consciousness and can act independently.</p><p></p><p>They are independent individuals.</p><p></p><p>This is a fundamental difference from the [Painting Immortal] clones.</p><p></p><p>The [Painting Immortal] clones are essentially a differentiation of his blood qi and divine nature.</p><p></p><p>However, the eagerly anticipating Xue Dufu was very disappointed...</p><p></p><p>Because the Envoy Immortal Real Person had no intention of resisting at all, obediently and fanatically.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings... my lord."</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal Real Person clasped his fists, respectful and fervent in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>This fervent submission made Li Che somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Envoy Immortal Real Person, not resisting at all, had mistaken Li Che for the Pacification King Yimo during his last moments?</p><p></p><p>That's why he had no resistance at all, submitting so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's also possible that since Li Che's cultivation has risen to the Grand Master realm, he can achieve absolute suppression of the Envoy Immortal Real Person at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, the Envoy Immortal Real Person was so respectful, so he no longer had the intention of feeding him to Ox One.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the location of the six Black Armor Blood Guards.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature cultivation of these six Black Armor Blood Guards was also not low, all having divine image cultivation, and they were also post-boundary, if not for the enhanced Xue Dufu as the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the coordination of the divine image cultivation, they might even be able to suppress Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>After a few deep breaths, Li Che refined hundreds of divine image chess pieces, very satisfied, and then proceeded to spirit suppression.</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armor Blood Guards' faces were black and blue, distorted as they emerged.</p><p></p><p>All wearing black armor, familiar with taking the chopping saber from their own corpses, the black qi devoured the chopping saber, instantly fusing with them.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armor Blood Guards shouted in unison, respectful and enthusiastic, well-trained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armor Blood Guards were then twisted into a vortex and absorbed into a white Immaculate Divine Nature Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>Li Che plans to find an opportunity to place this Immaculate Divine Nature Chess Piece in Xixing's...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Around him, he had the six black-armored blood guards closely protecting Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Even if they died, the military formation of the six half-step grand master level blood guards could withstand a grand master for a while.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were people who had died once before, and were more professional death guards than true death guards, unafraid of death, and would truly go into battle if there was trouble.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu and the True Person of the Shadow Guards were also taken in.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched and his bones cracked, the flesh of the grand master realm still needing to slowly adapt.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, the battlefield was in utter disarray.</p><p></p><p>Corpses were strewn about, the pungent smell of blood permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paid it no mind.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over and landed on the coffins.</p><p></p><p>His toes lightly touched the ground, instantly causing ripples to spread out from the mud and standing water.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Che was like a leaf in a raging storm, rushing away.</p><p></p><p>Perfect, time to try out his professional body disposal abilities.</p><p></p><p>He flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Two chess pieces, one black and one white, spiraled and shot down.</p><p></p><p>"Black and white collapse."</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the sound of Li Che's light voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then, there was a silent explosion, the black and white light distorting into a ball, instantly bursting forth with dazzling brilliance! Like a giant bowl cover, it enveloped the corpses of Ji Haihui and the black-armored blood guards...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! A sudden gale erupted and swept through!</p><p></p><p>Countless winds and rains were devoured, leaving the surrounding space clean.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the explosion suddenly reversed, and countless raindrops were sucked back in!</p><p></p><p>And when all the light and heat had dissipated without a trace,</p><p></p><p>Only a deep, empty pit remained.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of Ji Haihui and the black-armored blood guards...</p><p></p><p>Had all disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle...</p><p></p><p>The rain that flowed back in was instantly vaporized by the crystallized surface of the pit, turning into dense steam that shot into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only silence, nothingness remained.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crackle crackle! Lightning flashed, thunder roared! The air suddenly burst open, and a figure with scorching hot blood surged in like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>It landed on the muddy, chaotic ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang, wearing shabby clothes, had his aura steaming, blocking the rain.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he held a figure - none other than Tie Shancai.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che had removed the heavenly earth chessboard, that terrifying and scorching destructive aura had immediately surged up.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang and Tie Shancai, who were originally not far away, immediately sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang, under Tie Shancai's strong urging, ultimately could not resist and came rushing over.</p><p></p><p>The tall and the small stood on the edge of the ten-zhang deep pit, both sucking in a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Haihui's... remains have disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"Who was it? So ruthless, to have wiped out Ji Haihui's funeral procession as well?"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai's eyes were wide, and even he, who feared nothing, couldn't help but clench his legs, feeling a bit horrified.</p><p></p><p>"The True Person of the Shadow Guards... a divine element true person... sensing this scorching aura, it seems to also have hidden grand master cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang, being from the Zhen Temple Bureau, was observant.</p><p></p><p>He did not focus on the area where Ji Haihui's remains had been annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he circled the edge and found a piece of shredded flesh.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the shredded flesh, Zhu Chaoyang's expression changed slightly, with both horror and shock.</p><p></p><p>"Divine element true person, plus grand master cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"Such power... seems to have not withstood the second attack?!"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai, at some point, had gripped a palm-leaf iron fan, his small head full of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>It was truly frightening, the same Ji Haihui as him had been reduced to ashes...</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a 'heaven and human united' realm grand master who struck?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful expert, in the entire Cloud State, there might only be a few, right? They are the top experts in the Dao City!"</p><p></p><p>"Yet they appeared in the Golden Light Prefecture City?"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang nodded gravely: "Even if it's not a heaven and human united realm grand master, it's probably not much weaker... it may even be a divine martial cultivator, a post-spiritual body realm expert with a flesh body full of apertures!"</p><p></p><p>"You in the Zhen Temple Bureau are the best at solving cases, can you judge who struck?"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai asked.</p><p></p><p>If you can judge, I can avoid them in advance.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang shook his head: "I only know the other party is very strong..."</p><p></p><p>"Strong in blood, strong in flesh, and strong in divine might... they defeated the True Person of the Shadow Guards without any resistance."</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Divine Monkey? Doesn't seem like it... the Underworld shouldn't have such a powerful existence, right."</p><p></p><p>"It should be the one who killed Ji Haihui and shattered the Martial Saint's will at the Temple God Resonance Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang said.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai let out a breath: "Fortunately... fortunately we checked the body in advance."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the winds and rains in the heavens and earth seemed to have grown much colder.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhu Chaoyang picked up Tie Shancai and ran off without looking back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And after Zhu Chaoyang and Tie Shancai left,</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, from the direction of the Golden Light Prefecture City, it seemed that someone had also sensed something, a figure breaking the sky, rushing over at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine nature distorted the vast clouds, the figure soaring through the air, its speed extremely fast as it rushed over.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom—</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops exploded, the divine element true person's powerful spiritual sense, radiating like a blazing sun, pushing the rain and airflow aside.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun and the grand master coachman beside him landed on the edge of the pit.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lu Yao, Wang Kuyu, and the erhu-playing Supervisor from the Qin Tian Monitoring Bureau also arrived.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Wang Kuyu glanced at Supervisor Hu Yingue, a flash of surprise in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How tragic, how tragic."</p><p></p><p>Supervisor Hu Yingue, placing a small stool, began to play a mournful erhu tune in the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun, however, did not pay him any mind, the withered, old-wood-like expression on his face carrying a few sharp edges.</p><p></p><p>"The young prince's funeral procession... completely wiped out, the remains disappeared, destroyed without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"The hand that struck was so ruthless... so malicious..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun sighed.</p><p></p><p>How did it come to this.</p><p></p><p>It was too tragic.</p><p></p><p>If Pacification King Ji Mogli were to learn of this news, he would be furious, wouldn't he.</p><p></p><p>However, this matter... can't be blamed on them.</p><p></p><p>Since Ji Mogli didn't send some strong experts to escort his son, knowing his son would be in danger, the defensive force was so weak.</p><p></p><p>But a divine element true person, a grand master of divine might, six black-armored blood guards, and the Martial Saint's will and dragon god bloodline within Ji Haihui's body... </p><p></p><p>There really wasn't any force that dared to tear off their masks and kill Ji Haihui, to go against a child.</p><p></p><p>"They did it so cleanly..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the grand master coachman beside him and asked, "Did you find anything?"</p><p></p><p>The grand master coachman fished a broken bone fragment out of the mud.</p><p></p><p>Silently handing it to Jiao Shaoqun.</p><p></p><p>After taking it, Jiao Shaoqun's third eye spiritual sense burst forth...</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes slightly, a terrifying divine nature coiled and surged.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Jiao Shaoqun suddenly opened his eyes, the bone fragment in his hand exploding into powder.</p><p></p><p>His expression was filled with astonishment and shock.</p><p></p><p>"The Subduing the Dragons Technique?"</p><p></p><p>"The one who killed this True Person of the Shadow Guards... must have used an extremely tyrannical version of the Subduing the Dragons Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun, using the divine nature suppression and tracing technique, could barely trace the fleeting scene on this broken bone fragment.</p><p></p><p>But that exquisite Subduing the Dragons Technique seemed to want to shatter his spiritual sense with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to master such an exquisite Subduing the Dragons Technique? Could it be... one of Ji Mogli's sons..."</p><p></p><p>"Secretly striking to seize the hereditary position?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The howling wind, the falling rain.</p><p></p><p>The black tiles shuddered, dull thuds echoing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, his five fingers gripping the flying thunder chess pieces, returned to the small courtyard in Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard was still tranquil.</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down from the courtyard's dome, the flowing water washing the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che removed the Ox Demon mask, took off the black robe, pulled over a bamboo chair, and sat down, his entire body relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The fragment of the True Person of the Shadow Guards' bone was something he had deliberately left behind.</p><p></p><p>With his spiritual sense having matured early, combined with the heavenly earth chessboard, how could he have missed a mere bone fragment? But he deliberately left it, to confuse and mislead.</p><p></p><p>On that bone fragment was the lingering aura of the Subduing the Dragons Technique that had shattered it, to investigate... would only lead to the grand achievement level Subduing the Dragons Technique empowered by the seven emotions divine nature! To simply erase the clues would not be the most stable approach, the most stable... was to leave behind spider silk threads, guiding the clues in other directions.</p><p></p><p>The True Person of the Shadow Guards died to the exquisite and peerless Subduing the Dragons Technique...</p><p></p><p>Who would guess that it was Li Che who struck?</p><p></p><p>A diligent and honest wood carver in the Qin Tian Monitoring Bureau of a prefecture city, how could he be connected to the Pacification King's Subduing the Dragons Technique?</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered, replaying this battle that was almost a complete steamroll.</p><p></p><p>His heart would not swell with pride or underestimate just because he had steamrolled the True Person of the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the strong remain strong, there are heavens beyond heavens!</p><p></p><p>But the Li Che of now is indeed not weak.</p><p></p><p>"A grand master... although I've just crossed the threshold, just barely condensed my first divine might, I can still be called a grand master."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips slowly curved upwards.</p><p></p><p>Crossing from Furnace Master to Grand Master was indeed a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Strength, explosiveness, blood essence - all underwent earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>But what was even stronger was the martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>Condensing a substantial martial dao will was the most tyrannical source of power for a grand master.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivators like the True Person of the Shadow Guards, who deduced grand master cultivation from the divine element spiritual sense in reverse, had an extremely weak martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Xue Dufu, whose martial dao will was tyrannical, even if he fought to the point of having both arms severed, his blood drained dry, his fighting spirit would still be unextinguished!</p><p></p><p>"I've initially crossed the threshold, but I haven't yet refined the bodily elixir to store the divine might, with the divine might hidden in the bodily elixir, a thought generates divine might, penetrating the flesh apertures..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che contemplated the cultivation of the grand master realm.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Golden Immortal Dao Fruit pulsed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up and walked into the courtyard, the rain falling on him, Li Che letting the rain splash.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle...</p><p></p><p>His body shuddered, the rain evaporating.</p><p></p><p>Extending his arm, clenching his fist, striking out!</p><p></p><p>The fist was like a long spear, the movements neither fast nor slow, without the savagery and urgency of fighting, but smooth and leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Like the master painters of national painting, placing the chess pieces at the celestial origin.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly earth rain was stirred, the divine might intertwining around him, within a ten-zhang radius centered on Li Che, all the airflow and rainwater were whirled, unable to disperse, compressed and gripped by Li Che's five fingers.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The water ball compressed to the extreme, wrapped in the surging divine wind, whirled in Li Che's palm!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's blood rushed, rapidly converging at the dantian.

The dragon elephant roared, the heart pounding, the powerful blood essence surging, as if the dragon elephant will was howling!</p><p></p><p>The martial dao will, the Dragon Elephant Golden Immortal!

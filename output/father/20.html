        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the wind and snow, a human figure stood firm.</p><p></p><p>Its aura and blood intertwined, making it highly conspicuous amidst the vast gray expanse. Carrying a butcher's knife, its gaze was extremely sharp, yet tinged with a hint of playfulness.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Li Che could be seen carrying salted meat, a jar of wine, and osmanthus cakes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused in his steps, his first reaction being... that his wrongdoing had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection, there was no reason for that. With his attainment of the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao, his transformed appearance had left no traces behind.</p><p></p><p>If his wrongdoing had not been exposed...</p><p></p><p>Then why was this constable from the government office, having completed the investigation into the death of Sun Changbiao, still here in front of his courtyard, and what did he intend to do?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Che could not think of the reason and was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Li Che, Master Li?"</p><p></p><p>The calloused hand of Zhao Chuanxiong rested on the knife handle wrapped in cloth as he looked at the approaching Li Che and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hands were full, so he could only make a symbolic fist salute: "It is I, sir. What matter do you have to instruct me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong looked at Li Che, scrutinizing him subtly, then shook his head imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Li Che's dispersed spiritual state and aura, his cultivation was only just at the breakthrough of the Skin Refinement realm, nothing more. He could not possibly be the ruthless and decisive killer who had slain Sun Changbiao.</p><p></p><p>According to Liu's description, that murderer was nearly two meters tall, with a burly and muscular build, extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to Li Che's physique.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhao Chuanxiong's visit to Li Che was not because of this.</p><p></p><p>"Liu has confessed," Zhao Chuanxiong said, looking at Li Che with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart skipped a beat, immediately understanding what Zhao Chuanxiong was referring to.</p><p></p><p>"You received a wooden sculpture of an angry-eyed spirit infant the other day, didn't you? That was placed at your doorstep by the deceased Sun Changbiao..."</p><p></p><p>"As a believer of the Spirit Infant Cult, he had set his sights on your family's spirit infant."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's lips curled into a slight arc as he stared at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che gritted his teeth: "I am well aware of this, for my daughter Xixia was targeted by the Spirit Infant Cult right after her birth, which is why I strived to become a skilled wood carver and moved into the Xu Family Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>"I thought we would be safe and my daughter could grow up securely, but little did I know that the Spirit Infant Cult would come to the workshop again after Xixia's first birthday celebration..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Che spoke with deep emotion, his face flushed with indignation.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen deduced that the wooden sculpture was placed by someone within the workshop, so he asked Master Chen to investigate, and it was ultimately confirmed to be the work of Sun Changbiao."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a look of fear crossed Li Che's face: "Constable Zhao, I did not kill Sun Changbiao, I..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong had been staring at Li Che the entire time and, seeing him become somewhat incoherent, raised his hand to gesture.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I know. You could not have possibly killed Sun Changbiao, and you don't have the capability to do so..."</p><p></p><p>"Since it is related to you, I'm just conducting a routine inquiry."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong turned around and looked towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, won't you invite me in to sit for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong smiled: "I've heard that your wood carving skills are exceptional, and I may need to ask Master Li for some carving work in the future."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che hesitated for a moment, as he was not inclined to have the other party enter the courtyard, but since Zhao Chuanxiong had made such a direct request, he could only invite him in.</p><p></p><p>He opened the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Zhangya stood gracefully under the snow-covered eaves, and Xixia was toddling around the cleared courtyard in a wooden walker.</p><p></p><p>Seeing an official enter the courtyard, Zhangya's face immediately turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Husband..."</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly called out, fearing that Li Che had done something wrong.</p><p></p><p>After putting down the items in his hands, Li Che waved to Zhangya: "This is Constable Zhao from the government office, he has come to investigate some matters, there is no serious issue."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhangya nodded, and the tightly wound tension in her heart relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong appeared by Xixis side, smiling and saying, "So this is Teacher Lis daughter, truly lively and adorable, like a jade carving."</p><p></p><p>When Li Che heard this, his heart immediately tightened, and alarm bells went off in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, children are like that."</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhao really likes children, I wonder if I could hold her?"Zhao Chuanxiong said gently.</p><p></p><p>"The little girl is shy, Captain Zhao, I'm sorry." Li Che rejected without even thinking.</p><p></p><p>However, Captain Zhao seemed not to have heard, squatting down and looking at Xixis "Xixis, will you let uncle hold you?"</p><p></p><p>Xixis crystal-clear big eyes stared at Captain Zhao, and the next moment, she stepped on her walker and started to run away.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Chuanxiong laughed and his hand reached out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, and the Dragon Elephant Vajra Wisdom in his heart began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhao Chuanxiong's outstretched hand was grasped by another hand, preventing him from holding Xixis.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhao, the girl doesn't want you to hold her, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, not a tall man, had a leather flask hanging at his waist, and his hand that reached out just happened to hold down Zhao Chuanxiong's outstretched hand.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and snow seemed to suddenly freeze in this moment, congealing in midair, and then was silently torn apart by the terrifying gale, exploding into a hazy snow powder.</p><p></p><p>The two opposing auras clashed thunderously, like huge waves crashing against each other.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong slightly turned his head, looking at Chen Dabao who had blocked his action, and the smile on his face gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Teacher Chen..."</p><p></p><p>"The child doesn't like you, so don't force her, don't leave any shadows on the child."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Chen... Hug." Xixis, who was standing beside them, saw Chen Shifu and bumped her walker against his leg, calling out in a sweet voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my precious darling, grandpa will hug you, come here." Old Chen looked at Xixis, his old face instantly blossoming into a smile like a chrysanthemum, and he picked up Xixis from the walker.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong also stood up, his hand resting on the hilt of the knife again.</p><p></p><p>"Such a lovely child."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong looked at the Xixis being carried away by Old Chen and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart also relaxed a little.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Li, Teacher Chen, I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong did not linger in the courtyard any longer, waved his hand, and left the courtyard, his figure disappearing into the hazy snow.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen rocked Xixis in his arms, making her giggle "haha".</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Zhao Chuanxiong's retreating back and slowly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, in the future, don't let strangers easily enter the courtyard, especially..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Xixis aversion to Zhao Chuanxiong is not because she's shy, Xixis has spirituality and can discern good and evil towards her, this Zhao Chuanxiong... has ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed slightly when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Did he tell you that the Liu family hired him, and that it was Sun Changbiao who placed the wooden carving of the spiritual infant in your courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled, his voice a bit cold: "From beginning to end, the Liu family only admitted that the couple had worshipped the spiritual infant cult, but never admitted to placing the wooden carving of the spiritual infant at your doorstep..."</p><p></p><p>"And the spiritual infant sculpture found in Sun Changbiao's house is just an ordinary three-headed, six-armed spiritual infant sculpture, with one eye open and one eye closed..."</p><p></p><p>"Then how did this Zhao Chuanxiong know that the one placed at your door was the 'angry spiritual infant'?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

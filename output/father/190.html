        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous roar of the rushing river echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>In the vast sky above, there was splashing rain, pouring down like countless raging bullets, incessantly pounding away.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the angry cliff, one could truly hear the endless angry cries.</p><p></p><p>That was the furious roar of the six black-armored blood guards after drawing their saber-like blades, bursting in everyone's ears, echoing ceaselessly, thunderous and deafening.</p><p></p><p>The many cultivators of the Jin Guang Manor, every one of their faces turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored blood guards brought by the young prince Shi Haiwei were all peak Sect Master level experts, their vital energies refined to the extreme, cultivating the same shared techniques.</p><p></p><p>Their vital energies were connected as one, not weaker than any Grandmaster of Divine Might!</p><p></p><p>Even in terms of heroic spirit, they were even more terrifying! After all, they were united as one!</p><p></p><p>The roar echoed without end, shaking like thunder! All the warriors felt their vital energies surging uncontrollably, and many Saintly cultivators also sensed their divine natures wavering!</p><p></p><p>The Phantom Guard True Person rose up in the air, and three powerful figures stood in his way.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao, Wang Daoren, and Zhu Chaoyang of the Zhen Miao Manor.</p><p></p><p>Two Divine Element True Persons and one Grandmaster of Divine Might, such a lineup indeed gradually calmed the Phantom Guard True Person.</p><p></p><p>But everyone could feel the anger.</p><p></p><p>Intertwined with the anger were also terror, despair, and sorrow!</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, sir."</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Temple resonance has not yet ended, no one knows the situation inside..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Since Jiao Shaochun had entered the Mysterious Pavilion, it was now Wang Kuyu's turn to step forward.</p><p></p><p>After all, Wang Kuyu was currently the only visible Divine Element True Person of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the Grandmaster who had always guarded Jiao Shaochun, the Charioteer.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he remained completely motionless.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this Charioteer, unless there was an incident that threatened Jiao Shaochun, he would not make any move.</p><p></p><p>But at least the existence of this Grandmaster was a backing.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Phantom Guard True Person was... he could not single-handedly deal with two Divine Elements and two Grandmasters, right?</p><p></p><p>"The young prince is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Qianyuan Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"You cannot escape your involvement, you must give an explanation for the prince!"</p><p></p><p>The Phantom Guard True Person's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the young prince would die, after all, the young prince had so many life-saving methods, and the trump cards left by the old prince! But the fact was that the young prince was dead.</p><p></p><p>Before they set out, they had all left their divine sense on the young prince, and the black-armored blood guards had left their essence blood...</p><p></p><p>As soon as something happened to the young prince, they would immediately receive the news.</p><p></p><p>And with the young prince's death, they could naturally feel it more clearly.</p><p></p><p>Despair...</p><p></p><p>The Phantom Guard True Person, a mighty Divine Element True Person, at this moment, revealed a sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine how he would explain to the prince upon returning to Jiezhou, and how he would explain to the princess...</p><p></p><p>Heaven has collapsed! The death of a prince, the old prince must be furious beyond measure! Not only the Phantom Guard True Person, but the six black-armored blood guards who had never shown any emotional fluctuations, were also trembling in their hearts at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to feel the old prince's furious outburst, as terrifying as the falling of the stars!</p><p></p><p>"Qianyuan Divine Sect... must give an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>The Phantom Guard True Person said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Zhu Chaoyang exchanged a glance, their eyes flashing with an unusual color.</p><p></p><p>Fuck...</p><p></p><p>It seems to be true! Not just a pretense! The young prince Shi Haiwei... really died in this Ancestral Temple resonance?</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Temple resonance... is not a hundred percent safe event, all the children are told of its dangers when entering the Ancestral Temple trial."</p><p></p><p>"Since the young prince insisted on participating, and something happened... how can you shift the blame to the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he died at the hands of the guardian curse corpses?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, the young prince has the dragon god bloodline flowing in him, maybe some guardian curse corpse didn't like the dragon clan bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>His expression was calm, but his heart was almost blooming with laughter.</p><p></p><p>Shi Haiwei died? The son of Shi Mogli died? Heaven has eyes indeed! Nan Liehuo almost felt as refreshed as drinking an ice-cold watermelon on a scorching summer day, his entire being relaxed to the point that every pore was exuding.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"Nan Liehuo, you shut up!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai roared ferociously!</p><p></p><p>He stared fixedly at Nan Liehuo, the murderous intent radiating from his pupils, as if he could no longer hide it.</p><p></p><p>The savage murderous intent, the frantic mentality, seemed to surge like waves, assaulting Nan Liehuo! However, Nan Liehuo smiled joyfully.</p><p></p><p>He deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's incitement made Wang Kuyu quite troubled.</p><p></p><p>He was just here to complete a task, if he helped the Divine Sect create a pacifying prince as a major enemy...</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the Divine Sect, he might be severely criticized, or even sent to the back mountain for reflection.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>How could he die? And it's the death of a young prince!</p><p></p><p>Normally, the prince's offspring are called world princes, unless they have the right to inherit the throne, then they would be called young princes. </p><p></p><p>This shows that Shi Haiwei's status and position were not ordinary in the eyes of the old prince Shi Mogli!</p><p></p><p>The Phantom Guard True Person's murderous intent surged, and the six black-armored blood guards also drew their blades and stood ready.</p><p></p><p>"I want to tear open the mist! I want to see... how the young prince died!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The Divine Element Elixir floated, emitting dazzling light and heat!</p><p></p><p>Majestic divine nature, surging like waves!</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to kill the other divine children?!"</p><p></p><p>However, the Phantom Guard True Person's forceful move to tear open the mist angered Lu Yao and Zhu Chaoyang. Wang Kuyu also immediately acted.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the wind and rain were fierce, the great river roared angrily, and all the surrounding vegetation cowered. Three Divine Element Elixirs floated, shining like the sun and moon, dazzling and brilliant! The six black-armored blood guards simultaneously gripped their saber-like blades, the murderous intent rampant, as if they had transformed into the shadow of a black-armored divine general, rising up into the air!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang exhaled a furious hum from his nostrils.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the thunderous roar of the heavens erupted! The body of the Grandmaster, emanating the ultimate light and heat, stepped out, the heroic spirit overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>The heroic spirit of one person suppressed the six black-armored blood guards! On the Angry Cliff, the atmosphere was tense, ready to erupt into a great battle at any moment!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! In the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>On the intersecting lines of the chessboard, a jet-black ancient sword, like a black hole, suddenly appeared! Countless sword lights burst forth, each sword light was extremely dark, like the ink squeezed out, deep and unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>The sword's hum trembled, as if resisting, shuddering, wanting to tear open the space and leave this place!</p><p></p><p>The sword qi gushed forth, in the celestial chessboard, like a lotus flower blooming in hell!</p><p></p><p>Hell Lotus!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Countless white, pure divine nature chess pieces, at Li Che's single thought, moved over, like countless falling meteors, rushing towards the Hell Lotus Yin Sword!</p><p></p><p>As if to suppress the Seven Elemental Corpse Curse mother-child seal, to suppress this Four Divine Weapon!</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang—</p><p></p><p>One by one, the white pure divine nature chess pieces exploded!</p><p></p><p>Dispersing into a dense divine mist, shrouding the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Just the falling of a single sword qi had the terrifying power to easily tear the void apart! This was the Four Divine Weapon's self-resistance!</p><p></p><p>In the celestial chessboard, Li Che's spiritual consciousness sat cross-legged, floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>His eyes opened and closed, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at it indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Why did he take the initiative to seize this Four Divine Weapon, the Hell Lotus Yin Sword...</p><p></p><p>It was because Li Che sensed that the source of the Martial Saint's phantom power came from this sword! Shi Mogli seemed to have set it up long ago.</p><p></p><p>With Shi Haiwei's death, this sword would activate the Martial Saint bloodline within Shi Haiwei, causing the pre-existing Martial Saint phantom to manifest.</p><p></p><p>If he did not seal this sword, the power of the Martial Saint phantom would continue to surge, until it reached an extremely terrifying level!</p><p></p><p>In that case, even Li Che might have a headache.</p><p></p><p>So, when Li Che made his move, his target was the Hell Lotus Yin Sword.</p><p></p><p>Has Shi Mogli refined this Four Divine Weapon?</p><p></p><p>Li Che guessed that he probably had not.</p><p></p><p>But even if he had refined it... so what?</p><p></p><p>Once it entered the celestial chessboard, it belonged to the Li clan!</p><p></p><p>"Damned beast."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual consciousness was cold.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the struggling Hell Lotus Yin Sword, constantly emitting towering sword qi, as if wanting to tear the celestial chessboard apart, he rebuked.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he pointed at his brow.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed pure divine nature chess pieces suddenly fell down!</p><p></p><p>Instantly forming a dense net, enveloping it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che's boldness in dragging this Four Divine Weapon into the celestial chessboard was not based solely on the pure divine nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>But on... the Equaling Heaven Mask! Another mythical weapon! Li Che's spiritual consciousness surged forth, sensing and controlling the Equaling Heaven Mask, approaching that Hell Lotus Yin Sword!</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>The Equaling Heaven Mask began to vibrate.</p><p></p><p>As if an ancient existence had awakened from its slumber, like the purest stone in the heavens and earth, it suddenly shattered! The Equaling Heaven Mask instantly shot forth, becoming a stream of light, fiercely covering Li Che's spiritual consciousness face!</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, opening his eyes! His eyes shone with brilliant golden light, as if intense golden flames were burning from his pupils!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual consciousness, wearing the Equaling Heaven Mask, had his heroic spirit steadily rising.</p><p></p><p>Appearing above the Hell Lotus Yin Sword.</p><p></p><p>The hairy hands pressed down forcefully, sitting down with a thud.</p><p></p><p>The Hell Lotus Yin Sword...</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a while, it chose to give up and lie down.</p><p></p><p>Just like how it had been stabbed by the Fire Spear Tip and gave up in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was a sword that really liked to lie down and give up.</p><p></p><p>Beckoning with five fingers, the pure divine nature chess pieces floated around the Yin Sword.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Sword gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>No longer moving, no longer struggling.</p><p></p><p>The Equaling Heaven Mask, at this point, finally detached from Li Che's spiritual consciousness, quietly floating there, no longer showing any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>As if savoring the feeling of wearing the Equaling Heaven Mask.</p><p></p><p>This feeling actually allowed him to gain a deeper understanding of the Martial Saint's ultimate art, the Chaos Equaling Heaven Staff!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Pavilion, the mist surged and washed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze slightly flashed.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of his spiritual consciousness wearing the Equaling Heaven Mask and suppressing the Hell Lotus Yin Sword flashed like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression became a little strange, this situation was actually a bit beyond Li Che's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stored the Yin Sword into the celestial chessboard, intending to use the power of the Equaling Heaven Mask, combined with the pure divine nature chess pieces, to suppress the Yin Sword.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected it to be so smooth.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Equaling Heaven Mask, after staying in his celestial chessboard for so long, has finally softened and become compatible with him?</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Pavilion, it was quiet.</p><p></p><p>Xixie blinked her big eyes, gripping the Purple Flame Snake Spear, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che directly grab that Hell Lotus Yin Sword and collect it, Xixie's eyes were shining! Her dad is really domineering! He just snatched the enemy's divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>As for Shi Mogli's Martial Saint phantom... it seemed to have fallen into silence.</p><p></p><p>With the severing of the connection between the Yin Sword and the Martial Saint will-manifestation phantom, the pressure of the Martial Saint will began to plummet in a cliff-like manner.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it fell to a horizontal line and no longer fell.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed it for a while, his eyes flashing, and he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it has reached the same level."</p><p></p><p>Shi Mogli's Martial Saint will, having lost the support of the Yin Sword's stored power, has now fallen to about half a Grandmaster's level.</p><p></p><p>And it was still declining.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint will slightly fluctuated, gazing at Li Che, its expression extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the sword?"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint will said in a deep voice, booming in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"It's mine now."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his arm, his hair flying, shielding Xixie behind him, facing the Martial Saint's heroic pressure alone.</p><p></p><p>However, the current Martial Saint pressure... did not have the slightest oppressive feeling to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>It was just that...</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the blurred Martial Saint phantom, only knowing that the other party was very burly and heroic in spirit, but unable to see the appearance clearly.</p><p></p><p>This person... was the famous and mighty Pacifying Prince Shi Mogli.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint of the current era, the Divine Fetus Great Deity! The Martial Saint will reflected before Li Che, though only a wisp, was still extremely extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very curious...</p><p></p><p>The Pacifying Prince Shi Mogli, who was thousands of miles away, could he sense the current situation through this wisp of Martial Saint will?</p><p></p><p>If he completely extinguished this Martial Saint will...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>King Pacifier Princess Yimo Li, can you know what happened with the temple deity resonance this time?</p><p></p><p>Li Che has always been cautious in his actions.</p><p></p><p>He can be the most solid shield for his daughter, but he won't just recklessly charge in.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Saint, and even a Deity Embryo Great Deity, is simply not something the current Li Che can casually deal with...</p><p></p><p>But now, it is not the true body descending.</p><p></p><p>It is just a wisp of Martial Saint will!</p><p></p><p>Princess Yimo Li wants to know what happened here, perhaps... she needs to recover this Martial Saint will to know.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Pavilion, the mysterious mist surged...</p><p></p><p>Xixie did indeed kill Jie Haihui, but the ones who know Xixie killed Jie Haihui are...</p><p></p><p>Only him Li Che, the Martial Saint will in front of him, and that wisp of dragon shadow, as well as... the watching Temple Deity Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Although others sensed something, they did not know what happened.</p><p></p><p>The shielding power of the mist in detecting and probing is very strong, especially this is the mysterious mist of the Four Mysterious Temple's Mysterious Pavilion, even the Spiritual Immortal's spiritual power would have difficulty expanding its perception in it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is special, because he possesses the Dao Fruit [Chess Saint], and has reached LV4, with stronger perception ability.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the fact that Xixie killed Jie Haihui...</p><p></p><p>Not many people know about it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, and he suddenly had a plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>That blurred Martial Saint will, as if sensing the raging will burning in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the lips and teeth opened, the tongue unfurled with thunderous sound!</p><p></p><p>Rolling thunder sound, like an angry dragon turning over, roaring and exploding! Countless mysterious mists were instantly blown into a swirling black vortex!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Countless raging airflows, forming invisible oppression, heavily pressed down on Li Che!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint will's eyes were extremely brilliant, although it was just a wisp of will, it was extremely majestic and domineering!</p><p></p><p>"You want to suppress my Majesty?"</p><p></p><p>"Country bumpkin warrior, how dare you."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice, with unparalleled heroic spirit, he raised his hand, the blurred five fingers clenched, instantly...</p><p></p><p>Countless flowing lights gathered, actually turning into a... long-handled umbrella spear! The long-handled umbrella spear... is very blurred!</p><p></p><p>But, it is extremely terrifying! As soon as it appeared, it seemed that the mist could not bear its weight and would be crushed!  Just the form of the divine weapon, it already possessed such a majestic spirit!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed...</p><p></p><p>The might of the Martial Saint, so terrifying! Even if it was just a wisp of will, the Infernal Lotus Yin Sword was taken and suppressed by him, still not to be underestimated!</p><p></p><p>This long-handled umbrella spear divine weapon, must be an ultimate divine weapon that Princess Yimo Li has completely mastered! The Martial Saint will is so sensitive, Li Che's fighting intent leaked a little, and it was sensed! Although the Martial Saint will was cut off from its connection with the Yin Sword and could not maintain it, it still had undeniable pride! A mere country bumpkin, also wants to suppress the Martial Saint will?!</p><p></p><p>Grasping the long-handled umbrella spear, he suddenly turned it, and countless surging energies seemed to tear apart the layers of airflow.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint will indifferently lowered its gaze, and stepped forward resolutely! One step landed, like a thunderous drum!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Huge waves dispersed in all directions!</p><p></p><p>As the umbrella spear rotated, amid the sound of tearing fabric, the spearhead had already struck out, and the void seemed to be twisted and exploded, the howling and tearing airflow, actually turned into countless dragon shadows! Myriad Dragons Prostrating to the Deity!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint's supreme art, when performed by the Martial Saint, is completely different from what Jie Haihui had performed. One in the sky, one in the dust!</p><p></p><p>Roar! Thousands and thousands of dragon roars burst out domineeringly, deafening, heaven-shaking and earth-shattering!</p><p></p><p>Like the ancient and sealed Buddhist bell on the Spiritual Mountain in the Buddhist Sect being struck hard!  The spearhead that struck out, supremely domineering!</p><p></p><p>The speed of the strike did not seem to be fast, but within a range of five hundred zhang from Li Che and the Martial Saint will, the airflow was all torn apart! This one strike, perfectly fused the Myriad Dragons Prostrating to the Deity, a Martial Saint supreme art, within it! Li Che could not even describe the connotation of this strike!</p><p></p><p>It's like summoning the myriad dragons of heaven and earth, even if the gods are in front, it dares to suppress and kill with such domineering! It is a command, a mastery, a majestic, and also... domineering! Boom!!! The air waves were emptied, the airflow raged wildly! Turning into the roar of myriad dragons, rampaging and dancing!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's ink-black robe fluttered, his whole body's tendons and bones rang, his spine trembling, like a low dragon roar echoing.</p><p></p><p>He was wrong! The Martial Saint, even if the aura is weakened to only the Grandmaster level, is far beyond what a Grandmaster can compare to!</p><p></p><p>His eyes were as bright as fire! He did not lose the courage to take action because of the majestic Martial Saint will!</p><p></p><p>And the blocked Xixie, also felt a little power leaking, the little one trembled slightly, staring with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>So terrifying...</p><p></p><p>Just like the Big Bad Wolf in fairy tales! Her eyes revealed a worried look! Daddy...</p><p></p><p>Can he win?!</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense the little cotton's doubt, Li Che glanced back and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixie, don't underestimate your old dad!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell!</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed loudly, stepping out heavily, the scorching heat in his eyes seemed to be burning in substance!</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint will...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao Fruit in his chest, violently pounding, excited to the point of almost bursting out of his body! Expectation, excitement! The heavy step, as if stomping the entire Mysterious Pavilion into a turmoil!</p><p></p><p>On his back, the big tendons trembled, the terrifying power was released.</p><p></p><p>Hum bang—</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood grew a little, the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor, tempered without equal!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even use the power of the Temple Deity chess pieces!</p><p></p><p>He simply relied on the Dao Fruit, to activate all the tempered power in his flesh and blood!</p><p></p><p>Because Xixie was behind him, Li Che did not let his flesh and blood completely twist and deform, just slightly bulging a little, swelling and lifting his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Not to scare his daughter! Tendons and bones ringing, the furnace of blood and qi surging in waves, huge waves! Terrifying true qi, raging and roaring! Dragon Elephant True Strength!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were bright and fierce, as if the face of the Great Sage had covered his face, at that moment of enlightenment, a sense of understanding suddenly arose in his heart! With a thought, the blood and qi surging with red clouds wrapped around him.</p><p></p><p>Roaring Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound!</p><p></p><p>The Roaring Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Spear fell into his hand, grasped tightly by his hooked five fingers, tearing out streams of airflow as he gripped it!  The blood and qi surging with red clouds wrapped around the Roaring Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Spear, instantly turning it into a scarlet gold treasure staff! The staff shook, and in the trembling, the staff shadows intertwined, as if generating thousands of times of birth and extinction changes! Roaring Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound!</p><p></p><p>One staff sweep out! It seemed that there was thunder on his staff shadow, exploding loudly!</p><p></p><p>The staff shadows lingered!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, combined with the Primordial Heavenly Staff!</p><p></p><p>Killing move...</p><p></p><p>Primordial Heavenly Staff!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumble—!!! The long-handled umbrella spear and the Primordial Heavenly Staff, collided fiercely! This seemed not just a simple collision of two weapons, but more like a contest of two bodies, a clash of strength, a collision of blood and qi! The earth shook and the mountains trembled!</p><p></p><p>The mysterious mist instantly rushed towards the two at high speed, and then was forcefully scattered in all directions by the powerful and majestic power.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mysterious Pavilion seemed to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Within a range of two miles of the two, the mist beneath their feet seemed to all collapse and plunge into the surging Nine Dragon River!</p><p></p><p>Causing the river water to explode!</p><p></p><p>Shooting up dozens of zhang water columns into the clouds!</p><p></p><p>Hearing on the Angry Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The clashing, almost about to fight, Spiritual Immortal experts, were startled and changed color. They turned their heads to look at the silent Mysterious Pavilion, the sudden commotion, a towering water column bursting into the sky!</p><p></p><p>The boiling blood, surging fiercely! "Is this... a Grand Master?!"</p><p></p><p>"In the Mysterious Pavilion, is there a Grand Master fighting?!"</p><p></p><p>Standing upright with a sword in the cliff, the carriage driver, his eyes suddenly brilliant, the divine aura rolling, the Grand Master's blood and qi like a roaring tiger!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang also appeared, his brows furrowed, clenching his fists, gazing intently.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The mist rolled and surged, as if hundreds of dragon shadows were dancing and soaring in it! Just one collision, it was so terrifying! The howling roar spreading from the mist, made the wind and waves on the Angry Cliff raging!</p><p></p><p>Flying sand and stones, piercing the void! The surging waves pounding the shore angrily! Such a momentum, caused the sea serpent horses and horses to panic and neigh incessantly, causing an uproar in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Mansion, as well as the martial artists from various places, were all startled.</p><p></p><p>Many of the cultivators who sent the spirit children to participate in the Temple Deity resonance, were even deathly pale...</p><p></p><p>The Temple Deity resonance, how could such a terrifying collision occur?</p><p></p><p>What about those children?!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even the confronting Influence Cultivator True Person, gazed at the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"It's the King!"</p><p></p><p>Sweeping over from the collision of overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>The Influence Cultivator True Person, sensed a familiar aura that struck the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>That is the King's aura! The King's martial dao will left in the Young King's body?</p><p></p><p>It actually activated this wisp of martial dao will...</p><p></p><p>The one who killed the Young King...</p><p></p><p>Must die!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Pavilion surged, the rumbling dragon roar came.</p><p></p><p>Above.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel was spinning frantically, scattering countless jumping sparks! Jiao Shaochun sat cross-legged, his whitened hair flying, a trace of astonishment flashed on his withered face.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Myriad Dragons Prostrating to the Deity..."</p><p></p><p>"At least a Grand Master level Myriad Dragons Prostrating to the Deity true meaning!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it Princess Yimo Li's Martial Saint will?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun's face, like the bark of a thousand-year-old tree, trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>His dry lips and teeth closed, with a hint of bitterness spreading.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihui...</p><p></p><p>Was really killed.</p><p></p><p>Even the Pacifier King's Martial Saint will was forced out, and the murderer could even clash with the Martial Saint will without falling behind! That is Princess Yimo Li's Martial Saint will after all...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Golden Light Mansion, who can resist? Who can?!

        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a black outfit, looked very energetic. His muscular body, honed through martial arts training, filled out the clothes, making him appear upright and vigorous, standing out among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stopped in his tracks and looked towards the three people approaching in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The big-headed Lü Chi with the Nezha-style braid was very familiar to Li Che, but the other two figures beside him made him slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They were dressed in official uniforms, with the distinctive waist plaque of the Temple Guardianship Office hanging at their waists, engraved with the image of a small temple - very recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's first thought was that he might have been reported by this little rascal Lü Chi.</p><p></p><p>But this idea was quickly extinguished, as Li Che had always been gracious and amiable towards Lü Chi, so there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>He waited quietly as the three approached.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li," Lü Chi said, seeing Li Che, his head bobbing, and he quickly called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the other two and said, "These two..."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, they are from the Celestial Observatory!" Lü Chi immediately provided the answer, not keeping them in suspense.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned - the Celestial Observatory?</p><p></p><p>In the Great Jing Dynasty, the Temple Guardianship Office, the Celestial Observatory, and the Divine Sect were the three great powers, with the first two belonging to the court's forces, while the Divine Sect was a sectarian force.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardianship Office dealt with mysterious temples, belonging to the combat forces, felling mountains, destroying temples, suppressing the strange and eliminating the evil - all these dirty and tiring tasks were handled by the Temple Guardianship Office.</p><p></p><p>While the Celestial Observatory, within the court, was more like a logistical force, producing elixirs, divine artifacts, and divine weapons, earning a fortune and becoming extremely wealthy.</p><p></p><p>The "Great Jing Celestial Observatory Furious Mysterious Bluefish Blood Martial Elixir" that Li Che had taken when he broke through the Profound Vein was from the Celestial Observatory.</p><p></p><p>"It was the teacher who asked me to bring you to the capital city and introduce you to the Celestial Observatory. This recommendation spot is extremely precious," Lü Chi said, shaking his big head.</p><p></p><p>The two men in official uniforms smiled at Li Che: "Senior Qingshan has recommended you to the Celestial Observatory, and we are here to contact you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his hands, and the two men returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>"I was just about to go to the '留香阁' (Lingering Fragrance Pavilion). Why don't we go there and chat over some food and drinks?"</p><p></p><p>Confirming that the other party had no ill intentions, Li Che became even more gracious and amiable, smiling and inviting them.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi was not interested in eating, and without hesitation, chose Xixia over food and the scooter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the three from the Celestial Observatory arrived at the "Lingering Fragrance Pavilion".</p><p></p><p>The most prosperous restaurant outside the capital city, it was highly favored by the nobles of the outer city, mainly because of the chef's excellent culinary skills, producing dishes that were both fragrant and visually appealing.</p><p></p><p>The financially well-off Li Che did not hold back, ordering a table full of good wine and delicious dishes.</p><p></p><p>Although the prices in the capital city were extremely high, it was nothing compared to the piles of gold bars and silver ingots in his Spatial Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Li, you are too kind," the three said, seated in the private room, with a cool-looking female musician playing the zither, the music lingering in the air.</p><p></p><p>"I am from the Celestial Observatory of the Golden Light Capital, Liu He, and this is my colleague, Hai Chuanying. We are both third-rank guest officials of the Celestial Observatory."</p><p></p><p>"Guest officials?" Li Che seemed puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's confusion, the eloquent Liu He smiled and explained, "Guest officials need to pass an examination to enter the Celestial Observatory and enjoy the benefits of Celestial Observatory officials, but they are not true Celestial Observatory officials and do not hold official ranks."</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood - it was like the difference between contract workers and temporary workers in the civil service.</p><p></p><p>"As Senior Qingshan, who is ranked eighth on the Divine Foundation Genealogy of Cloud State, naturally attaches great importance to you, we have personally come to contact Mr. Li."</p><p></p><p>"We have completed the collection of Mr. Li's information. In just three years, you have gone from a wood carving apprentice at the Xu Family Wood Carving Shop in Feiluo City to becoming a master wood carver, able to carve divinely inspired wood carvings. Your talent is truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan's recommendation is also quite reasonable."</p><p></p><p>Liu He clinked glasses with Li Che and they drank the fine wine, but after just one cup, Liu He's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The wine from the outer city is still a bit lacking. Although the Lingering Fragrance Pavilion is the best restaurant in the outer city, this wine... is indeed rather ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Li, if you have the chance to enter the inner city, I will invite you to try the divine-quality wine of the Yunfang Pavilion. </p><p></p><p>"With a beautiful lady pouring the wine, the divine-quality warm wine, once it touches the lips, the whole body is revived with divine energy. That taste... mmm..." Liu He couldn't help but exclaim in praise.</p><p></p><p>The man named Hai Chuanying next to him spoke in a calm tone, "Liu, Mr. Li has not yet entered the Celestial Observatory and become a guest official. Are you already thinking of taking him to the brothels to enjoy the music?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, as long as he can pass the guest official examination, it's only a matter of time. After all, the recommendation spot is so precious, Senior Qingshan won't waste it," Liu He laughed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che invited the three to eat and drink, gradually inquiring about the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan's recommendation only gives you the qualification to take the examination. Whether you can truly become a Celestial Observatory guest official will depend on Mr. Li's own abilities," Liu He said.</p><p></p><p>"We guest officials, although not true Celestial Observatory officials, still enjoy considerable benefits. More importantly, we can borrow the power of the Celestial Observatory and gain its protection. For someone like you from the outer city, this is the key," he continued.</p><p></p><p>"The incident in Feiluo City has already spread to the capital. City Lord Cao Guang sacrificed the entire city in an attempt to promote the Mysterious Temple, but due to Senior Qingshan's presence, the plan failed, and Cao Guang died, as did his son Cao Qingyuan..."</p><p></p><p>Liu He took a sip of wine and squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Cao Guang's death doesn't matter, but... Cao Qingyuan's death is not good news for you, Mr. Li."</p><p></p><p>"Cao Qingyuan's mother is Qin Yuqing of the Qin Family..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, although already aware of this, still revealed a look of astonishment: "What does Cao Qingyuan's death have to do with us?"</p><p></p><p>Liu He glanced around and then looked at Hai Chuanying, "Brother Hai, you should be the one to explain this."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying snorted, "You're still afraid of getting into trouble."</p><p></p><p>"This woman, Qin Yuqing, is the third daughter of the Qin Family patriarch, and a core disciple of the Golden Rift Gate. On the surface, she appears gentle and accommodating, but in reality, she is extremely malicious, enjoying assassinating people in the dark and delighting in torturing them. She is known as the Jade-Faced Demonic Rakshas..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's due to the influence of the divine foundation she cultivates, the 'Infernal Wrath Demon King'..."</p><p></p><p>"But her maliciousness is notorious, and she is the Qin Family's 'black glove' in handling matters. With her son dying in Feiluo City, she will surely vent her anger on those from Feiluo City."</p><p></p><p>"This may also be one of the reasons why Senior Qingshan recommended Mr. Li," Hai Chuanying said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter and I came here for the Divine Sect's sect examination. Does she dare to target us?" Li Che frowned.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying, however, laughed, looking at Li Che strangely, "But you haven't even been examined yet, nor have you entered the Divine Sect. It's not even a done deal..."</p><p></p><p>"They are quite adept at playing these games by the rules."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Divine Sect is powerful, the five great families of the capital city and the five major sects, who have been deeply rooted in the capital for hundreds of years, are all local tyrants."</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood.</p><p></p><p>He chatted further with Liu He and Hai Chuanying about the specific content and situation of the Celestial Observatory guest official examination.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the food and drinks, he bid farewell to Liu He and Hai Chuanying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He ordered a table of wine and dishes and had the staff of the Lingering Fragrance Pavilion send them to his residence in the Listening Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then went to another courtyard he had in the Golden Light Capital.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was filled with piles of wood, the rich aroma of wood permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on a wooden chair, Li Che's fingertips glowed with light as he tore open the air, clenching his five fingers to retrieve a large object.</p><p></p><p>It was the "First Generation · Namo Xian Gong Bodhi Barrett" mechanism that Li Che had just finished developing and manufacturing.</p><p></p><p>Made of seventh-grade spiritual wood dragon-tooth boxwood, it had taken him several ruined carving knives to finally carve it out.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-tooth boxwood was extremely long and slender, like dragon fangs, more aesthetically pleasing than a decorative piece.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-tooth Bodhi were the bullets, and Li Che had used seventh-grade spiritual wood, combined with Bodhi tears and the craftsmanship of the Raven Spiritual Wood, to painstakingly create one round.</p><p></p><p>Even just one round had cost Li Che an enormous amount of effort.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the spiritual awareness he gained after breaking through the divine foundation, he wouldn't have had much confidence in such a delicate task.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also understood that although he had Qian Xi's assistance, the importance of spiritual awareness could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Patiently polishing the smooth barrel of the dragon-tooth boxwood, Li Che remained silent, his gaze somber.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, I walk on thin ice..."</p><p></p><p>"But this world is ultimately too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"I want to quietly watch my daughter grow up, but there are always those who don't want that... who want to break the ice under my feet and let me fall into the icy abyss."</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head, the spring breeze caressing his face, yet it felt icy and bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>Feiluo City was like this, and the capital city was no different...</p><p></p><p>Without a background, it was too difficult in this world.</p><p></p><p>Like today, if it weren't for Li Qingshan's face, those two third-rank guest officials from the Celestial Observatory might not have even given him a second glance.</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately... I'm still not strong enough..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, clenching his five fingers, gripping the dragon-tooth boxwood barrel, and with his other hand, he picked up the other components and slowly assembled them.</p><p></p><p>The sound of metal and wood friction was like the most melodious music in the world.</p><p></p><p>Click, click...</p><p></p><p>When the assembly was complete, Li Che held it up with both hands.</p><p></p><p>He had not made a scope, because he didn't need one...</p><p></p><p>If he had made a scope, it would have been looking down on the "Go Chess Sage" too much.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin Family... Qin Yuqing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Nirvana Pulse between his brows pulsed, and his spiritual awareness surged out, activating the dragon-tooth boxwood gun, causing it to flash with patterns as divine energy gradually flowed into it.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying and dangerous aura began to emanate and spread from the mechanism.</p><p></p><p>The wind... howled, the airflow turbulent! Causing the wood chips in the small courtyard to fly about.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yuqing... the core disciple of the Golden Rift Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder... can she withstand a shot of the 'Dragon-Tooth Bodhi'?"</p><p></p><p>"But I... only have one round left."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, continuing to focus intently on polishing the Dragon-Tooth Bodhi, ensuring precision and guaranteeing a perfect one-shot kill on the first try.</p><p></p><p>To achieve a flawless one-shot, one-kill.</p><p></p><p>"You, Qin Yuqing, are sinister and malicious, the Jade-Faced Demonic Rakshas, but I, Li Che, will only act with the utmost sincerity and uprightness..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you."</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled forcefully, his qi and blood surging.</p><p></p><p>Being targeted by such a vicious woman, he ultimately found it difficult to sleep and eat.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Xixia was still young, so adorable, such a little girl, if she were to fall into the hands of that vicious woman and suffer unspeakable torment, as a father, Li Che dared not imagine it, just thinking about it made his organs twist in pain, an immense suffering.</p><p></p><p>"I must... kill her."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I need to accelerate my cultivation... I'm still too weak, I must strive to refine the divine vein as soon as possible. I heard from Senior Qingshan that there are exclusive secret formula pills in the Divine Sect, but unfortunately, without entering the Divine Sect, I cannot obtain them. I can only go to the Qin Tian Observatory to see if there are any good pills."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, I also need to prepare for the guest disciple assessment of the Qin Tian Observatory."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan should have also foreseen the unrest in the capital city, which is why he used this recommendation quota for me."</p><p></p><p>"I can't let down his expectations. The tiger skin of the Qin Tian Observatory is indeed not bad."</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, Li Che formulated his next cultivation plan.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight climbed up the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Che finally finished his cultivation in the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The surging qi and blood within him, like a blooming lotus in hell, gradually coiled and restrained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, and a flash of lightning seemed to flicker in the dark courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Mysterious Vein, the speed of his martial dao cultivation had not decreased much, mainly because after Li Che's [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] reached Level 3, his innate talent had been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, Yang family's [Heart Startling Firm] and Xu family's [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword] divine natures, due to the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit reaching Level 2, the refinement speed has been accelerated. Now they have both completed the refinement of the divine nature chess pieces, reaching the level of 'Cultivating Nature Like a River'. Zhou Ruoguang's [Chaotic Joy Bewitching God] has also barely reached 'Cultivating Nature Like a River', after all, Zhou Ruoguang's own strength is not strong."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have four divine natures reaching the level of 'Cultivating Nature Like a River', and one divine nature has condensed a divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>"The path of divine nature still has a lot of room for progress. Once the divine nature is nourished enough, I will start to condense the other two divine foundations..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, divine light intertwining.</p><p></p><p>Within his Nirvana Heavenly Palace, with the [Unsullied Heart] divine nature, he had divided it into five areas, nourishing five types of divine natures.</p><p></p><p>Joy, Anger, Thought, Sorrow, and Surprise, the five divine natures were hidden in the Nirvana.</p><p></p><p>The seven emotional divine natures, only the divine natures of Worry and Fear were missing.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they should have been gathered in Flying Thunder City, but unfortunately, the An family had fled, and Zhang Xiangyang had also escaped in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, the problem is not too big, the possibility of obtaining these two divine nature techniques in the capital city is much greater.</p><p></p><p>Just need to pay more attention, and I will be able to find them.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation talent in the divine nature secret art is indeed average compared to the Horizontal Refinement."</p><p></p><p>"The [Furious True Lord Killing Gaze] obtained from the mysterious temple, I have just barely entered the door, while the divine nature martial art [Furious True Lord Three Blade Sword] has already reached small success, this is because I have practiced it less."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Python Dragon Cannon and Cloud Hawk Stepping Cloud Leap, they have now reached great success..."</p><p></p><p>"Divine nature martial arts are more suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>After summarizing his own situation, Li Che stretched, his entire body like firecrackers exploding in unison.</p><p></p><p>After a simple tidy up, just before leaving, Li Che flicked his finger, and a white [Unsullied Heart] divine nature chess piece floated and merged into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This is the coordinate anchor point of the Flying Thunder Chess Saint, a habit of leaving one behind, a stable hand for escaping.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Che finally restrained his qi and blood, and strolled back home.</p><p></p><p>Intending to guide his wife's newly developed muscle-opening posture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>The sky was gloomy, with thick, dark clouds piled up in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Spring thunder was rumbling behind them, occasionally flashing with lightning.</p><p></p><p>A spring rain, a warm season, a few more spring rains, and it would be the time of the earth's revival.</p><p></p><p>But the spring rain in early spring was still quite biting.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, who had been guided by Li Che all night to a brand new version of the muscle-opening posture, was lazily lying on the bed like a white snake, without the strength to get up.</p><p></p><p>She surnamed Zhang, after all, was too arrogant...</p><p></p><p>Daring to let him, Li Che, use even a little bit of force, how terrifying his physical body's Horizontal Refinement was.</p><p></p><p>Refreshed after waking up, Li Che guided Xixia's daily martial arts cultivation, then planned to go out and head to the Qin Tian Observatory, to understand the specific details of the assessment required for the next day.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, Liuhe and Haituan Ying had only notified him that he had obtained the assessment qualification, and naturally they would not explain the specific details too verbosely.</p><p></p><p>The sky was gloomy, and the fine rain fell like fine hair.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a clean and neat black outfit, held up an oiled paper umbrella, and the spring rain splashed on the umbrella surface, staining it with droplets.</p><p></p><p>The willow swayed in the wind, and the spring atmosphere was in full bloom.</p><p></p><p>Li Che left Tinghua Alley and stepped onto the spacious and long blue stone street of the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his footsteps paused for a moment, and the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit in his chest cavity pulsed slightly, sensing that someone was spying on him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression remained unchanged as he strolled in the rain under the umbrella.</p><p></p><p>But his mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth chessboard suddenly unfolded...</p><p></p><p>Half of the golden light capital city appeared in his mind, shrinking abruptly, presented in his consciousness, with the consumption of divine nature points.</p><p></p><p>The chessboard criss-crossed, the alleys and streets were all revealed.</p><p></p><p>The aura that was spying on him was also clearly visible on the chessboard, unable to hide.</p><p></p><p>After the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit reached Level 2, his perception became more and more sensitive, and he could even form various colors based on the opponent's aura and hostility.</p><p></p><p>Pitch black color represented the most intense hostility.</p><p>Grayish-black color represented some hostility, but not much.</p><p>Pure white color represented no hostility at all.</p><p></p><p>And in his perception...</p><p></p><p>That aura spying on him... presented a grayish-black color, belonging to having some hostility, but not much.</p><p></p><p>But even if the hostility was not much, it was already unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che, had entered the capital city, always being kind to people, and acting low-key.</p><p></p><p>For no reason, why would someone have hostility towards him?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes reflected a faint glow, the perspective zoomed in, and he clearly saw the person emanating the hostile aura.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in an alley, suppressing his aura without any leakage, under a gray mask, the eyes were gloomy, staring in his direction.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Someone from Qin Yuqing?"</p><p></p><p>"For now, I can't judge... but the problem is not big."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor]'s sleeping elephant was fully activated! The spring rain drizzled down.</p><p></p><p>In the alley.</p><p></p><p>The figure wearing the gray mask suddenly paused, shaking his head, but found that the target he was staring at had disappeared...</p><p></p><p>That's right, he had disappeared right in front of his eyes?</p><p></p><p>"Where's the person? How did he suddenly disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"The divine nature I locked onto him also disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>What's going on? The brow under the mask mask furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>"How am I going to report to the Miss?..."</p><p></p><p>The figure flickered, suddenly appearing on the long street, but no matter how he released his divine sense to perceive, he just couldn't sense where Li Che had gone.</p><p></p><p>"Damn... is this some kind of sorcery?"</p><p></p><p>"This person must have some issues!"</p><p></p><p>He was sure it wasn't his own problem, so it must be the seemingly refined and kind wood carving master from Flying Thunder City... who had issues!</p><p></p><p>"I'd better go back and report to the Miss..."</p><p></p><p>The figure blurred and rushed away in the distance.</p><p></p><p>And after he left.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was...</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Li Che in a black robe, took out a horse-faced mask and covered his face, his eyes dark and gloomy, like a ghost from the underworld, piercing through the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>No, Ox Demon is temporarily out of business.</p><p></p><p>Now, he is Horse Face! With the high-level Chess Saint, in terms of investigation and counterintelligence, no one can match him.</p><p></p><p>Under the extreme aura concealment, Li Che silently followed the gray-masked figure.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the gray figure appear in front of a mansion, Li Che did not approach any closer.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted, falling on that mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, haha..."</p><p></p><p>"I, Li Che, have entered the capital city, behaving low-key and refined, yet I have still been targeted... truly a vicious woman."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I have not seen the appearance of this vicious woman..."</p><p></p><p>"Kill this person, and perhaps the vicious woman will appear?"</p><p></p><p>"After seeing her once, I will add her to my Horse Face's reaping list..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's thoughts emerged, but his hands had already acted.</p><p></p><p>Fingers together, tearing the air.</p><p></p><p>A long bow intertwined with electric currents fell into his hand, and a spiral wooden arrow made of spiritual flower willow wood was nocked on the inferior divine weapon [Mysterious Thunder Angry Flood Dragon Bow].</p><p></p><p>Gripping with five fingers, behind his head, a divine foundation suddenly rose! The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Divine Foundation! The eyebrow of the horse-faced mask split open a vertical line, as if a scarlet eye was rolling around in it.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Killing Gaze!</p><p></p><p>A stream of divine nature light shot out from the vertical eye, as if igniting and charging the entire arrow!</p><p></p><p>The spine muscles trembled, the spine roaring like an angry dragon.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon unparalleled in close combat, Horse Face reaping from afar.</p><p></p><p>The bow drawn to the full moon!</p><p></p><p>Under the mask, the angular jaw slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>Spy, let me let you spy!</p><p></p><p>Fingers released.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Heaven-shaking, wind and thunder vivid, countless airflows surged and shot, the spring rain curtain was violently torn apart!</p><p></p><p>As if an angry flood dragon had its tendons pulled, roaring furiously! The gray-masked figure just about to enter the Qin Mansion, hair standing on end, a divine foundation suddenly emerged behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>This person was actually at the Divine Foundation Initiation Realm! But the arrow shot towards him, the terrifying positional pressure, and a momentary glimpse of a three-eyed divine being, with a vertical eye emitting a deadly light, made his divine nature falter and enter a brief stagnation...</p><p></p><p>Just as he turned his head, he was suddenly pierced through the Nirvana by the terrifyingly powerful arrow.</p><p></p><p>The powerful arrow, piercing through the head.</p><p></p><p>Driving his body.</p><p></p><p>Nailed to the front of the Qin Mansion gate.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>After the brief stagnation.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly burst forth from within!</p>

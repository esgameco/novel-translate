        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The banquet ended, and Li Che led his family back to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After comforting his wife and Xixia to sleep,</p><p></p><p>Li Che came to the courtyard, where Old Chen was dead drunk and had already fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>The night breeze gently blew, and a figure in a blue robe sat quietly in the courtyard, reading a book.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a dim night, for Li Qingshan, whose eyesight was extremely strong, he could see clearly even in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan closed the book and said faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a strong alcoholic breath, expelling the alcohol in his body, his eyes clear and sober, without any drunkenness.</p><p></p><p>Now, his martial dao had reached the peak of his meridians, and ordinary alcohol could hardly make him drunk.</p><p></p><p>"After today, Xixia will officially enter the Qianyuan Sect. The entry examination in the capital city next February during the Spring Equinox will be just a formality."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Five days later, I plan to leave Feilei City. At that time, without my deterrence and protection, Feilei City may encounter changes."</p><p></p><p>"So, you and your family should pack up and leave the city with me then."</p><p></p><p>Five days later? Li Che was slightly taken aback. Is it that urgent?</p><p></p><p>"I have stayed in Feilei City long enough, and since I have shown my identity as a Sect Acceptance Emissary, I can no longer stay in Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>"The Jin'guang Prefecture governs many cities, all of which have spiritual children waiting for me to accept them."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan lightly tapped the book "Essentials of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms" that he had been studying these days.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, won't you go to the capital city with us?" Li Che asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"LÃ¼ Chi will go with you, and I need to go to other cities. In February next year during the Spring Equinox, I will arrive at the capital city and participate in the entry examination... I'll see you then."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia has good talent, and I will definitely take her as my disciple. I'm just afraid that others who are envious will try to snatch her, and... after going to the capital city, the court may also set its sights on Xixia, an excellent spiritual child, which is very tempting."</p><p></p><p>"The court?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Great Jing Temple Bureau, although the Great Jing Dynasty has relaxed the restrictions and allowed the major aristocratic families to cultivate spiritual children, but... to snatch the talents of the Sect, the Great Jing Dynasty will not be soft-handed at all."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Undermining the foundation is a common occurrence in the capital city and the provincial cities. No matter how great the benefits you are offered, once you enter the Temple Bureau, the key is whether you can survive to receive them."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Jing Temple Bureau is very strong, no weaker than any Sect, but... the casualty rate is also extremely high. They raid the temples, collect benefits, and suppress the temple deities, all of which require sacrificing lives to build up."</p><p></p><p>"I can only tell you this much. The decision in the capital city is up to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at the night.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, my departure in five days is with consideration. There are people who are eager for me to leave early, and only when I leave, will they dare to reveal their claws..."</p><p></p><p>"The disappearance of so many spiritual children in Feilei City is related to the Spiritual Infant Sect, and the Spiritual Infant Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite calm: "Is it related to the City Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The City Lord Cao Guang is the patriarch of the Spiritual Infant Sect... You know, many people know this."</p><p></p><p>"I really want to smash him to death, but I can't do it for now."</p><p></p><p>"My divine nature is mostly left in the mountain gate, used to gather the divine nature of the temple deities, so... relying solely on the cultivation of a Sect Master, I can't kill Cao Guang, after all, my strongest aspect is the divine nature."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"This Cao Guang... is he that strong? The same divine foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"The divine foundation also has strong and weak differences, related to the divine foundation law one cultivates, and one's own martial dao and physical body. Moreover, this Cao Guang... has a big problem, and he should have a close relationship with the 'Corpse Deity Sect'. That 'Thousand Buddha Feast' clearly shows his appetite and ambition are extremely great."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's expression became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart sank upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Sect? Another strange sect?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what is the Corpse Deity Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect... is a major strange sect that has swept through the Great Jing. They worship the cultivation of the 'Three Pure Corpse Deity Consumption Proper Law', which can consume the divine nature of corpses and transform it into their own divine nature. It is extremely evil. The Three Pure-level divine nature techniques will not be passed down, but the simplified 'Corpse Deity Consumption Art' of the Corpse Deity Sect has become a means to corrupt many cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and hesitated a bit before revealing some secrets.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, and his brain buzzed.</p><p></p><p>This description... </p><p></p><p>Why does it sound so familiar?!</p><p></p><p>The 'Three Pure Corpse Deity Consumption Proper Law', which can absorb the divine nature of corpses and transform it into one's own divine nature? What's the difference between this and his Thousand Analysis hand absorbing divine nature to refine the chess piece of the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit? Li Che took a deep breath, and his teeth ached slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How evil."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan did not doubt Li Che's reaction, as ordinary people would have this reaction when first hearing about the Corpse Deity Proper Law: "Indeed, it is evil, after all, it comes from the strange temple of the Three Pures. But it is said that the cultivation difficulty is also extremely high, and it is easy to lose one's will and become a monster that is neither human nor ghost."</p><p></p><p>"And by consuming divine nature, one is also easily contaminated by the aura of the dead, and then one's own body will turn into a walking corpse..."</p><p></p><p>"In short, Li Che, the techniques and laws of the Corpse Deity Sect, you must never get involved. If you do... your cultivation path will be ruined!"</p><p></p><p>"Once you taste the pleasure of quickly improving your cultivation by devouring others' divine nature..."</p><p></p><p>"And then try to cultivate slowly, I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to do so, your mentality... will completely degenerate, and your martial dao and cultivation path will be cut off!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's expression was extremely serious, speaking with great solemnity.</p><p></p><p>He was not only pointing out the dangers to Li Che, but also because he had high hopes for Li Che and hoped that his path would not go astray.</p><p></p><p>If one cultivates the "Corpse Deity Consumption Art" of the Corpse Deity Sect, in the early and middle stages, it would not be noticeable, but only in the later stage, when the aura of the dead erupts and the will is completely invaded, would it be exposed. By then, there would be no turning back.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was worried that Li Che would go down the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan knew that Li Che was the Ox Demon, but the Ox Demon... seems to be only powerful in the martial dao, and his divine nature is quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>If his divine nature also suddenly and drastically increased, then Li Qingshan would really have to consider whether Li Che had been tempted by the Corpse Deity Sect and cultivated the Corpse Deity Consumption Art.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded his head rapidly like a pecking chicken.</p><p></p><p>But his heart couldn't help but be slightly disturbed.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Analysis hand... plus the [Chess Saint] Dao fruit, is equivalent to the 'Three Pure Corpse Deity Consumption Proper Law'? Fortunately, the divine nature chess pieces refined from the Chess Saint Dao fruit have no side effects and will not affect his mentality.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che always had a feeling...</p><p></p><p>The demonic head is actually my own mistake.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by like sand between the fingers, and three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because they knew that Li Qingshan was about to leave, these three days saw Feilei City become visibly more lively.</p><p></p><p>The City Lord's Mansion also began to prepare for the "Thousand Buddha Feast", inviting several troupes of performers to the city for grand performances.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che had no time to watch the performances. He went to the black market, took the blood of the three sacrificial animals and five livestock he had purchased, and returned to the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>What he obtained from Old Man Yang was the "Nine Luminaries Startling Firm Divine Foundation Law".</p><p></p><p>But although Li Che had extracted Old Man Yang's divine nature and refined it into a chess piece, to cultivate and raise it to the level of a river-like nurturing divine nature, it would take a month or two.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had no chance to forge the Startling Firm Divine Foundation for the time being.</p><p></p><p>However, his [Wrathful Amitabha] divine nature had already been nurtured to the peak of a river, so he could try to forge a divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the carving knife, he took the last piece of "Spiritual Flower Willow" spiritual wood, and the internal energy surging from his meridians poured into the spiritual wood, causing steam to rise.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, there seemed to be a faint glow flickering on the spiritual wood, and all the steam was evaporated, with the spirituality of the wood fully activated.</p><p></p><p>This process was quite consuming of internal energy.</p><p></p><p>No wonder only master wood carvers can do wood carving, because most of them have quite decent martial dao cultivation, and it takes decades of tempering of their qi and blood to have enough powerful internal energy to evaporate the spirituality of the wood.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the wooden chair, Li Che recalled the wood carving patterns passed down by the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the carving knife shot out, and Li Che clenched his five fingers, and the knife flashed like a slithering snake, shining with bright white light, wandering on the "Spiritual Flower Willow" spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>The falling wood chips scattered in the courtyard of the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was extremely focused, his mind highly concentrated. The carving knife tore open the wood fibers, sketching out the rough lines, and with just a few lines, the overall outline was presented.</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit provided Li Che with superb craftsmanship, and the skilled art of wood carving was no longer a challenge for him.</p><p></p><p>After about two hours, Li Che completed the carving and polishing of the last wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>"The third statue, the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Infant Statue..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled with a thunderous voice, and in an instant, all the wood chips were swept away from the wooden sculpture, revealing the lifelike wooden statue.</p><p></p><p>Three eyes, wrathful eyes, sitting on a lotus pedestal, with robes fluttering, and a braided hairstyle.</p><p></p><p>The other two statues were also wrathful-eyed, but with different poses.</p><p></p><p>Li...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Che stood up, stretched his limbs, and was also recovering his qi and blood, strengthening his body.</p><p></p><p>The circulation of qi and blood roared and surged through the meridians, his whole body brimming with a mighty spirit. He slowly pushed forward the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, refining his physique with the Hua Jing Fist Art.</p><p></p><p>Without having activated the Vajra Transformation, his muscle lines were already extremely powerful. Under the tight-fitting black clothes, his muscles were filled with explosive power. Each move he made expanded and circulated the inner qi that bulged beneath his skin, like scurrying little mice.</p><p></p><p>Slowly gathering his strength, his qi and blood boiled to a peak, but it was already very difficult to make further progress through physical tempering alone.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of qi and blood has reached the peak of the qi channels, there is nowhere further to go..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a breath, like a raging hurricane sweeping through the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This further solidified Li Che's intention to forge a divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was about to head to the prefecture city, where there were many powerful experts, and the potential dangers would be even greater. After breaking through to the divine foundation, his ability to withstand dangers would also increase.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, the day before leaving the city, I will come here to forge the divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>He placed all the prepared items in order.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his fingers, a white divine chess piece leaped and landed in the bamboo pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he clenched his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Chess Sage of the Flying Thunder returned to the city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was deep and quiet.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind rustled.</p><p></p><p>The suddenly lowered temperature caused small snowflakes to fall, draping the land in a silver coat, wrapping the entire city in a pure white.</p><p></p><p>The carriage wheels crushed the snow on the cobblestones, kicking up a flurry of snow grains.</p><p></p><p>Lifting the curtain, the weary Xu You, dressed in white clothes, exhaled a white breath and stepped out of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the carriage can stop here, you can go back early, I'll return home tomorrow..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You instructed the carriage driver of Xu's Residence.</p><p></p><p>"Third Master, you should also rest, you've been working hard these days." The driver, still respectful towards Xu You, expressed his concern before cracking the whip to drive the horses away.</p><p></p><p>With a sword hanging at his waist, the snow-dusted Xu You swept a glance at the seemingly unfamiliar Flying Thunder City, gently shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>On his way back, the driver had also told him about the recent changes in Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>The Yang family was wiped out by the Ox Demon, even their divine foundation ancestor was killed. The An family was so frightened that they moved out of the city overnight. The Si family was in decline, and the Xu family had become the pillar family of Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>It was so unreal...</p><p></p><p>Xu You didn't expect that so many major events would have happened during his absence from the city.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the Envoy of the Divine Sect had arrived, and Xixie was an exceptional spiritual child, shocking many people. And the wood carving master Li Che was actually a 22-year-old spiritual child, which was even more shocking to the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Xu You also learned from this that the Li family was going to move to the prefecture city to participate in the Divine Sect's entry examination in the second month of spring next year.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the last time we'll see each other?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You exhaled a breath, accompanied by the drifting snowflakes, and returned to the Xu family's estate.</p><p></p><p>There was no one to welcome him, and no one cared about his return.</p><p></p><p>He returned to his own courtyard, pushed open the door, and the thick snow had piled up, just as it was when he left. There was no sign of life.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, he grabbed the teapot, but it was empty.</p><p></p><p>Xu You stared blankly, when his mother was still alive, every time he returned from the Divine Cultivation Institute, there would be hot tea and hot food waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>He had been sitting in his own room for nearly half an hour, waiting for his father to summon him.</p><p></p><p>However, it never happened, as if his return was of no concern to anyone.</p><p></p><p>Xu You bitterly smiled and shook his head. What was he expecting? He stood up, locked the door, hung his sword, and left.</p><p></p><p>He headed straight towards Li Che's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the courtyard gate, he could already hear Xixie's excited screams from inside.</p><p></p><p>He knocked on the door.</p><p></p><p>The moment Xu You stepped into the alley, Li Che immediately sensed it.</p><p></p><p>So, as soon as Xu You knocked on the door, it was opened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a black outfit, smiled at the weary-looking Xu You: "You're back?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Xu You!" The scream came from the courtyard, and Xixie came dashing over, standing in front of Xu You and blinking her eyes up at him.</p><p></p><p>Xu You couldn't help but unconsciously raise the corners of his mouth in a smile, feeling the completely different atmosphere from the empty and cold courtyard of his own home.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't had dinner yet? Perfect, Old Chen is also here, let's have a drink together."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xu You smiled.</p><p></p><p>Brushing the snow off himself, he stepped into the clean and tidy courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Under the eaves of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The charcoal brazier radiated warmth, boiling water gurgling.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen Chen Dabao carried a jar of precious wine and walked out of the house, waving to Xu You.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xu family estate.</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Xu family sat in the armchair, his aged face flushed with a sickly redness, occasionally coughing.</p><p></p><p>There was a stench of decay emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming stood respectfully, and next to him was the bowed Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>"Xu You is back?"</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Xu family asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming nodded: "I sent him out to eradicate the demonic aura that had escaped from the mysterious temple. He just returned."</p><p></p><p>"Then as his father, you didn't go to greet him?" The old master of the Xu family glanced at him: "At least he's your son."</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's expression didn't change much.</p><p></p><p>"He's just a discarded son anyway, what's the point of greeting him? His fate has already been determined..."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how you never comforted your eldest son back then..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's tone was very calm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli didn't dare to say a word next to him.</p><p></p><p>This secret... was the first time he had heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"Your eldest brother... I wronged him..."</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Xu family's gaze was hazy, sighing lightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming shook his head: "No, it was I who wronged your eldest son, I failed to break through the divine foundation... the fault lies with me, all mistakes are mine."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's body trembled slightly beside him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming turned to look at Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>"Heli, don't learn from me, you must live up to your third brother, you must break through the divine foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"Only then will you not betray him."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The clear words echoed in the room.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli raised his head, exhaling a turbid breath.</p><p></p><p>His body no longer trembled, and he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I understand."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The mountain range on the horizon was shrouded in white mist.</p><p></p><p>Fine rain and winter snow intertwined.</p><p></p><p>After a good night's sleep, Li Che went straight into the study, directly grasping the chess piece anchor and arriving at the bamboo pavilion outside the city.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo pavilion was quiet, the gentle wind carrying the winter rain brushing the bamboo leaves, making a rustling sound like the sound of waves.</p><p></p><p>After a night's rest, Li Che's spirit and energy were at their peak.</p><p></p><p>First, he braved the misty rain and snow, reconfirming the various hidden traps and mechanisms set up around the bamboo pavilion, before returning to the interior.</p><p></p><p>He took an incense burner, lit the incense sticks, and the lingering smoke curled into the air.</p><p></p><p>He then took the blood of the three sacrificial animals and five livestock, liquefied it with inner qi, and placed it in white bowls, arranging them properly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took the three carved statues of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lords and placed them in three different positions, forming a triangular formation.</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Li Che sat down cross-legged in the center.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he sat down, he felt a great difference. The divine energy in the heavens and earth seemed to be boiling, being drawn by an invisible force, converging towards the spot where he was sitting.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a formation?" Li Che couldn't help but feel curious.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat similar to a sacrificial ritual formation, and once the formation was established, it would attract divine energy.</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>He expanded the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit's heavenly earth chessboard, always vigilant to the situation around him, so that he could react immediately if anyone intruded.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Che slowly exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the cushion, the details of the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Divine Foundation Technique" flowed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Che suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged and intertwined, his physical body abruptly tensed, his muscles bulging, his entire person expanding by a circle.</p><p></p><p>His powerful physique was shrouded in a hazy blood-colored mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone like lightning, his black hair flying up with vigor, exuding an "angry" aura! He raised his hand and pointed at his brow.</p><p></p><p>The inner scenery of the Mud Pill Palace suddenly appeared in a thunderous display! There was a torrent of divine energy rushing out like a river, accompanied by the sound of water crashing. The blood of the three sacrificial animals and five livestock in the bowls began to visibly dissipate, as if being consumed by an invisible existence.</p><p></p><p>And the wooden statues placed in the three positions.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly turned blood-red! Letting out an extremely furious roar that pierced the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Please support the novel with monthly votes, reading, and recommendations!

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To prevent Xixia from being attacked by the wind and snow, Old Chen even directly used his inner strength to dispel the cold for the little girl, so that not a single snowflake fell on her.</p><p></p><p>Back in the simple mud hut, Zhang Ya and Li Che immediately got busy, inviting Old Chen back to guard the place, naturally they had to treat him well.</p><p></p><p>They made good wine and good dishes, and had a sumptuous dinner together.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ya's skills are not bad, very good, in the future Old Chen will come to mooch meals, and I'll have the pleasure of eating well."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen ate the dishes while drinking wine, squinting his eyes, extremely happy.</p><p></p><p>Xixia sat in the wooden baby chair made by Li Che, waving her hands, seemingly also wanting to take a sip of Old Chen's gourd wine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che kept Old Chen company for a few cups, but didn't drink much more.</p><p></p><p>After all, tonight they had to worry about the desperate disciples of the Lingying Sect, so he had to keep his wits about him.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Old Chen played with Xixia, while Li Che sat in the chair, by the oil lamp, as usual taking out the wood he had brought back from the wood carving shop, practicing carving and trying to make mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because their relationship had become closer, that "Treatise on Tang Mechanisms" he had lent out, Old Chen casually mentioned that he wouldn't be collecting money from Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che became an official wood carver, although he didn't lack that fifty coins, this was still Old Chen's attitude, so Li Che respectfully thanked him with a toast.</p><p></p><p>The sleeve crossbow was completed, but Li Che didn't stop there, he planned to make two more, one hidden in the other sleeve, and the other prepared for his wife Zhang Ya, just in case.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after making the sleeve crossbow once, the maturity of the Dao fruit had already been extracted, and could no longer be further grown. If he wanted the Dao fruit to mature more, he could only make other mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow were thick, howling and raging outside.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, the oil lamp flickered and danced, casting shadows.</p><p></p><p>In the late night.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, who was protecting the sleeping Xixia, suddenly narrowed his eyes and silently left the house, leaping up onto the roof.</p><p></p><p>His powerful qi, like an angry dragon, roared in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>A few approaching dark shadows, sensing Old Chen's aura, without the slightest hesitation, turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's face was gloomy, these disciples of the Lingying Sect were really crazy, daring to commit crimes in the dead of night.</p><p></p><p>"One to open the tendons, four to grind the skin, this formation... If Old Chen wasn't here tonight, little Che might not be able to protect Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen pulled out the stopper of the gourd, taking a gulp of wine.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with a fierce light.</p><p></p><p>The Lingying Sect... </p><p>Had really made Feilei City a chaotic mess.</p><p></p><p>Back in the house, Old Chen nodded at Li Che, then returned to the sleeping Xixia's side.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hand gripping the carving knife, the veins rising like coiling dragons, after a long while, he slowly exhaled, calming his heart to continue carving.</p><p>This kindness from Old Chen today, Li Che would remember.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, the weather cleared, no longer snowing.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya got up early to start packing, preparing to move.</p><p></p><p>Although her husband hadn't said much to her, but with her keen perception, seeing that Old Chen had been invited to guard their home, she understood that there was a dangerous threat to her little family.</p><p></p><p>So, there was no sadness in moving, only the desire to move into the courtyard of the wood carving shop as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The things in the mud hut weren't many, just some daily necessities piled up, they called a donkey cart and headed towards Xu's wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>The neighbors on the street, seeing this scene, one by one poked their heads out, looking at them with surprise and envy.</p><p></p><p>"So they're moving... This family is going to make it big, flying out of this remote corner."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Che has become an official wood carver at Xu's wood carving shop... In the future he can make a lot of money!"</p><p></p><p>"Just looking at Che, you can tell he's someone who can succeed! Now he's a wood carver, I heard the wood carvings made by wood carvers can sell for ten taels of silver each!"</p><p></p><p>"They're not the same as us anymore, they're in a different world now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The neighbors muttered with envy and mixed emotions, watching as the donkey cart crushed the pristine snow and disappeared around the corner of the alley.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the wood carving shop, they directly entered the shop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't see the shop owner, but saw an old man dressed in fine clothes, looking like a butler, holding a set of keys in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, the shop owner asked me to wait for you and accompany you to choose the courtyard."</p><p></p><p>The butler smiled, then looked at the old Chen holding Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Master Chen is here too?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled: "Old Sun, just take Ah Che to the two-room courtyard across from my place, we'll be neighbors from now on!"</p><p></p><p>The one called Old Sun grinned: "That's great, come this way."</p><p></p><p>The group entered the shop's large courtyard, walking through the narrow alleys between the high walls, soon arriving at the residential area, seeing the rows of courtyards lining the alleys.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family Woodcarving Shop was very large, occupying a vast expanse of land! </p><p></p><p>After all, the Xu family was wealthy and powerful, and had also cultivated martial arts skills and inner strength. They had developed the business in Feilei City for over 200 years, with deep foundations.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the big landlords, they were even bigger landlords, having amassed a great deal of land.</p><p></p><p>The old steward Xiao Sun unlocked the door with a key and pushed it open, causing the piled-up snow on the roof to fall, revealing a spacious courtyard covered in thick snow.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, take a look around. If you're not satisfied, you can look at some other courtyards."</p><p></p><p>The old steward Xiao Sun's attitude towards Li Che was very warm and respectful. </p><p></p><p>To be able to become an official woodcarving master from a mere laborer, one must have exceptional woodcarving talent. To become the steward of the Xu Family Woodcarving Shop, one must also have keen discernment - he would not rashly offend others.</p><p></p><p>Li Che led Zhang Ya into the courtyard, and after carefully inspecting it, the long-tense mood finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his lips curved into a smile: "Good, very good."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya also looked at the bright and luxurious courtyard with a dazed and unbelieving gaze. Compared to the previous small mud hut, this was so much better! "In a few days, please invite the whole family over for a housewarming meal, we can finally settle down."</p><p></p><p>After seeing the house, Zhang Ya snuggled into Li Che's embrace, her eyes sparkling.</p><p></p><p>Her husband had promised her a good life, and now... it had finally come true.</p><p></p><p>Their days were gradually getting better!</p><p></p><p>"You two tidy up the courtyard, get settled in. Old Xie can take Xixia to play at home. When you're done, come over for a meal. I'll have someone call you from Spring Wind Pavilion, it's right across from your door."</p><p></p><p>Big Bao carried Xixia, shouting a few words, then returned to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Being so close, they could even hear Xixia's giggles as she played with Big Bao.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled wryly: "I didn't expect Old Chen to get along so well with Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen is really nice. With Xixia with him, we can rest assured as we tidy up..." Zhang Ya smiled softly.</p><p></p><p>The couple exchanged a glance, then enthusiastically began to clean up the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time waits for no one, the seasons flow like a river.</p><p></p><p>Time flies like wood shavings under a knife, scattered unknowingly across the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was one year old.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The autumn chill had just passed, and the thick winter snow had already drifted down, piling up like white cotton in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen sat around the brazier, the old yellow wine warming on the stove, while on the table were sliced braised beef, pigs' ears, mixed with cilantro and garlic paste, the aroma wafting.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the one-year-old Xixia was stepping on the wooden walker Li Che had made for her, running and chasing the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen doted on Xixia, his eyes never leaving her: "Ah, little stinky Xixia, it's snowing outside, it's cold, come back inside to play."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, it's fine, let her play. Once she's tired, she'll sleep well at night, otherwise her abundant energy will have nowhere to vent, and she'll be wide-eyed like copper bells late at night."</p><p></p><p>From the kitchen, Zhang Ya brought out a steaming plate of stir-fried edamame, smiling as she said.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Xixia is one year old, you guys didn't even think of throwing a party? This old man wants Xixia to receive her gifts in style... I've called a few old fellows around, you'd better prepare a few tables!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen grabbed a handful of edamame, chuckling as he ate.</p><p></p><p>Li Che originally didn't want to hold a first birthday party, even though they had moved to the large courtyard of the shop this past year, the Lingying Sect had been quiet. But deep down, Li Che still maintained vigilance.</p><p></p><p>And the closer it got to Xixia's first birthday, the more vigilant Li Che became.</p><p></p><p>After all, that Lei Chunlian had specifically targeted infants on their first birthday! However, after discussing with his wife, they ultimately decided to hold a first birthday party, mainly because the courtyard was spacious enough, and holding it at home would also be considered safe.</p><p></p><p>The old yellow wine was warmed, and a cup was poured for Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also poured himself a cup, taking a light sip, the fragrant wine chasing away the winter chill.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes, a scene emerged.</p><p></p><p>On the vast earth, a towering precious tree with lush branches and leaves, and on it slowly grew a multicolored fruit, the fruit shimmering with light, as if reflecting the many growth scenes of Xixia over the past year.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>The long-awaited expectation finally blossomed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's first birthday, the second Dao fruit...</p><p></p><p>It has arrived.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Your daughter is one year old, safe and sound, you have obtained the Dao fruit "Dragon Elephant Vajra"]</p><p></p><p>PS: Please continue reading, please support with recommendations and monthly votes!

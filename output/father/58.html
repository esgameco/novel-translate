        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down from the high heavens, bitterly cold.</p><p></p><p>Just like the emotions in Li Che's heart at the moment, cold enough to kill.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Li Che's face gradually faded as he stared deeply at Xu Beihu. Although Xu Beihu was his martial arts mentor, he actually coveted Xixia! Xixia was only two and a half years old... How could this man plan to make her his child bride?! It was clearly not because he found Xixia cute, but because he wanted to seize her spiritual talent and bind her future.</p><p></p><p>As her father, how could he possibly push Xixia into the fire pit? Li Che's expression turned cold, and even the slightest warmth towards Xu Beihu disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Xu, you jest. Xixia is still young, it's too early to discuss this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, Xixia's marriage will depend on her own wishes, I will not interfere."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense the coldness in Li Che's words, Xu Beihu narrowed his eyes: "Master Li, the marriage of children is inseparable from us as their parents. The words of parents are the most important."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't be bothered to talk to Xu Beihu anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Beihu was somewhat embarrassed, as if he saw a trace of disdain on Li Che's face.</p><p></p><p>As if saying, what qualifications did his son have to match the highly spiritually gifted Xixia?</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, Feilei City is not safe these days, the threat of the Lingying Sect is becoming more and more serious. Master Li is not one of our Xu family, Xixia's protection in the Xu family may not be complete. If Xixia were to marry my son... then she would be one of our own, and the protection would be different."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze remained calm as he looked at Xu Beihu: "Manager Xu... Are you threatening me?"</p><p></p><p>The calm words seemed to make the heavens and earth fall silent.</p><p></p><p>The dripping sound of raindrops on the tiles and the blue stones became deafening.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu suddenly felt a chill down his back, the spiritual power he had cultivated was boiling incessantly, as if a terrible crisis was approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, Xixia is my goddaughter. As long as my Xu You is alive, he will give Xixia the greatest protection."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a powerful and angry voice came from the Shenxiu Academy behind them.</p><p></p><p>They saw Xu You leading Xixia, who was carrying a small schoolbag, slowly walking over.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia saw Li Che and called out joyfully, her voice soft and sweet. Outside, Xixia was always shy and soft-spoken.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately looked at Xixia, his face filled with tenderness: "Daddy has come to pick you up. Your mother made your favorite stir-fried prawns today, let's go home early."</p><p></p><p>The greedy Xixia couldn't help but drool at the mention of it. However, to maintain her image, she secretly covered her mouth.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xu You confronted Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the rare angry Xu You, Xu Beihu's mouth twitched, but he didn't completely break off: "Forget it, it was just a suggestion. My attitude is very sincere, Master Li... Consider it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu didn't want to say more, just looked at Li Che and turned to leave with his team.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother's children... basically their spiritual talents are too low, and his son is already eight years old, too old." Xu You looked at Li Che, with some righteous indignation, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>More angry than Li Che, the father.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was just silently wanting to kill someone, his expression not too obvious, while Xu You's anger was evident on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's future... is destined to be a Shenzong, but we must not let her be delayed in the Xu family."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xu You looked at Li Che and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"We as parents must take responsibility for our children's future!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled from the heart: "Don't worry, my daughter is my little cotton pad. Whoever dares to covet her will have to face my wrath."</p><p></p><p>Xu You heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Xixia came running over and threw herself into Li Che's open arms.</p><p></p><p>Li Che planted a kiss on Xixia's soft cheek.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, have you been good at the Shenxiu Academy? Did you listen to Auntie Shu's words today? Did you cause any trouble... Hmm? Old Xu, who is he?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes as he looked at the big-headed boy with a Nezha braid following Xixia.</p><p></p><p>This Nezha-braided boy, he looked familiar, wasn't he the child next to the mysterious old man before?</p><p></p><p>Earlier at the Jinhuang Building, Li Che had wondered where the boy had gone...</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this boy had approached Xixia!</p><p></p><p>A strong aura of danger emanated from Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Two words seemed to slowly emerge from the depths of Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>Punk?! His daughter was only two and a half years old, and this punk dared to appear in front of her father?</p><p></p><p>The originally blank-faced Lü Cheng, who was following the mysterious old man, suddenly felt a strong killing intent, and his hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Lü Cheng was following the mysterious old man, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was the one who knew Li Che's true identity.</p><p></p><p>This fellow... was the much-talked-about lone hero, the Ox Demon, from Fei Lei City!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon who had the blood of many on his hands! "Ah, he is Shu Auntie's acquaintance who was cultivating his divine nature at Xu Ji Spiritual Cultivation Monastery, and can be considered Xixia's little friend..."</p><p></p><p>"My Xixia is so cute, how could she be friends with this big-headed fellow?"</p><p></p><p>As a father, he could not get used to a boy constantly following his daughter around.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this boy had an unusual background, as he was traveling with the elder who could kill a Shengi Cultivator. Xu You's mouth twitched, and he understood Li Che's vigilance as a father.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that bad, Old Li, it's not that bad..." Xu You almost laughed out loud.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is quite obedient, and his divine talent is also excellent... Shu Auntie was too lazy to take care of him, so she just threw him to me. I plan to bring him to your house to mooch a meal." Xu You chuckled.</p><p></p><p>But as he was laughing, he suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at him, then glanced at Lü Chi with the Nezha braid.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, I..." Lü Chi tried to speak up, his voice strained.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why his divine nature was constantly boiling, as if he had been targeted by some great demon.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... was just an ordinary blood warrior!</p><p></p><p>Once Lü Chi transformed into the [Wrathful Third Prince], a single slap could kill a large group of people! Why should he be afraid?</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak, come here." Li Che said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lü Chi obediently took a few steps forward. Li Che held Xixia in one arm and gently patted Lü Chi's head, "Not bad, your head is quite big, it should be easy to twist."</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi: "..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You finally couldn't hold it in and burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Ah, the usually approachable Li Che, suddenly becoming cold and protective, was really quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>Twisting the head so easily...</p><p></p><p>You, Li Che, have never even killed anyone, but you sure know how to scare people.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the end, Lü Chi was still taken to mooch a meal, even though he didn't want to go.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che, for some reason, still made him go.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, because it was raining heavily in the courtyard, Xixia and Lü Chi played in the courtyard. This was Xixia's first time bringing a friend home, and the little girl was having a lot of fun.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Chi only felt that Li Che, who was sitting under the eaves and carving wood with a knife, was like constantly measuring his body with the knife.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Xu You discussed the Shengi battle with Li Che, and then took his leave and returned to the Xu family to handle some matters. Although the Xu family had not informed him of this major event, he was still the direct descendant of the Xu family, so he should go back and help.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't try to stop him. As for Xu You, the direct descendant of the Xu family, Li Che only felt pity for him.</p><p></p><p>Xu You, Xu Beihu, and Xu Heli were brothers from different mothers. Xu You's mother had passed away early, and the family patriarch didn't pay much attention to him, because Xu You's divine talent was too low, and it was unknown whether he would be able to step into the "Cultivating Nature Like a River" in the future.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Xu You was too good-natured and honest. The more obedient the child, the less attention the parents would pay.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's status in the Xu family was really not high, and Li Che sometimes felt heartbroken for him.</p><p></p><p>After Xu You left, the only support left for the staying Lü Chi was gone.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Che did not put on the ruthless Ox Demon mask.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>The rainy night was deep, and the dark clouds were so thick that they were almost impossible to disperse.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently lulled Xixia to sleep, then delivered the grain to his wife Zhang Ya and arranged for the mother and daughter to sleep.</p><p></p><p>He then got up and left the master bedroom, making sure that the traps he had set up in the bedroom were intact.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went to the study, and in the darkness, changed into a flexible black outfit and carved out the cute Ox Demon mask, covering his face with it.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, he disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>In the side room.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi, with the Nezha braid, sat cross-legged on the bed, his eyes slightly closed, cultivating his divine nature. The quilt that Zhang Ya had prepared for him was neatly folded into tofu blocks, and he had not covered himself with it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lü Chi opened his eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The thick clouds behind the lightning tore the night sky apart.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi looked towards the suddenly opened window.</p><p></p><p>There, a figure in a wide-brimmed hat and black clothes stood.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind, the turbulent airflow.</p><p></p><p>The flickering lightning...</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the adorable Ox Demon mask under the wide-brimmed hat.</p><p></p><p>PS: Bad news... the strong push didn't work, and we lost by a little bit again.

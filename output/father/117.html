            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Cooperation of Great Wealth and Nobility?</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his eyebrows and glanced at Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>He could smell something unusual about this "great wealth and nobility" cooperation - it might suit his tastes well, because the form of address had changed from "little Li Che" to "Ox Demon," indicating that Li Qingshan's talk of great wealth and nobility cooperation was to be done with the identity of Ox Demon, not Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could more or less guess that Li Qingshan wanted to cooperate with the identity of Ox Demon, and wanted to cooperate in which aspect.</p><p></p><p>He took a sip of hot tea, chewing on the emerald green tea leaves that had entered his mouth, and the bitter taste spread across his tongue.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said, "Senior, speak plainly, what is this great wealth, I'm very interested."</p><p></p><p>Wealth and nobility, who wouldn't be interested? </p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che was in great need of resources, and if he could get a few more Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals, Nine Yang Martial Elixirs, and supreme martial arts, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan also narrowed his eyes and looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the shock Li Che brought to him was no less than Xixia's bone tempering at the age of three.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che had only cultivated for three years, and the time he spent truly stepping into the martial dao and beginning to nurture his divine nature was not much different from the time Xixia took to complete her bone tempering.</p><p></p><p>A 22-year-old spirit child, from just entering the martial dao to the point of being able to kill a sect master in just three years. How terrifying?!</p><p></p><p>Calculating this talent as a genuine spirit child, it would be equivalent to a three-year-old spirit child killing a sect master!</p><p></p><p>Compared to this, Li Che's daughter Xixia no longer seemed so monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Qingshan also knew that he couldn't calculate it this way.</p><p></p><p>But there was no doubt that Li Che and his daughter Xixia... their talents were absolutely terrifying! Li Qingshan pondered carefully, but he couldn't figure out the reason, because it was unreasonable...</p><p></p><p>Xixia could be understood, after all, Li Che was monstrous, so his daughter being monstrous made sense.</p><p></p><p>But why was Li Che's talent so monstrous?</p><p></p><p>Bloodline inheritance? Late bloomer?</p><p></p><p>Before, Li Che was just a mud-treading nobody! Working as a porter in a wood carving shop, earning a miserable living of only dozens of large scenery copper coins a day.</p><p></p><p>How could he suddenly achieve such a reversal?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that there really is a sudden enlightenment technique in the world, like the Peng bird soaring into the clouds? All one can say is that Li Che may have obtained the inheritance of some powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was not interested in these things, everyone has their own opportunities, he would not covet anything, he Li Qingshan also had his own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan withdrew his strange gaze and took a deep breath. "Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"I know all about your actions since you came to the prefecture city, I can only say... well done in killing!"</p><p></p><p>"The forces in the prefecture city are a mixed bag, each with their own schemes, they should be killed off, so they won't be full of themselves and always try to stir up trouble."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a sip of tea and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"You killed the Fishery Gang, those subordinate forces are all related to the Corpse God Sect... the Fishery Gang's composition needs no further explanation."</p><p></p><p>"Jing Wudao has placed his treasure on the Corpse God Sect, planning to be the vanguard for the Corpse God Sect's advance into the Golden Light Prefecture, and in the future he can gain great benefits, even obtain the 'Cursed Copper Corpse' refining technique of the Corpse God Sect, and build his own flesh body to the level of the 'Cursed Copper Corpse'."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled slightly: "Cursed Copper Corpse?"</p><p></p><p>He had activated the Tower Ascension Technique and used the temple god's chess pieces to unleash power that could kill the Cursed Iron Corpses, but their toughness had already exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>The Cursed Copper Corpse, how terrifying could it be? Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes: "The Cursed Copper Corpse is not ordinary, the low-grade Cursed Iron Corpses already possess the strength of a sect master, and if they are top-grade Cursed Iron Corpses, they can even rival a perfected sect master, and may even be harder to deal with than a perfected sect master, because their flesh bodies are unparalleled, indestructible and painless, like the most perfect death soldiers, and once they achieve the Cursed Copper Corpse, they can even be comparable to a great sect master!"</p><p></p><p>"Great sect master?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>In the Qi and Blood Martial Dao, after opening the meridians, the next step is to become a True Qi Sect Master, refining the essence of the martial dao into oneself, the perfect fusion of true intent and qi and blood, forming an even more powerful killing force.</p><p></p><p>And the great sect masters, they refine spirit auras, which are even more terrifying, with the power to split mountains and rivers with a casual gesture! "Yes, spirit aura great sect masters... they are martial dao elites who have realized the path of their own martial dao and comprehended the true meaning of heaven and earth. Every great sect master, even if they do not cultivate divine nature, can easily escape the divine essence pressure of divine sages, and easily flee to save their lives."</p><p></p><p>"Any great sect master, even if they do not cultivate divine nature, can dominate a region and become a powerful expert, and have no fear of divine sages, and can even easily kill them."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, when comparing martial dao to divine nature cultivation, a pure spirit aura great sect master is roughly equivalent to a top-tier divine sage, and compared to divine sages, they are a bit weaker."</p><p></p><p>"After all, to become a divine sage... the flesh body must also refine spirit aura, reaching the great sect master realm."</p><p></p><p>"Without becoming a great sect master, one cannot become a divine sage."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said softly, his eyes flickering with a hint of longing and pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Unless one cultivates to the realm of heaven and human unity among the great sect masters, one can then, relying solely on pure martial dao, contend with divine sages."</p><p></p><p>Pure qi and blood martial dao, competing with divine sages! Such a realm, how grand and magnificent, it is hard not to be captivated by it.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, in the present era, pure martial dao great sect masters are extremely rare, most of them will also cultivate divine nature, after all, comprehending heaven and earth through divine nature is much easier and smoother."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan laughed, with a hint of wistfulness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have reached the great sect master realm relying solely on their own comprehension are few and far between."</p><p></p><p>He came back to the main topic, looking at Li Che, or rather, Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>"You killed the Fishery Gang, most of them were those who had been imprinted with the Corpse Curse. Can you sense who has been imprinted with the Corpse Curse?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's gaze was intense as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow, then smoothed it out and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense it... and therefore struck them down."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect has set its sights on my daughter, all those who have been imprinted are not innocent, they shall be killed without mercy."</p><p></p><p>There was an icy killing intent in Li Che's words.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan clapped his hands and stroked his beard, laughing heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to sense the Corpse Curse imprint, it seems you are naturally sensitive to corpse qi. Normally, when a cultivator is imprinted with the Corpse Curse and has entered the Nirvana Palace, the divine nature can conceal it, and it is impossible to see it in ordinary circumstances..."</p><p></p><p>"You can see through it, this is an advantage, this is the foundation of our cooperation to achieve great wealth and nobility!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes, a sharp intent flashing in his eyes. He didn't care how Li Che was able to sense it, he just needed Li Che to confirm that whenever Ox Demon set his sights on a Fishery Gang cultivator who had been imprinted, it was not a guess, but because he had the ability to identify the Corpse Curse imprint, and that was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how do you want to cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not only the Fishery Gang, but the other two major gangs, the five great families, the five major sects... even the divine sect branches... may all have the possibility of having traitors who have allied with the Corpse God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"This prefecture city is filled with filth, with corpse qi flowing everywhere, making one want to vomit."</p><p></p><p>"You point out the filth to me, and I will clean it up myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>This was to have him confirm who had been imprinted with the Corpse Curse, and then... strike them down?! "The idea is pretty good... but a bit difficult, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Like the Fishery Gang, that Fishery Gang leader Jing Wudao has been imprinted with the Corpse Curse, he is a true divine sage cultivator, if you and I go to clean him up... we may end up being the ones cleaned up."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said it directly.</p><p></p><p>When he acted alone, he could instantly teleport and escape using the flying thunder chess pieces, even a divine sage cultivator might not be able to catch him.</p><p></p><p>But if they acted as partners...</p><p></p><p>If he ran, his partner might not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qingshan was powerful, against a true divine sage, he might have a hard time.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, do you think it's just the two of us acting? Do you think we don't have any companions... no, partners?"</p><p></p><p>"When we clean up, we'll naturally start from the illusory realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes flashed with a rebellious look: "Moreover, give me another year, divine sages..."</p><p></p><p>"So what?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo had abandoned Li Qingshan and moved into Li Che's courtyard, wanting to keep Xixia company.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's lament was pitiful, but there was no help for it, he had just returned to the prefecture city, and there were too many things to deal with, so he could only go along with his old lover's wishes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no objection to Shu Popo living in his home.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just a matter of a few more pairs of chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>And with Shu Popo, the strict teacher, around, Xixia would be more obedient in her martial arts practice, after all, she was a teacher from the Divine Cultivation Academy, her stern presence could still intimidate Xixia, which was just right for her to cultivate diligently in this period before the sect assessment.</p><p></p><p>Not like Old Chen, who was always calling Xixia "little stinker," provoking Xixia's rebellious psychology to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>She no longer listened to Old Chen's words, the old and young constantly bickered and quarreled, shouting "little stinker" and "old stinker" back and forth.</p><p></p><p>In the days to come, everything returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che resumed his regular life.</p><p></p><p>During the day, he went to the Astronomical Observatory to stand watch, and after getting off work, he went to the workshop courtyard to practice martial arts, cultivate, and carve wood.</p><p></p><p>The Fishery Gang had been wiped out, the once mighty gang, with the escape of their leader Jing Wudao, had completely fallen into desolation.</p><p></p><p>The Fishery Gang's forces were then devoured and divided up by the various major powers in the prefecture city, although the Fishery Gang still existed in name, it had actually been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the deterrence brought about by the Fishery Gang's downfall, or perhaps it was the lingering aura of the divine sage battle, as well as the suppression of Li Qingshan's reputation upon his return.</p><p></p><p>The entire prefecture city had become much more stable.</p><p></p><p>Listening outside Flower Lane, there was no longer any force keeping an eye on it.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, looking at the empty Heaven and Earth Chess Board, Li Che even felt a bit unaccustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>However, he still habitually arranged the Heaven and Earth Chess Board to ensure the situation around, so that if there was any abnormality, it would provide feedback.</p><p></p><p>Stability was the first priority for Li Che to establish himself and make a living in this world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze swept through the willow trees, bringing a warm wind.</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed silently.</p><p></p><p>Inside the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chess Board was shrouded, isolating all external auras.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the center of the courtyard, and the scattered wood chips from the wood carvings had long been blown to the corners of the courtyard by the invisible wind waves.</p><p></p><p>His jet-black and vigorous hair was constantly flying, and the faint light was emanating from the Nirvana Palace in his brow.</p><p></p><p>The milky white "Untainted Heart" divine nature, like a great net, divided the various divine natures.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo--"</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless ghost wailing voices were echoing endlessly, with a dense mass of ghost shadows intertwined and listed, wailing incessantly, as if the gates of the underworld had opened, and the wronged souls had returned from hell!</p><p></p><p>Boom--! Accompanied by a majestic aura wave, a series of concentric ripples spread out.</p><p></p><p>Colliding with the barrier that isolated the Heaven and Earth Chess Board.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The space behind Li Che suddenly erupted with a ghostly and ominous aura, accompanied by the grinding sound of a millstone. Bursts of divine light emanated from the "Sorrowful Cry Subduing Ghosts" divine foundation, generating a powerful divine energy wave that made one's nose tingle.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes, Li Che exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, his gaze calm and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Sorrowful Cry Subduing Ghosts' divine foundation has been established as well!"</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Li Che's lips.</p><p></p><p>The pure and unsullied divine nature surged forth, merging into the "Sorrowful Cry Subduing Ghosts" divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Aperture in his brow opened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two more powerful divine foundations arose.</p><p></p><p>They were the "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" divine foundation and the "Heart Startled and Firm" divine foundation!</p><p></p><p>"They're all established... done."</p><p></p><p>"After forging the 'Unsullied Heart' divine nature into a divine foundation, forging the other divine nature divine foundations is not too difficult. The divine power of the 'Unsullied Heart' divine foundation can generally balance out the conflicts and repulsive forces of the other divine foundations."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, his brow shining.</p><p></p><p>He had now forged four of the seven emotional divine foundations within his Nirvana Aperture.</p><p></p><p>Anger, sorrow, thought, and shock!</p><p></p><p>Along with the "Unsullied Heart" divine foundation, which was like a panacea.</p><p></p><p>Li Che now had five divine foundations swirling within his Nirvana Aperture!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling—</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine energies were crashing against the walls of his inner realm like waves, constantly expanding the space. The divine foundations floating within were all releasing divine impacts, carving out more space to accommodate them.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che's Nirvana Aperture inner realm was nearly ten times the size of a typical cultivator's who had opened a single divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>This greatly enhanced Li Che's divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Li Che could feel a unique change - his divine pressure... was extremely powerful and terrifying! Narrowing his eyes, his gaze seemed to flash with five-colored light. Clenching and unclenching his fingers, he suddenly exerted a powerful downward force.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling—</p><p></p><p>A torrential divine pressure was released, causing the air in the entire courtyard to be instantly evacuated, forming a massive void!</p><p></p><p>"Whew..."</p><p></p><p>"Now, not counting the 'Unsullied Heart' divine foundation, the divine pressure from just these four emotional divine foundations alone should be able to paralyze divine foundation realm cultivators, and even make divine foundation late-stage cultivators break out in a cold sweat."</p><p></p><p>"It should be able to contend with the divine pressure of Void Immortal cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, as if light was waxing and waning.</p><p></p><p>"Just four divine foundations, and if I were to forge the complete seven emotional divine foundations, perhaps... I could contend with true Divine Manifestation cultivators within the divine foundation realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head back, and the divine light in his Nirvana Aperture suddenly receded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the four divine foundations retreated back into his Nirvana Aperture, and the "Unsullied Heart" Dao fruit pulsed, the divine energy dissipating without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Joy, worry, and fear - the three remaining divine natures are yet to be forged into divine foundations."</p><p></p><p>"Now I can start on them."</p><p></p><p>As for the divine foundations for worry and fear, Li Che lacked the divine foundation techniques, but it was not a big problem. With his current status, obtaining them from Li Qingshan would be easy.</p><p></p><p>The higher-tier ones might be a bit difficult, though.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also had to consider slowly refining the divine foundations. But after understanding the process of refining divine foundations, he realized it was much easier than forging them, the main issue being obtaining the divine foundation techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the ten days, Li Che cultivated diligently without rest, and his harvests were not limited to just forging three divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>In the martial dao, his breakthroughs were truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>He took out a rotten-aura pill, swallowing it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>The pill fell into his abdomen, emitting a muffled sound. Under the control of his divine sense, his stomach lining began to undulate, crushing the pill shell, and the powerful medicinal properties surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his entire body brimming with surging qi and blood, as if a dragon and an elephant were roaring in unison.</p><p></p><p>His self-created supreme skill, the "True Essence of the Dragon and Elephant", had now reached small mastery. His qi and blood were surging and rumbling, accompanied by the power of the dragon and elephant. Even without activating the Ascending Stairs state, Li Che could still unleash the formidable might of the dragon and elephant, akin to the divine power of a celestial being! With a step, numerous qi and blood threads wove together behind him, forming what seemed like the outstretched wings of a soaring hawk, and he shot up into the void.</p><p></p><p>Flashing through the air, Li Che left countless afterimages, darting wildly around the courtyard. Finally, he lightly landed, the tip of his foot touching the blue bricks and kicking up a swirling cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"The Hawk Treading on Clouds, I've reached the Transformed Realm!"</p><p></p><p>This divine martial art had finally been mastered by Li Che, giving rise to the Transformed Realm state, fusing it into his divine meridians and blood, causing another transformation in his divine meridians and blood!</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che had mastered three martial arts at the Transformed Realm: the White Tiger Raging Winds Fist, the Eight-Link Bone-Shattering Spear, and the Hawk Treading on Clouds. His divine meridians and blood had undergone three transformations!</p><p></p><p>He was now qualified to assault the Patriarch Realm! But Li Che was an ambitious person. After all, with the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor" talent-enhancing Dao fruit, he would not be satisfied with the lowest level of divine meridian breakthrough to reach the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>He must complete the nine transformations of his divine meridians and then assault the Patriarch Realm! Aside from the supreme skill "Thousand-Hand Divine Condor", which was still at the great mastery level, the remaining six martial arts - the Amitabha Golden Robe, the Hundred Ghosts Wind Lightning Arrow, the Python Dragon Cannon, the Corpse God Death Smoke Finger, the Wrathful Three-Blade Sword, and the Thousand-Hand Divine Condor - had all reached the grand master level.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Corpse God Death Smoke Finger, with the support of a large number of top-grade ninth-tier "Corpse God Myriad Ghosts Death Qi Condensing Martial Pill", combined with Li Che's own extraordinary martial talent, it had reached the grand master level in just ten days! Although the death qi medicinal pills were exhausted, and it would be somewhat difficult to reach the Transformed Realm in the short term, for Li Che, this progress was already very gratifying.</p><p></p><p>After the martial pill was crushed, the surging death qi assaulted Li Che's skin and flesh. Li Che activated the "True Essence of the Dragon and Elephant", suppressing the erosion of the death qi, using it to temper his physique. The effect was astonishingly good!</p><p></p><p>Even better than the usual Serpent Blood martial pills! "The Corpse God Sect truly excels at the research of the flesh, this death qi pill... is excellent for those who can suppress the death qi through martial cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the death qi condensing martial pills I obtained from the Corpse God Envoy and Liu Jinsheng have all been used up... I'll have to find a way to restock."</p><p></p><p>Li Che reined in his qi and blood, and the lingering afterimages of the Hawk Treading on Clouds gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Li Qingshan... said I would become rich and honored, but when is he going to start taking action?"</p><p></p><p>"If he doesn't act soon..."</p><p></p><p>"I might just have to go solo."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The 21st day of the second month, the Spring Equinox.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ancestor opened the mountain.</p><p></p><p>A light drizzle, with mysterious birds arriving, day and night becoming equal.</p><p></p><p>The spring wheat has sprouted, and the fertile waters must be closely followed.</p><p></p><p>A spring rain and a warm season, but accompanied by a late spring chill, the drizzle carried a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>Today was a major event for the entire Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The spacious stone main road of the prefecture city, wide enough for ten carriages to travel side by side, was actually experiencing a traffic jam.</p><p></p><p>Vehicles and people crowded the streets, umbrellas in floral patterns blooming like spring flowers along the long road.</p><p></p><p>The wide official road of the Golden Light Prefecture City stretched all the way to the Qianyuan Divine Ancestor's branch mountain gate, a distance of over ten miles, now mired in congestion.</p><p></p><p>The clamorous voices almost threatened to rend the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In each swaying carriage, there were parents harboring hopes and trepidation for their children to succeed, as well as excited and nervous children.</p><p></p><p>Whether they could pass the Divine Ancestor's branch mountain entrance examination and enter the Divine Ancestor's cultivation, the impact on their future was too great.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the chosen spirit children, there were also some unwilling parents who brought their children to participate in the selection examination, as well as some children who were deemed to lack spirit child talent but had martial dao talent, coming to try their luck.</p><p></p><p>People of all kinds, intertwined and crowded on the official road.</p><p></p><p>In the Listening to Flowers Alley, in a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hurriedly changed Xixia into the new clothes she had just bought and carefully braided her hair.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Old Chen paced back and forth, holding a smoking pipe, his hands clenched into fists behind his back, extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>The family of the elder brother had also arrived. Cousin-in-law Liu Chunming held Li Chengzhou's hand, her expression also filled with anxiety. The corpse curse mark on Cousin Li Zhengran's body had long been shattered by Li Che using the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal. </p><p></p><p>Now, the entire person had regained his vigor, and with Li Che's help, he had found a decent job, his spirit and vitality restored.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Shu was also pacing, her nervousness no less than Zhang Ya's.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, on the other hand, was sitting in a chair, smiling amusedly.</p><p></p><p>"Chengzhou can be nervous, but my Xixia is not nervous at all."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite interested.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xixia was an exceptional spirit child, basically a shoo-in for entry into the Divine Ancestor's inner sect, it was just a matter of whether she would enter the inner sect or the true lineage.</p><p></p><p>So today's examination was essentially just a formality, although Li Qingshan had mentioned there would be competitive tests and the like.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was very confident in Xixia's education.</p><p></p><p>If it came to actual combat, she would absolutely be the brightest star in this round of sect examinations.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't play by the rules, pulling out a mini-Namu Gatling gun would be like punching the elderly home in the south and kicking the kindergarten in the north.</p><p></p><p>She would undoubtedly be the most dazzling star in this round of sect examinations.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che had heard from Li Qingshan that this sect examination would not be easy for Xixia either.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xixia's age was the youngest among the participants in this examination.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses secretly cultivated by the Five Great Families and Five Great Sects, the oldest of them were already eight years old, perhaps even having undergone blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che couldn't guarantee that Xixia would win decisively, as her age was indeed a bit young.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan had said that with Xixia's three-year-old bone-refining mastery, this level of talent... would at least secure her entry into the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the true lineage, the chance of success was over 70%!</p><p></p><p>The true lineage... </p><p></p><p>Entering Li Qingshan's sect did not count as the true lineage, as each true lineage disciple was the core disciple of a Divine Manifestation cultivator, receiving concentrated resources and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Xixia, who had emerged from the house with her head held high, her steps bold and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>His beloved Xixia the Great Emperor was finally about to begin her conquest.</p><p></p><p>As he helped Xixia onto the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che secretly instructed Xixia that unless absolutely necessary, she should not use the mini-Namu Gatling gun, as that would be bullying the little kids. But it was fine to use it on the bigger kids.</p><p></p><p>He also suggested coordinating with the Wooden Messenger Crow for some explosions.</p><p></p><p>Between Xixia getting injured in the competition and Xixia making other people's children get injured, as a parent, Li Che unhesitatingly chose the latter.</p><p></p><p>Ruffling Xixia's head, Li Che's gaze was gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Safety first, the examination second, whether you compete or not doesn't matter..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't get hurt, just be safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>PS: Please vote for monthly tickets, recommend tickets, and support the reading!

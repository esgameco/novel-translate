            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The brilliant hum tore through the tranquility of the temple! Scorching flames burst forth from the golden wheel, accompanied by high-speed rotation, twisting and distorting the air, with searing waves of light rippling across the golden wheel! The Heavenly King Tower trembled incessantly, and the myriad rays of light that cascaded down were like freed chains, shattering one by one! Even the sound of glass crashing to the ground could be heard!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying divinity erupted from the golden light wheel!</p><p></p><p>As if sweeping away mountains and seas, the intense heat caused the entire temple's temperature to rise! The golden wheel howled as it shot forth, the flames trailing behind it like a comet's tail!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the entire temple, inside and out, fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu, Nan Liehuo, and Wang Kuyu narrowed their eyes, watching as the four divine weapons - the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel - shot out from the temple...</p><p></p><p>The oppressive pressure rolled out like a tidal wave!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, surprised but unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Because he did not sense any malice from the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>the divine weapon was only attracted to the purple flame spear in Xixie's arm.</p><p></p><p>The attraction between weapons of the same origin! That's why Li Che did not act.</p><p></p><p>But the others did not know, and Nan Liehuo's expression changed slightly!</p><p></p><p>His five fingers trembled, and his eyes and body were suddenly engulfed in flames.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Prison Fiery Jade Body! Five streaks of fiery light shot towards the Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel with thunderous speed! Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle—</p><p></p><p>But accompanied by the rotation of the Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, the divine flames he shot were instantly shattered, sparkling like stars!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The speed of the Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel was too fast! Countless shockwaves were pushed aside, and many children's faces showed expressions of terror.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, however, was not the least bit afraid, her big eyes blinking. Although she said the wheel was trying to lure her, in reality, she was beckoning it with her fingers.</p><p></p><p>The butterflies on Xixie's shoulders spread their wings, like a nervous little cat.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the venerable elder of the Righteous Sect, Jiao Shaoqiu, narrowed his cloudy eyes.</p><p></p><p>He did not act to obstruct the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, like Nan Liehuo, but watched Xixie with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>As if... he was looking at a treasure! Actually...</p><p></p><p>able to attract the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel? Jiao Shaoqiu had rarely seen the golden wheel display such unusual behavior! Whew—</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, with its towering momentum, its flames rolling, but as it approached Xixie's small figure, it suddenly came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Rotating quietly, it hovered in front of Xixie.</p><p></p><p>The flames burned, scorching hot, but Xixie did not feel the slightest heat.</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel spun, the gentle breeze ruffling the small strands of hair on Xixie's forehead.</p><p></p><p>The others...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che, at close range, could feel the scorching heat of the golden wheel, the terrifying power it contained, as if it were ready to repel everyone and dote on Xixie alone.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but be speechless.</p><p></p><p>This wheel... it's playing favorites.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum—</p><p></p><p>In the temple, the Golden Heavenly King Tower seemed somewhat indignant, its divine energies intertwined, the myriad golden rays coalescing into golden chains that clanged as they locked the Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel back into the temple, like pulling back an excited dog.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling gradually subsided, and the golden wheel's momentum calmed down and settled.</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple, it was now completely quiet.</p><p></p><p>Xixie pouted, looking dissatisfied at the Golden Heavenly King Tower, as if her toy had been snatched away.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's gaze was strange, with a hint of purple, looking at Xixie as if she were a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo dispersed his Fiery Jade Prison Body and let out a breath, his heart finally settling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he vaguely understood something.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie... the resonance level might be a bit high?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>This Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel had burst forth from the Mysterious Temple of the Furious Three Princes of the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to have a deep connection with the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>To be able to attract the golden wheel...</p><p></p><p>Xixie's resonance with the temple's deities might exceed expectations.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu, however, shook his head: "It's hard to say... the matter of temple deity resonance is unpredictable, it depends on the deities, not the divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>"But this little girl... at least in the realm of temple deities and divine weapons, she has an unparalleled advantage."</p><p></p><p>"Good girl, good girl..."</p><p></p><p>On Jiao Shaoqiu's withered, wooden-like face, a radiant smile emerged.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo could feel Jiao Shaoqiu's admiration.</p><p></p><p>His heart stirred, and he couldn't help but say, "Elder Jiao, I wonder if this girl has a chance to become the last disciple personally taught by the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu, hearing this, immediately understood Nan Liehuo's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>"The news of the Sect Master only accepting the last disciple has already spread far and wide. As the supreme expert of the Lingnan Dao, the Sect Master's acceptance of a disciple has indeed attracted the attention of many forces."</p><p></p><p>"This little girl... has a good chance."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of innate Grand Sect Master physique, she is one of the few in the entire Lingnan Dao."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo, hearing this, let out a long sigh of relief, his heart filled with joy, as if a weight had been lifted from his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>To be called a Sect Master means they are at the Divine Embryo Realm!</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo, sensing Li Che's fluctuating emotions, looked over and smiled, "The Righteous Sect has one more spot for a personal disciple of the Sect Master. After accepting this disciple, the Sect Master will no longer open the door for disciples."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has set up a trial for disciples in the Dao City. If Xixie goes to the Dao City, she can try her luck. Who knows, she might succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie's talents are extraordinary, whether in divine nature or martial arts aptitude, they are exceptional..."</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a disciple of the Sect Master would allow her better development."</p><p></p><p>"And... better protection."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>As Xixie's father, Li Che naturally hopes for his daughter to have a better future.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's eyes flashed, and he said, "Xixie beat up the son of Ji Moli..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we don't consider Ji Moli, with that mother of Ji Haiwei, the Dragon Goddess Clan's daughter with an explosive temper... she will surely come to trouble Xixie afterward."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Goddess Clan is impulsive and domineering, not one to reason with. Xixie has beaten the Dragon Goddess's son, and that Dragon Goddess... will undoubtedly be furious."</p><p></p><p>"If that Dragon Goddess comes, she would still pose a considerable threat to Xixie."</p><p></p><p>"So, if Xixie can become a disciple of the Sect Master, her safety will be better guaranteed."</p><p></p><p>"Even if Ji Moli himself comes, he would have to show some respect to the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che fell silent at this.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Jiao Shaoqiu's hand stroking his beard paused.</p><p></p><p>"This girl has also beaten Ji Moli's son Ji Haiwei?" Jiao Shaoqiu looked at little Xixie in amazement, speechless.</p><p></p><p>It seems this girl is also a troublemaker.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, on the other hand, was very excited, clenching her chubby little fists, "That little servant made a bet with me, and he lost, but he didn't own up to it! He became a cowardly turtle!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, just like what the fat boy Zhou Peng said, if you don't own up to a bet, you don't get the prize!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che beside her frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The fat boy taught you that?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the fat boy Zhou Peng, who was busy stuffing his face with steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>What kind of nonsense is he teaching Xixie?</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Che's gaze, Zhou Peng suddenly looked up, a chill running down his spine, and the bun in his hand no longer tasted as good.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Yun'e, seeing Li Che's gaze, pursed her lips and took a step away from Zhou Peng.</p><p></p><p>"After all, Ji Haiwei is just a five-year-old child. Unwilling to admit defeat in a bet is normal, just a child's temper tantrum. What can it matter?" Jiao Shaoqiu chuckled as he stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the young prince Ji Haiwei, accompanied by a powerful cultivator, had been beaten up by Xixie and fled in disgrace, Jiao Shaoqiu's mood brightened considerably.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Golden Light Division is under the Righteous Sect, representing the Righteous Sect's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, this little girl, has helped the Righteous Sect regain face. As an elder, how could Jiao Shaoqiu not be delighted?</p><p></p><p>"Good girl, don't worry, your elder will protect you."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's gaze softened as he ruffled Xixie's hair.</p><p></p><p>"After the Temple Deity Resonance Assembly is over, I'll take you to the Dao City, to the Righteous Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Then, no one will dare to bully Xixie."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu said kindly.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, however, hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie's little friends are all here, can they come too? And Xixie's father, mother, and old Chen..."</p><p></p><p>Xixie raised her hand, beginning to count them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>He ruffled Xixie's hair.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu then began to call the other exceptional spirit children, evaluating their talents and giving them guidance for their future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Three days from now will be the Temple Deity Resonance Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Che walked down from Golden Light Peak, his eyes flickered, his heart stirring with a mix of worry, unease, and a touch of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Golden Light City.</p><p></p><p>Raindrops the size of beans poured down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A black dot slowly expanded, dense black mist rolling out from it, gradually coalescing into a massive vortex of death qi, swirling.</p><p></p><p>Two figures emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>A tall one in a black robe, with thick, black, flowing hair that fell to the waist, a white mask covering the face with the character "Seven" written in blood.</p><p></p><p>This was Yuan Jingang, the hidden Corpse Deity Envoy of the Corpse Deity Sect within the Golden Light City, undetected by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jingang was leading a small child.</p><p></p><p>The child's skin was so pale it glowed, with vacant eyes and thick dark circles, shoulders drooping, wearing a red belly wrap and loose pants.</p><p></p><p>Thick hair tied in two buns.</p><p></p><p>"The one sent by the Righteous Sect is that old immortal, the outer door grand elder Jiao Shaoqiu, the old thing who has fallen from the Golden Body Realm to the Primordial Spirit Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jingang spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"That old thing is no simple matter, with his half-dead, half-alive appearance... Once he fights with all his might, he will be truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Our main purpose this time is the Three Princes Temple Deity... If we succeed, good, if not, we'll still give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jingang turned to look at the child he was leading.</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>The child with the dark circles nodded, "Got it."</p><p></p><p>"Capturing a wisp of the Three Princes Temple Deity's divine essence? This task... is a piece of cake for me, no difficulty at all."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the child speak with such confidence, Yuan Jingang's masked face seemed to break into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple Deity Resonance Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>"The Garrison Command, the Imperial Observatory, even the Pacification King Ji Moli have sent children... There's no reason the Corpse Deity Sect can't send a child too."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jingang chuckled lowly.</p><p></p><p>But the laughter soon turned grim.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Sect's schemes in the Golden Light City had been completely uprooted.</p><p></p><p>All those chess pieces, wiped out completely.</p><p></p><p>As if a skilled chess player had made a move, presenting a lethal strike, devouring them clean.</p><p></p><p>How painful.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jingang's eyes twisted, the Corpse Deity Sect's years of planning had shattered in a single day.</p><p></p><p>How could he be at peace with this?</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, Horse Face! And the Monkey King!"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect has no grudge against you..."</p><p></p><p>"This enmity, I, Yuan Jingang, will never forget!"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect... has countless followers, how many can you, the Underworld, kill?"</p><p></p><p>Beneath the mask, the aura of deadly intent surged.</p><p></p><p>And behind him, one black vortex after another erupted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rain started falling again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, walked down the long street, glancing at the sky, knowing it was due to the temple deities' restlessness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at this time, snow should still be drifting in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Golden Light Peak, Li Che went directly to the city.</p><p></p><p>He first went to work at the Imperial Observatory.</p><p></p><p>At the Imperial Observatory, he saw Tao Ren wearing a red belly wrap and buns, his face full of reluctance, looking at Luo Yao.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao was trying to wrap Tao Ren in red brocade.</p><p></p><p>Tao Ren felt the red brocade was something for girls to play with, and he refused to wrap it around himself no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know shit! This is what I've learned from researching many materials, the key image of the Furious Three Princes of the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus!"</p><p></p><p>"Holding a spear, stepping on a golden wheel, wearing a red belly wrap, wrapped in red brocade... this is the Three Princes!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to enhance the resonance with the temple deities during the Resonance Assembly, you have to dress like this!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yao wrapped the red brocade around Tao Ren without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This red brocade was a divine weapon that Luo Yao had specially commissioned a weapon forger to make, and while the quality was average, if divine energy was channeled into it, it could flutter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, seeing this, couldn't help but be moved.</p><p></p><p>This item, it seems he should also prepare one for Xixie, the fire spear alone doesn't seem enough.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Luo, do you happen to have another one of these red brocades? I'd like to get one for my daughter, to increase her resonance."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled kindly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao.</p><p></p><p>When Tao Ren saw Li Che, he felt like he had found a savior. He quickly tore off the red silk sash from his body and reverently handed it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li Che, you don't need to find my master. This red silk sash, you can just take it and give it to Sister Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>Tao Ren was very excited. Lu Yao's face turned black with anger.</p><p></p><p>His heart felt a little tired. </p><p></p><p>He had brought Tao Ren here just on a whim, not really expecting Tao Ren to create any miracles.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you please. I've done what I should for you. Whether you can gain any fortune in this Temple God Resonance Assembly, it all depends on you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't stand on ceremony either, and directly accepted the red silk sash Tao Ren handed over.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao actually felt that Li Che's daughter had a better chance of standing out in the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and bid farewell to the two.</p><p></p><p>He then entered the workshop and continued making the pink divine fire cannon for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>After work, he returned to the alley in Falling Flower Lane to continue being busy.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che would take the deeply sleeping Xixia to the Mysterious Ape Bizarre Temple, and give Xixia special training.</p><p></p><p>Beating up the purple flame python spear.</p><p></p><p>Urging the purple flame snake spear to unleash its power, accelerating its fusion with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was even a little expectant.</p><p></p><p>Whether Xixia's martial dao physique could, under the fusion of the purple flame snake spear, transform into a supreme innate martial dao physique.</p><p></p><p>An innate grand master martial physique! But the difficulty was absolutely not small.</p><p></p><p>For three consecutive days.</p><p></p><p>When Xixia woke up in the morning, she always felt her arms aching and swollen, and could vaguely hear the mournful whimpers of the small spear in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Xixia would gently pat her chubby arms every day, comforting the small spear: "Xixia will grow up quickly, and then she can play with the small spear."</p><p></p><p>Xixia said this very seriously, and the purple flame snake spear felt comforted, and even became a little gentler towards Xixia.</p><p></p><p>It simply loved this little soldier master.</p><p></p><p>Stick and honey...</p><p></p><p>It was invincible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Ape Bizarre Temple! Rumbling! The scorching blood surged, the hot flow stirred up a violent wind, tearing the airflow without stop!</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood with his hands behind his back, taking a step forward, and in an instant, his figure seemed to blur.</p><p></p><p>The void seemed to be distorted under his single step, and the air was almost trampled into a deep hollow!</p><p></p><p>With a "bang", the explosion echoed.</p><p></p><p>The air-tearing airflow formed ripple-like concentric circles spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che kept stepping in the air!</p><p></p><p>Countless illusory figures gradually converged, finally landing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's chest suddenly swelled, and then with each inhale and exhale, it brought a mighty airflow that swept the temple, making the candle flames flicker.</p><p></p><p>The martial saint supreme skill, Soaring Eight Qi Steps... he had mastered it!</p><p></p><p>Li Che twisted his spine, his great tendons trembling like thunder! "This martial saint supreme skill is not bad, it's not just a simple movement skill, but there is also the power of killing hidden in the movement."</p><p></p><p>"Eight Qi Steps, one step one kill, the Eight Steps Shaking the Heavenly Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Che's toes touched down, the air seemed to explode, with a mournful sound, the air waves rolled! With a light leap, Li Che felt his whole body become agile.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was moving speed or flashing and dodging, it was much more flexible than before.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Cloud Pheasant Stepping on Clouds, it was truly much more powerful.</p><p></p><p>After stretching a bit, Li Che flashed and appeared in front of the Ape Deity.</p><p></p><p>Daily touching.</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Ape Deity had already become one of utter hopelessness.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che grasped the Flying Thunder Chess Piece and returned to the small courtyard on the middle slope of the Correct Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter!</p><p></p><p>The sky was still pouring heavy rain.</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds were piled up, as if there were flickering lightning rolling within.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day of the official announcement, the opening of the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>After returning, Li Che went to the kitchen to make breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Then he went to call Xixia and his wife to get up.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was disturbed from her sleep and was very angry, pouting her mouth, hugging her arms, sitting on the bed, and very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, on the other hand, smiled gently and tied Xixia's braids, and also changed her into a red belly warmer.</p><p></p><p>"Time to eat breakfast."</p><p></p><p>Li Che called out.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's anger dissipated, and she ran to the dining table, starting to eat breakfast, the unhappiness on her face disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, only delicious food can cure a bad mood.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, do you think we need to dress up more?" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't have the appetite for breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Today was a big event for the entire Jin Guang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Now she was no longer an ordinary person who knew nothing about cultivation. Regarding the Temple Guardianship Bureau and the Heavenly Monitoring Office, she also knew their significance, and also understood the purpose of the little prince who had been beaten by her daughter.</p><p></p><p>It was all for today!</p><p></p><p>The Temple God Resonance Assembly of the Four Mysterious Temples!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was actually quite worried, after all, this was to send the child to the terrifying and dangerous Four Mysterious Temples! Those bizarre temples, it was said that even a Grand Master would be in danger if not careful.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be even more dangerous for a child? As a mother, Zhang Ya's worry was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the happy Xixia eating the fried egg and plain noodles, and couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>"There's still a bit missing."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, Li Che couldn't help but think of some details from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Then he clenched his five fingers, and spiritual wood appeared in his hand, as thin as cicada wings, which he quickly carved with a carving knife.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, there was a small waist belt made of connected lotus petals.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tied the lotus petal waist belt around Xixia's waist.</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked at the blooming little flowers on her waist with delight, very happy and very fond of them.</p><p></p><p>She even turned around in a circle on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, Xixia has flowers!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the little flower Daddy carved for Xixia, so happy!"</p><p></p><p>The cuteness of the little girl came so suddenly and simply.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened an oiled paper umbrella, hugged Xixia, and headed for Jin Guang Peak.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, Li Qingshan, accompanied by Lu Chi and Sumu Bao, were waiting outside early.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't stay at home either, linking arms with Sumu Bao, planning to also go and watch this Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved her own daughter, so she was still very concerned and worried.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen also didn't go to work today, taking a day off, and followed everyone to watch the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group went down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain gate archway, a carriage was already waiting.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong drove a luxurious carriage, and when he saw Li Che's family coming down the mountain, he waved his arms from afar.</p><p></p><p>Xixia saw Shangguan Qinghong and was also very happy, the big and small ones jumped and stomped on the carriage shaft, and then climbed into the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong treated Xixia like his own little sister, and was also very nervous about Xixia's participation in the Temple God Resonance Assembly. He racked his brain for all the knowledge he had, reminding Xixia of some precautions regarding the Temple Gods.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to do his best as an elder sister.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, accompanied by Sumu Bao and Lu Chi, got into another carriage.</p><p></p><p>Before getting into the carriage, Lu Chi's deep gaze lingered on the carriage Xixia was in.</p><p></p><p>"Get in." Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi solemnly nodded and climbed into the carriage.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Jin Guang Branch Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>Various carriages had gathered, the Qin family, the Hai family, the Gong family, the Gongyuan family and other aristocratic families had all arranged carriages, waiting for the spiritual children they had arranged to cultivate in the Jin Guang Branch Sect.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Jin Guang Branch Sect had also prepared special carriages, arranging the spiritual children to gather together and go together.</p><p></p><p>The children gathered in groups, a bunch of little radish heads, whispering and chattering endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The rain falling from the sky could not disperse this enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>The laughter of the children did not seem to be going to participate in any Temple God Resonance Assembly, but more like going on a spring outing.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun also saw Li Che's family, but just nodded from afar as a greeting.</p><p></p><p>He was in a carriage by himself, holding the Jail Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a straw hat and a short jacket, the burly carriage driver, holding the reins, had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at this carriage driver, able to feel that this driver was extraordinary, containing terrifying blood qi that was held back.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Che did not feel any divine power from this driver, which meant... this was a pure martial dao blood warrior!</p><p></p><p>As for the specific cultivation, Li Che could not see through it.</p><p></p><p>After all the children were arranged in the carriages.</p><p></p><p>They set off.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of carriages, forming a grand procession, set out from the foot of Shengsong Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The wheels rolled, kicking up mud, shattering the accumulated water, and entered the Jin Guang Prefecture city, and then drove out of the Jin Guang Prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Guards were deployed, separating the common people, allowing the caravan to travel steadily.</p><p></p><p>In the Temple Guardianship Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang also brought Iron Shanfcai and climbed into a carriage, driving to follow the caravan.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Monitoring Office.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao brought Tao Ren and drove to follow.</p><p></p><p>One carriage after another occasionally gathered from the side streets, converging into the caravan like rivers flowing into the sea.</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The little prince Jie Hai, dressed in elegant clothes, his purple dragon god-like pupils flashing slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had left the City Lord's Mansion in these past few days.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufei's death had really scared him.</p><p></p><p>Jie Hai didn't want to die, so he holed up in the City Lord's Mansion, ensuring his own safety, waiting for the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the rain was torrential, the heavens and earth were damp.</p><p></p><p>But Jie Hai felt that the blood in his whole body was slightly trembling, as if it was about to revive.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple God Resonance Assembly is finally about to begin... After the assembly is over, I can finally leave this cursed place of Jin Guang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Jie Hai said.</p><p></p><p>He didn't like Jin Guang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He had suffered the greatest humiliation of his life here.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have the courage to face this humiliation, choosing to be a coward.</p><p></p><p>So, he wanted to wash away this shame, and could only find stronger help after leaving Jin Guang Prefecture, and then come back to reclaim it! The purple-eyed little prince Jie Hai's eyes flashed, thinking of Xixia's devil-like face, his whole body shuddered, and then he climbed into the extremely luxurious carriage.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was already sitting in the carriage waiting, seeing Jie Hai, he smiled gently: "Little Prince, relax, the King has already prepared a trump card for you... This Temple God Resonance, you won't lose to that girl."</p><p></p><p>The carriage was driven by a Grandmaster coachman.</p><p></p><p>Six black-armored blood guards riding sea-dragon horses, carrying heavy black armor and saber, with a majestic aura, followed closely.</p><p></p><p>The sound of hooves exploding, escorting the carriage, arrogantly like a sharp black knife, cutting into the caravan.</p><p></p><p>The Chief Inspector of the Temple Guardianship Bureau, Xie Jing, wearing a humble uniform, riding a sea-dragon horse, with his Inspectors and Chief Constables also riding sea-dragon horses, leading the way in front of the caravan.</p><p></p><p>The caravan left the Jin Guang Prefecture city, the wind and rain were fierce!</p><p></p><p>But the speed of the caravan not only did not slow down, but became faster and faster! The blood in the sea-dragon horses seemed to be boiling, the hooves falling faster and faster!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p></p><p>The rain was shattered and exploded into water mist!</p><p></p><p>The carriage cabin rocked violently.</p><p></p><p>As the carriage left the city.</p><p></p><p>The many children in the carriage cabin fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they finally felt the oppressive and tense atmosphere, and many of the spiritual children's small bodies were trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage cabin.</p><p></p><p>Xixia also rarely became silent.</p><p></p><p>Her head was tucked into Zhang Ya's embrace, letting Zhang Ya gently stroke her.</p><p></p><p>Her small hands clenched into fists.</p><p></p><p>The fearless Xixia Emperor, now... also felt a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, Daddy... Xixia is nervous!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her big eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Xixia's head and took out a white flying thunder chess piece, putting it in Xixia's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hold this chess piece, and it's like Daddy is by your side."</p><p></p><p>"With Daddy here, you don't need to be nervous."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to put too much pressure on yourself, just treat it as... a spring outing, even if you don't trigger the Temple God Resonance, and don't get the Temple God inheritance, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"With Daddy here, no one will hurt you."</p><p></p><p>"Because Daddy is super powerful..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's voice was gentle.</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her eyes: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che extended his little finger, and Xixia hooked it with hers.</p><p></p><p>Xixia giggled, and really wasn't nervous anymore.</p><p></p><p>She raised her chubby arms and said, "Daddy, but... the little spear has been shaking, seems very nervous, making Xixia a little nervous too."</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this, and gently grasped Xixia's arm.</p><p></p><p>Then, the spiritual light flashed in the middle of his brow. The spiritual consciousness opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The power of the spiritual consciousness, formed into a palm in Xixia's arm, slapped the snarling purple flame snake hard.</p><p></p><p>A sound like swatting a mosquito exploded in the carriage cabin.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Shangguan Qinghong were both startled.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che just rubbed Xixia's head.</p><p></p><p>"See, the little spear isn't nervous anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia shook her arm, and suddenly burst into a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>She leaned on the carriage window.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the raging wind and rain, looking at the roaring waves over a hundred meters high of the Nine Dragon River, she was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>Face the Temple Gods?! Xixia was no longer afraid of anything!</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>Daddy will protect Xixia!</p>

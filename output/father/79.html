        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But he... could he ascend to divinity through this method?</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not know, nor did he have any concept... this matter was too far removed from his current self.</p><p></p><p>And his divine nature had only just begun to be grasped, not even having forged a single divine foundation, yet he was already thinking about these things... it was truly meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine nature ascension speed was very fast, mainly relying on external objects.</p><p></p><p>[Wrathful Weeping Subdues Ghosts] had the divine foundation fragment of the Patriarch of the Si Clan, and thus he had easily reached the Cultivating Nature as a River realm.</p><p></p><p>[Furious Amitabha] was refined from the eighteen divine nature chess pieces of Zhao Xuanhai, allowing him to reach the Cultivating Nature as a River.</p><p></p><p>As for the newly refined [Chaotic Delight Bewitches the Divine] , it was a bit slower, after all, the divine nature had just been condensed... to refine it to the Cultivating Nature as a River realm, it should still take some time.</p><p></p><p>But with his current speed of refining chess pieces, it shouldn't take long.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the [Heart Startled and Resolute] of the Yang Clan, the fourth divine nature... I should try that as well."</p><p></p><p>"[Wrathful Weeping Subdues Ghosts] and [Furious Amitabha] are both at the Cultivating Nature as a River realm, combined... I wonder if they can match a divine foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes widened slightly, and the various divine natures instantly intertwined and ran rampant within the room, shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>There were mournful weeping sounds, thunderous roars of fury, as well as elusive laughter that came and went...</p><p></p><p>Divine nature phenomena were manifesting.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, the gentle wind brushing his clothes, his black hair flying.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was clear and bright, [Untainted Heart] trembling, but it prevented him from being affected by the divine natures, avoiding side effects like distorted expressions, loss of emotional control, and mental confusion.</p><p></p><p>Like when Si Mubai cultivated [Wrathful Weeping Subdues Ghosts], he would occasionally burst into tears that wouldn't stop.</p><p>And when Zhou Ruoguan cultivated [Chaotic Delight Bewitches the Divine], he couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably.</p><p>Those were the side effects that came with cultivating divine natures.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paced slowly, arriving at the window.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy east was faintly glowing, but was soon obscured by the thick dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>"I feel... at the limit..."</p><p></p><p>"The physical body has reached its limit."</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brows as he tried to withdraw the stabilizing [Untainted Heart], allowing the three divine natures to spread out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The blood and qi of his Qi Realm physical body, uncontrolled, surged forth, slightly trembling, his bones and tendons resonating, truly having a sense of the divine natures spiraling out of control.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't had [Untainted Heart] suppressing it, he might have already exhibited all kinds of unrestrained behaviors.</p><p>For example, bursting into tears, interspersing his speech with uncontrollable laughter, occasionally flying into a rage...</p><p></p><p>Even without activating the Vajra Transformation, with the blessing of the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao Fruit, his physical foundation was extremely solid and unparalleled. Yet, it was still struggling to withstand the pressure of three divine natures at once...</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that bearing the pressure of three divine natures was far more than just adding them up one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was not as simple as one plus one plus one equals three.</p><p></p><p>However, if Li Che activated the Vajra Transformation or the Wrathful Vajra, he should be able to easily withstand the impact of the three divine natures.</p><p></p><p>In short, his physical body was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Senior Blue Mountain said that in order to forge a divine foundation, the physical body cannot be too weak... When the physical body cannot bear the divine nature, it will be controlled by the divine nature, losing one's self. How can one then speak of a divine foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che now deeply felt this.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Martial Dao was still very important, and he could not neglect it.</p><p></p><p>He had only just entered the Qi Realm, and still needed to achieve the Mysterious Realm, Divine Realm, and even break through to the Patriarch Realm!</p><p></p><p>Although he could actively trigger and obtain an unparalleled physical body through the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>But the foundation itself could not be neglected either.</p><p></p><p>The more divine natures he condensed, the stronger his physical body had to be. If the physical body couldn't keep up with the growth rate of the divine natures...</p><p></p><p>Once his emotions spiraled out of control...</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't he end up dead?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For an entire day, Li Che did not leave his home.</p><p></p><p>He did not go to the independent workshop, nor did he go anywhere else.</p><p>It was not that he was unwilling, but rather he was waiting.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not stupid, and he also did not think the world was full of fools.</p><p></p><p>The more times the Ox Demon appeared, the more times he struck, the greater the possibility of exposure.</p><p></p><p>And he had brought Xixie to attack the Yang Clan, and Zhang Xiangyang had seen it.</p><p>Even if they could not confirm that the Ox Demon was Li Che himself, just based on the Xixie thread alone, this day should not have been calm and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>There would inevitably be some turbulence.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che chose to stay at home, quietly waiting for a great tide.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during the waiting intervals, he did not neglect his cultivation, and in his leisure time, he studied the two divine nature martial arts he had obtained, [Python Dragon Cannon] and [Cloud Hawk Soaring the Clouds].</p><p></p><p>Divine nature martial arts, those were still martial arts... they needed to be mastered through Martial Dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the ninth-rank divine nature secret art "Joyful Flying Head Savagery", Li Che did not start cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>Divine nature secret arts and divine nature martial arts are still somewhat different.</p><p>Divine nature martial arts can be approached as martial arts, with the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao Fruit able to provide blessings.</p><p>But divine nature secret arts require the invocation of divine nature, manipulating it through a unique path...</p><p>They belong to the "Fa" category, requiring the aptitude for Fa arts.</p><p>The [Amitabha Golden Robe] was also a ninth-rank divine nature secret art, and Li Che had only just barely entered the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fei Lei City, the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A figure as white as a bolt of lightning swiftly returned from the outside, rushing like thunder, and landed on the ground, its breathing heavy.</p><p></p><p>Behind it, there was another figure barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan sensed this and immediately rushed over, seeing the two in such a state, he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Father..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan was somewhat alarmed. Didn't they go outside to intercept that mysterious powerful figure suspected to be from the Divine Sect? How did it end up like this?</p><p></p><p>Adding the two old patriarchs from the Yang family and the Xu family, that was four Spiritual Base cultivators, with his father, a Spiritual Base realm cultivator, guarding them. Yet someone was still injured?</p><p></p><p>"Second Granduncle..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan looked at the injured cultivator who had stepped into the Spiritual Base realm by cultivating the "Wrathful Amitabha", the mask on his face shattered, revealing an extremely aged countenance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old man's face was pale, with fresh blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, his injuries were severe.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing... Consuming divine essence, a period of recuperation will be enough."</p><p></p><p>The old man waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect cultivator is indeed beyond our humble rural cultivators... Even without their main divine essence present, with most of their divine essence suppressed, they can still overwhelm us four."</p><p></p><p>"This person is definitely not an ordinary Divine Sect cultivator, which branch of the Qianyuan Divine Sect does he belong to?"</p><p></p><p>"His blood qi martial dao... I'm afraid he has already reached the Sect Master realm, relying solely on his blood qi martial dao to suppress us..."</p><p></p><p>"Without displaying divine essence, not even using divine essence secret arts or divine essence martial techniques, he simply overpowered us with his blood qi martial dao alone..."</p><p></p><p>City Lord Cao Guang removed his mask, his expression gloomy and unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"I know about the Yang family's matter... The attempt to capture that spirit child failed, only the spirit child from the An family was brought, and the two divine abilities of the Xu family, especially that superior grade spirit child, the capture failed again."</p><p></p><p>"Was it that Ox Demon interfering again?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the grand chair, City Lord Cao Guang's divine essence fluctuated, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Cao Qingyuan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... once again intervened to save Li Xue's daughter Li Nuanxi, it's definitely not a coincidence, and... that Ox Demon seems to have a very good relationship with Li Nuanxi, I suspect..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan shared his speculation.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang took a sip of hot tea.</p><p></p><p>"Your speculation... that Li Xue is the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"But Li Xue is only at the Tempering Bone realm, and three years ago, he was just an uncultivated commoner, how could he be the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he has hidden his cultivation? Able to conceal his cultivation in front of us, many Spiritual Base cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan stiffened his neck a bit, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting... If he really is the Ox Demon, it would be quite unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"The old man from the Yang family has also returned, seeing the Yang family wiped out... He must be furious."</p><p></p><p>"The old fellow was meticulous in managing the family, but ended up with the tragic fate of all the family's experts perishing. Although there are still many family members outside the city, how can those family members support an entire clan?"</p><p></p><p>"This old fellow is likely to go mad."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it's perfect... Qingyuan, go and convey your speculation to the old man of the Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether that Li Xue is the Ox Demon or not..."</p><p></p><p>"For many people, a speculation is enough, no need for evidence."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, even if Li Xue is not the Ox Demon, he must have an extremely important relationship with the Ox Demon... That superior grade spirit child Li Nuanxi has also truly vexed me, hasn't she caused the deaths of many of my subordinates?"</p><p></p><p>"That ominous spirit child, destroy her without hesitation..."</p><p></p><p>Sitting calmly in the grand chair, Cao Guang impassively drank a sip of the emerald green tea.</p><p></p><p>As if with just a few words, he had decided the fate of that innocent young girl.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sky gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had gone from morning to dusk.</p><p></p><p>In the study, Li Xue had finished refining the divine essence chess piece and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was happily playing on the twist car, giggling nonstop.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was diligently practicing her martial arts, sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Everything was tranquil and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Just like...</p><p></p><p>the calm before the storm!</p><p></p><p>The tranquility lasted for an unknown duration, until the sky had completely darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Xue suddenly opened his eyes, the Dao Fruit [Chess Sage] in his chest cavity slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly earth chessboard enveloping the house, the lines intertwined and quivering...</p><p></p><p>On the chessboard, there was an extremely powerful divine essence presence manifesting, like a vast and mighty sun, extremely conspicuous and dazzling on the chessboard map.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were ubiquitous screams, like crying, laughing, and spinning, dense and endless, far and near...</p><p></p><p>That was...</p><p></p><p>the tyrannical divine essence of Spiritual Base cultivators! Unrestrained and unmasked! Like a towering tidal wave dozens of meters high, surging with overwhelming might, rolling towards them!</p><p></p><p>Li Xue suddenly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>"So they've come..."</p><p></p><p>"The old man of the Yang family!"</p>

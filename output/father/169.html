            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Penetration! Soaring Crimson!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire body was trembling uncontrollably, emitting various cracking sounds, as if the internal bones were violently grinding against each other, undergoing a complete transformation! However, his eyes were brighter than ever before, staring intently at the emerging prompt.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Vajra • Soaring Crimson!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing was rapid and heavy, with beads of sweat the size of beans sliding down his forehead, falling to the ground with a "plop" and shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the prompt changed again.</p><p></p><p>【Soaring Crimson (Spiritual Penetration): Ascending the Tower with Soaring Crimson, the flesh and blood ascend, the Earthly Calamity and Heavenly Fiend, snap the fingers to explode the stars】</p><p></p><p>【First Realm: Surging Crimson Qi and Blood】</p><p></p><p>【Shedding the Qi and Blood, Surging Crimson Self-Generated, Soaring to the Heavens to Witness the Divine, Capable of All】</p><p></p><p>【Second Realm: ???】</p><p></p><p>The prompt for the new spiritual penetration gradually unfolded in a brilliant manner, as if spreading from the depths of his mind like ink.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, just like the spiritual penetration obtained from the Immortal Craftsman, it was divided into the First Realm and the Second Realm, mainly because his strength was still too weak to activate the Second Realm, or in other words, the maturity of the Dao Fruit was not yet sufficient! "Surging Crimson Qi and Blood..."</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>A doubt arose in Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>But there was no time to ponder further.</p><p></p><p>The shedding of the Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao Fruit brought about a complete transformation in Li Che's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>It was as if scorching volcanic magma was pouring down, crashing against the fiery rock-like sinews and bones.</p><p></p><p>Like a raging fire, it melted the internal organs, igniting the five viscera and burning the six bowels, with the scorching heat and pain spreading throughout his entire body.</p><p></p><p>There was no place that did not hurt, no place that did not burn!</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt as if he had been placed in a giant furnace, being forged like a precious steel sword.</p><p></p><p>The flames were burning, wanting to turn him into charcoal! Refining his physique to the utmost, extracting the essence and limits of his flesh and blood!</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble—</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious temple, the waves of energy surged, and the white hazy heat instantly burst out from the pores, like the blast of steam from a pressure cooker.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's skin was glowing red, as if filled with red fluorescent material, radiating a scarlet color in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was tense, and as his flesh underwent transformation, the inner landscape of his Nirvana Palace was also shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of the flesh and the spirit are actually related to a certain extent, complementing each other.</p><p></p><p>Plucking the Stars Pupils! The Spiritual Penetration manifests! A bloodied eye slowly opened from the center of Li Che's brow, as if endless divine light was bursting forth from the pupil!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! The shockwaves, centered on Li Che's flesh, spread out in concentric circles!</p><p></p><p>Crashing heavily against the temple walls, causing the mysterious temple to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel scorching hot currents, mixed with the terrible power of bone-refining, rushing through his entire body at an unimaginable speed, following the meridians.</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast! The skin was emitting scorching heat, and Li Che felt his skin being burned, hardened, falling off, and shattering...</p><p></p><p>Li Che threw back his head and let out a long howl, standing up and clenching his fists, beginning to practice martial arts within the temple!</p><p></p><p>Roar—! Howl—! The dragon's roar and the elephant's cry echoed, shaking the air.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood exploded into a blood mist, gushing out from every pore, forming the shapes of a dragon and an elephant, coiling around Li Che's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pushed forward with his martial arts, practicing his self-created supreme skill, the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Within the Myriad Transformations of the Dragon and Elephant, he had integrated various supreme skills, such as the Thunderous Body, the Eight Serpents Overturning the River, the Nine Seals of Mechanisms, the Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Divine Arrow, the Upward and Downward Coiling Thousand-Hand Divine Crane...</p><p></p><p>And the supreme skill of the Martial Saint, the Primordial Equaling Heaven Staff!</p><p></p><p>Li Che continued to practice, constantly punching, but his techniques integrated various supreme skills, even if they were of different types! All were manifesting the profound mysteries within his fist techniques! At this moment, Li Che was sweating profusely, blood spraying, qi and blood steaming, as if a dense Surging Crimson Qi and Blood was forming around him!</p><p></p><p>A sudden enlightenment, like a tidal wave crashing against Li Che's mind! Penetrating, clear, and enlightened! At this moment, Li Che felt that his understanding of the supreme skills was rapidly ascending!</p><p></p><p>Enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>Something akin to enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit's second shedding and the advancement of his spiritual penetration had brought Li Che into a state of martial dao enlightenment. All kinds of supreme skills in his mind had become clearer.</p><p></p><p>He was grasping them at lightning speed!</p><p></p><p>Even the Martial Saint's supreme skill, the Primordial Equaling Heaven Staff, which was obscure and difficult to understand, Li Che now seemed able to push forward with the rhythm!</p><p></p><p>This efficiency...</p><p></p><p>It was dozens, even hundreds of times higher than before! Li Che's body trembled, his heart filled with exhilaration, even though his sinews and bones were enduring inhuman pain and transformation.</p><p></p><p>But the harvest at this moment was immense!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the air seemed to be shattered, and he struck out with his fist, as if the qi and blood in his body were surging like thunderous rumbles! True qi and strength intertwined, rushing into the five viscera and six bowels, tempering the five viscera and refining the six bowels!</p><p></p><p>The strength radiated from his spine, spreading and expanding like a great net, reaching throughout his body!</p><p></p><p>The muscles were trembling at an extremely high frequency, as if undergoing intense forging, achieving a thousand hammerings and a myriad refinements, transforming into a divine weapon. Li Che's spirit was more excited than ever before! His vitality was mobilized, the Plucking the Stars Pupils in his brow activated, sensing all the changes within his body! A qi was rushing through at high speed, and he held his breath, suppressing it in the dantian!</p><p></p><p>That was the qi of the martial dao!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, under the transformation, this qi was the fundamental essence. If he were to release this breath, the shedding and transformation would abruptly end. Perhaps his flesh would still achieve a breakthrough, but with the release of this breath, the essence extracted from the blood and flesh would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Consequently... it would lead to a severe depletion of his vital essence and spirit!</p><p></p><p>The five viscera and six bowels were being refined, and the sinews, bones, meridians, and skin were also being refined!</p><p></p><p>Visible to the naked eye, the muscles and skin were trembling at an extremely high frequency, hundreds of times per second! His entire being even emitted a blurred afterimage!</p><p></p><p>The mist of qi and blood gushed out, becoming increasingly dense, and the qi coiled in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Punch!</p><p></p><p>Continue punching!</p><p></p><p>Primordial Equaling Heaven Staff! Li Che clenched his five fingers, and the Dripping Blood Startling Spear he had grasped was suddenly swung with terrifying whipping force, causing the air to explode.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power, obliterating everything! The sound of the rapidly flowing blood was like the towering waves of the Nine Dragon River, surging and rolling! Countless spear shadows densely accumulated within the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused, and the Dripping Blood Startling Spear he had gripped seemed to let out a cry of being overburdened! This spear... after all, was only a Nine Yang Divine Weapon, and at this moment, it could not keep up with Li Che's power and rhythm.</p><p></p><p>It could not withstand the force of the Martial Saint's supreme skill, the Primordial Equaling Heaven Staff!</p><p></p><p>The spearhead plummeted heavily.</p><p></p><p>Striking the air, the air seemed to be deeply indented.</p><p></p><p>Forming a ripple-like vortex of air waves, accompanied by the scorching hot steam bursting out from Li Che's millions of pores, it surged out of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping in all directions! The dense mist of the mysterious altar was instantly stirred up!</p><p></p><p>Within the mysterious altar, the flickering figures of the guardian curse corpses were restless and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the still of the night, the Fiery-Eyed Mysterious Awakening Ape Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Utterly quiet.</p><p></p><p>In the campsite, the lamps were flickering.</p><p></p><p>The chief constable Qi Yangbao, who was quietly reviewing the documents, suddenly changed expression! Grabbing the saber on the table, he immediately rushed out of the campsite, appearing outside the warning line of the dense mist of the mysterious altar.</p><p></p><p>The other chief constables guarding the Mysterious Temple also sensed the commotion and hurried over.</p><p></p><p>Standing outside the mysterious altar.</p><p></p><p>Watching the relentless turbulence, as if the waves were constantly pounding from within, causing the mysterious altar to suddenly surge with a powerful and scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of several people changed involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Chief... could it be... the temple is about to riot again?" </p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple... is it going to riot again? Last time, when the wood carvers from the Heavenly Mandate Observatory came to observe the temple deity, there had been a riot, although it was a false one.</p><p></p><p>But it had already made them extremely tense.</p><p></p><p>This time...</p><p></p><p>Is it going to happen again? Qi Yangbao's expression was extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, I don't know what's happening inside the mysterious altar... no, judging from this momentum, something must have happened inside the Mysterious Temple!"</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>"I have already sensed that the guardian curse corpses and demonic creatures infected by the temple deity's spiritual essence inside the mysterious altar are in turmoil..."</p><p></p><p>"Be on constant alert!"</p><p></p><p>"If the mysterious altar riots, and the guardian curse corpses break out..."</p><p></p><p>"You must immediately return to the prefecture city and report to the Surveillance Commissioner, requesting the Surveillance Commissioner to come and stand guard!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yangbao drew his sharp saber, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>The other chief constables did not say much.</p><p></p><p>The riots of the mysterious altar, they had experienced many times before, and they were not ignorant youngsters.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they don't know how many of their fellow constables will die this time during the mysterious altar's riot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yangbao, leading the other chief constables, stood guard with their sabers outside the warning line.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the turbulent mysterious altar suddenly became calm.</p><p></p><p>The guardian curse corpses and demonic creatures inside the mysterious altar fell into a deathly silence, as if they had been intimidated by some terrifying presence and dared not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yangbao's tense nerves slowly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Another false riot?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Qi Yangbao's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>Is the temple deity this mischievous?</p><p></p><p>Always playing like this, it's really torturing people, isn't it?!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Extremely quiet, only the steady and powerful sound of breathing remained.</p><p></p><p>The dense qi and blood mist enveloped every corner of the Mysterious Temple, as if forming a blood-colored temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the center of the temple, slowly opening his eyes, and in the blood mist-shrouded Mysterious Temple, there seemed to be a flash of lightning!</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump—</p><p></p><p>His heart seemed to have revived, beating violently, bursting forth with surging blood, flowing into the four limbs and the whole body!</p><p></p><p>Everything began to revive, the flesh and blood that had undergone the shedding and transformation, completely awakened!</p><p></p><p>The blood was surging, the sinews and bones were resonating, the intestines and stomach were moving...</p><p></p><p>Every organ of the body seemed to have undergone a transformation, gaining new life!</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, clenching his five fingers, and instantly, all the blood mist gathered, forming a blood ball enveloping Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Then, as Li Che spread his fingers, the blood mist exploded!</p><p></p><p>Transforming into the surging and boiling Surging Crimson Qi and Blood!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind stirred slightly, as if he had established a mysterious connection with these Surging Crimson Qi and Blood.</p><p></p><p>The Surging Crimson Qi and Blood enveloped an area of three zhang around him, not large, but it was as if he had gained countless additional eyes. Within the range of the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood, he could see everything clearly.</p><p></p><p>He could even manipulate these Surging Crimson Qi and Blood, changing their shapes in various ways.</p><p></p><p>Compressing, boiling, tearing, kneading...</p><p></p><p>These Surging Crimson Qi and Blood seemed to have become new organs for him! This sense of control was like he had an additional hand.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, all the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood boiling outside quickly retracted into his pores.</p><p></p><p>Able to shrink and expand at will, hiding and erupting, at his will! This feeling was truly unique.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Penetration... it is worthy of being called a Spiritual Penetration! Changing the mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Surging Crimson Qi and Blood seemed to have transformed into a thin garment, and the color could even change according to his will, through the refraction of light, transforming into various colors.</p><p></p><p>Shedding the Qi and Blood, Surging Crimson Self-Generated, Soaring to the Heavens to Witness the Divine, Capable of All!</p><p></p><p>Li Che recalled the introduction to the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood! As his strength increased, the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood seemed to also grow stronger! The most important thing is...</p><p></p><p>Soaring to the Heavens to Witness the Divine?</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, and a terrifying aura suddenly burst forth from his body.</p><p></p><p>Snapping his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood erupted, forming a blood-colored net around his body, gradually accumulating and coalescing at Li Che's feet into a blood cloud! The blood cloud slowly lifted Li Che's body, gradually floating him up!</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Somersault Cloud?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was strange.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the blood-colored cloud was not quite the same.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood supporting Li Che began to fly rapidly within the Mysterious Temple! Gradually, the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood seemed to be learning, becoming more and more agile...</p><p></p><p>They no longer required Li Che to expend mental effort to control them, but were extremely nimble, soaring up and down, left and right...</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Che struck a high-dive pose, the blood cloud could steadily catch him!</p><p></p><p>Extremely agile! </p><p></p><p>It was not at all cumbersome in flight! At his will, it was like a fish leaping in the sea! In the Mysterious Temple, the candles flickered continuously.</p><p></p><p>On the altar, the statue of the Mysterious Ape Temple Deity, its eyes gleaming, watched as the one riding the blood cloud soared and surged, as if the entire Mysterious Temple was trembling slightly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che landed on the ground, the Surging Crimson Qi and Blood transforming into a black robe covering his body.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a long breath, a faint smile appeared on Li Che's lips.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the airflow was torn into five waves of air trenches! The fascia trembled, the bones cracked! Dragon Sinews and Elephant Bones!</p><p></p><p>Surging Crimson Qi and Blood!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The true essence, to temper the five viscera and six bowels... When the profound martial arts essence fills the five viscera and six bowels, one can then step into the realm of the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"When one comprehends the will of the martial dao and gives birth to the divine aura, then one can be considered to have truly stepped into the realm of the Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>"My Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, which has fused the Primordial Heavenly Staff, can also be considered a supreme martial arts technique. If I can refine the true essence and use that true essence to temper the five viscera and six bowels... the effect will naturally be even better! The divine aura of the Dragon Elephant that is born will also be stronger!"</p><p></p><p>The divine aura of a Grand Master is quite different from the silver aura of the Corpse Refiner.</p><p></p><p>When the spirit and intent merge, the qi becomes an aura - this is the divine aura!</p><p></p><p>The divine aura is not just a form of power, but also a domain! In terms of strength, the divine aura of a Grand Master is still stronger.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of a Grand Master's divine aura is also related to their own martial dao will, as well as the supreme techniques they have cultivated at the Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint techniques are rare and difficult to cultivate, and to reach the Transcendent Realm and step into the Grand Master... is even more difficult! Li Che did not believe that Xue Daofu had broken through to the Grand Master realm using a Martial Saint technique.</p><p></p><p>If that were truly the case...</p><p></p><p>The Flying Thunder Chess Pieces have been arranged.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly, could he now contend with a Grand Master?!</p><p></p><p>He would find out by trying!</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his bones and muscles resonating and trembling!</p><p></p><p>Twisting his neck slightly, every sinew and muscle fiber was clamoring and quivering, emanating terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Daofu..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The daytime scene surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>On Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu, that Grand Master, had roared at Xixie time and time again...</p><p></p><p>This grudge! It pierced his heart! Li Che suddenly opened his eyes, an overwhelming aura of killing intent rolling forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>His physical body suddenly swelled up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wrapped his black robe around his body, putting on a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p></p><p>He did not activate the Primordial Jade of the two Corpse Spirit Generals, because Li Che was impatient, impatient to fight Xue Daofu! His daughter had been wronged...</p><p></p><p>Daddy's here to settle the score!</p><p></p><p>Pressing down the hat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers, the Flying Thunder Chess Pieces instantly flickered and disappeared into the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple completely returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The dense and scorching blood mist also finally dissipated completely.</p><p></p><p>On the altar.</p><p></p><p>The statue of the Spiritual Ape Deity trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As if it had let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>This bastard, has finally left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>In the Falling Flowers Alley, the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and wrapped in black clothes, appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Daofu, the one-armed divine aura Grand Master at the First Realm, his spiritual cultivation must be incredibly powerful... but he cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was as cautious as always.</p><p></p><p>Acting without caution, one would end up shedding tears. </p><p></p><p>Steadiness is one of the principles for survival and establishment in this world.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, within the house, the seven avatar manifestations of Li Che who were refining their spiritual nature exploded open!</p><p></p><p>The seven emotional spiritual natures all returned to the inner landscape of Li Che's Nirvana.</p><p></p><p>The seven spiritual foundations trembled and then all grew stronger! As Li Che fed them one spiritual essence crystal after another.</p><p></p><p>The seven spiritual foundations all reached the Spiritual Foundation Realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual nature suddenly grew stronger, as if a storm was raging within the house.</p><p></p><p>The seven Spiritual Foundation Realm spiritual bases, at this moment, had formidable power, not weaker than that of a Spiritual Sage! After properly arranging the mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Li Che merged his spiritual nature and blood qi, transforming them into spiritual ink, which he splashed onto the pure heart drawing paper.</p><p></p><p>Then the Horse Face gradually tilted out from the scroll.</p><p></p><p>The Horse Face nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shouldering the Immortal Craftsman Barrett, it directly leapt and vanished into the darkness, seeking a sniping position.</p><p></p><p>All preparations were complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Monkey Deity mask and slowly covered his face with it.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, then opening them again...</p><p></p><p>Beneath the mask!</p><p></p><p>His pupils were flowing with golden flames! Holding the Nine Sun Divine Spear, the Dripping Blood Shocking Gun, he placed it on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the mask, the corners of his lips curled up into a slight arc.</p><p></p><p>Lightly tapping his toes, he began to lightly hop and jump in place.</p><p></p><p>His blood qi surged like crimson clouds!</p><p></p><p>As his toes touched the ground...</p><p></p><p>Boom—! As if countless electromagnetic blood nets, they suddenly exploded open around Li Che, forming a blood-colored domain within a thirty-foot range.</p><p></p><p>The domain compressed and gathered at his feet, turning into a blood cloud.</p><p></p><p>It lifted Li Che's body.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a beam of light, it shot up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>As if it could soar up to the high heavens for ten thousand feet! The gods shall see me!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>It was very quiet and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>The room where the Young Prince Xie Haihui was located was also silent, with occasional spiritual waves rippling out, indicating he was cultivating his spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu, with his one arm, carried a cleaver.  His gaze was deep and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>He was seated on a long corridor chair, quite satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince had not sunk into the failure, but had adjusted his mindset and was now quickly returning to a state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This naturally made Xue Daofu quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>Failure is not terrible, what's terrible is falling into the deep pit of failure and being unable to climb out, that would be a kind of despair.</p><p></p><p>But if one can climb out of the pit, failure... will only make you stronger!</p><p></p><p>City Lord Su Huai was sitting in the leisure pavilion, sipping tea and playing chess.</p><p></p><p>Although the Young Prince had lost face by abandoning the mountain, Su Huai did not blindly lead the City Lord's Mansion's people to attack Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Huai really wanted to kill Nan Lihuo, Nan Lihuo was after all the Sect Master of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>If he were to be killed by him, the impact would be too great, the Divine Sect might even stop opening the Mysterious Temple of the Three Crown Princes' Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>That would delay the Young Prince's great matter.</p><p></p><p>So, Su Huai had been waiting.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo also knew this, and the two tacitly understood each other.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo was also seizing the opportunity to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to find an opportunity to scheme against Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai didn't mind, his strength was sufficient to allow him to face any plots and schemes from Nan Lihuo with ease.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Huai had placed a white chess piece on the sandalwood chessboard.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light, in an instant, whistled past his cheek.</p><p></p><p>The gale it stirred up even caused his black hair to flutter.</p><p></p><p>That was a...</p><p></p><p>Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet!</p><p></p><p>In Su Huai's eyes, this rapidly rotating mechanical bullet, its patterns seemed to have become sluggish.</p><p></p><p>This bullet...</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—! The bullet tore through the air, at an extremely fast speed, passing by Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>The target...</p><p></p><p>Was not him! But...</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai frowned.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, at the moment Su Huai sensed the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet, Xue Daofu had already appeared in front of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet, raising his one arm, his five fingers clenching like hooks.</p><p></p><p>He actually grabbed the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly rotating Dragon Tooth Bodhi, slowly came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>After a thunderous explosion, it was completely suppressed by Xue Daofu's powerful blood qi.</p><p></p><p>"Utterly ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Loosening his five fingers, the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet instantly turned into sand and dust, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, his hair flying, on his aged face, a murderous aura surged! "The Dragon Tooth Bodhi... is not an assassin from the Hunting God Pavilion, it's the Horse Face from the Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>City Lord Su Huai said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, appearing in the courtyard, standing in front of the Young Prince's residence.</p><p></p><p>And he was fast, the six Pacification King Xie Moguili's Black Armor Soldiers, moved even faster.</p><p></p><p>They had already drawn the slaughter swords on their backs, the armor clanging, with solemn expressions guarding the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's eyes flashed with a strange color.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they are the elite of the teacher's troops, the Blood Guard, one of the Four Black Armor Guards! Compared to the Divine Guard's elite, they are indeed far superior.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine the magnificent and unparalleled scene when the Four Black Armor Guards act together!</p><p></p><p>He wonders, in his lifetime, if he, Su Huai...</p><p></p><p>Could he have the opportunity to command the First Black Armor Guard?</p><p></p><p>"What kind of scum dares to assassinate the Young Prince!" </p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu spoke, his voice like rumbling thunder, in an instant, as if the clouds behind the sky had burst into thunderous roars! The countless snowflakes in the sky were all shattered into powder by the sound waves!  He lightly tapped his toes.</p><p></p><p>His figure had already shot up into the sky tens of meters away, his gleaming eyes sweeping out.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was like a blade.</p><p></p><p>Following the direction the Dragon Tooth Bodhi was shot from, he searched!  Thousands of feet away, he saw the Horse Face figure putting away the Immortal Craftsman Barrett and starting to leap and flee.</p><p></p><p>"Maggot-like thing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the attack had missed, and the Horse Face had immediately turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's eyes flashed with disdain and coldness.</p><p></p><p>His figure soaring in the air, with one arm behind his back, his sleeve fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>His toes suddenly touched down.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the air seemed to undulate like the surface of a lake, the ripples rising and falling, causing vibrations!</p><p></p><p>And Xue Daofu's figure, a powerful airwave burst out from behind him, like a white wave sweeping across the dark night.</p><p></p><p>Tearing through the darkness, crossing the thousand-foot distance! Swift as lightning!</p><p></p><p>Like thunderous rumbling across the earth! </p><p></p><p>The air let out a sound like a surging river as the powerful blood qi exploded, countless airflows were shattered and burst open under the invisible force.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's murderous aura was burning intensely!</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal it at all.</p><p></p><p>Today, the anger he felt on Golden Peak, at this moment, seemed to want to be fully vented, using this stinking rat that dared to sneak attack and assassinate the Young Prince as the object of his venting!</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Horse Face?</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu had heard of it, but he didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>Just a sneaky assassin hiding and showing its head, although its methods were strange, able to achieve a powerful assassination from a distance.</p><p></p><p>But so what? In the face of a Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>What difference is it from a struggling maggot?</p><p></p><p>That Dragon Tooth Bodhi's power was indeed impressive, with extremely strong penetrating force, even causing his palm to feel a stinging pain.</p><p></p><p>But... that's all.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't even pierce his palm!</p><p></p><p>And still wanting to assassinate?</p><p></p><p>A thousand-foot distance, to the fully unleashed Xue Daofu, was nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>And on the Young Prince's side, Xue Daofu was not worried, the six Black Armor Blood Guards, although only six people, each one had Spiritual Sage cultivation, Grandmaster Realm strength, they were the top elite of the Blood Guards!</p><p></p><p>Six working together, even a Grand Master would not be able to break through their defenses in a short time! Moreover...</p><p></p><p>As the Young Prince's most beloved disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince's protective foundation, how could it only be this?  Along the way, they had also suffered assassination attempts from the top-tier assassination organization of the Great Zhao Dynasty, the Hunting God Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>This Horse Face...</p><p></p><p>Compared to those assassination methods, it's really nothing, a small fry before a great master.</p><p></p><p>The Horse Face's cultivation was not strong, it had not run far yet.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu had already rushed over ferociously, his terrifying blood qi boiling and burning, making the air rise several degrees!</p><p></p><p>"Come and meet your doom!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>The powerful and unparalleled martial dao will of the Grand Master, like a collapsing mountain, heavily descended!</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Spiritual Dao, an incomparable level of suppression!</p><p></p><p>The martial dao will of a Grand Master also has a similar effect, though it is a bit weaker than pure level suppression, not so absolute.</p><p></p><p>If the suppressed person has a resolute will, they can still resist it.</p><p></p><p>The Horse Face's body paused, but then continued to flee wildly under Xue Daofu's martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu instantly descended, his five fingers clenching, as if grabbing all the airflows, he slammed them down hard! The Horse Face's running movements suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling blade light suddenly slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The cleaver at his waist shot out.</p><p></p><p>With a splatter, it severed the Horse Face's head.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>There was no spray of blood! Xue Daofu's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Thick black mist, with a dense ink-like smell, suddenly caused a strong sense of crisis to surge in Xue Daofu's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's heart greatly alarmed! Overhead, thunderous roars! There was a terrifying and scorching aura, suddenly bursting and exploding!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu abruptly looked up.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! However, he saw a dense and extremely bloody cloud, from high above, like a blood-colored thunderbolt falling to earth, rapidly crashing down!</p><p></p><p>On top of the blood cloud, a figure with a Monkey Deity mask, his hands hanging on the scarlet long spear on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the Monkey Deity mask...</p><p></p><p>Someone brazenly and arrogantly smiled! Ascending the tower!</p><p></p><p>The black hair beneath the wide-brimmed hat suddenly grew, as if gilded with golden light, shining brilliantly, the eyes beneath the Monkey Deity mask, at this moment, were like the blazing sun rising, the golden flames bursting forth!</p><p></p><p>Monkey Deity!</p><p></p><p>Descending from the heavens!</p><p></p><p>You dare to roar at my precious daughter?</p><p></p><p>Dare to roar at my Xixie Empress?! "I'll make you roar!"</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!! The surging blood qi exploded like a blood-colored electromagnetic net!</p><p></p><p>Then it transformed into a huge foot, following the Monkey Deity's raised foot!</p><p></p><p>With thunderous speed crashing down to earth!</p><p></p><p>Thud—!!! Heavily stomping down! Pressing the upturned Xue Daofu firmly into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Like a wooden stake!</p><p></p><p>Driving him deep into the earth!</p>

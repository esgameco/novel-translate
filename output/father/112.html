        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thick scent of blood kept gushing forth, like a geyser continuously erupting and spraying.</p><p></p><p>The entire hall was completely enveloped in the stench of blood, making one nearly retch.</p><p></p><p>And within the hall of the White Wave Hall, the wind whistling through the corridors howled and blew, chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon! Hearing his name strikes terror! A villain of the utmost cruelty!</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall master standing beside the White Wave Hall master was now trembling like a sieve, his face deathly pale, his eyes shrunken to the size of peas.</p><p></p><p>He stared dumbfounded at the towering figure beside him, who with the slightest twist had snapped the White Wave Hall master's head.</p><p></p><p>The recklessly dancing vigorous black hair, like lightning, reflected the adorable bovine mask... like a Asura! "You... you..."</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall master was gripped by horrific fear, for the fearsome reputation of the Ox Demon had spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>The many powers under the Fishing Clan had all been massacred by the Ox Demon, yet the Fishing Clan was utterly helpless against him!</p><p></p><p>Now, this Ox Demon had appeared at the White Wave Hall, and it was finally their turn...</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall master was utterly despairing, for the Ox Demon's appearance was sudden, as if he had simply materialized beside the White Wave Hall master.</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall master, who had cultivated the art of necromancy to the peak, with one foot already in the realm of the Cursed Iron Corpse, had his head twisted off by the Ox Demon... more effortless than wringing a chicken's neck...</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon was ten, a hundred times more terrifying than the rumors!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes behind the mask were ice-cold, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>These people... </p><p></p><p>All deserve to die.</p><p></p><p>His gaze connected with the celestial chessboard, and the seal of the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse imprinted on it suddenly trembled, a ring of invisible corpse qi radiating out from his body.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the corpse curse seals on these people - a gift from the Corpse God Sect, a means to drag them into the mire, for the corpse curse seals required the nourishment of death qi.</p><p></p><p>Where does death qi come from?</p><p></p><p>Just like the White Wave Hall master, by killing... even eating people! Boom! Blood and energy erupted, but the deputy hall master had no desire to fight back, he only wanted to flee. The White Wave Hall master had said someone would come to deal with the Ox Demon, but where? Where?! "Where are they?!"</p><p></p><p>The furious roar burst from the deputy hall master's throat.</p><p></p><p>Then, his body became immobilized, his throat seemingly gripped by an invisible hand. The terrifying high-level divine power, like ripples spreading, swept over him, freezing him in place, unable to move at all...</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying divine power...</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall master felt his divine power trembling, unable to even circulate a wisp, completely suppressed by the higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw the blazing sun-like divine foundation rising behind the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation revolving, countless blades sweeping in an instant, like countless bamboo leaves caught in a gale, a hurricane raging within the hall.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter-patter-patter—</p><p></p><p>All the experts of the White Wave Hall perished!</p><p></p><p>Li Che briefly activated the Ascent Stance, not the kind that replenishes divine power, but one that can be maintained for a few breaths, convenient for a one-time absorption of divine power...</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, countless divine powers converged from the corpses, coalescing into divine power chess pieces, entering the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's powerful divine sense swept through, plundering the Heavenly Jade from the two deputy hall masters he had killed and the decapitated hall master.</p><p></p><p>Killing without looting the bodies, how is that different from a stray dog?</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon—!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Che completed these corpse-looting actions, a terrifyingly powerful aura suddenly erupted from outside the White Wave Hall!</p><p></p><p>That was... the divine power aura of a Illusion Realm cultivator! Vast and majestic, like a divine being opening its eyes from afar, the divine power pressure sweeping to annihilate everything.</p><p></p><p>And there was also the terrifying sound of something piercing the wind, with a divine archer from the distance firing a deadly arrow straight at him!</p><p></p><p>One arrow wrapped with roaring dragon-like blood energy, and a refined divine foundation divine power! A very powerful shot! Sealing off all of the Ox Demon's escape angles and directions! But this was not the first time Li Che had encountered this powerful divine archer from the Divine Guard Army, whose archery skills were extraordinary, far surpassing Li Che's [Wrathful Hundred Ghosts Wind and Thunder Arrow].</p><p></p><p>And this divine archer was also extremely powerful, at the Patriarch Realm cultivation, his divine power already reaching divine foundation completion, on the verge of observing the Illusion.</p><p></p><p>The fired arrow was more terrifying than a cannon shell! If it came to the explosive power, it might even exceed his [Namo Immortal Workmanship Barrett]! The Namo Immortal Workmanship Barrett was mainly about long range, high speed, and strong penetration, combined with the malicious Bodhi Tear Dragon Tooth Bodhi Beads...</p><p></p><p>Causing horrifying carnage! But in terms of explosive power, it was no match for a divine arrow imbued with Patriarch Realm true qi and complete divine foundation divine power!</p><p></p><p>Two devastating attacks came raining down, one from a Fishing Clan Illusion Realm expert, and one from a divine archer of the Divine Guard Army!</p><p></p><p>Descending with thunderous might, the oppressive pressure was almost suffocating!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!! </p><p></p><p>The terrifying explosion, like a mushroom cloud rising, the ground trembling, countless cracks and fissures radiating out, as if the earth was quaking.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of meters away, the Nine Dragon River was also stirred into turbulent waves, as if a dragon was roaring in fury within!</p><p></p><p>The meeting hall of the White Wave Hall instantly collapsed, sinking into a deep pit, tiles and walls crumbling, massive spider web-like cracks spreading grotesquely.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the billowing smoke and dust, someone stepped through the air, sweeping past.</p><p></p><p>The gust of wind dispersed the floating dust.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the scene within the deep pit.</p><p></p><p>There stood an elder in elegant robes, hands clasped behind his back, hovering in the air, the Illusion Realm cultivator already possessing the ability of levitation.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the Fishing Clan's deputy clan masters, Liu Jingsong.</p><p></p><p>The other person, with a powerful aura raging, shot forward, landing on the edge of the pit, his golden armor glittering brilliantly in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>"He got away again..."</p><p></p><p>This person was the divine archer of the Divine Guard Army, Jiang Du.</p><p></p><p>These two were top-tier experts even in the entire Gold Light Prefecture, yet their combined assault had still failed to capture the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jingsong gracefully descended, his robes billowing in the wind as he stood with hands clasped, his brow and eyes icy cold: "What a remarkable Ox Demon, truly as slippery as an eel..."</p><p></p><p>"Always striking from the shadows, killing people then immediately fleeing! Malicious and cunning!"</p><p></p><p>"There are even people in the city calling him a hero, for slaughtering the innocent under my Fishing Clan... truly cruel and violent, yet cowardly and afraid of death, a mere rat!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jingsong cursed aloud.</p><p></p><p>A mighty Illusion Realm expert, yet he had been repeatedly evaded and toyed with by one at the Divine Foundation Realm, truly humiliating!</p><p></p><p>His rage was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Du put away his crimson longbow, glancing sidelong at the furious Liu Jingsong, inwardly scoffing.</p><p></p><p>The people the Ox Demon killed... what kind of scum were they? As a Fishing Clan deputy clan master, Liu Jingsong surely knew? Exploiting the people, committing evil, killing to feed the fish... cruel and tyrannical! They deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>Why then, despite the Ox Demon's countless killings, did he enjoy a good reputation in the city? It was simply because he was contrasted against his wicked peers!</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon must possess some secret art of divine power displacement, and his concealment technique is also extremely profound, otherwise he could not have easily escaped our attack and divine power suppression."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Du's golden armor rang as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jingsong let out a cold snort, his expression extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan... had another of its powers been annihilated! The White Wave Hall was the Fishing Clan's heavy hitter, the White Wave Hall master was known for his ruthless efficiency, yet he had been crushed by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days, many of the Fishing Clan's subordinate powers had suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jingsong's eyes flickered, an ominous luster constantly surging.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was...</p><p></p><p>Those killed by the Ox Demon were all followers of the Corpse God Sect, who had received the Corpse Curse Seal! This Ox Demon was actually... specifically targeting the followers of the Corpse God Sect!</p><p></p><p>A coincidence? Once or twice could be a coincidence, but every time the Ox Demon destroyed a Fishing Clan subordinate power, there were followers of the Corpse God Sect with the Corpse Curse Seal! This could not possibly be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"He's targeting the Corpse God Sect! He's single-handedly resisting the Corpse God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"A reckless villain, this Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"A true mad ox!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Unrestrained and arrogant to the extreme!"</p><p></p><p>"I really..."</p><p></p><p>"Love it!"</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardians.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao looked at the intelligence on the Ox Demon presented by Hong Yong and Shi Lei, his eyes shining, unable to resist slamming the table.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan had another of its powers destroyed by the Ox Demon, and according to the Temple Guardians' intelligence feedback, this White Wave Hall master... was also a follower of the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon... can he discern who has joined the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"He specifically targets the followers of the Corpse God Sect for killing, is he... trying to single-handedly resist the Corpse God Sect's encroachment on the Gold Light Prefecture?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao stood up, pacing back and forth with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>His face slightly flushed, filled with surging emotions.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardians knew about the Corpse God Sect's encroachment, of course they did, but they dared not act rashly, for they could not determine who had been infiltrated, unable to detect the presence of the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence the Temple Guardians had obtained at the cost of many agents, the Corpse God Sect had taken advantage of the [Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Enraged Third Prince]'s mysterious temple disturbance, while the Temple Guardians, the Celestial Observatory, and the Divine Sect's branch were all occupied with suppressing the Third Prince's temple...</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardians' supervisors and the overall commander were currently engaged in suppressing the Third Prince's temple.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Temple Guardians in the Gold Light Prefecture were depleted...</p><p></p><p>This was also why Zhang Lianhao dared not rashly take action.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that, without being able to confirm which of the Gold Light Prefecture's upper echelons had been corrupted by the Corpse God Sect...</p><p></p><p>He did not dare act rashly! Most importantly, the Divine Guard Army's upper ranks had also been infiltrated, and this was the gravest issue! After all, in terms of military might, the Divine Guard Army far surpassed the Temple Guardians.</p><p></p><p>"What a remarkable Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly a heroic figure."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Although... this utterly unrestrained, indiscriminate killer who disregards the rules, the authorities greatly dislike.</p><p></p><p>But from his own perspective, from the perspective of the prefecture's common people, the Ox Demon... was truly eliminating the harmful elements for the people!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's single-handed resolve had forced the Fishing Clan to restrain its vicious nature.</p><p></p><p>"I truly envy his unbridled temperament..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao truly envied it, for once he donned this official robe, there were many things he was no longer free to do.</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon's movement skills are remarkable, he must truly possess a displacement art, but now that he has been exposed... the various parties are on alert, so within the limits..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the techniques of the art of displacement, the Ox Demon... was not far from being caught in the net.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao stopped pacing and happened to be standing in front of the window.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the overcast sky, brewing a spring rain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The fine rain misted, shrouding the riverside city in clouds and mist.</p><p></p><p>Like the vast blank spaces in a landscape painting, the buildings with upturned eaves and corners stood out, full of poetic charm.</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory, the Cliff Stone Treasure Tower. In the study.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the white flying thunder chess piece with five fingers, returning to this place.</p><p></p><p>The bloody smell on his body was extremely thick, but with a sudden jolt, the countless bloodstains were condensed into a blood bead and directly thrown into a jade bottle, thrown into the void space.</p><p></p><p>Lighting the sandalwood, filling the study with a lingering fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Ox Demon mask, taking off the black robe, the burly physique returned to normal, restoring Li Che's usual gentle and honest appearance.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling lightly, Li Che's mood was calm and undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan... had been targeted by him, but he did not start by keeping an eye on the Black Snake Clan that was watching his family, but attacked the other forces of the Fishing Clan, as long as he found the corpse curse mark within the clan.</p><p></p><p>Li Che would not hesitate to kill them with thunderous outbursts.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Che was that the Fishing Clan... was almost completely penetrated by the Corpse God Sect, or one could say, it had almost opened its arms to allow the Corpse God Sect to erode it.</p><p></p><p>This must have been with the tacit consent of the Fishing Clan's upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>"The Fishing Clan... is this going to rebel against the Golden Light Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, he was too lazy to think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Fishing Clan rebelled or not, he didn't care, as long as he could act recklessly, the Fishing Clan didn't play by the rules, so Li Che would unleash the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the chair, Li Che counted the gains this time, which were actually quite ordinary. Li Che was mainly focused on the divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>"So poor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned and muttered, this White Wave Hall Master, with a total of only five ten-do divine essence crystals, was so poor that he was about to die.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten days, Li Che had completely transformed into the Ox Demon, hunting down the forces under the Fishing Clan, and killing any cultivators who had accepted the corpse curse mark of the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>In total, he had harvested thirty-two ten-do divine essence crystals, which was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also quite helpless, after all, divine essence crystals were resources consumed in cultivation, and these cultivators were all in need of cultivation, so being able to gather thirty-two of them was already quite good.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect's Corpse God Envoy is still richer... one eight-extreme divine essence crystal is almost enough to choke me to death."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered, reminiscing.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, during this period, while he was in the guise of the Ox Demon, hunting down the forces under the Fishing Clan, he had not encountered any Corpse God Envoys of the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and a flow of light appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Crafting (Lv3, 79%), Dragon Elephant Vajra (Lv3, 25%), Untainted Heart (Lv3, 5%), Chess Saint (Lv2, 58%)]</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Dao Fruit has achieved a considerable increase overall!</p><p></p><p>The progress of Immortal Crafting was not great, after all, he had not carved any new divine statues, and the Dragon Elephant Vajra, although it did not have too much pressure due to the frequent battles, the speed of improvement was still not bad.</p><p></p><p>After reaching Lv3 of Untainted Heart, the speed of improvement has completely slowed down. Even if he drained the remaining eight-extreme divine essence crystals, it would only barely increase the proficiency by 5%.</p><p></p><p>The ten-do divine essence crystals, on the other hand, required ten of them to increase 1% in proficiency, the speed has completely dropped, and the cost-effectiveness has become extremely low! He didn't know if it was because [Untainted Heart] had eaten the chaff of the eight-extreme divine essence crystals, and the ten-do divine essence crystals, which were like coarse grains, had become completely unpalatable.</p><p></p><p>This was forcing him to find higher-quality divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>Eight-extreme, seven-element level divine essence crystals were the only ones that could be accepted?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, [Untainted Heart] could extract the divine nature from the divine essence crystals at an extremely fast speed, and Li Che had transferred the extracted ten-do divine essence to the [Three-Eyed Furious True Lord] divine foundation, and although it still needed to be refined, the overall speed had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>In ten days, after refining ten ten-do divine essence crystals, he had raised the [Three-Eyed Furious True Lord] divine foundation to the divine foundation intermediate realm! But what made Li Che the most pleasantly surprised was the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit...</p><p></p><p>Due to the increase in killings, the condensed divine chess pieces, as well as the frequency of using the Flying Thunder Chess Saint and the Heaven and Earth Chessboard, had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit had achieved a desirable increase! It has now reached 58%!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it is the battles and killings that bring the fastest improvement.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>After finishing up, Li Che stood up, his entire body creaking and popping.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists, the intertwined airflow, Li Che began to cultivate martial arts in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the divine meridians, according to the "Supreme Prison Lotus Penetrating Meridians of the Great Scenery Temple", the cultivation of the divine meridians is mainly based on divine transformation.</p><p></p><p>The abundance of divine transformation affects the strength of one's qi and internal energy.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the Grandmaster realm, the divine meridians need to integrate the realm of three different martial arts, achieving the three divine transformations.</p><p></p><p>The "Harmony" is the minimum requirement, and the true qi Grandmasters who break through are also of the lowest grade.</p><p></p><p>After that, there are the stages of the six divine transformations and the nine divine transformations.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty... is simply incomparable!</p><p></p><p>After all, for any martial artist, to cultivate a martial art to the realm of transformation, the time and effort required is too much, too much.</p><p></p><p>And the martial arts are divided into small, medium, and supreme, and the realms of transformation are also different.</p><p></p><p>Many divine meridian martial artists, exhausting their lives, still cannot cultivate three realms of transformation martial arts, naturally they have no hope of becoming Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>However, it is rumored that within the Divine Sect, there is a mysterious and miraculous Spiritual Martial Pill, which can enhance a person's martial arts comprehension, and then the cultivation of martial arts can be accelerated to the realm of transformation.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why it is easier for the major sects to produce Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>But for ordinary divine meridian cultivators, Grandmaster is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Without becoming a Grandmaster, the divine appearance is hopeless... which is to say, a dead end, the path has been cut off.</p><p></p><p>In the workshop, the fierce wind gradually subsided, and only the hidden and undercurrent powerful qi was surging, Li Che opened his eyes, like a brilliant light bursting forth from the darkness, his eyes like two shining stars.</p><p></p><p>"The White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist and the Eight-Link Shatter Bone Spear have both reached the realm of transformation, and have been integrated into the divine meridians..."</p><p></p><p>"Next, the Python Dragon Cannon, the Cloud Hawk Stepping on the Clouds, and the Furious Cry of the Hundred Ghosts Wind Lightning Arrow have all reached the level of Master, and the Furious True Lord Three Blade Sword is about to reach the Master level..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, the Amitabha Golden Robe has also reached the Master level, all of them are just one step away from the realm of transformation."</p><p></p><p>"But the martial arts I cultivate are only seven in number, the nine divine transformations... are still two short."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought.</p><p></p><p>With the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao Fruit, Li Che naturally wanted to assault the nine divine transformations and step into the Grandmaster realm in the most perfect manner.</p><p></p><p>But even for him, the assault on the nine divine transformations was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, there is also the 'Seven Element Divine Sculpture Art' obtained from the Astronomical Observatory, which includes a profound martial art, the 'Thousand Hand Divine Sculpture', which belongs to the martial arts category, but I am still some distance away from mastering it..."</p><p></p><p>"Calculated this way, I'm still one martial art transformation short."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stopped his cultivation, the airflow and qi lingering around his body, like a blooming hell lotus.</p><p></p><p>"Should I cultivate the martial arts of the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought of the 'Corpse God Death Smoke Finger', a divine martial art that he had obtained from a Corpse God Envoy of the Corpse God Sect, which also belonged to the martial arts category.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this martial art requires death qi...</p><p></p><p>Well, the Ox Demon is not lacking in death qi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Since it's like this, he'll cultivate it! The foundation of the nine divine transformations is now complete! As for the current Ox Demon, when facing the Fishing Clan, he can only choose to sneak around and kill, kill someone and then run.</p><p></p><p>And he can only kill the small sects under the Fishing Clan, it would be very difficult to deal with the upper echelons of the Fishing Clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Fishing Clan's leader is a true Divine Appearance realm, and the two vice-leaders are even Grandmaster Illusion realm...</p><p></p><p>Even with the Ascending Tower state, going up against the Illusion realm, it would still be difficult to win.</p><p></p><p>The temple deities have the invincible posture of the same realm, but the Illusion realm is no longer in the divine foundation, so the suppressive power of the Ascending Tower state will be reduced, naturally making it difficult to defeat.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che felt that he should still give it a try.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>There are too many powerhouses in the Golden Light Prefecture, and if he gets trapped in a siege, it would be truly dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is playing it safe, even if he transforms into the Ox Demon, while pursuing recklessness, he must also ensure his own safety.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a turbid breath, Li Che walked to the window.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the waters of the Nine Dragons River lapping against the cliffs, Li Che's gaze changed.</p><p></p><p>While gazing into the distance, he seemed to see through the thick city walls and see a towering and ominous temple standing outside the city, roaring in the middle of the river.</p><p></p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the temple deities... is at the end of its rope."</p><p></p><p>"I want to absorb it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Late at night, the Fishing Clan headquarters.</p><p></p><p>An old man with a burly beard and bare upper body, sitting on a grand chair, his eyes wide open, full of surging murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The entire room was silent and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Vice Leader Liu Jinsong and the other Vice Leader Zhao Xunqi were silent.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred-million gambling den, the White Wave Hall... seven of them, all killed and eliminated from under my Fishing Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Now my Fishing Clan, the hearts of the people are in turmoil, and many even want to leave the clan!"</p><p></p><p>"A mere Ox Demon, not even an Illusion realm existence, has actually stirred up my Fishing Clan to such a state of unrest!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan leader slapped his hand down, the terrifying Divine Appearance power instantly emptied the airflow in the entire room, emitting a violent howling sound.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the people of the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Those who died were all marked with the seal before being targeted by the Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"How could the Ox Demon accurately find those who were marked?"</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Clan leader glared with his leopard eyes, looking at Liu Jinsong.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Ox Demon is actually a person of the Corpse God Sect? Damn it, he's just using an excuse, deliberately eating my Fishing Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong, who was responsible for liaising with the Corpse God Sect, was slightly pale at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon is a high-ranking member of the Corpse God Sect? Impossible, absolutely impossible...</p><p></p><p>This is a mess, the leader must not guess wildly!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong, dressed in luxurious clothes, cupped his fists and exhaled, his expression grim.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon could not possibly be a person of the Corpse God Sect, Leader, please calm down..."</p><p></p><p>"As for why many Corpse God Envoys have been in hiding."</p><p></p><p>"Because..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsong's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>"The Spring Equinox is approaching."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan is coming back."</p>

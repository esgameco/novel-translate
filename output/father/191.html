        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The agonizing roar erupted from the illusory dragon shadow, this was a divine dragon, similar to the Martial Saint's will, both born from the bloodline within Ji Huihui's body.</p><p></p><p>However, since Ji Huihui's own strength was not powerful, the wills born from the two bloodlines were also not strong.</p><p></p><p>Even the Martial Saint's will left behind by Ji Mogui was planning to use the Infernal Lotus Yin Shen Sword to carry more willpower.</p><p></p><p>Alas...</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus Yin Shen Sword was suppressed prematurely by Li Che's scheme.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ji Mogui's arrangement collapsed immediately.</p><p></p><p>It was just like two chess players sitting across the board, painstakingly arranging the grand dragon formation, only to have it shattered by a single move of the opponent.</p><p></p><p>And this illusory dragon shadow naturally became even weaker.</p><p></p><p>Because most of its power had been drained by the Martial Saint's will, this illusory dragon shadow only had the dragon form left.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, every time Ji Huihui activated the dragon god's power, it was consuming this divine dragon's will.</p><p></p><p>So now it was pierced through by Li Che's spear.</p><p></p><p>Stuck in the illusory mist, it could only keep struggling and thrashing.</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind dissipated, the illusory mist settled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, the Dao fruit in his chest tended towards calmness, the boiling blood in his body also gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Saint is truly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"The Pacification King's 'Myriad Dragons Prostrate Divine Technique', a peerless supreme skill, is indeed extraordinary! Even when executed at the Grandmaster realm, it is capable of destroying heaven and earth, enough to forcefully confront a Great Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che marveled inwardly, his eyes opening and closing, savoring this battle.</p><p></p><p>Waves of emotion surged in his heart involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>It was just a wisp of descendant bloodline will, yet it could erupt such power from thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>If the Pacification King was in his prime, how terrifying would he be? And this Martial Saint's supreme 'Myriad Transformations Subdue Dragon Technique', Li Che's supreme killing technique, the Primordial Single Staff, completely relied on the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant and the Dao fruit's enhancement to forcefully overwhelm the opponent.</p><p></p><p>In terms of techniques, he was still a bit inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, his heart slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable, mountain-like oppressive force suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute power, any schemes or calculations would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Even if he used the Flying Thunder Chess Pieces to teleport and escape, it would be difficult to shake off the danger.</p><p></p><p>The pressure...</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his heart now understanding his current strength, which was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>He could not be complacent, he still needed to strive and constantly grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Saint should also have varying degrees of strength, I just don't know what realm this Pacification King is at within the Martial Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, he had no concept of such a god-like realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the divisions of the Great Grandmaster realm, Li Che only had a partial understanding.</p><p></p><p>Xixie blinked her big eyes, full of stars.</p><p></p><p>Daddy is so powerful! Xixie was extremely happy, deeply satisfied and reassured.</p><p></p><p>She grinned foolishly, seeing that Li Che had finished the battle, she came running over, hugging Li Che's big leg.</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up Xixie, looking her up and down, seeing that she was unharmed, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing the little girl's head, Li Che's gaze fell on the corpse of Ji Huihui in the distance, his eyes slightly rippling.</p><p></p><p>And Xixie seemed to have thought of something, her body in Li Che's arms started to struggle.</p><p></p><p>She slid down to the ground, took a step, and ran out.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the almost dragon-shaped corpse of Ji Huihui, after some fumbling, she found Ji Huihui's Yin-Yang Jade with some clumsiness! Then she was overjoyed, hopping and skipping back to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy! Here!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie handed the Yin-Yang Jade to Li Che like a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"This is your spoil of war, you keep it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, however, rarely refused.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ji Huihui was the one Xixie defeated and killed, so this spoil of war should be left for Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Start cultivating the habit of collecting spoils from an early age.</p><p></p><p>But Xixie shook her head, "Give it to Daddy, Xixie has no use for it now!"</p><p></p><p>"When Xixie grows up, she will have many, many spoils of war."</p><p></p><p>Xixie raised her head, her chubby cheeks flushed with joy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and didn't refuse, taking the Yin-Yang Jade.</p><p></p><p>Also, keeping this Yin-Yang Jade for Xixie is not a good idea.</p><p></p><p>This is the Yin-Yang Jade of Prince Ji Huihui, the identification is too high, if Xixie has it, it's like openly declaring that she killed Ji Huihui, right?</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Martial Saint's will crushed by Li Che, the only ones who know Xixie killed Ji Huihui are the struggling divine dragon will and the spectating Taoist Priest Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>That divine dragon will, pinned in the void by him, is basically hard to escape.</p><p></p><p>So the real troublesome one is the Taoist Priest Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Being able to suppress the news that Xixie killed Ji Huihui, Li Che naturally advocates suppressing it, there's no help for it, the Pacification King is so powerful, not to mention his own formidable Martial Saint cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Just the Great Grandmasters and Divine Element Immortals under the Pacification King alone would pose a huge threat to Li Che's family.</p><p></p><p>Li Che always acts with stability as the priority.</p><p></p><p>He never acts recklessly.</p><p></p><p>I'm not strong yet, so I'll develop stealthily.</p><p></p><p>So if he can suppress the news, he naturally advocates suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of making the news chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"The Pacification King's Martial Saint will has been scattered by me, unable to return to its original body, so it naturally cannot know the truth of Ji Huihui's death thousands of miles away."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He put away Ji Huihui's Yin-Yang Jade, ruffled Xixie's head, and took a step forward, countless illusory objects exploded, rippling circles of air pressure dispersed, and in an instant, he appeared in front of the divine dragon shadow pinned in the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard! You killed my son!"</p><p></p><p>"You're dead!"</p><p></p><p>"You're all dead!"</p><p></p><p>The divine dragon shadow roared, furious to the extreme, even though it was struggling and thrashing while pinned in the void, it was cursing angrily.</p><p></p><p>Like a bereaved shrew.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at it indifferently, indeed...</p><p></p><p>Such venomous killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He must not let these wills return to their original bodies and know the truth of Ji Huihui's death.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers gripped the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Splitting Gold Spear, instantly the spear trembled and suddenly swelled, the blood qi and aura surging on it, like ferocious red blood vessels bulging!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly turning! The terrifying tearing force abruptly erupted from the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear.</p><p></p><p>Boom—!! The terrifying true qi gushed out, like countless blades, infusing into the divine dragon shadow...</p><p></p><p>A loud explosion! The divine dragon shadow directly exploded into pieces!</p><p></p><p>Turning into an extremely dense mist.</p><p></p><p>Only the extremely angry resentful will remained, still rolling in the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear with one hand, raised his hand, and tapped his brow...</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood parted, a brilliant eyeball spun dynamically! Plucking Star Pupils! A gaze with a sense of substantiality swept across, rampaging through the illusory mist!</p><p></p><p>Sweeping over the divine dragon shadow he had crushed...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he did capture a few lingering wills, Li Che flicked his finger, the powerful divine sense swept out...</p><p></p><p>Instantly erasing all these lingering divine dragon wills!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a few roars of dragon cries, the entire illusory mist became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Without putting away the Plucking Star Pupils.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Pupils capable of discerning the true from the false, emitting dazzling light, Li Che's brows slightly furrowed as he swept across the illusory mist, as if seeing the surging Illusory Towers.</p><p></p><p>Behind those Illusory Towers, there were densely packed illusory figures, clinging to the edge of the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at Li Che and Xixie through the mist.</p><p></p><p>The hairs on his body instantly stood on end!</p><p></p><p>As if every inch of his flesh and blood had frozen at that moment, the circulation of his blood seemed to have congealed.</p><p></p><p>These...</p><p></p><p>Are the monsters from within the Illusory Towers?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, his emotions involuntarily pounding.</p><p></p><p>Roar—! Those monsters from the Illusory Towers, as if they had sensed that Li Che could see them, suddenly began to frantically assault the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>As if they wanted to tear open the mist and rush over to kill! Rumbling—! Like the sound of muffled thunder, the entire illusory mist became agitated, as if scorching hot aura was rolling up from the depths of the mist.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were far apart, separated by the thick mist, it was impossible to block that scorching hot intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Is this... the Illusory Towers of this Four Guardians Illusory Temple?!</p><p></p><p>Each Illusory Tower is a creature born with the Illusory Temple, possessing extremely terrifying dangers.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Elder Jiao not supporting the Infernal Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel this time, once they stepped into the Illusory Towers, they would face the ravages and assaults of the monsters within the Illusory Towers!</p><p></p><p>To plunder the Illusory Temple, one must actually overcome and suppress the monsters within the Illusory Towers.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Towers of the Four Guardians Illusory Temple...</p><p></p><p>The monsters within, are probably extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even Martial Saints... may not be few in number, right? Li Che's hairs stood on end, feeling the great terror constantly approaching, approaching, wanting to tear open the mist and come closer, he chose to close the Plucking Star Pupils, and finally diverted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>As his gaze shifted away...</p><p></p><p>That restlessness and rumbling immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat appeared on Li Che's forehead, and he exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>The unknown is the greatest terror.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>He also had a lot of doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Guardians Illusory Temple... according to the descriptions in the scriptures of the Golden Light Sect, the cursed corpses of the temple guardians infected by the temple deity's divinity in the Illusory Towers... shouldn't be so many, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen such a large number of monsters..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like they were infected by the temple deity's divinity... more like..."</p><p></p><p>"They gathered from the depths of the Illusory Towers?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hairs stood on end.</p><p></p><p>He's not someone who hasn't been to the Illusory Temple before.</p><p></p><p>For example, that Fire-Eyed Mysterious Startling Ape Illusory Temple, he has set foot in it before.</p><p></p><p>And he has also tried to observe the Illusory Towers of the Illusory Temple with the Plucking Star Pupils.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the temple guardian cursed corpses and the monsters infected by the divine power, the numbers were not many...</p><p></p><p>Could it be because they were cleared by a powerful expert?</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the Plucking Star Pupils.</p><p></p><p>But his heart kept trembling.</p><p></p><p>However, the gap is too large.</p><p></p><p>Those Illusory Towers... are almost filled with monsters, enough to trigger claustrophobia.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity's divinity could not have infected so many Illusory Tower monsters...</p><p></p><p>So where did these monsters come from?</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A voice rang out in Li Che's ear.</p><p></p><p>His eyes couldn't help but narrow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che flashed, appearing beside Xixie, putting away the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Splitting Gold Spear, his gaze falling on the black lotus platform that appeared in the illusory mist.</p><p></p><p>On the lotus platform, a child in a black belly shirt was seated cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying and vast oppressive force suddenly collapsed like the mountains and rivers in mythology, exploding and crushing down on Li Che like an avalanche! Oppressive, suffocating! That was a terrifyingly high-level aura pressure!</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che, who now had eight Dao fruits in his Nirvana Inner Realm, could ignore the aura pressure of Immortal Cultivators, and could resist the pressure of Divine Element Immortals, felt as if he was trapped in suffocation at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was even frozen like a sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Only her curious eyes could blink.</p><p></p><p>Father and daughter, both seemed to have lost control of their bodies under the aura pressure, like wooden carvings, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's chest, a violent pounding sound exploded.</p><p></p><p>Like the evening drums and morning bells, like the rumbling of a great bell, it instantly flowed through his entire body, breaking the oppression!</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman], [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], [Untainted Heart], [Chess Saint], [Fairy in the Painting]...</p><p></p><p>Five Dao fruits lit up five rays of light on Li Che's body!</p><p></p><p>Lying on the lotus platform, the chuckling Third Prince suddenly stopped laughing.</p><p></p><p>He sat up seriously, staring intently at Li Che, squinting his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long time...</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince sighed with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to break through in this way... it's different, completely different."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about what you would do if you couldn't beat that dragon and that person? What would you do?"</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince looked at Li Che and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently, "Run away with my daughter."</p><p></p><p>"When my strength is sufficient... I'll come back to kill."</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince twitched his mouth, what a scumbag! From the moment he took that Yin Shen Sword, he had already shown an unparalleled scumbag attitude.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince jumped off the black lotus platform, his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"After all, you won't give up on your daughter, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"As a father, I naturally won't give up on my daughter."</p><p></p><p>"I envy you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince's mood seemed to have lowered a bit. He looked down at his own feet, then looked at Xixing: "I envy you for having such a father."</p><p></p><p>Xixing, who was being held by Li Che, seemed to be protected by the aura of the Dao Fruit, shielded from the pressure of the Third Prince's status, and was able to move again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Third Prince's envy, she proudly raised her chin.</p><p></p><p>Xixing's daddy is the best!</p><p></p><p>This is Xixing's daddy! The Third Prince's words ended.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the black lotus petals on the black lotus platform enveloped the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the mysterious mist was broken through and he disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xixing and looked at the vanished temple deity, his eyes flashing with a trace of doubt.</p><p></p><p>His perception spread, but he was completely unable to detect the existence of the temple deity's will.</p><p></p><p>He raised his gaze, looking towards the distant mysterious mist.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the mist began to slowly part.</p><p></p><p>An ancient and dilapidated strange temple came into view.</p><p></p><p>This was the true strange temple.</p><p></p><p>This time, there was no other "Xixing" sitting on the stairs in front of the strange temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put down Xixing.</p><p></p><p>"Go..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Xixing's head.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of regret in his eyes, because this strange temple... he could not enter.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, all the divine children and spiritual children who came to resonate with the temple deity were unable to step into the strange temple, at most they could only approach it.</p><p></p><p>The closer they got, the more they could receive the temple deity's gifts.</p><p></p><p>"How can I enter this Four-Guarded Strange Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel a trace of regret.</p><p></p><p>He had planned to enter the strange temple, observe the temple deity's statues, and leave a Chess Saint chess piece.</p><p></p><p>To leave himself a way in, so he could come here often.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>This idea had to be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he watched Xixing walk towards the steps of the strange temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lightly tapped his toes, his figure quickly shot back out.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly appeared next to the half-human, half-dragon corpse of Ji Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>He looked indifferently at Ji Haiwei's corpse...</p><p></p><p>He suppressed the urge to destroy the body.</p><p></p><p>He thought of Qin Fenghuо, and then of the terrifying death qi and corpse qi in the Qin family's carriage...</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Jingang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious Seventh-Rank Upper Position Corpse Deity Envoy of the Corpse Deity Cult, Yuan Jingang.</p><p></p><p>It turned out he had been hiding in the Qin family all along.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had actually never discovered it, even though he had specifically scanned the Qin family several times.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that...</p><p></p><p>The corpse talisman that Yuan Jingang commanded must be above the Seventh-Rank, reaching the Sixth司level! And this time, the Corpse Deity Cult must have had some calculations regarding this temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the best opportunity to frame someone? </p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers clenched.</p><p></p><p>He drew out death qi and corpse qi from the Seventh-Rank corpse talisman, and then dragon-elephant silver roar burst forth on his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>Mixing them together, he injected them into the wounds of Ji Haiwei's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Creating the illusion that he was killed by a powerful Corpse Deity Cult cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just something Li Che casually arranged to confuse the situation.</p><p></p><p>Except for the temple deity and Li Che himself, no one would know that it was Xixing who killed Ji Haiwei, but for the sake of safety, he splashed some more dirt on the Corpse Deity Cult.</p><p></p><p>This way, it would be even harder to guess that it was Xixing's doing.</p><p></p><p>As for the conflict between Ji Haiwei and Xixing...</p><p></p><p>Is a conflict between children even considered a conflict? After doing all this, Li Che smiled, tapped his toes, and the mysterious mist rippled and dispersed, making him disappear.</p><p></p><p>Xixing didn't look back, she knew her daddy would always be there.</p><p></p><p>She walked boldly and relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Although she had just obtained two divine weapons, a gold brick, and another golden light wheel, now she had the true gifts from the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>When Xixing reached the steps,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a buzzing sound echoed in her head.</p><p></p><p>Her small body directly sat down on the steps.</p><p></p><p>Beginning to receive the temple deity's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>On Jiao Shaoqiu's withered face like old tree bark, a trace of a strange color slowly flowed.</p><p></p><p>The collision just now was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>It almost reached the Great Grandmaster level! Jiao Shaoqiu's first thought was that there was a monster that had torn through the mysterious mist barrier and descended into the Mysterious Pavilion, causing the Mysterious Pavilion to lose control!</p><p></p><p>If that were the case,</p><p></p><p>All the participants in the temple deity resonance would die.</p><p></p><p>Including him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was controlling and manipulating the Hell Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel in front of him, the result would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu exhaled.</p><p></p><p>He continued to make hand seals, no longer caring about those matters.</p><p></p><p>He would first complete this session of the temple deity resonance, and then deal with the rest.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Pavilion really went into a rampage, it was not something he, who had fallen from the Golden Core to the Primordial Spirit, could calm and resist.</p><p></p><p>A Four-Guarded Strange Temple going into a Mysterious Pavilion rampage would be enough to shake the entire Lingnan Dao, requiring the dispatch of Martial Saints and Deity Embryo Great Cultivators to stand guard.</p><p></p><p>It was simply not something a Spiritual Element like him could solve.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Supervisor said... this Four-Guarded Strange Temple of the Golden Light Prefecture is very special, but he didn't explain specifically what's special about it, the riddle-speaking is so annoying..."</p><p></p><p>"But the Grand Supervisor also said that at least for the next ten years, this Eight-Armed Hell Lotus Furious Third Prince Strange Temple will not have a large-scale Mysterious Pavilion rampage..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's eyes opened and closed, and he raised his head to look at the Golden Light Wheel emitting a scorching halo.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Grand Supervisor in the Divine Capital, Jiao Shaoqiu still believed him a lot.</p><p></p><p>So he had not given up.</p><p></p><p>He was still presiding over this temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>For the children,</p><p></p><p>This temple deity resonance may be an opportunity to change their fate.</p><p></p><p>The opportunities of the Four-Guarded Strange Temple...</p><p></p><p>Can affect the children's entire lives!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the carriage, dissolving the [Painting Immortal] clone he had left on the carriage shaft, as if the two overlapped, and the Painting Immortal clone exploded into thin mist.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo—</p><p></p><p>The wind was howling.</p><p></p><p>The large raindrops were still pouring down, pounding on the top of the Thunderous Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The tense atmosphere gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>His departure and return had not attracted anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Huai and Zhang Ya in the carriage were completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>Li Che leaned against the carriage shaft, his entire body relaxed, his muscles more relaxed than ever before.</p><p></p><p>He raised his gaze, sweeping towards the center of the Thunderous Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The tense atmosphere began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Because the sudden eruption of power at the Grandmaster level in the mysterious mist made the Shadow Guard True Person realize that it was the Prince who had acted.</p><p></p><p>It should be the Martial Saint will left by the Prince in the Young Prince's body that erupted.</p><p></p><p>That murderer... must be done for! The Shadow Guard True Person was already looking forward to it...</p><p></p><p>Looking forward to the scene when the mysterious mist tore open again, and everyone saw the appearance of this supreme Martial Saint will.</p><p></p><p>That was the Pacifying King after all! Not only was he a supreme Martial Saint, but also a Deity Embryo Great Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The mere appearance of such a powerful Martial Saint will would be enough to suppress everyone present, making all the strong ones pay their utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's eyes flickered, and he let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>He brushed off his clothes, and excitement and fervor appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen his teacher.</p><p></p><p>Now that he could see, even if it was just a trace of Martial Saint will, it still made him very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He had even prepared to make a deep bow.</p><p></p><p>Waiting to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard True Person no longer lingered.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Element Golden Core returned to the Nirvana Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the six Black Armor Blood Guards also put away their Slaughter Sabers, and under their black helmets, their cold and solemn faces could not hide their fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Wang Daoren both heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If they really fought, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>They were also shocked, sensing the aftershocks of the Grandmaster-level power that had just surged and gushed out from the Nine Dragon River.</p><p></p><p>"The Pacifying King... Is it Ye Mogli?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and Wang Kuyu both had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu even shook his fly-whisk, his face full of bitterness: "Sure enough, Ye Mogli sent Ji Haiwei here to this Four-Guarded Strange Temple, he must have a big scheme."</p><p></p><p>"I hope they don't provoke the temple deity, don't make the strange temple go into a rampage..."</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, the Golden Light Prefecture doesn't have the power to quell the temple deity's fury and the Mysterious Pavilion rampage."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu sighed.</p><p></p><p>And on the edge of the Thunderous Cliff,</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's coachman and the Shrine Pacification Supervisor Zhu Chaoyang, two Grandmasters, had their muscles tightly tensed, their martial will as Grandmasters already suppressing.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint... Martial Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang thundered deeply, exhaling.</p><p></p><p>It must not be the Martial Saint in person, it was probably just a trace of Martial Saint will, yet it could still erupt with Grandmaster-level power!</p><p></p><p>It was simply terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Unimaginably terrifying...</p><p></p><p>But Zhu Chaoyang was more curious, who was it that contended against Ye Mogli's Martial Saint will? Even if it was just a trace of Martial Saint will...</p><p></p><p>It still had the terrifying suppressive force unique to Martial Saints!</p><p></p><p>Who was it that could fight against a Martial Saint will? The Qin family carriage.</p><p></p><p>The breeze blew, constantly rippling the curtain.</p><p></p><p>The figures inside the carriage had never shown themselves.</p><p></p><p>But when the Martial Saint will erupted with Grandmaster-level battle aftershocks, the figures in the carriage did tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>For a moment,</p><p></p><p>It was quiet on top of the Thunderous Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting.</p><p></p><p>In anxiety, curiosity and anticipation...</p><p></p><p>When the mysterious mist tore open,</p><p></p><p>That Martial Saint's grandeur!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che had relaxed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Wait for the Martial Saint's grandeur? These people were likely to be disappointed...</p><p></p><p>He had crushed Ye Mogli's Martial Saint will, of course, the main reason was that Li Che was cunning enough, when he sensed that the Hell Lotus Yin Deity Sword was strengthening the Martial Saint will's aura, he immediately took the initiative to attack, first collecting the sword into the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>This made the Martial Saint will lose its continuous power source.</p><p></p><p>So it could not continue the magnificent battle, and simply exploded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>The breeze blew, accompanied by the sound of falling rain.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a flow of light gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra (LV4, 40%)】</p><p></p><p>After the battle with the Martial Saint will, the maturity of the Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra had directly risen to 40%!</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a fleeting battle, the gains for Li Che were huge!

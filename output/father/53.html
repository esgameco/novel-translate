        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and the slanted rain poured down from the high sky, splattering against the earth below.</p><p></p><p>Washing over the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Pavilion seemed to be shrouded in a curtain of rain, its surfaces blooming with countless hazy outlines. The suspended pavilions, with their curtains fluttering wildly in the rushing airflow stirred up by the downpour, were like a swirling dance of twisted dragons.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's complexion was ashen, his face full of a look as if he were on the verge of tears, like an aggrieved young mistress who would burst into sobs at the slightest touch.</p><p></p><p>He had taken a seat in the suspended pavilion he had reserved in advance.</p><p></p><p>As one of the Three Young Masters of the Fei Lei Clan, he previously never needed to make reservations, but ever since he was mysteriously attacked by a cultivator and had his divine nature diminished, and the news spread that his elderly grandfather's divine foundation was on the verge of collapse...</p><p></p><p>Now, even coming to the Golden Pavilion required advance booking for him.</p><p></p><p>The charcoal stove boiled the water, the bubbles rolling up and down. He added the finest spring tea leaves to the pot, and the dry tea leaves instantly unfurled, their verdant essence blooming like flowers.</p><p></p><p>The rich tea aroma intertwined with the wind and steam flowing through the hall.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's eyes were downcast, even with a hint of ferocity. Guo Zhan had died... He had suffered a grave injury, his divine nature knocked down, plummeting from the realm of "Cultivating the Spirit like a River."</p><p></p><p>This filled him with both anger and sorrow...</p><p></p><p>But this was not the worst of it. As if the heavens were raining down on a leaky roof, his elderly grandfather, in order to pursue the culprit for him, had gone to the mysterious temple outside the city, only to suffer a devastating blow, his divine foundation teetering on the verge of collapse. If he did not use his divine foundation's power in this lifetime, he could still eke out a few more years of life, still dominating the Fei Lei Clan. But once he did, he would undoubtedly perish.</p><p></p><p>Worst of all, the news of his grandfather's damaged divine foundation had already spread within Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>The Yang, Xu, An families, the imperial court... one by one, they were eyeing the Sima Clan, which was about to lose its patriarch, like a juicy, fragrant roast.</p><p></p><p>"The divine cultivator who attacked me, the Fourth-Rank 'Wrathful Prince,' could not have come from Fei Lei City. Most likely, he was from the Divine Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the days, in about a year, the Divine Sect will send people to recruit spirit children. But with the changes in the Spirit Infant Academy and the mysterious temple, the Divine Sect must have noticed something and sent people earlier than usual."</p><p></p><p>"Fei Lei City is, after all, just a small city. The [Grieving Demon-Subduing] technique I cultivate is the best divine art in Fei Lei City, but it's only at the Nine-Star level. Compared to the Fourth-Rank... the gap is too vast, far too vast..."</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai clenched his fist. Although he was furious, tears kept flowing uncontrollably from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>There was a time when he had forced Zhao Chuanxiong to be the bait, to lure in that Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was as if the wheel of karma had turned, and he too was being forced to be the bait...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Simo Bai also began to understand Zhao Chuanxiong's feelings a little.</p><p></p><p>Being the bait... there was always the risk of being devoured.</p><p></p><p>That kind of suspending one's life on a hook, walking the line between life and death...</p><p></p><p>It truly tested one's mental state and courage.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai forced himself to calm down, but when he picked up the exquisite tea that the beautiful courtesan had personally poured for him, his trembling fingers betrayed his inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The curtain rose and fell...</p><p></p><p>Rose and fell again.</p><p></p><p>But when it rose once more, he saw one figure after another, wearing masks, appear around the Golden Pavilion, their powerful divine auras bursting forth from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Some had sword lights swirling, stirring up thoughts, some had towering fury like a Buddha, some had a terrifying presence like an armored deity.</p><p></p><p>They wore all kinds of masks, tigers, leopards, goats...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of the uproar caused by the Ox Demon's cute ox-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Making those who lurked in the shadows of Fei Lei City and committed acts of violence now habitually wear masks.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai looked at these people, his hand no longer trembling, but with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Hele, An Ruosu, Yang Kaihe... Do you think just by wearing masks, I won't know who you are?"</p><p></p><p>"Your divine auras, even if you turn to ash, I would still recognize them. Wearing masks is nothing but self-deception."</p><p></p><p>"Since you dare to come and encroach on my Sima Clan, why not do it openly?"</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai said coldly.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how he rebuked and questioned them, only his own voice echoed in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>No one answered him.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's gaze flashed with a sharp edge, and the next moment, nine palm-sized Grieving Infant wooden figurines slid out from his sleeve pocket. With a flick of his hand, they floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come... then all of you, go to your deaths!"</p><p></p><p>And in the instant he flung out the nine Infant wooden figurines,</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's white robes billowed as he plummeted downwards into the rain curtain, his divine aura bursting forth as he executed a divine secret art, his entire being seemingly melting into a tear sliding down a cheek, fleeing swiftly out of the Golden Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai now had only one thought: Escape! The bait must also save itself!</p><p></p><p>Let the two core disciples and the nine Infant spirits entangle them.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to flee for his life!</p><p></p><p>The Sima Clan is doomed...</p><p></p><p>And he just needs to take his elderly grandfather and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shattered fragments of the Ancestral Divine Essence have escaped the inner city and arrived at the outer city, ready to make contact with the arranged Spiritual Infant Sect...</p><p></p><p>The Si family now has a chance to rise again! He can live!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chaos erupted in the Golden Radiance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine energy waves were emanating from within, and four enormous, millstone-like illusory shadows appeared in the sky...</p><p></p><p>The raindrops seemed to be frozen, unable to fall.</p><p></p><p>It was as if four divine beings were clashing in the high heavens, the four millstone-like shadows as bright as the sun in the sky, dispersing the darkness, shining exceptionally bright in the minds of the people. The ordinary people inside the Golden Radiance Pavilion were all afflicted, their emotions stirred up, fluctuating wildly, some crying, some laughing, some angry... tormented in countless ways, uncontrollable, like devout believers manipulated by the seven emotions.</p><p></p><p>After the intense emotional turbulence, they started bleeding from the mouth and nose, fainting.</p><p></p><p>The unlucky ones died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The divine essence cultivators' battle, the ordinary people... were the ones who suffered the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Raindrops the size of soybeans fell on the bluestone path, making a continuous "pitter-patter" sound.</p><p></p><p>The chaos in the Golden Radiance Pavilion lasted for an unknown duration, just like this sudden thunderstorm, accompanied by rumbling, washing down in a drizzle, showing no signs of stopping, but rather growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a rain hat, stood in a dark alley, letting the rain wash over him.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at the Golden Radiance Pavilion, observing the battle of the divine essences from afar, his heart slightly heavy...</p><p></p><p>The divine essence cultivators were truly powerful, their divine control overwhelming the will of those below them, crushing them absolutely.</p><p></p><p>No wonder once they attain the divine essence, their status in the city becomes supreme, able to establish a powerful clan.</p><p></p><p>The divine essence cultivators' mastery of the divine energy particles permeating the heavens and earth is far beyond imagination, their every move possessing unfathomable might.</p><p></p><p>Even the blood-transforming warriors, to use a vivid description, are like ants.</p><p></p><p>In such a battle... Li Che did not choose to enter the Golden Radiance Pavilion, but rather lay in wait outside, observing the situation.</p><p></p><p>The location he chose to hide was the path from the inner city to the outer city. If Simo Bai managed to escape alive, this would be his inevitable route.</p><p></p><p>If he is not dead, Simo Bai must pass through here to leave the city...</p><p></p><p>Li Che would be able to observe the situation and selectively intervene.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The "Untainted Heart" in Li Che's chest suddenly started pounding, sensing the intense divine energy waves sweeping through, carrying wails of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The "Wrathful Weeping Demon-Subduing" divine energy! Li Che narrowed his eyes, his entire body's qi and blood becoming even more restrained, but his gaze was like lightning, observing intently, his heart filled with doubt...</p><p></p><p>Soon, he noticed a barely perceptible water bulge on the ground, condensing an extremely potent "Wrathful Weeping" divine energy, rushing down the long street at an extremely fast speed!</p><p></p><p>If not for the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit's sensitivity to divine energies and its ability to detect them...</p><p></p><p>Li Che would never have noticed it!</p><p></p><p>Someone has escaped!</p><p></p><p>Fleeing by merging into the water... such a bizarre technique, it must be a divine energy cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Who is it?</p><p></p><p>The one needing to escape at this critical juncture, carrying such intense "Wrathful Weeping Demon-Subduing" divine energy...</p><p></p><p>It must be Simo Bai! Is it him? Regardless of whether it is him or not... the one needing to escape at this critical moment, Li Che will not let him go!</p><p></p><p>Better to kill the wrong person than to let him go! Li Che felt the entire world grow silent, the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" in his chest pounding thunderously. With his Six Cycles Blood Transformation Technique perfected, his qi and blood surged upwards!</p><p></p><p>In a snap of the fingers!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's concealed and hidden aura instantly tore apart, his jet-black hair wildly dancing, his thin and wiry body suddenly swelling, growing taller! Nine large tendons trembled like an enraged dragon, the tiger-like roars of his bones and joints incessant!</p><p></p><p>His stretchy clothes instantly inflated, every exposed inch of his skin seeming to glow, revealing the dark blue veins beneath the skin! His eyes burned like two great suns!</p><p></p><p>Like an enraged divine or Buddha! </p><p></p><p>The second shackle opened! Wrathful Gaze Vajra!</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p><p></p><p>The pouring rain was instantly evaporated by the surging hot blood!</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the Ox Mask and covered his face...</p><p></p><p>His aura instantly became like a reclining divine or Buddha, rising up in an instant, his spirit soaring to the heavens! Then, he took a heavy step! The pooled water in the alley first remained silent, but after Li Che swiftly dashed out, the thick water on the bluestone ground was violently swept up, rising nine feet high!</p><p></p><p>Thunderous roars shook the dark clouds in the sky!</p><p></p><p>When the thunder faded!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already appeared above the glowing divine energy sphere, hidden within the deep water of the long street, like a swimming fish.</p><p></p><p>His towering 7-foot-2 figure, smashing through the wind and rain, the two eyes behind the Ox Mask coldly and mercilessly looking down, his raised foot, radiating the rampant blood energy and inner strength...</p><p></p><p>Came crashing down!</p>

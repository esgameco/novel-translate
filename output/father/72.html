        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gloomy sky was like the arrival of night, making one feel an overwhelming sense of oppression and confinement.</p><p></p><p>Thunderclaps tore through the night sky, the sudden flashes of light dispelling some of the darkness, but the mist shrouded the entire Flashing Thunder City, resulting in extremely poor visibility.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Tall walls stood erect, and the security guards responsible for protection sought shelter from the rain.</p><p></p><p>They clutched their weapons, leaning against the doorway, listening to the rain pounding furiously on the black tiles, the shattering sound of the splashing water causing them to drift into a daze.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Yang Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery was breached and the spiritual children were taken away, the Xu Family and An Family had strengthened the security of the spiritual monastery, increasing the number of patrolling guards.</p><p></p><p>The rain was truly too heavy. </p><p></p><p>It was still early winter, yet such a violent thunderstorm was a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>The already cold temperature, combined with the icy rain, had become bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>"This damned weather, it's as if the gods are furious," grumbled a burly guard, leaning against the door, casting a glance at the gloomy sky.</p><p></p><p>As a blood-refined guard, his qi and blood were robust, so he was not afraid of the bitter cold, but being uncomfortable was a different matter.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let your guard down, in weather like this, it's the best time for those with ill intentions to make their move..." murmured an old guard puffing on a pipe, who was at the blood-refined stage and had undergone the sixth blood refinement, while the other guards were at the tempering-bone stage.</p><p></p><p>This lineup of guards clearly showed how much the An Family valued the spiritual monastery.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, you're too cautious, the An Family is a prominent clan in Flashing Thunder City, who would dare to attack the spiritual monastery?" several of the tempering-bone guards chuckled in succession.</p><p></p><p>"The Yang Family didn't have our level of protection back then..."</p><p></p><p>However, before they could finish speaking, the dense rain curtain was suddenly torn open...</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a howling gale, the shattering sound of shredding air! Massive hammers came crashing down! A surge of powerful spiritual energy caused the guards to be stunned, but in that moment of bewilderment, their minds were seized, and the hammers smashed into their heads, spraying white and red blood! The blood-refined guard puffing on the pipe, his eyes widening with fury, grabbed a long saber and sprang up!</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual energy! [Startled Shock Fierce]! The Yang Family?!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you, Yang Family people?!"</p><p></p><p>The old guard roared.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant, a burly figure tore through the rain curtain, accompanied by a whimpering scream-like sound, swinging a massive hammer down with a crushing blow.</p><p></p><p>The unstoppable force directly shattered the head of the blood-refined old guard.</p><p></p><p>"Attack."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dense bloodiness,</p><p></p><p>the burly figure wearing a masked face of a startled child spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Several figures emerged from the corpses, grabbing the dripping bloody hammers, and rushed into the rain curtain towards the spiritual monastery.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain thundered, causing the eaves to hang with beaded curtains.</p><p></p><p>Granny Shu leaned on her python-headed cane, sitting in a rattan chair, the swirling steam and the fragrant tea drifting in her nostrils as she carefully poured milk into her teacup. </p><p></p><p>Adding milk to tea was a method taught to her by an acquaintance, and she quite enjoyed the unique flavor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of her acquaintance, Granny Shu's gaze unconsciously fell on the large-headed boy quietly seated in the fragrant room, cultivating his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"My grandson has grown so much..." Granny Shu sighed, the past swept away by the wind, and she herself had grown old and withered.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi, focus on your meditation, cultivate your spiritual energy!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Granny Shu's face hardened, and she brought her python-headed cane down firmly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This caused the half-opened-eyed Nuanxi, who was sneaking a glance at her milk tea, to jump in fright and quickly close her eyes, pretending to be earnest.</p><p></p><p>Granny Shu felt a bit helpless. This Li Nuanxi, with her exceptionally powerful spiritual energy, was a superb cultivation talent. </p><p></p><p>It's just that her temperament was too lively - at only three years old, she was more agile than many children four or five years older.</p><p></p><p>"How did the refined and cultured Master Li give birth to a daughter so... impulsive," Granny Shu couldn't help but use the word "impulsive" to describe her.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Lu Chi, which child in the spiritual monastery hadn't been beaten by Nuanxi? </p><p></p><p>Even four or five-year-old boys stood no chance against the three-year-old Nuanxi... she was a natural combat prodigy, using her brain to fight.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual combat saint from birth!</p><p>The hegemon of the spiritual monastery! </p><p>Next to Nuanxi, Lu Chi also had his eyes closed, but suddenly he opened his eyes, his braided Nezha hairstyle swinging as he turned his head to the side, towards the warm room heated by the charcoal stove outside.</p><p></p><p>There was a scent of blood...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"And... a divine energy fluctuation!" Lü Chi frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma Su! Lü Chi has opened his eyes! You should scold him quickly!" </p><p></p><p>A child from the Xu family exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi rolled his eyes. These little brats were really immature. He, Lü Chi, was a genius disciple who had entered the inner sect of the Qianyuan Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for protecting his little junior sister who had not yet married...</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi would not be bothered to stay here.</p><p></p><p>"Lü Chi, quickly close your eyes, or Grandma Su will hit you!"</p><p></p><p>"How childish." Lü Chi sneered. However, as soon as he finished speaking, Lü Chi regretted it.</p><p></p><p>"Lü Chi! How dare you call me childish! I'm going to tell my father!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, Lü Chi saw Xixi beside him, hands on her hips, glaring at him with a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the meditation class about to descend into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su grabbed the rattan-headed cane and stomped it down repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to open her mouth to reprimand and restore order...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the wrinkled face showed a slight change in expression.</p><p></p><p>"Children! Get up and hide in the inner room!"</p><p></p><p>"Lü Chi, you lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su's expression became solemn, her divine energy spreading to suppress the restless classroom.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in the grandmother's attitude scared the children, who did not dare to say more, and followed Lü Chi to the inner room.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, is there a monster coming to catch us?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi turned her head to look at Grandma Su before leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Grandma is here..."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>Xixi also smiled brightly: "Then Grandma must be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Then, Xixi followed Lü Chi into the inner room.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su was stunned, but the next moment, a smile bloomed on her old face, warming her heart.</p><p></p><p>The old woman stood up and turned the rattan chair towards the continuous heavy rain. The rainwater splashed on the ground, and the gusts of wind blew in from outside.</p><p></p><p>Blowing through the old woman's withered hair.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the white mist rising from the rain curtain, outlining the burly figures holding iron hammers.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic divine energies, filled with shrieks and screams, disturbing the heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>The old woman sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"[Shocked and Fierce], the Yang family..."</p><p></p><p>When the Yang family's divine cultivators could release their divine energies so unscrupulously in the Xu family's divine cultivation institute, but the Xu Heli, Xu Beihu, and the old Xu family matriarch were nowhere to be seen...</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su already understood.</p><p></p><p>"The great families are indeed great families. Even after so many years, they still cannot change their essence of sacrificing everything for the pursuit of interests... It's really... sickening."</p><p></p><p>"These... are just children, how could they bear it?"</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Xixi's bright and lovely smile.</p><p></p><p>The grandmother's eyes softened a bit.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's rattan-headed cane suddenly twisted, and the next moment, a sharp long sword was drawn out from the cane with a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the rain curtain, endless sword qi raged and intertwined! Weaving into a sword qi python, rushing towards the Yang family's divine cultivators wielding their hammers.</p><p></p><p>"Children, Grandma is here..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who was coiled around the three-eyed furious true lord spirit child statue, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His body flickered and fell off the altar.</p><p></p><p>Under the bovine mask, his eyes were ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>In his chest...</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Sage] Dao fruit was pounding violently.</p><p></p><p>As if a chess piece had been dropped, about to be captured.</p><p></p><p>The pure divine energy chess piece he had hidden in Xixi's body immediately reacted upon sensing the crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Something happened to Xixi... Who dares to touch my daughter?!"</p><p></p><p>Fierce and murderous aura instantly spread from every pore of Li Che, causing the many red candles in the mysterious temple to sway.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, his spiritual sense focused on the violently trembling pure divine energy chess piece anchor.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his empty palm.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the white chess piece left in Xixi's body was firmly grasped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>In this world, Li Che's goal was simple - his wife and children.</p><p></p><p>His wife and children were the soft spots in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Whoever dares to touch his daughter...</p><p></p><p>He will kill them! The Ox Demon... is about to unleash his killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, seeking monthly votes, and recommendation votes to support!

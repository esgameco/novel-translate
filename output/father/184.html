            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down with a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>The sky was gloomy and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>The carriage raced through the wind and rain, but the old man felt a sense of oppression, as if a divine being was seated in the clouds, overlooking the world and observing the entire manor city.</p><p></p><p>The old man was well aware that this was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, the fact that it could give him this feeling of being observed meant that the person's power was...truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>At least at the level of a Sage Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"The Sage Realm cultivator in the Golden Light Manor City now..."</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>"The shadow that follows beside Prince Ji Hai?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps Lü Yao from the Celestial Observatory?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that little brat Wang Kuyu...no, he doesn't have the guts."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The old man formed a few hand seals, slowly sealing the flickering golden light wheel.</p><p></p><p>His withered, thousand-year-old fingers, like hooks, gently covered the golden light wheel, and the sparks instantly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only a faint wisp of smoke remained, drifting out of the carriage as the curtain fell.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...a Sage Realm cultivator from the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Bringing the four divine weapons - the Prison Lotus, Wind Fire, and Golden Light Wheel - to the Golden Light Manor City was definitely not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect has been quite active lately...both in the Dao City and in the Golden Light Manor City."</p><p></p><p>"However, on my way here, the evil ones from the Corpse God Sect have been very low-key, and I haven't detected a trace of the aura of death and corpses."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect...has actually learned to be low-key?"</p><p></p><p>The old man muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Outside the carriage, the coachman suddenly whipped the reins, and the air was torn apart with a deafening crack.</p><p></p><p>The carriage then shot forward like a sharp blade, cutting through the dark night and the rain curtain!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardianship Office.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing, dressed in his official uniform with a saber at his waist, stood quietly in the rain, accompanied by the supervisors, chief constables, and constables guarding the manor city.</p><p></p><p>The other high-ranking Temple Guardianship Office members had been dispatched to guard the other mysterious temples.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing stood with his hands at his sides, a hint of excitement flickering in his eyes, for he knew in advance who the great master coming to the Golden Light Manor City was.</p><p></p><p>It was his former superior officer from when he trained in the Dao City, whom he had not seen in many years.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a carriage slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>The speed was not fast, but as the wheels rolled over the puddles, they kicked up a curtain of water.</p><p></p><p>Even from afar, it felt as if a mighty, ferocious beast was hidden within the carriage, containing an extremely terrifying and boiling power!</p><p></p><p>"Little Jing."</p><p></p><p>The curtain was pulled back, and the burly figure of Zhu Chaoyang emerged, his overwhelming and scorching aura instantly freezing the wind and rain around him!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's eyes were bright and piercing, his body robust, his hair vigorous, his temples pulsing, his vital energy surging.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out, the majestic aura of a great master nearly suffocated everyone present.</p><p></p><p>A towering martial will, like a blazing sun in the sky! The countless water vapor seemed to be instantly evaporated!</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardianship Office members quickly gripped their sabers and saluted.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang raised his hand to gesture for them to stop.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only a supervisor in the Dao City Temple Guardianship Office, his status was higher than the chief constable of the local manor city.</p><p></p><p>Both in terms of strength and position.</p><p></p><p>"No need for such formalities."</p><p></p><p>"I have escorted the Elder of the Divine Sect from the Dao City, and now that we have arrived at the manor city, I naturally need to stop by the Temple Guardianship Office."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang explained briefly.</p><p></p><p>Then, from the carriage, a small child wearing a red belly band and with only a tuft of hair tied up on his head emerged.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's gaze swept over him, and his heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Zhu Chaoyang's personal escort to the Golden Light Manor City this time had another task besides assisting in the escort of the Elder of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was to also escort this child...</p><p></p><p>The divine prodigy from the thousand-year-old family of the Iron Clan in the Divine Capital! Rumored to have the Violet Qi talent, reaching thousands of feet! He had great confidence in the upcoming Temple God Resonance event for the four divine temples.</p><p></p><p>"Little Iron Head, come and greet the members of the Temple Guardianship Office."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me Little Iron Head, I have a name, it's Iron Shancai!"</p><p></p><p>Iron Shancai was quite displeased, already learning to roll his eyes at a young age, all because of the pressure of society.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Iron Head sounds better."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang bared his teeth in a grin.</p><p></p><p>"My mother pleaded with the Grand Supervisor, and the Grand Supervisor's divination said that there is a divine weapon in this mysterious temple that is suitable for me! That's why I'm here, to obtain that divine spear - the Purple Flame Snake Spear and Fire Tip Spear of the Four Guardians!"</p><p></p><p>"I only want that divine spear!"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to compete with me, I'll burn them!"</p><p></p><p>Iron Shancai clenched his little fists, and flames were burning from his mouth, nose, and eyes, in three different colors!</p><p></p><p>The falling raindrops were instantly evaporated with a "sizzling" sound.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing quietly observed the tyrannical Iron Shancai, his heart slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater had not even reached Iron Shancai's body before it was vaporized into steam.</p><p></p><p>Although it was raining, Iron Shancai seemed to be surrounded by an invisible cloak of flames.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at him, Xie Jing felt a sense of panic and dread! In his mind, a name surfaced.</p><p></p><p>"The divine fire among the heavenly and earthly spiritual beings?!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Iron Shancai, Xie Jing dared not underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops were sizzling and evaporating, as if there was a circle of invisible fiery garments around Iron Shancai.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be the embodiment of primordial fire!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang smiled: "Do as you please..."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Four Guardian divine weapons are not that easy to master. I think you should first obtain the temple god's inheritance before anything else."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang said, then looked at Xie Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jing, it seems you haven't fallen behind in your cultivation these years, not bad..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang patted Xie Jing's shoulder, his gaze very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the praise from his senior, Xie Jing couldn't help but smile, stepping aside to make way for Zhu Chaoyang and Iron Shancai to enter the Temple Guardianship Office.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Temple Guardianship Office building.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang stood with his hands behind his back, his brow furrowed as he sniffed the air.</p><p></p><p>"There is a scattered and fragmented martial will permeating the air, as well as the aura of a Sage Realm cultivator's golden core..."</p><p></p><p>"What has happened in the Golden Light Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang asked.</p><p></p><p>As a great master who had refined eighteen divine spirit techniques, belonging to the Sage Realm, his strength was far beyond that of Xue Dubi.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing did not hide anything, and explained the enmity between the Underworld and Prince Ji Haihui, as well as the Hunting God Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld? What kind of powerful thing is that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang listened and his eyes flashed with sharp light.</p><p></p><p>"First kill the great master, then the Sage Realm cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>"It has some potential."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang laughed.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple God Resonance event is about to begin, and all kinds of monsters and demons have come out..."</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God Pavilion, the Corpse God Sect, Prince Ji Haihui... and now the Underworld too."</p><p></p><p>"It's a turbulent time."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang sighed, this trip was not as simple as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully, there won't be too many twists and turns.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly retracted the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>His gaze opened and closed, the wind and waves roaring, making his black robe flutter.</p><p></p><p>"The powerful cultivator from the Divine Sect is deeply unfathomable, far beyond the Sage Realm cultivator I just killed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Although he only caught a fleeting glimpse through the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, the opponent's powerful spiritual sense had vaguely detected his prying.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this Elder from the Divine Sect who had come was most likely a cultivator who had reached the pinnacle of spiritual refinement, and might even have stepped into the Sage Realm, achieving the "Golden Body Shedding".</p><p></p><p>A Sage Realm cultivator who has completed the "Golden Body Shedding" might not even be destroyed by a volley of his Heaven-Shaking Raven Avalanche Cannons.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand shots might not be enough, but ten thousand shots... should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>However, even one thousand shots of the Heaven-Shaking Raven Avalanche Cannons would already drain his furnace's blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand shots...</p><p></p><p>After this ten thousand shot barrage, even the Ox Demon might be reduced to beef jerky!</p><p></p><p>The Wrathful Blaze Serpent Mechanical Cannon... is related to one's blood qi.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the cultivator's own strength, the longer they can sustain the cannon's fire.</p><p></p><p>"If I break through to the Great Master realm... I should be able to fire ten thousand shots."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched, his bones and muscles creaking.</p><p></p><p>Li Che never overestimated his own cultivation, always subconsciously lowering it by one level.</p><p></p><p>For example, now with the Furnace Sect Master's physique, against an ordinary late-stage Sect Master, he could even kill them in three moves.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che still felt that he would have to go all out to kill the opponent.</p><p></p><p>This was a cautious approach to the world, respecting the enemy. What if the enemy had a hidden trump card? By treating the opponent as if they had a trump card, one would not be caught off guard if they did use it.</p><p></p><p>One would not easily be ambushed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che flicked his finger, extinguishing the boiling charcoal furnace, and the water for brewing tea gradually stopped boiling.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect Elder has arrived, and the Temple God Resonance event is about to begin in the next few days. After a brief rest, I should start preparing..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rotated his neck, the terrifying blood qi in his body seemed to roar like a sea serpent in his acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"I should give Xixia some special training, and also fulfill my promise."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this little Prince might think I'm just the Underworld Monkey, only good at talking big."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, putting on his Ox Demon attire, his figure towering like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>He went into the room and grabbed the soundly sleeping Xixia, directly transporting her to the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Ape Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they arrived at the Mysterious Temple...</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear and Fire Tip Spear in Xixia's arms seemed to be stimulated, and the purple flames instantly burst out!</p><p></p><p>This person... has come again! To beat the snake again! Boom boom boom! The temperature of the purple flames soared, and the air in the entire Mysterious Temple became scorching, as if it was distorting.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—!!!"</p><p></p><p>The purple dragon snake opened its mouth and let out a roar, as if invisible sound waves were exploding in the void.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Demon mask, the corners of Li Che's lips curled up, his flesh and blood suddenly growing taller, his five fingers clenching...</p><p></p><p>Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Burst Open!</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear instantly appeared in his hand, the blood qi shrouding the spear, and the ferocious blood vessels seemed to spread across it, making the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear appear even thicker.</p><p></p><p>Gripping it with one hand, he swung it out with force! While helping Xixia complete the fusion of the divine weapon, he could also temper his own martial arts...</p><p></p><p>Perfect! The shadow of the club burst open, and with each shake, it was like a peacock spreading its tail! The purple dragon snake was instantly blown apart, scattering countless purple flames.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit in his chest cavity trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint Absolute Skill he had just obtained, the "Soaring Void Eight Extremes Steps", suddenly appeared in Li Che's mind. Taking a step forward, the space seemed to twist for a moment, and Li Che's figure was instantly pulled into a trail of afterimages, overlapping and finally converging.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Cloud Pheasant Stepping on Clouds, this footwork was far more powerful and exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly, practicing various Martial Saint Absolute Skills while cultivating the Soaring Void Eight Extremes Steps.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was sleeping, and Li Che was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Only the purple flame dragon snake from the Purple Flame Snake Spear and Fire Tip Spear... was being beaten.</p><p></p><p>And in the process of being beaten, the Purple Flame Snake Spear and Fire Tip Spear vibrated incessantly, releasing more and more flames, further enhancing the fusion and tempering of Xixia's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>And this...</p><p></p><p>was the effect Li Che wanted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also knew that for the four-year-old Xixia to completely master this Four Guardian divine weapon was basically impossible.</p><p></p><p>But, to give his daughter a little more foundation for the upcoming "Temple God Resonance" trial, which was full of danger, would be enough.</p><p></p><p>This was a simple and sincere wish of a father.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were fierce, and the surging waters of the Nine Dragon River seemed to be boiling, the rolling hot waves rushing into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Melting the accumulated thick snow, turning it into a torrential downpour!</p><p></p><p>Pounding, pounding, pounding—</p><p></p><p>The sound of the rain falling was extremely violent, and there seemed to be flashes of lightning behind the clouds!</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Divine Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>The rain water rolled down the blue stone steps like a waterfall, splashing and exploding, like a white dragon.</p><p></p><p>The horses stopped, their nostrils huffing out scorching hot air, their hooves lifting and falling, spraying water in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo, Wang Kuyu, Zhang Qingzheng, Li Qingshan, Zhu Hongdou, and Weng Wuyu, six people stood at the entrance of the mountain gate, quietly looking towards the carriage.</p><p></p><p>They were wearing straw hats, parting the rain.</p><p></p><p>The coachman pulled the reins, the thick veins on his muscular arms bulging. </p><p></p><p>He then respectfully lifted the curtain, opened an oiled paper umbrella, and leaned forward as he held the umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>An old man in simple, ancient clothing,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>The old man was very thin, withered like an old dried-up tree, holding a golden wheel in his palm, and the other hand was constantly making hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo and Wang Kuyu's gaze fell on this old man, slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they did not expect the visitor to be this elder.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiao, I didn't expect it would be you responsible for escorting the Four Divine Armaments this time..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo spoke first.</p><p></p><p>The old man got down from the carriage, with a faint smile on his withered face.</p><p></p><p>"This old body of mine is about to return to the earth, and being able to do a bit more for the sect is not easy."</p><p></p><p>The old man chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>This old man was Jiao Shaoquiu, the outer gate elder of the Orthodox Qianyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Orthodox Qianyuan Sect was also divided into inner gate, outer gate, and core disciples.</p><p></p><p>The outer gate elder's status was not much weaker than the core elders of the inner gate, only their cultivation was not high enough.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo had once cultivated under the guidance of this old man, knowing some of the sect's secrets.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu had actually broken through to the Golden Body Realm in his early years and entered the core elder position, but unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>During an expedition to the mysterious temple of the Six Offices, he suffered a heavy blow, his Golden Body was shattered, and he fell back to the Origin Spirit Realm, and his cultivation has been stagnant since then.</p><p></p><p>Everyone thought this elder was about to retire, but unexpectedly, he was the one dispatched for this important matter.</p><p></p><p>"What? Do you look down on this old man's bones?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu seemed to have read the thoughts of Nan Liehuo and Wang Kuyu and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"You two young fellows, I used to guide you, and now you start to look down on this old man."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo and Wang Kuyu were suddenly flustered and hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu, holding the sealed golden wheel in his hand, smiled and said, "Let's go to the Divine Hall, use the Heavenly King Tower to suppress this wheel, otherwise this old body of mine will be tormented by it."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo hurriedly led the way.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at the Golden Peak and stepped into the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo personally activated the Heavenly King Tower, pouring down its radiance.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus Firestorm Golden Wheel encountered the Heavenly King Tower, initially erupting with towering flames, but both were incomplete Divine Armaments.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King Tower did not yield to it, directly shooting out, pouring down countless golden rays, firmly sealing the wheel in the air of the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu shook his hand and exhaled a breath, stepping back.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I've put down this wheel."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo introduced Li Qingshan and the others to Jiao Shaoquiu.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan... a renowned figure in the Cloud State Spiritual Genealogy? I heard you have stepped into the Divine Appearance Realm? Not bad..."</p><p></p><p>"Your foundation is solid, the Thunder Annihilation Divine Appearance has great potential, breaking through the Six Offices Divine Appearance... comparable to the ordinary Divine Appearance Realm."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu nodded approvingly, appreciatively examining Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of Li Qingshan's name, and although he was in the Dao City, those who could leave their names on the state genealogy were still quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the Divine Appearance Realm with the Six Offices Divine Appearance, in the Dao City, he could also squeeze into the top hundred of the Divine Appearance Ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, your martial dao is also not bad... there is a chance for you to step into the Great Grandmaster realm."</p><p></p><p>"How about going to the Dao City for development? There, you should find it easier to become a Great Grandmaster."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu asked kindly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was stunned, but did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Go to the Dao City?</p><p></p><p>It's not impossible.</p><p></p><p>But he was a bit reluctant to leave the Golden Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo seemed to see through his thoughts and smiled, "Li Qingshan, you can consider it... if you can establish a foothold in the Orthodox Qianyuan Sect, then our Golden Light Sect will also have someone in the Orthodox Sect."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu shook his head, and Nan Liehuo supported him.</p><p></p><p>Later, Jiao Shaoquiu thought of that fleeting illusion of a divine being watching from the sky.</p><p></p><p>He then inquired about whether any powerful experts had recently appeared in the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo did not hide anything, revealing the Divine Realm cultivators and Great Grandmasters who had recently appeared in the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He also mentioned the deaths of Xue Dufu and the Hunting God Pavilion Master, and their elimination.</p><p></p><p>"Infernal Fiends from the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld?</p><p></p><p>Even after living for so many years, traveling through countless mountains and rivers, with his vast experience, he had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's not talk about this..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard your Golden Light Sect has taken in a Celestial Child prodigy? I'll take a good look at this child genius tomorrow and see if there is any divine affinity."</p><p></p><p>"This year's Temple Spirit Resonance competition is too fierce, your Golden Light Sect may only have this child prodigy to rely on."</p><p></p><p>"In previous years, the Temple Spirit Resonance was only a competition among the finest spiritual children, but this year, even the Divine Realm's child prodigies have come."</p><p></p><p>"Your sect may be guarding a treasure mountain, but end up with nothing."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>But he smiled and said, "Elder Jiao, that may not necessarily be the case."</p><p></p><p>"That girl... is quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue took Xixie back to the house and then went to the study, grasping the Six Offices Spiritual Essence Crystal to cultivate the Immaculate Heart.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Early morning.</p><p></p><p>After raining all night, it finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>The dawn light broke through.</p><p></p><p>On the ancient trees in the mountains, crystal clear water droplets hung on the leaves.</p><p></p><p>In the study, Li Yue finished his night of tranquil cultivation and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immaculate Heart (LV3, 72%)]</p><p></p><p>One night of arduous cultivation had brought a 2% increase in maturity.</p><p></p><p>And this was while absorbing the Six Offices Spiritual Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue shook his head: "In the path of spiritual cultivation, my talent is indeed shallow."</p><p></p><p>"Even with the Spiritual Essence Crystal, the progress is so slow..."</p><p></p><p>But any progress is better than none.</p><p></p><p>If he can fully absorb the Six Offices Spiritual Essence Crystal, the Immaculate Heart should be able to reach LV4...</p><p></p><p>So, this is a matter of perseverance.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, without any special abilities, his talent is just average.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue has a clear understanding of himself.</p><p></p><p>He made breakfast and called his wife and daughter to eat, Old Chen also came to freeload.</p><p></p><p>During the meal, Li Yue gently snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, three white Immaculate Heart spiritual chess pieces floated in front of the three of them.</p><p></p><p>Xixie curiously looked at these spiritual chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, what are these? Can we eat them?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie blinked her big eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>"They are not for eating, these flying thunder chess pieces are hidden in your Nirvana Palace, so when you encounter danger, you can use them to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Just crush the chess piece, and you'll appear by my side."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue smiled and ruffled Xixie's head as he explained.</p><p></p><p>[Chess Grandmaster] The function of the Dao Fruit's second metamorphosis has also improved.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the flying thunder chess pieces could only be used by Li Yue, but now there are no such limitations.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who crushes the chess piece, Li Yue will sense it, and with a thought, he can teleport to their side.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue can also choose not to teleport, everything is within his control.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, hearing that they are not for eating, lost interest.</p><p></p><p>However, she obediently put away the chess piece, and it disappeared into her Nirvana Palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Old Chen did not ask much, they had complete trust in Li Yue.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast, Li Yue carried Xixie and went to the Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived at the Golden Peak, Li Yue felt something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's senior sister Sang Guanyin was already waiting there, and when she saw Li Yue and Xixie, she led them to the large platform in front of the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue saw that the children had almost all gathered there.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Divine Hall, a grand chair was placed, and an old man in plain clothes was seated there.</p><p></p><p>Little Fatty Zhou Peng and Yun'e were chatting animatedly with the old man, obviously quite familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiao, the child prodigy of my Golden Light Sect has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu immediately raised his purple-tinged eyes and looked over.</p><p></p><p>But his gaze was attracted by Li Yue holding Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Because in Jiao Shaoquiu's eyes, there was a towering pillar of purple spiritual energy surging from Li Yue's body...</p><p></p><p>Rising into the clouds, like a purple dragon undulating its body and roaring.</p><p></p><p>The old man was stunned, did his eyes deceive him?</p><p></p><p>Such a big "child prodigy" actually has innate purple spiritual energy? What kind of nourishment did he take to be this good?</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Li Qingshan saw that Elder Jiao was staring at Li Yue instead of Xixie, and the corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>Right, it's not his fault that his spiritual perception was blurred before, is it?</p><p></p><p>This guy... a twenty-three-year-old child prodigy! Even Elder Jiao was fooled!</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu's gaze flickered, and after a moment, he looked at the Xixie in Li Yue's arms.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, the old man's brows raised, quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not see the exact height of Xixie's innate purple spiritual energy, it must have reached thousands of feet! The old man was also amazed...</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of feet of purple spiritual energy... the Golden Light Prefecture has actually produced such a child prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue knew that Xixie's initial spiritual energy was not that high, mainly due to the generous gift from the young prince Shi Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, come to Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu waved his hand warmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue put down Xixie, and she did not resist, pattering over.</p><p></p><p>Pursing her lips, raising her chubby cheeks, her lively eyes sparkling with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The old man reached out and gently tapped on several points of Xixie's body.</p><p></p><p>This was bone-touching divination.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes couldn't help but reveal some shock.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xixie with a sense of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even his unperturbed inner mind was rippling with waves.</p><p></p><p>This constitution...</p><p></p><p>How could it be so good?! A four-year-old girl... her physical body is not weaker than a Grandmaster warrior! Such a constitution, it is...</p><p></p><p>A Martial Body!</p><p></p><p>An innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body! Impossible...</p><p></p><p>An innate thousands of feet child prodigy, and an innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body...</p><p></p><p>They actually appear on the same girl?</p><p></p><p>If it were just an innate thousands of feet child prodigy, it could still be understood, after all, in the Four Mysterious Temple area, the spiritual energy diffusion has given birth to such divine children before.</p><p></p><p>These divine children are the blessed ones created by the environment.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>A treasure!</p><p></p><p>"An innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body..." </p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu exclaimed in admiration, looking at Nan Liehuo: "Liehuo, you're quite lucky."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo, hearing Jiao Shaoquiu's words, was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What? An innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body?! </p><p></p><p>Impossible! When he examined Xixie's martial talent before, it was good, but it did not reach the level of an innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body!</p><p></p><p>But Nan Liehuo would not doubt Jiao Shaoquiu, this elder would not lie to him.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo silently looked at Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Li Yue.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue was also stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>An innate Great Grandmaster Martial Body? His eyes couldn't help but flash with delight.</p><p></p><p>Refining the body through forging, it seems to have some effect after all.</p><p></p><p>This Fire Spear, it just needed a little push.</p><p></p><p>"A four-year-old child, changing every day, has infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo nodded, only then did he realize that Xixie's age was not too old, when he tested her three years ago, perhaps at that time, she was still developing?</p><p></p><p>But Xixie did not pay attention to the adults' guesses about her constitution. </p><p></p><p>She was leaning sideways, peeking and peering into the open doors of the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>That sealed Infernal Lotus Firestorm Golden Wheel.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance...</p><p></p><p>Completely captivated Xixie's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Elder, Master, that golden wheel seems to want to play with Xixie."</p><p></p><p>"Daddy! That golden wheel is tempting Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie said in her childish voice.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Xixie raised her chubby arm, her plump little fingers beckoning towards the golden wheel in the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquiu, Nan Liehuo, and Li Yue were stunned, and they couldn't help but look towards the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, their eyes shrank.</p><p></p><p>They saw...</p><p></p><p>That Infernal Lotus Firestorm Golden Wheel was spinning violently, as if it had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack crack! Countless sparks flew out!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Brilliant golden flames erupted on the golden wheel.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King Tower trembled.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Unable to continue suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>Causing the Infernal Lotus Firestorm Golden Wheel to fly towards Xixie at high speed, spinning with wind and fire!</p>

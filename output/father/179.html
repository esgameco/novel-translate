        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cat Face...</p><p></p><p>Ah, he called me Cat Face!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's hair and beard were flying, and the smile on his face could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This phrase was very familiar. When he was looking for Li Che to cause trouble, he had called Li Che the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Ox Demon was using the same words to tell him, let's cause trouble together! Li Qingshan was also very clear that he was different from the Ox Demon, and it might be difficult for him to reach the core of the Underworld. He only knew one Ox Demon, and it was by chance that he got to know him before the other party had grown up.</p><p></p><p>And Horse Face Li Qingshan could only contact the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that powerful Monkey King who could fight against great masters.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qingshan possessed the Underworld Deity Mirror, it was more of a tool for communicating with clients.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to enter the core of a power.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan didn't have high demands, he would just take it slowly.</p><p></p><p>"What great wealth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes, obviously in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>Although he had just broken through to the Divine Appearance realm, his combat power was not weak. Even if it was the Primordial Appearance realm, he could still fight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his martial cultivation had reached the level of a great master, and the supreme skill Eight Flood Dragons Overturning the River, had even broken through from the Five-Dao Qi and Blood Flood Dragon to the Six-Dao! The Six-Dao Qi and Blood Flood Dragon had already reached the level of a great master, giving birth to the supreme true essence.</p><p></p><p>He could use the true essence to wash his internal organs, refine the interior, achieve unparalleled internal and external toughness, without any flaws, and condense the divine might!</p><p></p><p>Assault the Great Master Realm! So, if there were enough battles, perhaps it could accelerate this understanding and breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were gloomy as he looked at Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Li Qingshan's words when he invited him, he couldn't help but have a sense of overturning the Heavenly Might.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head lightly, Li Che's gaze gradually solidified.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to kill the Young Prince?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che said softly.</p><p></p><p>However, the words fell on Li Qingshan's ears, like a thunderous roar, like a furious dragon wrapped in electricity rolling and roaring behind the clouds!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes couldn't help but shrink.</p><p></p><p>Kill the Young Prince Xie Haiwei?</p><p></p><p>Kill the son of Xie Mojie?! This matter...</p><p></p><p>It was indeed too stimulating!</p><p></p><p>But, besides being surprised, Li Qingshan was not too shocked. He narrowed his eyes: "Just like the Hunting God Pavilion? The Hunting God Pavilion also accepted the task of hunting down the Young Prince, and our Underworld also accepted this task?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan guessed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not explain, but smiled and said, "You can say that."</p><p></p><p>This Young Prince... Although he was beaten up by Xue, his heart was too vicious, actually planning to kill him and Zhang Ya, making Xue an orphan.</p><p></p><p>With such a cruel heart, he was not at all like a five-year-old child, Li Che did not need to show any mercy and treat him as a child.</p><p></p><p>"Not only do we have to kill Xie Haiwei, but also the six Black Armor Blood Guards around him, and that hidden... Divine Element Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Is this the Ox Demon? Holding grudges... Who said the Ox Demon was honest and upright? Li Qingshan was going to be in trouble with him! Is he playing this big?</p><p></p><p>He had just killed the great master Xue Dufei beside Xie Haiwei, and now he was targeting that Divine Element Immortal?</p><p></p><p>This is to try to bring spiritual torment to this Young Prince by continuously hunting down the protective forces around Xie Haiwei?</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>Try to challenge the Divine Element Immortal!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Element Immortal is stronger than the Divine Might Great Master in common sense, and his methods are more abundant and treacherous.</p><p></p><p>No one knows what terrifying secret techniques a Divine Element Immortal possesses.</p><p></p><p>Li Che left, taking Xue and Zhang Ya with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sat in the chair, looking out at the torrential rain, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>There was a long-lost fighting spirit burning in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>It seems that he is finally going to play with me!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo returned to the divine hall, quietly pacing.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain, this winter rain, seemed to be even more turbulent because of that exploding mushroom cloud firework.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops pounded on the tiles, constantly jumping and bursting.</p><p></p><p>The wind blowing through the hall struck the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the howling wind waves, Nan Lihuo's white hair was blown up restlessly.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the corner of his mouth also couldn't help but rise slightly.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the steps of the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>His palm flashed, and an old jar of wine appeared in his hand, which he knocked off the seal and started to drink wildly.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld and the Hunting God Pavilion both want to kill Xie Haiwei..."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the great master beside Xie Haiwei has died, leaving only one Divine Element Immortal to guard... the protective force has been greatly weakened."</p><p></p><p>"There is a chance..."</p><p></p><p>"There really is a chance..."</p><p></p><p>"And Su Huai!"</p><p></p><p>Splash splash...</p><p></p><p>The wine flowed into his mouth and down his neck.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's eyes, for some reason, turned slightly red.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Mojie..."</p><p></p><p>On Nan Lihuo's face, endless pain suddenly appeared, as if there were memories that drilled into his heart, frantically surging.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, the continuous winter rain finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>After the rain, the Golden Light Mansion was washed with a biting chill.</p><p></p><p>The water of the Nine Dragon River had become turbulent and surging, as if something terrifying was about to awaken from within.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature in the heaven and earth was becoming more and more dense, which was the unique divine nature scattered by the Four Mysterious Temples.</p><p></p><p>Oppressive and terrifying, it was as if scorching heat waves were surging up from the bottom of the river, and then surging up to the sky, completely melting the accumulated snow and turning it into rainwater.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew.</p><p></p><p>The scorching heat of the river water and the increasing density of the divine nature all meant that the day of the Temple God Resonance was constantly approaching.</p><p></p><p>The Correct Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind was rustling.</p><p></p><p>There was no snow, nor any rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in the courtyard, guiding Zhang Ya in her martial arts practice, which was a genuine guidance.</p><p></p><p>With the purification of the Untainted Heart Divine Nature, and Li Che's understanding of the Dao of Martial Arts, Zhang Ya's martial arts improvement was very fast, with obvious progress.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya also practiced seriously, obviously this assassination incident had truly stimulated her.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't want to be a burden, she must work hard to become stronger, at least to have the ability to protect herself, not to become a hindrance to her husband and daughter.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the divine nature and martial arts experience to Zhang Ya, Li Che went up the mountain to work.</p><p></p><p>Walking along the long street, the location of the Observation Pavilion had become a huge pit and ruins, and many workers were cleaning up the remains and rebuilding the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't care.</p><p></p><p>These days, the Young Prince Xie Haiwei had completely retreated to the City Lord's Mansion, not moving at all, as if he had really been frightened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che guessed that this Young Prince would probably remain like this until the Temple God Resonance Assembly was opened.</p><p></p><p>The turtle is really good at hiding its head.</p><p></p><p>However, the shock of a great master being killed did frighten this Young Prince.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Temple God Resonance Assembly...</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, as if there was a gentle wind flowing through the gaps between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The wind carried the roar of an angry child, deafening.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple's divine nature is becoming more and more dense... The divine nature is in turmoil, which means that the power of invasion will become stronger and more terrible..."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Abyss is about to open..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Time was approaching, even Li Che himself had some pressure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This may be the greatest opportunity for his daughter! After all, it involves a Four Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>While having great opportunities, it also comes with great danger! Although there is a Divine Ancestor holding the Four Mysterious Divine Weapons to pave the way, Li Che still has some worries and is concerned about Xue's safety.</p><p></p><p>However, sometimes this kind of worry is unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>His daughter must grow up, and his daughter's arm conceals the Fire Spear.</p><p></p><p>With this kind of proof, during the Temple God Resonance, she should have some advantages over other divine children, and should be safer as well.</p><p></p><p>His ink-black robe fluttered in the wind as Li Che arrived at the Cliff Observatory Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It was warm as spring inside.</p><p></p><p>There was a burning charcoal stove emitting heat waves.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was sitting on a chair cracking melon seeds, and when she saw Li Che, she greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che came to work every day, rain or shine.</p><p></p><p>As for Shangguan Qinghong, she simply had nowhere else to go.</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan family had long since declined, and the fact that she had assassinated her own father Shangguan Zhenghen was already known to everyone, so she couldn't go back to the Shangguan family, so she could only stay in the Observatory.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Che, do you think I have a chance to see the Horse Face of the Underworld? I want to become his disciple and learn his sniping skills!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, among the various figures in the Underworld, the Horse Face is the most mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Even when he strikes, it is always without a trace of his presence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused for a moment, smiled warmly, and said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Climbing to the second floor, he went to his own workshop, only to find that there were two people sitting there and drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>They were the Deputy Director of the Observatory in the Capital City, Lu Yao, and the Sect Master of the Divine Eagle Ridge, Tang Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, come."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia saw Li Che and his eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>That mushroom cloud firework had already made Tang Sangjia guess at Li Che's identity.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this gentle and honest wood carving master was the ruthless and cunning Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wasn't, the mechanism that blew up the Observation Pavilion was definitely related to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"How is the learning of the Nine Imprint Mechanism going?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia poured a cup of tea for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao was a bit surprised, not expecting the bad-tempered Tang Sangjia to have such a good temper.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Imprint Mechanism was a supreme mechanism technique, and each imprint mastered could give the mechanism beasts different powers.</p><p></p><p>This Nine Imprint Mechanism was similar to the Thousand-Hand Divine Eagle Technique passed down in the Observatory, both belonging to the divine nature martial arts category.</p><p></p><p>When practicing, it not only consumed blood and qi, but also mobilized divine nature.</p><p></p><p>And when the imprint is inserted into the mechanism beast, it contains blood, qi, and divine nature, so the mechanism beast becomes more lifelike.</p><p></p><p>It's as if it has been given a true spirit.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che vaguely felt that the Nine Imprint Mechanism had other uses, but he was unable to research them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not a true disciple of the Tang family.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che had mastered the divine nature supreme skill of the Nine Imprint Mechanism to a great extent, not yet reaching the level of a great master, but able to outline about five imprints, respectively "Approach, Battle, Fight, All, and Seal".</p><p></p><p>Each imprint has a special effect.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that the Nine Imprint Mechanism is too compatible with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Not only in martial arts, but also related to immortal craftsmanship, the immortal dao fruit combined with the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor, making his progress extremely rapid.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even felt that his speed was a bit slow.</p><p></p><p>And the number of imprints Li Che had mastered was far beyond Tang Sangjia's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Five imprints?!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia's grip on the teacup caused the water to splash out, his eyes full of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of the Nine Imprint Mechanism is greater than that of ordinary true essence martial arts, and it also requires the cooperation of divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Although it is also a martial art, it can be displayed in battle.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Che could master five imprints in such a short time, it's simply...</p><p></p><p>A monster! A person born for mechanisms?! Tang Sangjia was full of regret and heartache: "Why aren't you my Tang family disciple..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, but did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lu Yao looked at Li Che with amazement. The Nine Imprint Mechanism of the Tang family...</p><p></p><p>As the Deputy Director of the Observatory in the Capital City, he had heard of it.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia let out a sigh, shook his head, and then looked at Li Che, taking out a set of drawings from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"This is my research on the mechanism you mentioned last time..."</p><p></p><p>"Take a look, if it's helpful and can help you create the mechanism, that would be the best."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia calmed down and became more and more appreciative of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes brightened as he took the drawings from Tang Sangjia and unfolded them, revealing the design of the Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Mech.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at it carefully, and many places conflicted with his own design, but Tang Sangjia had applied the techniques of the Nine Imprint Mechanism, and many places were even more reasonable and convenient than Li Che's original design.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was enlightened, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>The immortal dao fruit was pounding, immediately grasping the essence in Tang Sangjia's drawings.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even with the immortal dao fruit, experience is still very important in many cases.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "In a group of three, there must be my teacher", it is indeed true.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was shaken at the moment, and he vaguely had some ideas about the Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Mech.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia came this time to bring Li Che the drawings, and also a kind of spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, this is the extremely tough and able to conduct divine nature spiritual wood you asked me to find... the Wrathful Blaze Flood Dragon Wood, there is only one in the entire Divine Eagle Ridge."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Then, he felt a scorching heat!</p><p>And there was a surging divine nature raging.</p><p></p><p>A huge scarlet wooden block that two people could barely hug appeared before Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth-Grade Spiritual Wood!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lu Yao's gaze also focused! Sixth-Grade!</p><p></p><p>Anything involving the Sixth-Grade, there will be earth-shattering changes! Li Che actually needs Sixth-Grade Spiritual Wood? "Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that when he asked Tang Sangjia to find a more durable spiritual wood that could conduct divine nature, he would really find it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was looking for these spiritual woods, naturally to upgrade the immortal craftsmanship Gatling Gun and Barrett! Facing Primordial Appearance realm cultivators, the power of the immortal craftsmanship Gatling Gun and Barrett would have...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The current equipment is not enough.</p><p></p><p>Barret is still okay, as it can increase its power by enhancing its penetration.</p><p></p><p>But the Xian Gong Gatling gun is a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it needs to be improved...</p><p></p><p>The machine gun is not enough...</p><p></p><p>Let's use the autocannon! The Firegod Raging Flood Spiritual Wood...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps we can try to make the Xian Gong Firegod Cannon!</p><p></p><p>"Why thank me? This Spiritual Wood is not something even master woodcarvers can use... You're useful, so take it and use it."</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Jinguang Prefecture, no one can use sixth-grade Spiritual Wood, and even I'm curious to see what kind of thing you can tinker with."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader, how much Spiritual Essence Crystal do you need? I'll buy it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>However, Tang Sangjia simply waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>"I'm giving it to you. If you make something interesting that can entertain me, consider it payment for the wood."</p><p></p><p>His grand and magnanimous gesture left Li Che greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not put on airs either, and directly took the Firegod Raging Flood Wood.</p><p></p><p>A sixth-grade Spiritual Wood, even if no one could use it, its value was still undoubtedly high.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the waters of the Nine Dragon River were becoming more turbulent, surging with warmth.</p><p></p><p>Causing the snow and clouds of the bitter winter to no longer continue accumulating.</p><p></p><p>Raindrops fell incessantly, pattering loudly on the earth.</p><p></p><p>Inside a magnificent pavilion with upturned eaves in the city.</p><p></p><p>A figure wearing a golden mask, half of his face burned, burned a letter to ashes.</p><p></p><p>He slammed his palm on the table, leaving a dent in the shape of his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from under the golden mask.</p><p></p><p>As the sub-sect leader of the Hunting God Sect in Jinguang Prefecture, Huang Xirong never thought he would encounter such fierce competition from his fellow practitioners!</p><p></p><p>They had directly used extremely terrifying formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The lingering power of that terrifying explosion, even now, Huang Xirong still found it hard to forget.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... Ox Demon, Horse Face, and Monkey King!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong's voice was low and his anger surging.</p><p></p><p>He had already received a reprimand from the Hunting God Sect in the Capital. </p><p></p><p>This matter, he indeed had an inescapable responsibility, but he also couldn't have predicted that the Underworld would be so crazy and domineering.</p><p></p><p>"Now, in Jinguang Prefecture, I am alone... How can I, by myself, support the Hunting God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong slowly raised the hand that had slammed the table, leaving a dent.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master of the Hunting God Sect in the Capital, let me stop task distribution and take action against the Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>"But I have been hiding and searching in the prefecture city for quite some time, and the people of the Underworld have not left the slightest trace."</p><p></p><p>"Who is the Ox Demon? Who is the Horse Face? Who is the Monkey King?"</p><p></p><p>"No one knows!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong murmured, his voice low and quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Spiritual Master, hiding his identity and secretly investigating the traces of the Underworld, was surprisingly discovering...</p><p></p><p>The core members of the Underworld, in the city of Jinguang Prefecture, did not even leave a single clue.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was very frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong wanted to take revenge, wanted to wash away the humiliation he had suffered as the sub-sect leader in Jinguang Prefecture...</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't find the target! The other party had slapped you, but you didn't even see the shadow of the person who slapped you.</p><p></p><p>It was so frustrating! Huang Xirong had never felt such frustration before.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Sect's business in the prefecture city had just started to unfold, but it had encountered such an event. Huang Xirong felt that his luck was truly too bad.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan and Nan Liihuo have hired the Underworld... They may have pretended to be members of the Underworld, but they are not."</p><p></p><p>"However... I can take action from Li Qingshan, perhaps I can find the traces of the Underworld by following the clues from Li Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong tapped his fingers lightly on the table.</p><p></p><p>He had already been held accountable, and Huang Xirong was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Sect's business in Jinguang Prefecture had been temporarily suspended, and the Capital had asked him to wash away the humiliation, so he was indeed not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he would ferret out the members of the Underworld... and kill them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The core three of the Underworld, the Ox Demon, the Horse Face, and the Monkey King.</p><p></p><p>Only the Monkey King, relying on the power of the temple gods, could contend with a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ox Demon and the Horse Face, they were more inclined to be cunning and despicable.</p><p></p><p>As long as their identities were exposed and their traces found,</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong felt that by hiding in the dark, using his wits, he could definitely complete the hunt.</p><p></p><p>He, Huang Xirong, was originally a killer who had risen to become the sect leader of the Hunting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>He would also occasionally take on killer missions.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to Li Qingshan, there is also that Second-Grade Academician of the Qin Tian Observatory, Li Che."</p><p></p><p>"This person was previously suspected to be the Ox Demon... but there have been many times when the Ox Demon was active, and someone saw Li Che in the Qin Tian Observatory, providing an alibi."</p><p></p><p>"But... so far, in the entire Jinguang Prefecture, only Li Che has been suspected to be the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon of the Underworld is skilled in formations, with cunning and vicious methods... Li Che, as a Second-Grade Academician of the Qin Tian Observatory, has an extremely high level of woodcarving skills... a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong's golden-masked eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong tapped his fingers lightly.</p><p></p><p>The killer of the Hunting God Sect had assassinated Zhang Ya and Li Che's couple, and the stronghold of the Observation Pavilion was then completely destroyed...</p><p></p><p>Seemingly due to fierce competition between practitioners...</p><p></p><p>Or could it be a retaliation? Because...</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Sect had assassinated Li Che and Zhang Ya?</p><p></p><p>The moment this thought arose in Huang Xirong's mind, he suddenly felt a bit ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>How could that be possible?! If it was just because of this reason...</p><p></p><p>Were the members of the Underworld lunatics?! Was Li Che their patriarch?!</p><p></p><p>But as soon as this idea appeared, Huang Xirong couldn't get it out of his mind no matter how he tried.</p><p></p><p>"A coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong stood up, wearing the golden mask and walked to the railing of the inn.</p><p></p><p>Looking out at the hazy rain and mist.</p><p></p><p>"Really a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rain was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>In the Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard of the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's whole body was steaming with a scorching aura, his powerful furnace blood surging and roaring like a flood dragon burning the heavens! The Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>With a horizontal push of his fist, all the martial arts were instantly refined and integrated into a single move, the dragon and elephant roaring, bursting forth from within!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying fist aura exploded, causing the airflow in the entire courtyard to boil and churn, the energy roaring incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a breath and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant has fused the supreme martial arts of the Mixed Origin Parity Heaven, the Thousand Mountains Lone Sword, and many other Grand Master's ultimate techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty of refining and integrating them has become increasingly challenging, as refining the martial arts scriptures is already difficult."</p><p></p><p>"For the martial arts I have created to reach the Grand Master realm, perhaps... I need to create the killing techniques of the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, his mind immersed in the scorching blood.</p><p></p><p>The Mixed Origin Parity Heaven Staff had two killing techniques, perhaps... the killing techniques are the key to a martial art's transformation into a supreme art.</p><p></p><p>But what will the killing techniques of the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant be?</p><p></p><p>How should he create them?!</p><p></p><p>"Inhale... Exhale..."</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a fierce wind blew.</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmed his spirit, returning his state to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the blueprint drawn by Tang Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>Of course, many things in the blueprint Tang Sangjia drew about the suggestions for the Guanyin Lotus main battle tank, Li Che did not find appealing.</p><p></p><p>But some of the things containing Tang's formation techniques allowed Li Che to suddenly understand, and he could learn from them.</p><p></p><p>He went into the house.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the [Firegod Raging Flood Wood] that Old Tang had generously sponsored.</p><p></p><p>The scorching and surging spiritual power and aura immediately enveloped the entire house.</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers, and the heavenly and earthly chessboard suddenly expanded its range.</p><p></p><p>He took out the divine weapon Lü Xuanbing Yang Sword, the sixth-grade Spiritual Wood was no longer something that ordinary carving knives could scratch.</p><p></p><p>However, with Li Che's current Xian Gong skills, even a long sword could give him the feeling of using a carving knife.</p><p></p><p>"The machine gun is not powerful enough, so let's upgrade it to an autocannon..."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Wood Raven also needs to be upgraded, as well as the Dragon Tooth Bodhi Seed bullets, the 'Soldier' seal in the Nine Seals Formation can increase penetration, the 'Motion' seal can increase speed..."</p><p></p><p>"These formation seals can be integrated into the autocannon."</p><p></p><p>"The autocannon consumes more materials... Fortunately, I have the [Painting Immortal] Dao Fruit, which can be replicated and used to create the Raven bullet chain."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... the autocannon firing a thousand rounds per second... each cannon shell fired would be a Spiritual Essence Crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Because he had the experience of manufacturing the Xian Gong Gatling gun before, the difficulty of modifying the Firegod Autocannon was not as great as imagined, the only tricky part was integrating the formation seals into it.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon's sharp blade tore through the Firegod Raging Flood Wood, as if sparks were jumping out, scattering in the air.</p><p></p><p>Extreme brilliance!</p><p></p><p>This Firegod Raging Flood Wood was extremely tough, far exceeding refined iron, and without a divine weapon, it could not be cut.</p><p></p><p>And this Firegod Wood was also an excellent spiritual power conductive wood, if the Great Snow Avalanche spiritual chess pieces were hidden within, the power would be even more terrifying! So the Firegod Raging Flood Wood was also an excellent material for making cannon shells.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Plucking Star Eyes, sweeping his gaze over the Firegod Wood, the Dao Fruit in his chest pounded.</p><p></p><p>According to the blueprint in his mind, Li Che began to manufacture it unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Sparks kept scattering!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>A figure silently and invisibly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the pavilion, the golden mask covering his eyes, coldly sweeping his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong looked coldly at the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual sense of the Spiritual Master silently and quietly spread out.</p><p></p><p>But in his spiritual sense, he only saw the woodcarving that Li Che was diligently working on, very simple and honest.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>He kept probing with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>But there was nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>He was very confident in the spiritual sense of his Spiritual Master.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence, Li Che was just a very simple and honest woodcarver.</p><p></p><p>Diligently carving wood sculptures every day.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his own hands to support his family.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be so?</p><p></p><p>This kind of honest and simple person, could he be the Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>"Knowing people by their face, not by their heart..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong stood with his hands behind his back, as a killer, his suspicion made him unwilling to give up, continuing to monitor.</p><p></p><p>As a killer, he had plenty of patience.</p><p></p><p>"Three days, I will only observe for three days, if this Li Che really does not show any signs similar to the Ox Demon... then I can kill him."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong's eyes were icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Killing Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Was originally the task assigned to the Hunting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>He did not act immediately, he just wanted to confirm whether Li Che was the Underworld's Ox Demon, to eliminate one of the guesses.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che really was the Ox Demon, Huang Xirong could even capture him, and then try to follow the clues to find the traces of the Horse Face and the Monkey King.</p><p></p><p>To truly drag the Underworld, hidden in the darkness, out into the open!</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>The eyes under Huang Xirong's mask were filled with killing intent! The Underworld and the Hunting God Sect, this grudge was now completely established.</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expanded heavenly and earthly chessboard naturally detected the trace of Huang Xirong.</p><p></p><p>As well as Huang Xirong's extremely dark killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Master?!"</p><p></p><p>"And an extremely eager-to-kill Spiritual Master."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression slightly tightened, his hand movement pausing for a moment.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon resumed his work with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit was being driven to the extreme by him.</p><p></p><p>The intersecting and crisscrossing lines on the chessboard, while shielding Huang Xirong's perception, also obscured Huang Xirong's spiritual sense, creating the illusion of diligent carving.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Li Che was cutting the sixth-grade Spiritual Wood.</p><p></p><p>If Huang Xirong discovered that Li Che was using a divine weapon sword to cut the sixth-grade Spiritual Wood, he would most likely guess that Li Che was the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong always felt that something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense was hazy and uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Master of the Hunting God Sect, the last time he didn't manage to kill him, the 150-magnitude Great Snow Avalanche spiritual chess piece, failed to explode and kill him..."</p><p></p><p>"A future trouble."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>A Spiritual Master level as a future trouble.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made him lose sleep.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xirong wanted to kill him, and Li Che also wanted to eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>But a Spiritual Master was not something that could be easily killed just by wanting to...</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Che now had many methods, since he had no experience in confronting a Spiritual Master, he also had no confidence in being able to kill this Spiritual Master.</p><p></p><p>The large-scale Great Snow Avalanche Guanyin Lotus cannon shells did have very strong destructive power.</p><p></p><p>But the Spiritual Master's spiritual sense was powerful, able to sense and evade in advance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly raised the fiery red, hollow-like Firegod Autocannon barrel he had been polishing.</p><p></p><p>This cannon barrel was thick, the caliber much larger than the Xian Gong Gatling gun.</p><p></p><p>It could carry large-scale Great Snow Avalanche Raven cannon shells! Closing one eye.</p><p></p><p>Pressing the cannon barrel against the other eyeball.</p><p></p><p>Through the autocannon barrel, he vaguely saw the figure in golden mask standing on the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The caliber is justice.</p><p></p><p>Within the range...</p><p></p><p>I am the king! If the Firegod Cannon he was manufacturing could be successfully made.</p><p></p><p>Everything would be different then.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao stood with his hands behind his back, watching as Little Liu departed. Snowflakes drifted down from the sky, landing on the whitened tips of his hair.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of detachment and complexity in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao had died, but what Old Chen felt concerned about was not Sun Changbiao's death itself - in this era, a person dying was nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p></p><p>What Old Chen was concerned about was Li Che's decisiveness.</p><p></p><p>They had just discovered that the one coveting Xixia was Sun Changbiao, who had joined the Lingying Sect. Yet, as soon as the task was done, Li Che had rushed off to kill Sun Changbiao.</p><p></p><p>Decisive, ruthless, and swift in action!</p><p></p><p>Was it really Li Che who had done the deed? Where did he get the strength to kill Sun Changbiao? Even Old Chen was left somewhat dazed and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>His carefree stroll was disrupted, and he turned down a different path, heading towards Sun Changbiao's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the courtyard, he heard earth-shattering cries.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, a crowd had gathered. Old Sun the steward was there, his old face ashen and his whole body trembling, clenching his fists in anger and grief.</p><p></p><p>"Who was it? Who killed my son?"</p><p>"My son was a peaceful and kind-hearted person. Who could be so malicious?"</p><p></p><p>The steward wept inconsolably, the pain of losing his son piercing his heart.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Lady Liu was being supported as she sat in a chair, tears streaming down her face, wailing.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen drew closer and inquired for a while, and a strange feeling came over him.</p><p></p><p>"A towering and burly figure like a small mountain, with palms the size of fans, who kicked down the door and then brutally kicked Sun Changbiao..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the hand of a Tempering the Bones expert... It seems it was not Li Che after all. Li Che has only just reached adulthood, he would have been no match for Sun Changbiao."</p><p></p><p>"How curious, what a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen shook his head in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Sun Changbiao's body, the head severed and the bones shattered, he sighed. It was a rather tragic end.</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze and saw Sun Changbiao's four daughters standing in the corner, timid and fearful. The eldest daughter, looking at her father's corpse, had no sorrow in her eyes, but rather...</p><p></p><p>A sense of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The news of Sun Changbiao's brutal murder quickly spread like a storm through the Xu Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>It caused a great commotion.</p><p></p><p>The Three Managers had left the city, and this incident occurred in their absence, with significant impact.</p><p></p><p>The next day, people from the inner city Xu Family and constables from the outer city yamen came to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu, his burly frame draped in a fox-fur cloak, had an aura of concentrated energy crackling around him as he looked at Sun Changbiao's body in the coffin, a flash of something unusual in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Tremendous force, one kick shattering the internal organs, and during the confrontation, the arm bones were also crushed, in a crushing motion. Without a doubt, the one who struck was a formidable Tempering the Bones martial artist. As for the final severing of the head, the wound is so clean, indicating an extremely sharp blade, likely a sword."</p><p></p><p>Beside Xu Beihu, the outer city constable chief Zhao Chuanxiong, also a burly man with a wide-bladed saber at his waist, squinted his eyes and analyzed.</p><p></p><p>"Chief Zhao, I never imagined that after all these years of peace, our Xu Family would have such a bold villain brazenly enter our shop and commit this heinous act."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu clasped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong smiled and waved his hand. "Perhaps it was the work of another family, wanting to make an example and intimidate you Xu Family. But it is also strange... Why target this Sun Changbiao? And why him specifically?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu was also puzzled, and after much thought, could not come to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong smiled and raised his hand with a light wave.</p><p></p><p>"Search around, see if there are any clues."</p><p></p><p>With that, the constables Zhao had brought began to search Sun Changbiao's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Lady Liu, who was sitting in the chair and wailing, saw the constables searching, and a flash of panic and then despair crossed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, one of the constables shouted, "Found it!"</p><p></p><p>He then returned carrying a "Three-Headed Six-Armed Lingying Idol".</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's eyes flashed with anger, his hair flying, as he turned to glare at Lady Liu, roaring, "So you all have joined the Lingying Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong narrowed his eyes, gently clapping his hands. "Ah, so it's the Lingying Sect. That makes sense..."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the four daughters standing in the corner, the youngest only two or three years old, tilting her head with a bewildered expression, her hair in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's face was grim. Although the infiltration of the Lingying Sect into the shop was something he had long anticipated, having it suddenly exposed like this was rather embarrassing for the Xu Family.</p><p></p><p>"Now the situation is quite clear. This Sun Changbiao had joined the Lingying Sect, and his daughters must have been targeted by the sect to be taken as sacrifices. Sun Changbiao refused to hand them over, so he was killed by the villains."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, truly a tragic tale."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fatherly Love...</p><p></p><p>"Liu, is this true or not?" </p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair and still crying, Liu was suddenly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Blending into the crowd, Li Che, who had heard the captain's analysis, couldn't help but twitch the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>It was true that Sun Zhangbiao died from fatherly love, but that was Li Che's fatherly love...</p><p></p><p>Without further observation, Li Che then went to the practice field to train.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The practice field was bustling with energy.</p><p></p><p>The new wood carvers recruited by the shop this year had just learned the polishing cultivation method, and they were all full of fighting spirit, carrying stone locks and constantly training.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan, with her straight and long legs, was instructing the newcomers. Seeing Li Che's appearance, she immediately greeted him with a smile: "Master Li, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently and nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhengpin, who was sweating profusely on the side, also stopped his training: "Master Li, have you heard? Master Sun died so miserably, his whole body was crushed by the villain, and he was tortured to death, and his head was even cut off, it's too gruesome to look at."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mouth twitched, it had become more and more exaggerated as it was passed on... He wasn't that cruel, was he?</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che still joined the conversation with a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>While the elders were chatting, the newcomers didn't dare to interfere. After a while, Li Che began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation he displayed outwardly was the perfection of polishing, which had already made many people envious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che would never miss his daily practice, after all, the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao fruit could be matured, and daily cultivation was indispensable.</p><p></p><p>But while cultivating, Li Che was pondering the matter of the opening vein method and the inner strength method.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was contemplating, Xu Beihu came to the practice field.</p><p></p><p>"Second Steward."</p><p></p><p>Everyone stopped their actions and greeted him with clasped fists.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's expression softened a bit: "Today I came to the outer city to investigate the cause of Sun Zhangbiao's death, and I can also give you some guidance on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Li Che's body, revealing a satisfied expression: "In one year, your polishing has been perfected, your innate talent in cultivating the body is quite remarkable, keep working hard and don't slack off. If you have any needs, you can bring them up and I'll listen."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his fists and said, "Second Steward... Now that my polishing has been perfected, I wonder if I can request the opening vein method and the inner strength method?"</p><p></p><p>"Today, when I passed by Master Sun's courtyard, I saw his tragic death, and I'm still shuddering. I heard that Master Sun was like a mountain of fatherly love, and he died tragically while protecting his daughter, I... I'm afraid."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's words were full of sincerity and worry.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu fell silent for a moment. He had heard about Li Che's situation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had previously joined the Xu family for protection because he was worried about the Lingying Sect, and now this incident had happened, which had indeed tarnished the reputation of the Xu family. This was a sign of a decline in prestige.</p><p></p><p>However, the rules of the Xu family could not be broken. Xu Beihu shook his head and showed a look of regret: "According to the rules of the Xu family... you need to reach the perfection of polishing before I can teach you the opening vein method and the inner strength method."</p><p></p><p>"The foundation must be solidly built before you can move forward, otherwise the high tower will easily collapse. If I teach you prematurely, I'm afraid you will be tempted to practice it early and hurt your body, this is for your own good."</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and showed a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Beihu hesitated for a moment, then produced a porcelain bottle and handed it to Li Che: "Well, this is a 'Polishing Pill', a total of six pieces... as a reward for your perfection in polishing."</p><p></p><p>"Take one pill every five days, and with your talent, in more than a month, you should be able to perfect your polishing."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, you can come to me to get the opening vein method and the inner strength method."</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a little regretful, but his face showed joy as he took the "Polishing Pill". In his heart, he had already decided to go to the market to see if he could buy the inner strength method.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had said that they were not members of the Xu family, so the opening vein method and inner strength method they could cultivate were not very advanced, and were not much different from the higher-level inner strength methods available in the market.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che take the pill, a smile appeared on Xu Beihu's rough face.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, I also have a job here that I came to find you for."</p><p></p><p>"I know your wood carvings are full of artistic conception, and the young master of the Si family has come to me, wanting to commission you to carve a wood sculpture, and the reward is five gold leaves."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Five gold leaves?! Five hundred taels! A big customer!</p><p></p><p>But this also meant that the requirements would not be simple, and this wood carving task must be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression became solemn as he clasped his fists and asked, "May I ask what the young master of the Si family wants me to carve?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the serious Li Che, Xu Beihu smiled.</p><p></p><p>"A nine-headed Guanyin statue that can subdue ghosts."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

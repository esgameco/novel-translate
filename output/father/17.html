        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other party was wearing a cute moo-cow mask, but the eyes behind the mask were devoid of any trace of cuteness.</p><p></p><p>The moment their eyes met, Sun Changbiao felt the scent of death.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming killing intent, like a surging river breaking through a dam, threatened to overwhelm his psychological defenses! "This is Xu's Woodcarving Shop! How dare you commit murder here?!"</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the excruciating pain in his abdomen, in the face of the fear of death, Sun Changbiao let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>His internal qi and blood surged, his major tendons tensed and vibrated, and the internal force in his palms flowed like snakes, revealing his cultivation at the opening of the meridians stage, ready to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao was also very clear that this was Xu's compound, where many old woodcarvers lived. As long as he could delay the time, perhaps reinforcements would arrive! At worst, his elder brother and father lived in the nearby courtyard, and they would come as soon as they heard the commotion!</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Sun Changbiao indifferently, his usual gentle and refined demeanor completely gone.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che could never have imagined that the extremely gentle person he was on the outside would be so ruthless and malicious towards his own daughter...</p><p></p><p>Ordering his daughter to cook and do chores was one thing, but at the slightest dissatisfaction, he would beat her with a rattan cane.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the face but not the heart.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were not important...</p><p></p><p>What was important was that Li Che had heard Sun Changbiao's words.</p><p></p><p>Confirming Sun Changbiao's malicious intent towards Xixia, this person must be the one who placed the angry-eyed wooden doll the previous night, intending to send Xixia to the Dharma Master in exchange for his own child!</p><p></p><p>This was enough reason to die.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, a murderous aura surged in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Under the life-and-death stimulation, Sun Changbiao let out a roar, slamming his arms fiercely on the ground, propelling himself into the air, his back tendons taut like bowstrings, and he unleashed two powerful punches towards Li Che! The opening of the meridians force, as well as the internal force, gushed out in full force!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The towering, burly cow-faced figure simply raised a hand, and his fist, like a fan, suddenly clenched and pushed out a punch.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, there seemed to be the roar of a dragon and the scream of an elephant, a terrifying sound carrying strong sound waves, shaking the air and raging within the room.</p><p></p><p>The fists collided, and a bone-cracking sound exploded!</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao let out a miserable howl, his eyes revealing terror.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering the Bones? A Tempering the Bones martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>Such power, it must be a Tempering the Bones martial artist!</p><p></p><p>Within this compound, how could there be a Tempering the Bones martial artist casually coming to kill him?!</p><p></p><p>With one punch, Li Che had shattered Sun Changbiao's arm bone. The eyes behind the moo-cow mask were indifferent and calm.</p><p></p><p>With a light flick of the fingers from the sleeve, the Dao Fruit Immortal Craft slightly trembled.</p><p></p><p>An invisible silver thread, as if tearing through the air, like a spider spinning its web or an extremely sharp sword unsheathed, danced wildly in the air, whipping up a sudden gale.</p><p></p><p>Mechanism, Thousand Spider Threads!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a few taut sounds and cutting noises.</p><p></p><p>Clenching the five fingers, the threads quickly retracted, disappearing back into the billowing sleeves.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure pressed down on the hat brim, shook his sleeves, and with a few quick steps, rushed out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Opening the courtyard gate from the inside, he directly departed, disappearing into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao stared blankly at the retreating towering figure.</p><p></p><p>A red line slowly seeped out droplets of blood on his neck...</p><p></p><p>The overturned Eight Immortals table behind him had been silently sliced open, the cut clean and precise.</p><p></p><p>And what was also cut open...</p><p></p><p>was Sun Changbiao's head.</p><p></p><p>With a gurgle, the head tilted and fell from the neck, accompanied by the gushing of scalding hot blood.</p><p></p><p>The entire room was filled with a bloody stench.</p><p></p><p>The fallen Liu Shi had already been frightened senseless, her whole body trembling like a sieve.</p><p></p><p>Only when the howling wind and swirling snow rushed in from the broken door outside did she let out a terrifyingly shrill scream from the depths of her throat!</p><p></p><p>"Murder... murder!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dark alley.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had withdrawn the power of the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao fruit, and his body immediately returned to normal. He put on his clothes again, took out the Meng Niu mask, clenched his five fingers, and the mask was instantly shattered into wooden chips.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down his hat, listening to the mournful cries that drifted in with the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>There was not much change in his expression.</p><p></p><p>If Sun Changbiao did not die, he would pose a great threat to Xixia. Li Che was also afraid that if he didn't watch over Xixia one day, the one crying would be himself.</p><p></p><p>Born in this world, the heart cannot be merciful, the hand cannot be soft.</p><p></p><p>Li Che no longer considered himself a good person. Killing was not the first time he had done it, from the black-skinned man in the past to the current Sun Changbiao.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's hands were also stained with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>But he just wanted to protect his daughter well.</p><p></p><p>All of this was his duty as a father.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. If I could... eliminate the Lingying Sect, Xixia's safety would not be threatened."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at his palms and murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Then, he lifted his head high and strode out of the alley.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the courtyard, where Old Chen was playing with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>He extravagantly used his inner strength to melt all the snow in the courtyard, leaving a dry ground for the little girl to toddle around on her walker.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!" The little girl saw Li Che and her eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>With unsteady steps, she ran towards Li Che, who smiled and said, "Has my little stinky Xixia missed Daddy?"</p><p></p><p>Picking up the girl, Li Che playfully poked her little nose. Old Chen became jealous and did not use his inner strength to melt the snow, so the snowflakes began to fall again.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy is still the most affectionate. Old Chen has been with you all day, but as soon as Daddy comes back, you don't want Old Chen anymore." Old Chen pouted, and the air seemed to be filled with the scent of vinegar.</p><p></p><p>Li Che burst out laughing and pointed at Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya came out of the kitchen carrying hot dishes and said gently, "Uncle Chen, husband, it's time to eat."</p><p></p><p>The dishes were very rich, with meat and fish, very nutritious. She took a small bowl, picked out some fish meat, and started feeding the Xixia, who was sitting in a high chair and tapping on the wooden bowl.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen then began to eat and drink, chatting as they did so.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's cooking was very good, and Old Chen often came to freeload, not feeling guilty at all, after all, this little bit of food was nothing to the current Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Old Chen had reduced his work to keep Xixia company, often introducing his wood carving clients to Li Che, allowing Li Che to take on many lucrative jobs.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Old Chen hummed a little tune and went for a leisurely stroll.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he walked out, hurried footsteps came, and at the corner, he encountered a figure with a panicked expression.</p><p></p><p>"Little Liu, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen recognized this person, the young son of the old master craftsman Liu from the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's you, Teacher Chen. Ah... something has happened, something has happened to my sister..."</p><p></p><p>Little Liu's expression was grim. Seeing it was Chen Daobao, he still stopped to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's expression immediately darkened upon hearing this. His sister... wasn't she the wife of Sun Changbiao?</p><p></p><p>"In the Xu Family Mansion, a villain suddenly appeared and broke into my brother-in-law's courtyard, cruelly killing my brother-in-law... Ah... Father told me to notify the shopkeeper..."</p><p></p><p>Little Liu sighed deeply, briefly told Old Chen a few more details, and then hurried away towards the outside of the mansion.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind whistled, biting and bone-chilling, the world was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao... dead? He had just recently informed Li Che that Sun Changbiao was targeting Xixia.</p><p></p><p>But now, Sun Changbiao had been beaten to death in his own home.</p><p></p><p>A coincidence? Chen Daobao gripped the wine gourd, his expression becoming complex.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

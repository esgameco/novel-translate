        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was something Li Che had never imagined before - his Dao fruit had matured to level 3, and he had actually undergone such a transformation! "The embryonic form of divine abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and in an instant, he looked at his own hands. Vaguely, a faint jade-colored mist seemed to be emanating from his arms, gushing out from his pores, making his fingers and arms look as white and jade-like as if they were carved.</p><p></p><p>【Embryonic Form of Divine Abilities (Immortal Craftsman · Thousand-Layered Palm): Absorbing divine nature, cultivating divine abilities, the immortal craftsman undergoes metamorphosis, and his techniques reach new heights】</p><p></p><p>The introduction appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che just took one look, and his mind was shaken, greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing divine nature?!"</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean the Embryonic Form of Divine Abilities can be used to absorb divine nature for one's own use?"</p><p></p><p>Divine nature... that was a realm he had been unable to access so far.</p><p></p><p>Although his wood carvings were sent to the inner city, used by the scions of prominent families to cultivate their divine nature, Li Che had never truly come into contact with divine nature himself.</p><p></p><p>Gradually calming down, Li Che let out a breath, his eyes shining brightly: "Unfortunately, I don't know yet what the use of divine nature is... but absorbing divine nature is just one effect of the Thousand-Layered Palm, there are still new transformations to come."</p><p></p><p>Li Che settled his mind, looking at the golden mist emanating from his arms, the corners of his mouth curling up.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the "Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping and Subduing Ghosts Statue" before him, Li Che raised his hand, the jade-colored mist-covered palm covering the wood carving.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed as if the jade mist had turned into flowing light, and all the carving techniques, craftsmanship, and other details of this wood sculpture were presented before him, which Li Che easily analyzed and grasped.</p><p></p><p>Li Che released his hand, the smile on his lips becoming even more pronounced: "The Thousand-Layered Palm... can analyze any craft."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I touch it, I can analyze the root, like investigating things to understand their true nature, and obtain the techniques."</p><p></p><p>To verify his guess, he left the workshop and went out to the finished sculptures placed outside.</p><p></p><p>The snow was falling heavily.</p><p></p><p>A few sparse figures were carefully placing the finished sculptures.</p><p></p><p>These were the porters from the workshop, and Li Che had once been one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li!"</p><p></p><p>The porters saw Li Che and all showed fawning smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Do you need any wood materials? Just give us the order, and we'll carry them in for you, no need for you to come out in this bitter cold." A porter wiped the sweat and said hastily with a smile.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che just waved his hand: "No, I'm just taking a look."</p><p></p><p>He then walked up to a finished sculpture and covered it with his hand, the hazy jade mist emanating from his palm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the carving techniques, processes, and other details of this wood sculpture were all revealed in his mind, unlike before when he could only grasp the techniques one by one, now he had no such limitations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he grasped them more meticulously, and could even make improvements on the original techniques, supplementing the deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>"As expected..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che released his hand, smiling inwardly, his confidence soaring, and he felt he had an even greater grasp on manufacturing the remaining nine highly difficult mechanisms in the "Tang Family Mechanism Records".</p><p></p><p>"It's time to update the mechanisms... and give that Zhao Chuanxiong an even bigger surprise."</p><p></p><p>In a month's time, Li Che had undergone a significant transformation.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had advanced, his immortal craftsmanship level had also improved, and he had obtained the embryonic form of the divine ability [Thousand-Layered Palm].</p><p></p><p>It was time to eliminate the potential danger that was Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Li Che always had a sense of a sword hanging over his head, unable to rest easy, always feeling that Xixia might suffer a great calamity at any time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Xu Beihu arrived as promised, wearing a large cloak, his physique even more imposing.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, is the wood carving ready?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's voice was rough, his eyes shining with vitality. As soon as he entered the workshop, he came to look for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Entering the workshop, he saw the wood sculpture quietly placed on the workbench, his eyes lighting up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, Master Li's skills have improved again! This Avalokitesvara Weeping and Subduing Ghosts Statue... is indeed excellent, full of meaning!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu stared at the Weeping and Subduing Ghosts Statue, his eyes unable to look away.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the divine nature I cultivate is not 'Weeping and Subduing Ghosts', otherwise I definitely wouldn't sell this wood carving to the Si family... at least, I'd charge more haha."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"If the second boss needs it, you can place an order with me, a business of five gold leaves per time, I will..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I hope he comes a few more times, then I won't have to worry about food and clothing anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'll come visit you when I have the chance, but... the wood carvings I need must be made by a master wood carver."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to sell me wood carvings, you'll have to become a master wood carver. We Xu family direct descendants cultivate divine nature, and the divine nature wood carvings we've comprehended all come from the masters' hands. That Simu Bai... is just at a critical breakthrough point, so he's casting a wide net, not being picky, needing a large quantity of wood carvings, so he's come to you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly releasing his hand, Xu Beihu looked at Li Che with amazement: "Master Li, your talent for wood carving... is truly exceptional, you have the potential to become a master. If you diligently research divine nature, you may have the opportunity to become a master wood carver in the future."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che became curious and asked, "Second shopkeeper, what is the difference between a master wood carver and an ordinary wood carver?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu had a very high opinion of Li Che and did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>The two men had the workers load the wood carvings onto the prepared carriage, and Xu Beihu led Li Che into the luxurious and magnificent carriage.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, a stove was burning and tea was being brewed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu poured a cup for Li Che and explained, "The reason why master wood carvers can be called masters... is that the wood carvings they create are fundamentally different from those of ordinary wood carvers."</p><p></p><p>"This difference lies in divine nature."</p><p></p><p>"The wood carvings created by master wood carvers give birth to true divine nature, which can be absorbed."</p><p></p><p>"This alone is the difference between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's body trembled slightly. The wood carvings he made... possessed true divine nature?</p><p></p><p>"It's not hard to understand. You know about spirit babies, right? When people combine, the babies born are blessed by heaven and earth, and naturally possess divine nature. Master wood carvers... in creating spirit baby wood carvings, it's like a pregnant woman giving birth to a spirit baby, so the wood carvings have a chance of possessing divine nature, although the divine nature born is not comparable to a true spirit baby, it is still like showing off to heaven and earth, capturing the divine nature that wanders between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do master wood carvers... cultivate divine nature techniques?" Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu nodded matter-of-factly: "Without cultivating divine nature techniques, one will ultimately be like an ant. Without cultivating divine nature, how can one feel, understand, and bestow divine nature?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps thinking of something, Xu Beihu looked at Li Che with a smile: "Master Li, don't be in a hurry. Divine nature techniques are extremely precious, they are the hidden treasures of every great family and clan."</p><p></p><p>"Although your talent is not bad, it still needs to be considered. Moreover... Master Li is too young, you need more accumulation, more experience and qualifications, before you can try to cultivate divine nature techniques and have the chance to become a master wood carver."</p><p></p><p>"But it's only a chance."</p><p></p><p>The carriage passed the tumultuous outer city and soon arrived at the majestic inner city wall.</p><p></p><p>Because it was a Xu family carriage, they didn't even need to be inspected and drove directly into the bustling inner city.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Che's first time coming to the inner city. The clean and luxurious buildings were towering side by side, and just through the window, he could see all kinds of prosperous scenes.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the precarious and dilapidated environment of the outer city, where the common people struggled to survive, it was like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped in front of a grand restaurant. This restaurant was decorated in gold and splendor, with exquisite carvings and extremely extravagant.</p><p></p><p>Several workers quickly came out of the restaurant and carefully carried the wood carvings, following behind Xu Beihu and Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"This Jinhuan Pavilion is one of the best restaurants in the inner city, a meal here starts at around a hundred taels of silver. It seems that young master Simu Bai attaches great importance to you and is quite looking forward to your 'Crying Demon Pacifier', so he has specially arranged a banquet here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The two walked through the beautifully carved corridor, where every wooden material was meticulously carved by master wood carvers, exquisitely beautiful and pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, there was a pavilion-like structure with an open space on all four sides, like a suspended pavilion. The curtains were hanging, and the wind blew, making the curtains flutter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che saw the white-robed figure sitting and drinking in the suspended pavilion from afar.</p><p></p><p>Next to that white-robed figure stood an old woman, head bowed, reporting something.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the old woman, and the warmth on her face gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Finally... it completely froze! Staring at the face of the old woman that Li Che could dream of in his sleep...</p><p></p><p>A faint murderous intent began to spread from the depths of Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>This old woman was the midwife who delivered Xixia and killed dozens of children - Lei Chunlian!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 195</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mushroom cloud formed an umbrella-like canopy.</p><p></p><p>The hot air surged and rolled! Like steel that had been forged and tempered a thousand times, it burned to an extreme red, hissing and steaming with scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's ink-black robe fluttered, his jet-black hair lashing the airflow like black thunderbolts. He stood in the courtyard, raising a single hand, his five fingers curved like hooks.</p><p></p><p>Countless boiling hot currents intertwined around him, his heart pounding powerfully, each beat like a huge drum made of the hide of an ancient fierce beast being struck and shaken violently!</p><p></p><p>Inhale! Exhale! Li Che stood with his eyes closed, the blood-colored thunderbolts intertwined in his palm were the first divine might forged from the essence of the myriad transforming dragon and elephant - extremely condensed and domineering, flickering and surging like electric currents! This was the first divine might Li Che had condensed, far more powerful than the true qi of a master, its destructive power alone being on a completely different level.</p><p></p><p>The might extends three feet, the divine might breaks through thirty feet! This was no empty boast, the difference was like that between a bicycle and a small car in terms of speed and destructive power.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che could feel that the divine might he had tempered was even more fierce and powerful!</p><p></p><p>After all, it was forged from the ultimate insights of the martial saint's supreme art, refined into divine might! Any master's supreme art, cultivated to the grandmaster realm, could allow one to gain insights into the true essence, and by refining the viscera with this true essence, one could temper divine might! The rank and strength of the master's supreme art would also determine the strength of the divine might.</p><p></p><p>Just as master's supreme arts are divided into lower, middle and upper grades, the refined divine might would also vary in quality.</p><p></p><p>The world has always been uneven, there will never be absolute fairness.</p><p></p><p>It is the same in martial cultivation and spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>These are inevitable facts, and people can only follow these rules. To become strong, one must stand at the upper end of the unevenness.</p><p></p><p>Obtain better resources, cultivate better martial arts, and refine stronger true essence!</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of the heartbeat, violent and thunderous.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, dazzlingly brilliant, as he stood in place, his entire body and pores glowing, the acupoints shining!</p><p></p><p>The whole appearance was like a translucent agate, with flowing light intertwining on the surface.</p><p></p><p>One could even see the thick, mercury-like blood rushing and roaring in the meridians through the glowing pores. Li Che felt the divine might that coiled around him like blood-colored lightning, far more powerful than the previous dragon and elephant silver might! Although both were qi might, the two were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>Because this blood and qi divine might was tempered from the essence of the myriad transforming dragon and elephant, it was truly... the divine might of a grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Meaning that at this moment, Li Che had truly stepped into the grandmaster realm!</p><p></p><p>He clenched his five fingers, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The dense medicinal aroma floated up under the stimulation of the scorching blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly crushed the jade bottle, revealing the transparent pill inside.</p><p></p><p>It was a gift from the Sect Master of the Hunting God Hall, Huang Xilang - a sixth-grade low-grade Dragon Blood Martial Pill!</p><p></p><p>A sixth-grade pill! </p><p></p><p>Exactly what Li Che needed at the moment! Gulp - he opened his mouth, his tongue scorching hot, the pill entered his throat and fell into his stomach, like a huge stone thrown into a deep abyss!</p><p></p><p>The sixth-grade low-grade Dragon Blood Martial Pill was extremely precious and rare.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Che had not obtained any sixth-grade martial pills after killing the grandmaster Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>It was a martial pill refined with the blood of a true dragon! At this moment, as Li Che was breaking through to the grandmaster realm, this pill would help strengthen his blood and qi!</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, the light in Li Che's brow and cinnabar field glowed.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual consciousness resided there, his eyes opening and closing, radiating dazzling divine light.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Li Che to clearly sense every inch of his sinews, flesh, and meridians.</p><p></p><p>Even following the spread of the blood vessels, he could perceive his viscera, and even more minutely!</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of spiritual consciousness!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sixth-grade martial pill was suddenly crushed by the terrifying force of the stomach wall, the pill casing bursting, and the dense, surging medicinal properties gushing out!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart pounded, as if it had become a huge vortex, instantly drawing and swallowing all the medicinal power!</p><p></p><p>A long, drawn-out exhale, like the roar of a great whale! His heart seemed to have become a powerful reactor, the internal fire burning intensely, wanting to burn him to ashes from the inside out!</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster of Divine Might..."</p><p></p><p>"In total, one can refine thirty-six types of divine might, each of which can be further divided into ten strands, each strand opening one acupoint... Connecting the three hundred and sixty acupoints of the body."</p><p></p><p>"Woven into a divine might web, completely integrated, connecting the acupoints, circulating the entire body, with each inhalation and exhalation, one can connect with heaven and earth, this is the ultimate realm of the Grandmaster of Divine Might, reaching the unity of man and heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing good in the Qingyun Jade of the Jihai Hall.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a young prince, he was still too young, and his cultivation was not strong, but he did have a decent reserve of spiritual crystals, with ten sixth-grade spiritual crystals and enough seventh-grade spiritual crystals for a hundred.</p><p></p><p>At least in terms of wealth, he truly deserved the title of young prince.</p><p></p><p>As for divine weapons, apart from the fourth-grade divine weapon, the Yulian Yin Divine Sword, which Li Che had collected into the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, and the Prison Lotus Yin Divine Sword...</p><p></p><p>There were no other high-quality divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>However, there were quite a few cultivation manuals.</p><p></p><p>And there were also records related to martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Among them were records of the division of the grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>The grandmaster realm is divided into three stages: Divine Might, Unity of Man and Heaven, and the Pinnacle Three Flowers! Such as Xue Dufu and Zhu Chaoyang, they were only grandmasters at the Divine Might stage.</p><p></p><p>And now, the strand of divine might Li Che had tempered also marked his formal entry into the realm of the Grandmaster of Divine Might! Hum - the hot currents surged and rolled, all being drawn into the vortex of the heart, countless blood vessels being infused with it.</p><p></p><p>Like the explosive force of a foot stomping on a puddle, countless streams of water shot out like water arrows, impacting his limbs and viscera!</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle -</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood there, feeling the great transformation brought about by the advancement in his martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che's physical body had already become extremely powerful after being purified by the Dao Fruit, but the transformation brought about by the realm advancement was also no small matter.</p><p></p><p>The impurities in the muscles were washed away, the tendons and bones were forged a thousand times, becoming even more resilient, and the nerves attached to them seemed to have grown stronger, with more acute feedback.</p><p></p><p>And with this extremely acute perception surging,</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes burned like flames, his two eyeballs scorching, like the beams of a flashlight piercing the darkness.</p><p></p><p>In his left eye, a dragon seemed to be undulating, and in his right pupil, an ancient giant elephant trumpeted and snorted! Boom - countless surging heat waves formed the illusory images of the dragon and elephant, powerful and majestic, ancient and mighty, domineering and unparalleled...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, his ink-black robe fluttering, a martial will that pressed down the air and rippled outward like mountains and rivers, utterly unyielding and masculine, as if he had become the dragon and elephant himself!</p><p></p><p>The martial will unique to grandmasters...</p><p></p><p>A refined essence of spirit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel that with the martial will fully formed, his spiritual consciousness also seemed to have grown much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Che's spiritual consciousness was premature.</p><p></p><p>It was only after cultivating to the Elemental Realm that one could condense the spiritual consciousness, and at that time, his spiritual consciousness was as weak as his current one.</p><p></p><p>It was only after condensing the Spiritual Elixir that he could gradually use the elixir to refine his spirituality and strengthen his spiritual consciousness, reaching the First Realm of Spiritual Consciousness, the Spiritual Consciousness Metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>And now, the martial will was also assisting in the tempering of his spiritual consciousness!</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly understood why it was said that a single martial grandmaster or a single Spiritual Immortal True Person, when facing an opponent who had reached the same level in both martial and spiritual cultivation, would be extremely hard-pressed.</p><p></p><p>The martial will feeding back to enhance the spiritual consciousness, this indeed brings a faster increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>His heart like a furnace, the thunderous heartbeat never ceasing.</p><p></p><p>But the rumbling of the Dragon Elephant Golden Immortal Dao Fruit gradually subsided, and the majestic and unparalleled aura on Li Che's body slowly receded.</p><p></p><p>Bringing two fingers together, he tore open the air.</p><p></p><p>A cute cow-faced mask was then covered on his face by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a straw hat and a black robe,</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body shuddered and he disappeared from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crackle, crackle!</p><p></p><p>Lightning flashed, thunder roared.</p><p></p><p>Drizzling wind and rain howled obliquely, mixed with swirling snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter!</p><p></p><p>On the long street, the Divine Guard soldiers in armor marched, holding weapons, clearing the spacious road even more empty.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Sentry True Person and Su Huai had white cloth bands tied around their arms, walking slowly at the front, white paper money scattered, the atmosphere full of desolation.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, six black-armored Blood Guards with solemn expressions carried a coffin, step by step, powerful and heavy, as if they were going to shake the ground to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The people on both sides dispersed, although separated by the Divine Guards, but each harbored the mood of watching the excitement.</p><p></p><p>The funeral procession crossed the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>All the major forces heard the commotion and came to pay their respects, giving face, as Jihai Hall had died, but after all, he was the son of Pacification King Jie Molei, the proper etiquette still had to be given.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>Pacification King Jie Molei has not died yet.</p><p></p><p>It's not about the monk, but the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Within the Golden Light Prefecture, in addition to the Five Great Families, there were all kinds of medium and small families, each sending people to mourn.</p><p></p><p>The rain slanted, pattering on the black-tiled eaves, connecting into dripping water.</p><p></p><p>Qingtian Observatory Treasure Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao stood at the railing in the wind and rain, standing side by side with the Observatory Supervisor Hu Yingue, who was plucking a mournful erhu.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the Supervisor's melancholic erhu music, Lu Yao couldn't help but feel a sense of empathy.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly killed Jihai Hall?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Yao couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't think of it, and almost everyone else couldn't either.</p><p></p><p>Even Jiao Shaochun, who controlled the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel and led the Temple God Resonance, didn't know who killed Jihai Hall and shattered the Martial Saint's Will.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Golden Light Prefecture, who could do this...</p><p></p><p>There was almost no one, right? "It's better not to guess, even if you guess correctly, it won't do you any good..."</p><p></p><p>"Pacification King Jie Molei's reputation is not good, with many enemies, perhaps it was a powerful enemy hiding his identity who killed Jihai Hall... It's possible."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao didn't refute it, because this possibility did exist.</p><p></p><p>Watching the paper money fly and fall to the ground, soaked by the rain, seeing the desolate funeral procession leave the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of the high-profile and domineering Young Prince Jihai Hall when he first came to the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had met such a desolate end.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Hu Yingue seemed to have gained inspiration, playing the erhu even more mournfully, the emotions fully expressed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao rolled his eyes, looking at the funeral procession disappearing into the hazy rain, too lazy to listen to this annoying erhu anymore, and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Supervisor Hu Yingue glanced at him, smiling on his face.</p><p></p><p>Young people don't understand the beauty of the erhu, mistaking the pipa for a treasure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The funeral of Young Prince Jihai Hall left the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many forces became aware.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of Golden Light Mountain,</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo stood with his hands behind his back, his white hair flying, his eyes raining down fire, his mood extremely good.</p><p></p><p>But not enough.</p><p></p><p>Although Jihai Hall is dead, he did not kill him.</p><p></p><p>And Jihai Hall's death will certainly provoke the fury of Jie Molei, and he doesn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo let out a breath, his eyes gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He wants to kill Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>He had previously contacted Ox Demon and Horse Face, and had planned to kill Su Huai, and now in the Underworld, even grandmasters and Spiritual Immortal True Persons could be killed.</p><p></p><p>A mere Su Huai, only half a step into Spiritual Immortal, must be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo planned to complete the assassination of Su Huai in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>"Killing a Su Huai... should be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo lowered his eyelids.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much time left, closing his eyes, seeing an extremely terrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>His face flushed red, letting out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>His body leaned, directly plunging into the wind and rain, heading towards the direction of Zheng Lightning Peak.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to contact the Ox Demon and Horse Face of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>But now to contact the Underworld...</p><p></p><p>Through Li Qingshan would be the most convenient.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The funeral procession left the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai escorted them for ten miles, then did not continue to see them off.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, farewell."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai, in white robes, his face sorrowful, cupped his hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Sentry True Person and the six Black-armored Blood Guards did not pay any attention to him, and left directly.</p><p></p><p>The unfinished paper money, the endless sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Watching the funeral procession disappear into the wind and rain, Su Huai slowly straightened up, the sadness on his face vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his eyes, a flash of unease could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand to cover his chest, his face pale, panting slightly: "Such a strong sense of unease..."</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly? Who killed Jihai Hall..."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect? The Hunting God Hall? Who was it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was almost going mad, a blood-red web of unease emerging in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My teacher doesn't believe in me, doesn't think I can grow, and has sent me here... I've lost everything!"</p><p></p><p>"Why does he think I'm not as good as my senior brothers and sisters?"</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>The scarlet light in Su Huai's eyes reached an extreme, his spirituality surging like a venomous snake, undulating its tongue in his body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually,</p><p></p><p>Su Huai regained his calm, the hand clutching the white robe on his chest slowly lowering.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the disappearing Yin Sentry True Person's funeral procession.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai knew that neither Jihai Hall nor the Yin Sentry True Person had ever looked down on him.</p><p></p><p>Although he was Jie</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was joyful.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of inexplicable joy.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not show it, as Jisha was after all the son of the teacher.</p><p></p><p>He had to be sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>"Oh teacher, when will you ever look upon me?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard was shrouded in a black shadow, thick like undissipating ink.</p><p></p><p>Six black-armored Blood Guards carried the coffin, their sorrowful expressions genuine.</p><p></p><p>They had an intense fanaticism and trust towards the Old Lord, so naturally they would also feel grief and sorrow at the death of his son.</p><p></p><p>The funeral procession advanced in silence.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard did not scatter paper money anymore, about once every ten li he would scatter some paper, no need to do it constantly.</p><p></p><p>They did not use a dragon-horse carriage to transport the coffin, but carried it back themselves.</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored Blood Guards were all top-tier masters, nearly half-step Grand Ancestor level existences, the elite among the Blood Guards. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Therefore, even while carrying the coffin, their pace did not slow down much.</p><p></p><p>It instead showed more sincerity.</p><p></p><p>They walked for an unknown duration, and the dark clouds in the sky grew thicker, lightning flashing and thundering incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard halted his steps, looking towards the distance, where the fierce wind and rain intertwined.</p><p></p><p>In the tilted heaven and earth,</p><p></p><p>there stood a figure.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura was held back, like a terrifying dormant dragon, the five viscera and six bowels tempered, seeming to glow from under the skin.</p><p></p><p>Grand Ancestor! Zhu Chaoyang! The Overseer of the Daocheng Temple Shrine, Zhu Chaoyang.</p><p></p><p>By Zhu Chaoyang's side was a following figure, none other than Tie Shancai.</p><p></p><p>A flash of hostility flickered in the eyes of the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard.</p><p></p><p>"Overseer Zhu, what is this about?"</p><p></p><p>"Obstructing the funeral procession of the Young Lord, disturbing the Young Lord's homecoming... are you not afraid of the Old Lord's wrath?"</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard said in a deep voice, the Spiritual Origin Elixir already surging from the Nirvana within his brow.</p><p></p><p>But Zhu Chaoyang waved his hand and said, "Sir, do not think too much, this child just insists on coming to take a look..."</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's gaze shifted to Tie Shancai's figure, a hint of wariness appearing.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai... how could he not recognize him? The son of the Imperial Princess under the current Heavenly Emperor, his father an influential figure in the Shrine of the Divine Capital.</p><p></p><p>In terms of status, he was in no way inferior to the Young Lord.</p><p></p><p>Both were scions of the nobility.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard furrowed his brows, his gaze falling on Tie Shancai, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Lord has passed, sir..."</p><p></p><p>However, Tie Shancai simply waved his hand and walked over to the coffin.</p><p></p><p>The auras of the six black-armored Blood Guards simultaneously erupted.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang raised his hand, a mighty martial will sweeping down to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's expression fluctuated, but in the end he could only wave his hand.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai grinned, raising his hand to pat the coffin, then tiptoed, his small figure shattering the raindrops and floating above the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Facing the serene Jisha lying in the coffin, Tie Shancai's gaze was fixed on the blood hole in the center of his brow.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he opened his mouth, and flames of three colors erupted from his three orifices - mouth, nose, and eyes.</p><p></p><p>The flames appeared quickly and disappeared just as fast, swallowing them up after the brief flare.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai then stepped down from the coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang cupped his hands towards the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard and the six black-armored Blood Guards, giving an apologetic smile, then turned to follow Tie Shancai.</p><p></p><p>The funeral procession continued on.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang led Tie Shancai, standing in the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>When the procession had gone far away,</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai finally raised his head, his gaze burning.</p><p></p><p>"My flames... sensed it..."</p><p></p><p>"This Jisha was killed by the [Purple Flame Snake Spear]!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang was taken aback, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Among that group of brats... there must be someone who has obtained the Purple Flame Snake Spear!"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai's gaze was burning, full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't make a mistake!"</p><p></p><p>"Definitely didn't make a mistake!"</p><p></p><p>"And I guess... that the Purple Flame Snake Spear has likely fallen into the hands of that Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was gloomy, with lightning flashing and thunder rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard was very resentful, but could only endure it. If Jisha were still alive, they would not have to suffer this indignity.</p><p></p><p>However, Tie Shancai's identity was special, and he forcefully suppressed them, so they could only bear it.</p><p></p><p>After all, without the Young Lord, in terms of status, Tie Shancai was indeed the highest.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grand Ancestor Zhu Chaoyang could only obediently act as his dog.</p><p></p><p>Although he was dissatisfied in his heart, the respect he had to give, he still had to give.</p><p></p><p>Howling winds and pouring rain, lightning flashing! The raindrops connected into lines! The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard suddenly halted his steps, heavily stomping down, causing the muddy water to explode.</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored Blood Guards carrying the coffin looked over in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Stopped again? However, the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard raised his head, his eyes in the dark shadow unusually grave, more intense than ever before! There was even a hint of disbelief in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There is killing intent."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's figure abruptly transformed into a black line, disappearing without a trace, as if merging into the shadows of the falling raindrops.</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored Blood Guards, hearing the words, also had their hackles raised, their armor clanging.</p><p></p><p>They placed the Young Lord's coffin down.</p><p></p><p>The six simultaneously raised their hands, gripping the saber on their backs.</p><p></p><p>The rain stopped.</p><p></p><p>The six narrowed their eyes, looking up at the sky...</p><p></p><p>Shockingly, the raindrops falling from the sky above were blocked by an invisible barrier, prevented from falling down.</p><p></p><p>Intersecting lines, criss-crossing...</p><p></p><p>Like...</p><p></p><p>A grand chessboard!</p><p></p><p>Chessboard?! Rustle! </p><p></p><p>The chessboard seemed to only appear for a moment, then merged into the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain poured down again! Each raindrop connected into a line, turning into extremely sharp arrows whistling down! The six black-armored Blood Guards' gazes sharpened, and the next moment, their armor trembled, clanging deafeningly, their internal qi and blood surging.</p><p></p><p>As half-step Grand Ancestor level warriors, although they had not yet comprehended the true meaning and tempered their divine might, their true qi and blood were also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>The boiling blood caused the surrounding temperature to suddenly soar.</p><p></p><p>The puddles on the ground abruptly twisted into scorching white air waves.</p><p></p><p>And in the distance,</p><p></p><p>a burly figure slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—! The smoke was instantly torn open.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the true face.</p><p></p><p>Ashen and dark, exuding an aura of death, as if dragged back from the depths of hell.</p><p></p><p>Filled with ferocity, lingering in the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Wearing an extremely fierce ox-headed mask, with a scratch mark carved by nails on it.</p><p></p><p>The hidden True Immortal of the Shadow Guard immediately recognized this figure!</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, his aura momentarily fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Dufu?!"</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon of the Underworld, who had once struck on the Long Street, killing the Spiritual Immortal Priest Huang Xilongof the Hunting God Pavilion, so the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu, resurrected and defected to join the Underworld!</p><p></p><p>His appearance here now...</p><p></p><p>indicated something. The Underworld's fiends must have also arrived! Ox Demon, Horse Face, and... Monkey King! The pressure, pressing down like a mountain, filled the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld—!!! The Young Lord is already dead, and this Underworld... still won't let them go.</p><p></p><p>They actually intend to ambush them on the way.</p><p></p><p>Does this mean they want to leave them all in the Golden Light Prefecture City?!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu appeared, wearing the Ox One mask.</p><p></p><p>His burly figure suddenly shook!</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops in front of him exploded, shattered into a hazy powder! He drew his waist, and the sickle knife instantly transformed into a crescent moon blade...</p><p></p><p>Holding the crescent moon blade in one hand, the blade scraping the ground, the terrifying power instantly caused the soil and sand to explode, forming a trench!</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon blade was swung up!</p><p></p><p>The sound like thunderclap, the force like a mountain collapsing! Numerous obscure, ashen auras of blood qi and divine might undulated from Xue Dufu's body, like roaring dragons!</p><p></p><p>A total of fifteen black divine might strands intertwined and lashed out!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the might Xue Dufu displayed made the six black-armored Blood Guards unable to remain calm! Stronger, even stronger!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu had originally just entered the Divine Might Grand Ancestor realm, with only one refined divine might strand.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had enough for fifteen divine might strands, penetrating one hundred and fifty acupoints in the human body!</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon blade swept, the raging wind and rain were enveloped by the terrifying divine might, sliced through like a mountain being cut in half, surging towards them!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Just one word, like a thunderclap! The six black-armored Blood Guards roared, their qi and blood intertwined, the military joint attack technique instantly manifesting on the six of them! A huge blood armor phantom appeared, swinging a long blade, exuding a might no weaker than a Grand Ancestor, colliding with the crescent moon blade Xue Dufu had swept out!</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored Blood Guards' bodies trembled violently, unable to help but spit blood.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>the hidden True Immortal of the Shadow Guard did not attack Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>But transformed into a viper hidden in the darkness, lightning-fast, rushing towards a distant direction.</p><p></p><p>Merging into the shadows of the falling raindrops, speeding up!</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon—! The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard recognized the black-robed figure standing in the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Under the wide-brimmed hat, a cute ox-faced mask was slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>It was the Underworld fiend, Ox Demon! Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Die! The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's killing intent surged, this Ox Demon... actually dared to bring Xue Dufu to ambush them?</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Dufu was a Grand Ancestor, the military formation of the six black-armored Blood Guards could also delay a Grand Ancestor for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But he...</p><p></p><p>could easily kill the Ox Demon! The powerful divine nature exploded, the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard burst out from the reflection of a raindrop.</p><p></p><p>Appearing behind the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his body qi trembled, a strand of divine might erupted from his palm.</p><p></p><p>This True Immortal of the Shadow Guard, adept at concealment, was also a Divine Might Grand Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Although he had only barely stepped into the realm of Divine Might Grand Ancestor by using the power of his spiritual origin to push his martial dao, he had still managed to condense a strand of divine might.</p><p></p><p>But he was a Grand Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's killing intent was overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>First eliminate the Ox Demon, then go solve the problem of the traitor Xue Dufu! However...</p><p></p><p>Before his divine might fist could reach, his body suddenly seemed to be frozen.</p><p></p><p>His heart pounded, as if tightly gripped by a hand.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed! The next moment,</p><p></p><p>he found that the cute ox-faced mask of the Ox Demon had somehow turned to face him.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The Ox Demon took a step, the tip of his foot striking the ground with a thunderous sound! The entire ground trembled, countless mud and water puddles exploding, accompanied by the shattering of soil and stones, surging up from both sides of the Ox Demon like a tidal wave!</p><p></p><p>Like a speedboat, suddenly tearing through the white waves on a great river!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's figure abruptly swelled up, like inflating.</p><p></p><p>Expanding and growing larger, the muscular frame twisting and stretching to two and a half meters tall!</p><p></p><p>The tight-fitting clothes outlined the lines of muscles, forged like a thousand hammers.</p><p></p><p>Martial will, dragon-elephant-gold-steel! Boom—! The raindrops seemed to be suspended in the air at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Then, a leaping divine might, like a blood-colored lightning, intertwined and coiled around the Ox Demon's huge fist like a hammer.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying martial will!</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying divine might!!</p><p></p><p>So brilliant, like the ultimate blazing of the sun's divine might...</p><p></p><p>This is...</p><p></p><p>A Grand Ancestor?!</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's brain buzzed, as if about to explode, he too was a Grand Ancestor...</p><p></p><p>But his divine might compared to the Ox Demon's divine might...</p><p></p><p>was like a firefly to the full moon!</p><p></p><p>But the great terror of life and death quickly brought him back to his senses, the Spiritual Origin Elixir instantly leaping out from between his brows!</p><p></p><p>Just a strand of divine might!</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong, how brilliant...</p><p></p><p>it was still just a strand of divine might!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Origin Elixir trembled unceasingly, the mighty divine nature like towering waves, a thundering waterfall! </p><p></p><p>Fusing the divine nature power with the martial dao divine might! In an instant, dazzlingly brilliant, it transformed into an ultimate dazzling dagger, intending to slash across the Ox Demon's neck, severing that huge ox head! This strike, if used against Xue Dufu, would undoubtedly be fatal!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon did not retreat in the least, his eyes even blazing with fanaticism and excitement!</p><p></p><p>Facing the True Immortal of the Shadow Guard's terrifying kill strike combining divine nature and divine might!</p><p></p><p>Twisting his waist!</p><p></p><p>Shifting his body!</p><p></p><p>Punching out!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's five fingers clenched into a fist, intertwining the brilliant condensed divine might lightning! The cute ox-faced mask's brow suddenly cracked open, revealing an eye, the divine light dazzling, the seven-wheel spiritual foundation pulsing on the Ox Demon's back, like a peacock spreading its tail!</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual foundation wheels, it was as if there were carved dragon statues emerging, lifelike, containing the seven emotions, the dragon roars shaking the heavens!</p><p></p><p>One punch struck out!

        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire stone-paved mountain path seemed to roll and tremble like a giant dragon, causing countless accumulated snows on the mountain path to surge and plummet down like an avalanche.</p><p></p><p>The old man with one sleeve stepped onto the blue stones, and his bearing became completely different.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had awakened in an instant, like a fierce tiger opening its eyes, shaking the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>A shout of "Worship the Mountain" suddenly erupted like thunderous sound waves! It whipped up a surging airflow, like a tide, which forcefully blocked the falling avalanche waves.</p><p></p><p>Countless white dust clouds, like vast ocean waves, were kicked up!</p><p></p><p>Then, the old man with one sleeve took a step, and his body suddenly shot up like a cannon shell.</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast.</p><p></p><p>Extremely fast! Faster than an arrow released from a bow! Whoosh—! The howling winter winds were all suppressed and pushed down, and an indescribable might, twisting the air, radiated out from around the old man, as if forming a unique domain! The surging hot blood caused the white snow on the mountains to evaporate and the void to become hazy and distorted.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a great sun had risen from the foot of the mountain, majestic and brilliant, radiating light and heat! The Grand Master! At this moment, the entire Golden Light Sect was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Within the mountain gate, the disciples of each peak and vein were all startled in their hearts, alerted by this.Almost at the same time.</p><p></p><p>On top of several peaks within the sect, there were extremely powerful auras that burst forth and twisted. On the Thunderclap Peak, Li Qingshan's expression turned gloomy, and he gripped the ram's horn mace that slid into his palm.</p><p></p><p>With the gate wide open, he stepped forward quickly, and the aura of his divine form erupted, as if a thunderous divine general with wings on his back had appeared across the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>On the Two Sleeves Peak, the Confucian elder Zhang Qingzheng, who was reading a book, suddenly slammed the book down, his anger uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>He took a step out, with a vast and sweeping momentum, and shot out.</p><p></p><p>On the Red Cloud Peak, Zhu Hongdou, who was wiping her scarlet divine spear, sensed the aura of the Grand Master bursting forth from the foot of the mountain at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, she drew her spear and shot out.</p><p></p><p>On the South Mountain Peak, the eldest elder Weng Wuyu sighed lightly, tapping his peach wood cane, and also stepped out.</p><p></p><p>On the Golden Light Peak, Nan Lihuo's expression remained calm, his white robe fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>By his side, the Taoist Wang Kuyu's expression became increasingly bitter.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, it seems your guess was right... This young prince just couldn't sit still and has come after all."</p><p></p><p>"Worshiping the mountain, this is actually a show of force."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu shook his head lightly.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo smiled: "No, it's not a show of force... but a test."</p><p></p><p>"A test?" Wang Kuyu asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"He's testing you, shixiong... The young prince is ostensibly here to see Xixie, wanting to see the divine talent of the Golden Light Manor, but in reality, having the Grand Master worship the mountain..."</p><p></p><p>"The purpose is to test the strength of you, the orthodox inheritor of the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Golden Light Sect is a branch of the Divine Sect, and since the orthodox inheritor is here, he naturally won't stand idly by, also representing the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master worshiping the mountain is to see if the Divine Sect has sent a Divine Element True Man this time."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's white robe fluttered, and his white hair was also blown about.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... It seems that's the case."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo looked at Wang Kuyu meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Whether to fight or not, whether to kill or not, sometimes it may not be up to one's own choice.</p><p></p><p>Without further words, his large sleeves billowed behind him as he stepped out and floated down to the main platform of the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan and Sang Guanyin arrived one after the other.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, the chubby boy Zhou Peng, the stunningly beautiful girl Yunye, and many other elite and superior spirit children training on the Golden Light Peak gathered around.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, someone wants to fight!" Xixie exclaimed excitedly, her big eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>"Shh... Xixie, you shouldn't say that carelessly," the chubby Zhou Peng hurriedly said, his face jiggling.</p><p></p><p>Xixie tilted her head, "But the other side is provoking us, isn't worshiping the mountain the same as wanting to fight?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Peng's head spun like a rattle drum, "Of course not, this visitor is the Grand Master... Who can fight the Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless our orthodox sect's Grand Masters come over, or a Divine Element True Man intervenes... Otherwise, we'll most likely get beaten up."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master's physical body is flawless and impeccable, condensing divine might, with their spirit and blood refined into a precious elixir of the body, reaching the realm of the Robe Perfected, able to look down on all heroes!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Peng took a deep breath, explaining the Grand Master's immense power to Xixie. Xixie opened her mouth, her eyes sparkling, "Then how many fireworks do we need to blow up to make him poop?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Peng: "..."</p><p></p><p>Well, he had wasted his effort explaining, this girl's mind was only filled with fighting.</p><p></p><p>She has no fear of the Grand Master at all... </p><p></p><p>Truly... she's a real bull calf!</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Yunye covered her mouth and giggled, gently pulling Xixie aside to whisper something.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's expression immediately became serious.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo arrived with his hands behind his back, glancing at the group of little ones, but did not ask them to leave.</p><p></p><p>He was not worried that the young prince, accompanied by the Grand Master, would dare to unleash a massacre within the Golden Light Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>After all, the hosting of the Temple God Resonance still required the participation of the Golden Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, it was just to worship the mountain, use their aura to suppress their peers, and intimidate the divine children and spirit children of the Divine Sect, so that they would not perform well in the upcoming Temple God Resonance.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The entire mountain peak was shaking.</p><p></p><p>The four divine form elders arrived one after another, landing on the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's expression was gloomy, gripping the ram's horn mace, feeling the oppressive force that made him struggle to breathe, involuntarily adjusting the fluctuations of the qi in his body.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>Their physical body is flawless and impeccable, forming an indestructible divine body, refining their five viscera and six bowels to the extreme, with qi circulating throughout their body and the hundred acupoints, condensing divine might. Their divine will, qi, and physical body have formed a precious elixir of the body! Reaching the realm of the Robe Perfected, their will is divine!</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying aspect of the Grand Master is their formidable martial dao will!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan is currently a Sect Master Perfected, having mastered the ultimate technique of the Eight Coiling Dragons Overturning the River, refining five qi blood dragons.</p><p></p><p>But to step into the realm of the Grand Master, it is still far away, and he can't even see any hope.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend the true meaning, refine the five viscera and six bowels, and cultivate a supreme technique to the Realm of Transformation, forming a true meaning domain, is to reach the Sect Master Perfected, which seems to be only one step away from the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, this step is much more difficult than anyone can imagine.</p><p></p><p>Just like an Elementalist wanting to break through the barrier and reach the Divine Element realm, becoming a Divine Element True Man, the difficulty is even greater!</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master, on a bloody and murderous battlefield, can withstand and defeat thousands of troops without being defeated.</p><p></p><p>Not just ordinary troops, but the most elite, battle-hardened iron-armored soldiers of the Great Xing Dynasty! Even a Grand Master who has just condensed divine might would be considered a top-tier expert in the Dao City.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's expression remained calm, his divine sense expanding to suppress all the terrifying auras, so that the spirit children would not be affected.</p><p></p><p>When the young prince entered the Golden Light Manor, he had already anticipated this would happen, so he was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>As the son of the Pacifying King Gui Moli, his actions were so overbearing, which could be understood.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>A sound of breaking through the air resounded, and then an old one-armed man suddenly landed on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>With just one step, it was as if the entire mountain forest had been trampled, causing countless plants and soil to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Countless airflows seemed to condense into substance and were ruthlessly torn apart, and thunderous roars echoed ceaselessly across the entire mountain peak!</p><p></p><p>The old man landed in front of the main platform.</p><p></p><p>His black hair flew, and the empty sleeve of his robe flapped in the air. Although he was wearing only straw sandals, no one dared to underestimate his might.</p><p></p><p>"The divine might Grand Master... Xue Dufu."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with the powerful figures around Gui Moli.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu slowly opened his eyes, and at that moment, the wind and snow on the entire mountain peak suddenly ceased.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the night sky had been shrouded in an even thicker and deeper darkness, the heavens and earth darkened, oppressive and confined.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial dao will of the Grand Master! Xue Dufu did not attack, but merely manifested his martial dao will, creating an extremely terrifying oppression.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's expression became solemn, and the divine form behind him emerged, the brilliant golden light illuminating him.</p><p></p><p>His entire body and bones resonated, as he was also a Sect Master Perfected warrior, and his physical body involuntarily emitted a resplendent hum.</p><p></p><p>This was the self-defense reaction after sensing the martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>A light sigh suddenly came from within the temple.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's gaze slightly moved, and the black hatchet at his waist began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Taoist slowly walked out of the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Dufu, you can worship the mountain, but why be so overbearing? Your martial dao will is like raging fire, how can these children withstand it?"</p><p></p><p>"This is too much."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist sighed again.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he flicked his duster.</p><p></p><p>Forming a hand seal, his entire body radiated with divine nature, and a golden spirit relic the size of a palm suddenly floated up behind him, spinning slowly.</p><p></p><p>Within the spirit relic, a divine form was contained, the golden light dazzling and resplendent!</p><p></p><p>Countless divine natures, divine wills, and divine souls were all stored within.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Element Elixir!</p><p></p><p>The moment this Divine Element Elixir appeared,</p><p></p><p>an extremely terrifying pressure erupted from the Taoist, like a vast and towering tidal wave, ruthlessly crashing towards Xue Dufu's martial dao will!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Like the drumming of heaven and earth, a muffled explosion! Xue Dufu was actually forced to retreat a step, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>His hand had already firmly grasped the black hatchet at his waist.</p><p></p><p>"A Divine Element True Man?"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Kuyu of the Qian Yuan Divine Sect... You've broken through to the Divine Element realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu took a deep breath, feeling the boiling divine nature level suppressing and assaulting his martial dao will.</p><p></p><p>His expression became much more serious.</p><p></p><p>Just as the young prince had guessed, the Qian Yuan Divine Sect... had indeed sent a Divine Element True Man!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the entire Golden Light Peak fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, Zhu Hongdou, and the other divine form elders all turned back in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the terrifying level pressure that almost made their divine forms and divine natures unable to circulate and flow...</p><p></p><p>They were all shocked and terrified.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Element True Man!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's shixiong had actually succeeded in refining the nine-life Divine Element Elixir and become a Divine Element True Man! Nan Lihuo looked back, his deep gaze carrying a hint of contentment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Light Manor City was shaking.</p><p></p><p>When the young prince brought a Grand Master to worship the Golden Light Sect, all the powerful figures within the manor city were alerted.</p><p></p><p>The divine form patriarchs of the Qin, Hai, Gong, and Gongyuan families all shot up into the sky, their divine senses spreading out, sensing from afar.</p><p></p><p>That was a Grand Master after all...</p><p></p><p>A martial dao Grand Master could even contend with a Divine Element True Man! If this martial dao Grand Master had also stepped into the Divine Element realm in the divine nature aspect, that would be even more terrifying!</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Dufu had not reached the Divine Element realm in the divine nature aspect, only the divine form realm. Because he had spent most of his time cultivating the martial dao, his divine nature cultivation naturally lagged behind.</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Master..."</p><p></p><p>The several divine form patriarchs' expressions kept changing, filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>However, they also knew that this battle could not be fought, as the young prince only wanted to worship the mountain and meet the spirit children, and would not actually start a fight.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the divine form patriarchs changed expression again.</p><p></p><p>Because an aura even more powerful than the Grand Master's martial dao will erupted, and from afar, they could even glimpse the terrifying Divine Element Elixir!</p><p></p><p>"A Divine Element True Man?!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the patriarchs of the major families finally understood the young prince's purpose.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to probe the foundation of the Divine Sect within the Golden Light Manor!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sect had hidden a Divine Element True Man in the Golden Light Manor, something no one had expected.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the patriarchs were all filled with a chill.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the cliff-side treasure tower, in the Heavenly Observation Bureau, in the examination room,</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the child next to the white-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>A familiar feeling suddenly washed over him.</p><p></p><p>The sleeve crossbow, the thousand spider silk...</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his sleeve, the sleeve crossbow and thousand spider silk hidden within suddenly felt a bit scalding.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>The flying thunder chess pieces left on Xixie suddenly sensed the events unfolding on the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Even without the flying thunder chess pieces' perception, the powerful aura erupting from the Golden Light Peak could basically be felt.</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Supervisor and the Heavenly Observation Bureau Deputy Supervisor who had come from the Dao City exchanged a glance, and the two of them disappeared from the room almost simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure landed atop the tower of the Qintianjian Observatory, gazing towards the direction of the mountain gate of the Jinguang Division.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, he is the son of Jimo Li, fierce and unparalleled, he has indeed allowed himself to be tested..."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that Wang Kuyu would actually condense a divine elixir and break through to the Divine Realm, attaining the position of a True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>The Observatory Director sighed deeply, and in this moment, he couldn't help but want to play a tune on the erhu.</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Director from the Capital City arrived, his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze flickering as he gave a slight nod.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it was unexpected..."</p><p></p><p>He and Wang Kuyu both hailed from the Capital City, but Wang Kuyu had broken through to the Divine Realm...</p><p></p><p>He had been hiding this so well.</p><p></p><p>"When an Eminent Cultivator breaks through to the Divine Realm, the momentum is truly grand, and they would sometimes even invite people to witness the ceremony."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Wang Kuyu might have deliberately hidden himself, just so he could come to the Jinguang Prefecture City, for the sake of this temple deity resonance..."</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Director from the Capital City, Lu Yao, smiled faintly, his gaze shining.</p><p></p><p>The Observatory Director glanced at him but did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to fight, he just wants to test these prodigies, to see if there are any threats."</p><p></p><p>"If there's no fight, it's no big deal, we'll continue the assessment."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they had returned to the assessment chamber.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood quietly, and the prodigy beside Lu Yao stared at Li Che with wide eyes, as if he had found a familiar aura about him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao glanced at Li Che, smiling faintly: "Master Li Che, did you inherit the legacy of the Tang Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"After the fall of the Tang Clan, most of their disciples joined the Qintianjian in search of a path, and this prodigy is from the Capital City, the newly risen Tang Clan - Tang Ren."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che was suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>So he was a legitimate scion of the Tang Clan.</p><p></p><p>"I once entered the Shenjiao Ridge and gained the appreciation of the Ridge Master, who imparted some formation techniques to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che replied with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>The young boy, Tang Ren, suddenly brightened: "Could it be the Granduncle Tang Sangjia?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, and the young boy became overjoyed, almost wanting to run over and tug at Li Che's sleeve to take him to find the Ridge Master, Tang Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>"Tang Ren, don't be so reckless, Master Li is about to prepare for the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Tang Ren heard this and immediately released Li Che's sleeve, standing obediently to the side, but his eyes still held a fervent eagerness to see an old acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and looked towards the Examiner, Lu Yao.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao nodded, and the assessment chamber fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, a citizen of Feiluo City, has been engaged in wood carving for over four years, and last year entered the Qintianjian in Jinguang Prefecture City, passing the Third-Grade Clientele Assessment and becoming a Third-Grade Clientele."</p><p></p><p>"This year, he has initiated the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment, and if he fails to pass this time, he cannot initiate another assessment for three years."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said solemnly, his voice echoing in the assessment chamber.</p><p></p><p>"The Second-Grade Clientele Assessment is presided over by the Deputy Director of the Qintianjian in the Capital City, Lu Yao, and all records will be kept. If there are any objections, they can be appealed to the Qintianjian in the Divine Capital."</p><p></p><p>As the assessment began, the atmosphere gradually became solemn.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Shangguan Qinghong and Gong Yunli were huddled together, having brought small stools to sit in the corner, one munching on melon seeds and the other eating snacks, both excited and anticipating Li Che's assessment.</p><p></p><p>The Second-Grade Clientele Assessment was far more difficult than the Third-Grade one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had initiated the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment in just one year, and Gong Yunli was actually not very optimistic.</p><p></p><p>But what he had accumulated in that one year was not insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao nodded, slowly writing in the record book: "Unblemished background, diligently taking on tasks in the Qintianjian of the Prefecture City for a year."</p><p></p><p>"Now, he will initiate the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment."</p><p></p><p>"The Second-Grade Clientele Assessment has three aspects."</p><p></p><p>"They are cultivation, mastery of the 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique', and wood carving skill."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked at Li Che and said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"First, the cultivation assessment. To become a Second-Grade Clientele, one's qi and blood cultivation must reach the Penetrating Meridian Realm, and one's spiritual cultivation must have forged a Divine Foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, demonstrate your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the gazes of everyone in the assessment chamber shifted, all curious about Li Che's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Meeting the cultivation standard was a hard requirement, and if one's cultivation did not meet the standard, the assessment would be directly terminated, with no need to proceed further.</p><p></p><p>This was the standard of the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment.</p><p></p><p>But exactly what Li Che's cultivation was, many were not too clear.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli and the others knew that Li Che's cultivation time was not long, and he was extremely low-key, working a 9-to-5 job in the Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Even though his daughter had entered the Divine Sect and become a prodigy, he still maintained his low-key personality.</p><p></p><p>Exactly what cultivation Li Che had, the others were not too sure.</p><p></p><p>The assessment chamber was deathly silent, all waiting for Li Che to demonstrate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, but showed no sign of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>For him, meeting this cultivation standard was truly too easy.</p><p></p><p>But now, the question was how much cultivation he should reveal.</p><p></p><p>His ink-black robe fluttered slightly as he took a step forward, clenching his five fingers, his qi surging, his bones and sinews resonating, as if a qi vein was running from the top of his head all the way down to his feet, emitting a resounding sound.</p><p></p><p>"His qi and blood martial dao cultivation has indeed reached the Meridian Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli, chewing on a honey-preserved fruit, nodded approvingly, a gleam of delight in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, her foxy eyes suddenly widened.</p><p></p><p>Because as Li Che clenched his five fingers, the airflow in the assessment chamber seemed to be completely grasped by him, surging and fluctuating incessantly! Penetrating Meridian Realm! Gong Yunli exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>And as Li Che's body trembled again, the realm of the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist merged into his physique, causing his qi and blood to undergo a transformation, as if an enraged tiger had descended from the mountain!</p><p></p><p>The people in the room seemed to hear the roar of a tiger, causing the entire room to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Meridian!" </p><p></p><p>Gongyangliancheng's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The powerful qi and blood surged and then gradually subsided, and Li Che's face bore a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Director Lu, now for the spiritual cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao nodded slightly, his gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in place, raising his hand and tapping his brow at the Niwan acupoint.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the assessment chamber suddenly began to boil, and then a divine foundation rose from behind Li Che!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>When did Kezhi breakthrough to the Divine Foundation realm?</p><p></p><p>So fast...</p><p></p><p>The last time during the Third-Grade Clientele Assessment, Kezhi was only at the level of Tranquil Cultivation, right?</p><p></p><p>In just one year, Kezhi directly broke through from Blood Refinement to Divine Meridian, forging a Divine Foundation from Tranquil Cultivation...</p><p></p><p>It was truly astonishing! What kind of monster was this? Such talent... too extraordinary! But thinking about how Li Che's daughter was the rare Jingguan Prefecture Prodigy Xixie, it did make sense.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao glanced at the record book, his brow slightly raised: "Nine Luminaries Suspended Thought Flow Divine Foundation... not bad, it meets the requirement."</p><p></p><p>"But you were only at the level of Tranquil Cultivation a year ago, how did you forge a Divine Foundation in just a year?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's gaze swept over him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che retracted his Divine Foundation back to the Niwan, smiling: "Perhaps... the resources in the Prefecture City are abundant, and the food is good."</p><p></p><p>"This year, I have diligently worked, earning a total of fifty-six Divine Essence Crystals, all of which I have refined, allowing me to break through in my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Director Lu, you may not know, but Li Che... is the biological father of the Jingguan Prefecture Prodigy, Xixie."</p><p></p><p>The Observatory Director stroked his beard and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"When Li Qingshan went to Feiluo City to test the spiritual children, Li Che's talent was also detected. Although he is twenty years old, his spiritual nature is pure and flawless, truly a supreme spiritual child..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that he is a bit older, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao heard this and smiled, looking at Li Che, a twenty-two-year-old spiritual child? He didn't have too much doubt.</p><p></p><p>Under his spiritual sense, Li Che's cultivation was indeed consistent with what he had displayed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao had more confidence in his own spiritual sense detection.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think Li Che could hide it from his spiritual exploration.</p><p></p><p>After recording Li Che's current cultivation realm in the record book, it meant that Li Che had passed the first cultivation assessment.</p><p></p><p>"The second item... is to test your mastery of the 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique'. This 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique' is a fusion of spiritual techniques and spiritual martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Elemental Divine Sculpture Techniques, and the Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Pinnacle..."</p><p></p><p>"Demonstrate it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said.</p><p></p><p>For the Qintianjian Clientele, the 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique' was the most important. The level of mastery of this technique passed down by the Qintianjian was also related to the evaluation of the Clientele.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Yao finished speaking, Li Che immediately took action, his qi and blood surging, and in an instant, he swung out an arm.</p><p></p><p>Countless illusory images layered upon each other, dense and numerous, as if they had formed thousands of arms behind him, each arm in a different posture, the five fingers moving in various ways, some grasping, some carving, some pressing...</p><p></p><p>Boom! The thousand hands converged, striking the air in front of him, the airflow surging and shooting out, as if it had struck the surface of a cowhide drum, emitting an earth-shattering rumble!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh-</p><p></p><p>Li Che swung his arm again, his qi and blood surging like an overturned furnace, the countless illusory arm images layering up until they were almost solidified, spreading out behind Li Che like a peacock displaying its tail!</p><p></p><p>"Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique... Mastery Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! After Li Che demonstrated this Divine Sculpture Technique, an exclamation resounded in the assessment chamber.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong, Gong Yunli, and Gongyangliancheng were all greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>In just one year, he had mastered the Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique to the Mastery Realm? This was true talent, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's wood carving talent was exceptional, and he had a bonus in learning the Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique... but this bonus was too much, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Even the Observatory Director and Lu Yao revealed expressions of surprise.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that Li Che would only be able to reach the Perfected Realm in this Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique, never expecting him to cross into the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had the confidence to initiate the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmed his aura, the illusory thousand hands disappearing, his expression serene.</p><p></p><p>With the improvement of his own cultivation, Li Che could also appropriately reveal a bit more of his true identity's cultivation, in order to gain more benefits.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao narrowed his eyes, somewhat astonished as he scrutinized the gentle young man before him.</p><p></p><p>This young man... had the bearing of a Special-Grade Clientele! According to the record book, his growth speed was too fast! He was a good seedling! Lu Yao couldn't help but develop the thought of recruiting him.</p><p></p><p>Such a good seedling, if he went to the Qintianjian in the Capital City, he could obtain more resources and develop and improve even faster.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, the Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique has been mastered to the Mastery Realm, meeting the requirements of the Second-Grade Clientele. Next is the final assessment item."</p><p></p><p>"Wood carving skill assessment!"</p><p></p><p>"Independent carving."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao stood up.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Three seemingly very simple wood sculptures appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>But the expressions on the wood sculptures were lifelike, as if they were about to come alive.</p><p></p><p>"These three are from the Mysterious Temple Deity wood sculptures. You have one incense stick's worth of time to complete an independent wood sculpture."</p><p></p><p>"After the carving is finished, your wood sculpture will be placed alongside the three temple deity wood sculptures."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, there will be a clash of spiritual energies. If your wood sculpture can withstand the three temple deity wood sculptures for ten breaths, you will be considered to have passed the assessment!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze immediately fell upon the three temple deity wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly understood why the Observatory Director had him visit the Mysterious Temple to observe the temple deities before he proposed to take the Second-Grade Clientele Assessment.</p><p></p><p>It was to prepare for this moment? Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had no fear or nervousness in his heart at all.</p><p></p><p>He swept a glance over the three temple deity wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>He slowly walked to the pile of wood materials, selected a piece of Octagonal Spirit Wood, gently tapping it, causing his qi and blood to surge, evaporating the moisture within the spirit wood.</p><p></p><p>Then he returned to the workbench.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a carving knife, he began to carve.</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't plan to hide his abilities, he wanted to show off a bit.</p><p></p><p>His gaze suddenly became sharp, the level 4 [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit pulsing in his chest, the carving knife dancing in his palm, and the next moment, it fell upon the wood.</p><p></p><p>Amid the tearing sounds, wood chips flew. Knife rising and falling, the knife light like a dragon! Gradually, a wood sculpture took shape under Li Che's knife!</p><p></p><p>Wearing golden mail armor, a phoenix-winged purple gold crown on his head.</p><p></p><p>His eyes like golden fire.</p><p></p><p>Holding a Chaos Cudgel, stepping on the Clouds and Mist!</p><p></p><p>Instantly!</p><p></p><p>The three temple deity wood sculptures that Lu Yao had placed on the table... uncontrollably erupted with spiritual energy! The spiritual energy in the assessment chamber surged and roiled! In the Nine Dragon River, the river waters rose in great waves!</p>

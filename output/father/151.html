            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky was snowing.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, it was silent, only the sound of the soft snow rubbing against the ground could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he gripped the seven-element spiritual crystal, the only one he had.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity spiritual chess pieces were exhausted, and opening the tower lacked the blessing... the power was greatly discounted.</p><p></p><p>Without the temple deity spiritual chess pieces, he felt insecure...</p><p></p><p>It was still half a year away from entering the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>And he couldn't use the Heavenly King spiritual chess piece every time he opened the tower, right?</p><p></p><p>So, Li Che was still quite looking forward to going to that [Fire-Eyed Mysterious Awakening Ape] mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>But before that, he had to convert all his resources into improving his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Gripping that seven-element spiritual crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The [Immaculate Heart] fruit in his chest began to beat violently, and a mighty suction force burst forth from it.</p><p></p><p>It was just like the feeling when he first absorbed the pale divine energy from the Eight Extremes spiritual crystals.</p><p></p><p>That... refreshing feeling like drinking an ice-cold Sprite on a hot summer day! Rumbling—</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a faint rumbling sound echoing and vibrating in the inner world of his Nirvana.</p><p></p><p>The flawless divine energy contained in the seven-element spiritual crystal was extremely mighty, like a breached dam, pouring out the water flow frantically.</p><p></p><p>It surged into Li Che's Nirvana inner world, surging into the Immaculate Heart spiritual foundation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even had the illusion that he had swollen up, being supported by the abundant divine energy.</p><p></p><p>And the Immaculate Heart fruit, whose advancement speed had become increasingly slow after reaching level 3, began to accelerate again!</p><p></p><p>Li Che focused his spirit, fully immersing himself in the refinement of the seven-element spiritual crystal.</p><p></p><p>2%... 2%... 2%...</p><p></p><p>In two or three breaths, the maturity would increase by 2%, a feeling of soaring! Awesome! That's the feeling!</p><p></p><p>Intoxicating!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were shining, and the Nirvana inner world was glowing!</p><p></p><p>The Immaculate Heart spiritual foundation was rapidly growing, and the aura was constantly rising! Even the seven emotions spiritual foundation was slightly trembling, cheering and wanting to share the feast.</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>The exhaled airflow seemed to form a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>The rapid advancement was always short-lived.</p><p></p><p>The eyes opened and closed, as if a milky white light flashed from the bottom of the eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Fruit: Immaculate Heart (lv3, 39%)]</p><p></p><p>A seven-element spiritual crystal was soon drained and turned into a transparent crystal stone, lying quietly in Li Che's palm.</p><p></p><p>"It increased by 30% in maturity, a little lower than expected, but the lingering feeling of the Immaculate Heart fruit..."</p><p></p><p>"The next seven-element spiritual crystal should still be able to bring a rapid advancement."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes and felt his condition.</p><p></p><p>The Immaculate Heart spiritual foundation had reached the level of the spiritual foundation after the boundary, and the balancing and lubricating effect on the seven emotions spiritual foundation was becoming better and better.</p><p></p><p>The coordination of divine energy between the seven emotions spiritual foundation had also reached a state of ease.</p><p></p><p>"But to forge the seven divine images of the seven emotions spiritual foundation... is not an easy task."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan's forging of the divine image was so grand in scale, if I were to forge the seven emotions spiritual foundation... the scale would certainly be even greater."</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned, worrying about how to deal with his breakthrough to the divine image in the future.</p><p></p><p>And once his possession of the seven spiritual foundations was exposed, it might attract the attention of those with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>The danger would increase.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's usually stable mentality naturally did not allow such a situation to occur.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I can only find a remote and uninhabited place to break through secretly when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Putting away the remnants of the seven-element spiritual crystal, Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so poor..."</p><p></p><p>"If only I had a few more seven-element spiritual crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the sect master going to hire the Ox Demon and Horse Face to assassinate Su Huaili? Why hasn't he made a move yet?" Li Che couldn't help muttering.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, he stretched.</p><p></p><p>He opened the spatial rift and took out one eight-extremes spiritual crystal after another, handing them to the seven [Painting Immortals] avatars in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Let them refine the eight-extremes spiritual crystals to nourish their nature and improve the divine energy of the seven emotions spiritual foundation.</p><p></p><p>He also encouraged them again, for the avatar researching the [Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Tank].</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the divine wood sculptures of the avatars and headed towards the Qingtian Monitoring Cliff Stone Treasure Tower.</p><p></p><p>The snow fell on the long street, more silent than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a hat and a black robe, walked along the long street.</p><p></p><p>Passing by the riverside, the surface of the river seemed to have a light breeze blowing over it, occasionally rippling.</p><p></p><p>The snow fell on it, twirled slightly, and then melted and sank into the water.</p><p></p><p>The clear spring snow, suddenly remembering the clear river and the visible sand.</p><p></p><p>The snowy scenery of the Nine Dragons River had a unique charm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Nine Dragons River did not freeze.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could truly experience the loneliness of the solitary fisherman in the straw hat, fishing alone in the icy river.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the Qingtian Monitoring.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the completed wood sculpture to Shangguan Qinghong, asking her to deliver it, Li Che planned to go to the workshop.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Che, wait, your second-rank client assessment has been approved, and the personnel from the Dao City of the Qingtian Monitoring have arrived. They should arrive in about half a month, so you should prepare well."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the Junior Supervisor is looking for you. She said she was following the orders of the Monitoring Supervisor and wants to take you to visit the Divine Sculpture Ridge today."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's steps suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Sculpture Ridge?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Divine Sculpture Ridge... Most of the spiritual wood resources come from the Divine Sculpture Ridge. In the future, if you need higher-quality spiritual wood, you'll need to go to the Divine Sculpture Ridge to find it."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong said with a smile as she cracked melon seeds.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was about to ask more about the Divine Sculpture Ridge.</p><p></p><p>The rarely seen Gong Yunli had already arrived, her elegant dress flowing, her face lightly powdered, her broad chest, walking with her hands behind her back.</p><p></p><p>"Client Li, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said.</p><p></p><p>The two of them left the Qingtian Monitoring Treasure Tower, and a luxurious carriage with the Gong family's emblem was waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>Li Che climbed into the carriage, which was spacious and comfortable inside, and couldn't help but marvel at the extravagance of these aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli also climbed into the carriage, sitting opposite Li Che, and began to brew tea.</p><p></p><p>The coachman drove the carriage as soon as the two of them got in.</p><p></p><p>The spirited horses neighed, and the hooves echoed on the blue stones.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sculpture Ridge is quite far outside the Gold Light Prefecture City... it will take some time to get there." Gong Yunli poured the tea and handed a cup to Li Che, then sipped her own cup.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Supervisor, the Divine Sculpture Ridge... is also a force in the prefecture city, right?" Li Che asked curiously after taking a sip of the tea.</p><p></p><p>He had previously understood little, and now that he was about to enter the Divine Sculpture Ridge, he naturally had to do some research in advance.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sculpture Ridge is actually under the Divine Sect... The Dao City Divine Sect has the Dao City Divine Sculpture Ridge, and each state's branch sect has its own Divine Sculpture Ridge."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sculpture Ridge is generally located near the mountain gate of the Divine Sect. The Qianyuan Divine Sect's Yunzhou branch is located in the Gold Light Prefecture, so the Divine Sculpture Ridge is also located in the Gold Light Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, it belongs to the Divine Sect's forces."</p><p></p><p>"But in most cases, the major forces in the prefecture city will regard it as an independent force."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said softly.</p><p></p><p>"An independent force?" Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli nodded and lightly hummed, "The Divine Sculpture Ridge... is more like a gathering place for wood carving masters."</p><p></p><p>"The divine sculptures required for the cultivation of the inner disciples of the Divine Sect mountain gate all come from the Divine Sculpture Ridge."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sculpture Ridge has a dedicated team of wood carving masters."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli looked out the window at the scenery.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the same as the wood carving master clients of the Qingtian Monitoring?" Li Che raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli's long eyelashes fluttered, and she looked at Li Che and shook her head, "Of course not, the clients of the Qingtian Monitoring can be wood carving masters, weapon forging masters, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>"And they are not limited by identity. The wood carving masters of the Divine Sculpture Ridge, few of them have passed the assessment of the Qingtian Monitoring's third-rank client identity."</p><p></p><p>"And the Overseer of the Divine Sculpture Ridge... is the first-rank client of our Qingtian Monitoring."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli finished speaking, and Li Che couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"First-rank client?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was well aware of the requirements for a first-rank client, which were not easy to meet.</p><p></p><p>Even third-rank clients who are ten-star wood carving masters can pass.</p><p></p><p>The second-rank may require the level of an Eight Extremes master.</p><p></p><p>The first-rank client, however, needs to be able to carve seven-element divine wood sculptures!</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but think of the seven-element divine statue that Li Qingshan had observed his divine image with.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it must have been created by the hand of this first-rank client of the Divine Sculpture Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"That Overseer... has a special identity, you'll see him soon, remember to be polite." Gong Yunli reminded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded repeatedly, a seven-element wood carving master...</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally had to put on a bright smile, as he might need the seven-element divine sculptures for Xixing's cultivation, and he couldn't afford to be blocked in terms of resources.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, yes, that Divine Sculpture Ridge Overseer... his surname is Tang."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli thought of something and introduced him to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Skilled in mechanical techniques."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The carriage sped out of the prefecture city and flew along the official road.</p><p></p><p>The coachman kept whipping the reins, and the spirited horses ran faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>These horses might have some demonic bloodline, fast and enduring...</p><p></p><p>About an hour or so.</p><p></p><p>Under the swift and electric carriage, they finally reached their destination.</p><p></p><p>The carriage drove into a small town.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of a vast manor in the center of the town.</p><p></p><p>"We're here."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Divine Sculpture Town under the jurisdiction of the Divine Sculpture Ridge."</p><p></p><p>"Each Divine Sculpture Ridge has such a small town, where you can find wood carving masters to order divine wood sculptures, and also buy spiritual wood and so on..."</p><p></p><p>"The five great families, the five great sects, the Gold Light branch sect, the Temple Supervisor's Office, the Qingtian Monitoring, and the City Lord's Mansion all have outposts here."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli introduced.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the manor gate, Gong Yunli took out an introduction letter and was then led inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Che followed Gong Yunli, walking through the long corridor filled with the fragrance of various types of wood, looking up to see the endless white mountains covered in thick snow.</p><p></p><p>The mountains seemed like a sleeping dragon, coiled between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, passing through the workshop area, he could see the densely packed workshops, and even see some laborers in the snowy weather, bare-chested and puffing hot breath, carefully moving the wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but look a few more times, his gaze revealing a nostalgic look.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he was also a laborer in a wood carving workshop.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sculpture Ridge was like a giant wood carving workshop.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at?" Gong Yunli saw Li Che pausing and looked at the bare-chested laborers with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>These laborers had shallow cultivation, mostly just skin-refining or tendon-refining warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Supervisor, you don't know... I used to be just a laborer in a wood carving workshop, carrying wood sculptures and materials on my shoulders, carrying the burden of my family."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing such a familiar scene, I can't help but be filled with mixed emotions."</p><p></p><p>Li Che finished speaking, and Gong Yunli's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>A laborer from the mud-legged class.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a third-rank client of the Qingtian Monitoring...</p><p></p><p>It was indeed quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It could be called a miracle.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli couldn't help but admire him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew, and Li Che's heart suddenly jumped, and the [Chess Saint] fruit in his chest violently shook with a warning.</p><p></p><p>Under the black robe, the tendons and bones rang, the major tendons trembling.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>A great expert! Li Che quickly turned his gaze, glimpsing a figure.</p><p></p><p>Just standing in the corridor, the aura was as calm and steady as a huge mountain, but there was still a roaring dragon hidden within!</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli, however, stepped aside and bowed respectfully, "Junior Supervisor Gong Yunli pays respects to Overseer Tang."</p><p></p><p>Li Che turned around and looked at the burly old man who had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Very burly, even surpassing his own physique after activating the Dragon Elephant Golden Ape.</p><p></p><p>With a bushy black beard, fierce eyes, and muscles like steel cables all over his body, constantly emanating a scorching and explosive aura.</p><p></p><p>The Overseer of the Divine Sculpture Ridge, Tang Sangjia!</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his hands in greeting, facing this vigorous old man who did not seem like an old person.</p><p></p><p>The old man looked down at Li Che, the slightly narrowed eyes containing a hint of inquiry and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the talented divine wood carving master that little fellow Li Qingshan mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard you have also delved into and researched the way of mechanisms?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia said indifferently, his voice resonating like a great bell.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused, "Senior Li Qingshan has overpraised me, I am not worthy of being called a talent, I only have some insights."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had mentioned him to this Divine Sculpture Ridge Overseer before, but apparently delayed bringing him here due to his own need to break through the divine image.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia's sharp eagle-like eyes scrutinized Li Che for a moment, and a strange light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Spider Silk? Sleeve Crossbow?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled, the Sleeve Crossbow and Thousand Spider Silk were hidden extremely well, but the old man had seen through them at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"You've learned the [Tang Family Mechanism Compendium]? This is the most widely circulated version of the Tang Family's mechanical techniques." Tang Sangjia said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Light.</p><p></p><p>Beckoning Li Che to walk alongside him, Gong Yunli had to fall back a step, following the two like a maid.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli wasn't annoyed, he just curiously looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Gentleman Li to be skilled in mechanism techniques as well, he was quite hidden.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli initially felt something was off when he heard that Li Che was skilled in mechanism techniques, but after thinking about it carefully, he couldn't figure out the possibility of Li Che being the Ox Demon, so he didn't pursue the matter further.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the perplexed Supervisor Gong out of the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched. Assistant Supervisor Lin's evaluation of Supervisor Gong as having a big chest but an empty head... was indeed accurate.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia led Li Che and Gong Yunli to the reception hall.</p><p></p><p>He had a good impression of Li Che, because Li Che's understanding of the Tang Clan's mechanisms was quite profound, which deeply... touched Tang Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>"With just the 'Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms' you can research so profoundly, you clearly love mechanisms..."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you are not a member of the Tang Clan, otherwise... I would have taken you as a disciple and passed on the true transmission of the Tang Clan's mechanisms to you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also impressed by Tang Sangjia's understanding of mechanisms: "The true transmission of the Tang Clan's mechanisms?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the difference from the Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia laughed and poured a cup of tea for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The difference is not that great, the records in the Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms are ultimately superficial, many details are missing, and it is extremely difficult to create the ninth-ranked 'Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus' just by relying on it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Wooden Raven, the Bodhi Tear... it is basically impossible to create them."</p><p></p><p>"But the true transmission of the Tang Clan's mechanisms is different, it has detailed manufacturing methods, and... accompanying divine techniques."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia was not stingy with his guidance.</p><p></p><p>Since the downfall of the Tang Clan, the reputation of the Tang Clan's mechanisms has plummeted, these days... there are too few young people who love mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>This person... understands me! Li Che's heart also surged, and in discussing mechanisms with the elder Tang, he gradually revealed his understanding of the "Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms" without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>Even the research on new mechanisms such as Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus, Bodhi Tear, and Wooden Raven, he also shared.</p><p></p><p>There was a kind of camaraderie between mechanism masters.</p><p></p><p>After the discussion, Li Che also had a feeling of meeting too late.</p><p></p><p>His heart pounded, and the flowing light flashed past his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsmanship (LV3, 95%)]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sudden surge in the maturity of his Immortal Craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>An unusual color flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This can also increase the maturity?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps...</p><p></p><p>This is the most superficial, the discussion of the Dao? Tang Sangjia looked at Li Che's eyes with increasing appreciation, interrupting Li Che's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Che, my young friend, do you know why the Tang Clan perished?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia picked up the teacup and took a big sip.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli, who was sitting aside, was eating snacks to pass the time, after all, she didn't understand what the two had been talking about for so long.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even get a cup of tea, and now that she finally heard some gossip that she could understand, she couldn't help but perk up her ears and eavesdrop curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also curious, and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Because of four words... 'Possessing Artifacts with Arrogance'."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia put down the teacup and said faintly.</p><p></p><p>"The court... set its sights on the 'artifacts' of the Tang Clan, helpless, what to do?"</p><p></p><p>"That artifact, was... the peerless Mechanism Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was enlightened, Mechanism Beasts!</p><p></p><p>In the Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms, there was only a simple mention, obviously, this was the true hidden secret of the Tang Clan's mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the peerless Mechanism Beasts, not ordinary Mechanism Beasts... Mechanism Beasts are excellent helpers for exploring mysterious temples and shrines, and are also terrible war weapons."</p><p></p><p>"The Tang Clan was thus labeled 'Possessing Artifacts with Arrogance', and was destroyed by the troops sent by the old Emperor of the Great View."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli, who was eating the honey-preserved fruit, suddenly spat it out.</p><p></p><p>This lord, these treacherous words cannot be said!</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia stared at Li Che with burning eyes: "Che, my young friend, do you want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart pounded.</p><p></p><p>"I want to."</p><p></p><p>"But you can't..." Tang Sangjia regretfully shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "......"</p><p></p><p>If I can't learn, then what the hell?</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was truly curious about these Mechanism Beasts.</p><p></p><p>His recent research on the [Avalokitesvara's Lotus Main Battle Tank] had just encountered a bottleneck, and these Mechanism Beasts might give him some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment, and was not stingy either, taking out a design blueprint of the Avalokitesvara's Lotus Main Battle Tank from his Spatial Storage.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Tang, I've been researching a certain mechanism recently and have encountered a bottleneck, unable to break through. Could you please give me some guidance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment and handed the design blueprint to Tang Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>The tea leaves in his mouth rustled.</p><p></p><p>Then he put down the teacup in his hand, taking the mechanism blueprint without much concern.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che had some insights in mechanisms, he was after all just learning from the "Records of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms" and such basic mechanism books.</p><p></p><p>The mechanisms he designed, how difficult could they be? He could give pointers in a split second.</p><p></p><p>This is why Tang Sangjia had such a good impression of this young man who was obsessed with mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else...</p><p></p><p>Daring to hand him a blueprint, he would have directly given them a beating.</p><p></p><p>Taking the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia's gaze fell on it, and in the next moment, his eyes narrowed... </p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly became deep and dark, completely absorbed by the ingenious design on the blueprint, unable to look away even a bit.</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely captivated by the clever conception on the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sipped his tea, not at all anxious.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was still puzzled, only marveling at Li Che's achievements in mechanisms, actually able to make the Lord of the Lingshan so immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Lord of the Lingshan become like a statue.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli cast a curious gaze.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with the Lord of the Lingshan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at her.</p><p></p><p>The big-chested and brainless Supervisor, truly carefree and untroubled.</p><p></p><p>He and the Lord of the Lingshan had talked so openly and directly, but Gong Yunli still hadn't guessed the fact that Li Che was the Ox Demon? Well...</p><p></p><p>Fools have their own blessings.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, he should be analyzing and researching..."</p><p></p><p>"Supervisor, you don't play with mechanisms, so it's normal not to understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was suddenly displeased: "Who are you looking down on?"</p><p></p><p>She stood up and went around to the back of Tang Sangjia, glancing at the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>Wow--</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli quickly averted her gaze, it seemed her brain had taken in too much complex knowledge, not understanding a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, you two continue your discussion, I'll go out for a stroll."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli shook her head, found an excuse to slip out and get some fresh air.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to burn an incense stick.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure of Tang Sangjia moved slightly, his eyes rippling, after a long time, he sighed in admiration and exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, this mechanism... is just a base, right?"</p><p></p><p>"And the thing it carries should be an improved version of the 'Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus'."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia returned the blueprint to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>Appreciation, regret, pain, sadness...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of emotions, intertwined and complicated, like mixed soy sauce and vinegar.</p><p></p><p>What a talented mechanism genius!</p><p></p><p>But alas...</p><p></p><p>Alas, you little bastard! Tang Sangjia plucked a strand of his beard, the Tang Clan had already declined and perished, what was he still clinging to those rules for? He needed a talent like Li Che in mechanisms so badly!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Elder is truly insightful."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The destructive power is great... may I take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback, this topic was a bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>But he also seemed to hear a different meaning in it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Li Che responded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he tore open the Spatial Storage and took out the rough-hewn [Great Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon].</p><p></p><p>The Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon, about half a person tall, appeared in the reception hall.</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia was instantly attracted by it.</p><p></p><p>A sense of tension and crisis suddenly arose in his heart!</p><p></p><p>This half-person-tall Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus actually posed a threat to him!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>Even if there were ten thousand poisoned Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotuses, they wouldn't be able to hurt him a single hair.</p><p></p><p>This is not an ordinary Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus! "Indeed, it is an improved version of the 'Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus', you are truly a genius!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia looked at it and detected the difference.</p><p></p><p>"You've even integrated divine power? Taking the explosive route?"</p><p></p><p>"The power is formidable."</p><p></p><p>To be able to threaten him, the power must be formidable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the Avalokitesvara Lotus Cannon, smiling as he cupped his hands: "It's only a semi-finished product for now, when the finished product is ready, I can bring it to you for guidance, Elder."</p><p></p><p>"It's a deal!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Returning the favor... Mechanisms are not easily shown to others, since you've let me see your treasure, I'll return a gift in kind."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia took out a golden-covered book and handed it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The True Transmission of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms?! Elder... this?"</p><p></p><p>Didn't he say it couldn't be easily passed on?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've seen your precious mechanism, and I'm returning a gift, is that reasonable?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "Reasonable, thank you Elder for the gift."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia shook his head, his towering figure suddenly shrinking: "There's nothing left to hide, the Tang Clan... is gone."</p><p></p><p>"This technique, if buried with me in the yellow earth, is better off passed on to talented young people."</p><p></p><p>"If it can help you perfect this mechanism, it will also be my contribution to the way of mechanisms."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the records about Mechanism Beasts in the True Transmission of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms..."</p><p></p><p>"If one day you can create Mechanism Beasts... I have a favor to ask of you."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia became serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, upon hearing this, did not immediately agree.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's just to let you help me... repair a mechanism."</p><p></p><p>Repair a mechanism? Li Che's heart stirred, no longer hesitating, and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then I thank the Elder for the gift."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia stroked his beard and laughed heartily, in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>"Che, my young friend, you can hang the name of the Wood Carving Master of the Lingshan on me. If you have any needs for spiritual wood, you can come find me."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, any spiritual wood you need for making that mechanism, you can also come to me."</p><p></p><p>"I'll send the most experienced lumberjacks to lead you into the mountains to find spiritual wood, to fell the spiritual wood."</p><p></p><p>"I'll invest in you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was overjoyed to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Making mechanisms, spiritual wood is a major expense.</p><p></p><p>Good spiritual wood is better than gold and iron.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this trip to the Lingshan has found him an angel investor!</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia and Li Che hit it off immediately, he truly liked this young man who understood mechanisms, and was also very interested in Li Che's mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>He didn't hold back at all in investing.</p><p></p><p>He commanded the Lingshan behind him, not lacking in spiritual wood at all! What he lacked was a mechanism master like Li Che who could utilize the spiritual wood!</p><p></p><p>"I heard... your daughter has been accepted as a disciple of the Southern离Fire Gate, becoming a true disciple of the Golden Light Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"The wood carvings she'll need for her future cultivation, I'll cover them all! Whatever wood carvings she needs, just have her report to me."</p><p></p><p>Tang Sangjia patted his chest and laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was truly delighted this time, it was as if he had solved the major problem of the source of cultivation resources for his daughter's future.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Tang Sangjia continued to discuss mechanisms for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao Fruit did not increase in maturity again.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Elder Tang's understanding in the realm of mechanisms was limited, and had been exhausted by him.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che didn't mind, holding the "True Transmission of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms", such an advanced mechanism secret art.</p><p></p><p>The increase in Immortal Craftsmanship Dao Fruit was no longer a problem.</p><p></p><p>When Gong Yunli strolled back.</p><p></p><p>She saw the old and young addressing each other as brothers.</p><p></p><p>Learning that Li Che had become the honorary Wood Carving Master of the Lingshan, and also obtained a 50% discount on Lingshan's spiritual wood, and had the right to enter the Lingshan to fell wood at any time...</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was numb.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Li Che, only feeling that Li Che was shining.</p><p></p><p>Is this the legendary beauty trap? Li Che selected several Nine Yang Spiritual Woods in the Lingshan, and the towering and heroic Tang Sangjia waved his hand and sent them over!</p><p></p><p>Until sitting on the carriage back to the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was still numb.</p><p></p><p>She didn't quite understand how Li Che conquered the foul-tempered and stingy Lord of the Lingshan, Tang Sangjia?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, another three days had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Prefecture, Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>The white snow was hazy and drifting, covering a thick layer.</p><p></p><p>On Li Che in the courtyard, a layer of white feather robe was coated.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Lingshan, Li Che had been immersed in researching the "True Transmission of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms" for three days, almost in a state of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew by.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes rippled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>All the snow in the entire small courtyard instantly evaporated, turning into countless rising water vapors, shrouding the entire courtyard! In Li Che's eyes, there was suddenly a dazzling flow of light.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the prompt flowed like gentle water, appearing before him.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsmanship (lv4, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>7,000 wor</p>

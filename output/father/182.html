        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous downpour seemed to be drowned out by the explosive sounds in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Billowing black smoke unfurled in the heavens, continuously rolling and boiling, like a black dragon surging upwards into the clouds! The rapidly spinning barrels of the Firegod Cannon gradually came to a stop, scorching hot and steaming as the rainwater evaporated upon contact.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had expended all one thousand of his Avalanche Raven rounds in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>The Firegod Raging Dragon Cannon was different from the Immortal Engineer Gatling, placing much greater demands on the operator's vital energy and blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, a Furnace Sect Master, possessed an exceptionally robust vital energy and blood. When compressed and unleashed, it was like a volcanic eruption, a furnace pouring forth.</p><p></p><p>After expending all one thousand Avalanche Raven rounds, he felt a sense of depletion in his vital energy and blood, an intangible feeling of emptiness rising from his feet.</p><p></p><p>This cannon really did consume a lot of vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The heat haze rose, the cannon barrel slowly rotating, sparks dancing, gradually coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>From the cannon's muzzle, scorching hot waves of distorted air rolled out.</p><p></p><p>The barrage had ceased.</p><p></p><p>The smoke and dust were torn open by the rain.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all present,</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiling's aura extinguished, leaving only a charred, smoldering corpse that swayed and fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Steaming, it tore through the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, it crashed to the ground, splashing the pooled water up over a dozen feet high.</p><p></p><p>A Sage Realm Immortal...</p><p></p><p>Had met such an end!</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, the intense divine essence surged and rippled, like a massive boulder plunging into a great lake, generating towering waves! Silence!</p><p></p><p>Only the sound of falling rain remained.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jin Guang Prefecture was enveloped in stillness at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Even the other Sage Realm Immortals felt a tingling sensation in their bodies, a great sense of urgency and chill enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's eyes shone with brilliant light...</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion Master's Nascent Soul...</p><p></p><p>Had been shattered!</p><p></p><p>The Sage Realm Nascent Soul was the foundation of a Sage Realm Immortal.</p><p></p><p>By condensing the divine essence into a tangible form and comprehending the true will within the divine essence, it was infused into the Nascent Soul, causing it to radiate golden light.</p><p></p><p>The golden light of the Nascent Soul could refine the Primordial Spirit, ultimately coalescing into the Sage Realm Golden Body! Naturally, there were gradations among Sage Realm Immortals.</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Grandmaster's Divine Might, Heaven-Human Unification, and the Pinnacle Three Flowers Tribulation, Sages could also be divided into three stages of tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Namely, the Primordial Spirit, Golden Body, and Embryonic Breath stages! This was the solid path for Sage Realm Immortals to ascend to the Sage Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>However, once the Nascent Soul was shattered, this Sage Realm Immortal was essentially ruined.</p><p></p><p>What kind of firepower attack could have shattered the Nascent Soul of a Sage Realm Immortal, one that possessed the majestic divine essence pressure?</p><p></p><p>"That mechanism..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's gaze flickered, sweeping over and landing on the massive Firegod Cannon gripped by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mandate Observatory also had a Mechanism Department, and after absorbing the Tang faction, its Mechanism Department was not weak.</p><p></p><p>But there was simply no mechanism that could compare to the cannon the Ox Demon currently possessed.</p><p></p><p>If one had to make a comparison, it would only be to the ranked Mechanism Beasts!</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down like columns.</p><p></p><p>Cleansing the earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not hesitate further, retracting the scorching hot Firegod Raging Dragon Cannon.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, his toes touched the ground, and his entire body sprang into the air, the rainwater on the ground instantly exploding into ripples.</p><p></p><p>His towering, mountain-like figure shot up into the high sky.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the long bow suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was the Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star Divine Bow from Mount Qiulong!</p><p></p><p>With the divine bow in hand, his vital energy surged, the great tendons on his back trembling like a ballista, his Furnace Sect physique quivering.</p><p></p><p>Gripping his fingers, he drew the bow to its full extent!</p><p></p><p>The true intent surged, as if countless streams of fire were plummeting from the heavens above! Grandmaster-level true intent!</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star Arrows! The mastery-level true intent secret art was unleashed by the Ox Demon at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! The arrows of brilliant, raging light instantly evaporated numerous raindrops, shooting towards the Huang Xiling who had crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! The arrows whistled forth, exploding into rolling waves of fire as they struck Huang Xiling's body.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the ground, the Huang Xiling corpse, akin to charcoal, suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Angrily, it shot back up, its powerful vital energy surging!</p><p></p><p>It was actually a Grandmaster-realm martial artist! It roared, unleashing a flurry of punches, its blackened skin shedding in pieces.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>How despicable! Huang Xiling's Nascent Soul had already been shattered, yet he still wanted to fire more arrows at the corpse?</p><p></p><p>How could such a vile existence exist in this world?!</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star arrows were fired in rapid succession.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiling roared, infusing its vital energy, its near-Grandmaster-level strength fiercely striking the incoming arrows.</p><p></p><p>But the overwhelming power contained within the arrows made Huang Xiling's heart sink! Too strong! This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>His martial cultivation was almost at the Grandmaster realm, wasn't it? Poof! Huang Xiling roared, its fist techniques striking horizontally, yet unable to suppress the arrow light.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was pierced through the head by an arrow.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiling's ferocious, roaring head directly exploded, shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Viscous, mercury-like blood sprayed out, only to be instantly vaporized by the power contained within the divine arrow! Boom! The divine arrow pierced through its head, its momentum undiminished, slamming into the ground behind Huang Xiling, creating a massive, deep crater, the pooled water swirling like a vortex.</p><p></p><p>Mud and cracks spread like a web! Everyone was greatly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Some were astonished that Huang Xiling had not died, yet still harbored a treacherous counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Others were amazed that this Ox Demon was so steady, that even after shattering the opponent's Nascent Soul, he still wanted to shoot an arrow to blow off Huang Xiling's head!</p><p></p><p>These two...</p><p></p><p>Were both so despicable! Hum—</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a dizziness in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The towering Ox Demon had swiftly charged, like a falcon, crossing dozens of yards in an instant, appearing beside the Huang Xiling corpse with the shattered head.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked indifferently at the Huang Xiling corpse he had shot.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, he frantically absorbed the divine essence of this Sage Realm Immortal, condensing it into a divine essence chess piece.</p><p></p><p>And on the other side...</p><p></p><p>He began to stealthily search Huang Xiling's body, finally finding the Spatial Jade, taking it away with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>From crossing dozens of yards to completing the harvesting, it was no more than five breaths.</p><p></p><p>After this exhilarating harvest,</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon stood up, clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, before the eyes of all present,</p><p></p><p>He vanished without a trace!</p><p></p><p>Silently!</p><p></p><p>Only the roar of the downpour remained.</p><p></p><p>The dense bloodiness and blood mist were pierced by the raindrops, becoming riddled with holes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Ox Demon kill, loot the corpse, and depart in one smooth motion, their minds were buzzing.</p><p></p><p>So this was...</p><p></p><p>The professional assassin of the Underworld?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao let out a sigh, and even someone as strong as him didn't know when cold sweat had begun to bead on his back.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because of the Ox Demon's display of powerful mechanism-coordinated abilities.</p><p></p><p>But rather, the meticulous and consecutive killings.</p><p></p><p>If one were to be targeted by such an assassin...</p><p></p><p>It would truly be a headache.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Lu Yao couldn't help but think of the young prince in the Prefectural Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>How arrogant he had been when climbing the mountain, and now...</p><p></p><p>He must be shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore... Xue Daofu... Isn't he dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked towards the distant Xue Daofu, who had been suppressed by the seven divine essence techniques unleashed by Huang Xiling.</p><p></p><p>Although he was wearing a mask, the martial arts he displayed had exposed Xue Daofu's identity.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jin Guang Prefecture, the only one capable of wielding the Crescent Moon Saber Technique like that...</p><p></p><p>Was Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Daofu was dead, wasn't he?</p><p></p><p>Dragged back from the Underworld by the Underworld... and joined the Underworld?! Lu Yao's mind was buzzing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is really... unfathomable, completely unfathomable..."</p><p></p><p>The mournful sound of the erhu echoed, as Monitoring Officer Hu Yingue began playing the erhu again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao glanced at Hu Yingue with some exasperation, his mind already buzzing, and the erhu music only added to his irritation.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to bother with Hu Yingue, he looked towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stained with blood, but his condition seemed to be still not too bad.</p><p></p><p>After all, Huang Xiling was a Sage Realm Immortal, and for Li Che, a Deity Foundation cultivator, the suppression of the realm difference was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>It was only natural that Li Che was severely injured and bleeding after such a clash.</p><p></p><p>If that killing Rain Sword technique had truly struck him, Li Che would have been doomed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Horse Face had intervened in the shadows to save Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to have a very good relationship with the Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked deeply at Li Che, who was wiping the blood and standing up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, however, did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao didn't mind, his gaze flickering: "If there's a chance... give me a way to contact the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld should take on missions as well, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Underworld's strength made even Lu Yao, a Sage Realm Immortal, feel tempted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's strength was considerably stronger than Huang Xiling's, belonging to the later stage of Sage Realm Immortal Primordial Spirit tribulation, even faintly coalescing some Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiling had only just managed to stimulate the golden glow of his Nascent Soul, probably just stepping into the middle stage of Primordial Spirit tribulation.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Yao could empathize, and if he had been on the receiving end of the Ox Demon's cannon barrage, his fate might not have been much better.</p><p></p><p>The best approach would be to quickly retreat, create distance, and then use divine essence techniques for long-range bombardment of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiling, after using a divine essence technique against the Ox, found himself somewhat hard-pressed when facing the Ox Demon, and was ultimately killed.</p><p></p><p>But this was all part of the Ox Demon's design.</p><p></p><p>That's why Lu Yao found it so terrifying - the Ox Demon was terrifying, and the Underworld's killers were also terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao felt that establishing a good relationship with the Underworld would be the best course of action.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't have an enemy or two? The Avatar Li Che paused for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a figure in blue robes wearing a cat-faced mask emerged from the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld wants you dead by the third watch, who dares to let you live until the fifth watch..."</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned towards the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu twitched his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that Li Qingshan?</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan floated over, standing calmly in the rain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qingshan's flamboyant posture and reciting words, Lin Xiu... was extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>How come he didn't seize this opportunity?</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Had Li Qingshan really joined the Underworld?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers,</p><p></p><p>The Flying Thunder chess piece was gripped in Li Che's palm.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding wind and rain suddenly disappeared, leaving only the flickering of candles.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, in the eerie temple of the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Ape,</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Ox Demon mask, appeared, his towering figure like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Standing within the temple,</p><p></p><p>His boiling vital energy was roaring incessantly. Li Che removed the Ox Demon mask and stored it in his Spatial Ring, gently twisting his tendons and bones, and his back erupted with the cracking sound of a great bow, like the roar of a dragon and elephant, trembling endlessly!</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the sound subsided.</p><p></p><p>Like rolling drops of blood, clear and melodious, falling one by one.</p><p></p><p>After the intense confrontation, his vital energy was being tempered.</p><p></p><p>Clashing with a Sage Realm Immortal did exert considerable pressure, and Li Che had been on high alert throughout, not daring to underestimate anything.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Huang Xiling's head was shattered by his arrows that Li Che could feel a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle—</p><p></p><p>His whole body relaxed, and the heat trapped in his pores suddenly burst forth, like the scorching waves from a pressure cooker, stirring up a gale! This battle had consumed a significant amount of Li Che's vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the initial expenditure of vital energy to create the decoy Avatar, or the later barrage of the Firegod Cannon, they had greatly depleted his vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary Avatar was very fragile, and Li Che had increased the proportion of vital energy to ensure that this Avatar would not be directly shattered and dissipate into mist under the powerful suppression of Huang Xiling's Sage Realm position, giving away his hand.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this decoy had the strength of an ordinary Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that this decoy was a success.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Li Che took out an Eight Extremes Martial Elixir and placed it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>With a gulp, the elixir sank into his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>"Exhale—"</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—"</p><p></p><p>As Li Che breathed in and out, he crushed the medicinal properties of the elixir, frenziedly refining his physique!</p><p></p><p>This battle had brought Li Che tremendous gains! His eyes opened and closed, and a fierce wind swept through the eerie temple.</p><p></p><p>On the altar, the candles flickered, and the bald-headed Ape Deity statue had a bitter expression on its face.</p><p></p><p>This bastard... had come again!</p><p></p><p>He was really...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Drained dry, truly drained dry!</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the shrill cry of a temple deity was resounding, expressing a sentiment of resistance.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che treated it as the temple deity's welcome to him.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, flowing light leisurely drifted past his eyes.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv4, 20%), Dragon-Elephant Vajra (Lv4, 30%), Immaculate Heart (Lv3, 70%), Chess Sage (Lv3, 98%), Immortal in Painting (Lv2, 50%)】</p><p></p><p>The data of the Dao Fruits appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit was within his expectations, as the maturity gained from completing the Fire God's Angry Flood Dragon Cannon had not been small.</p><p></p><p>The other was the Dragon-Elephant Vajra, the combat experience gained from slaying a Divine Element Transcendent had also seen a bountiful increase.</p><p></p><p>But what delighted Li Che the most were the【Immaculate Heart】and【Chess Sage】Dao Fruits! The Chess Sage Dao Fruit was almost at the Lv4 level due to absorbing the divine nature of the Divine Element Transcendent and condensing it into chess pieces. Li Che could even choose to directly transfer the maturity of the Immaculate Heart Dao Fruit to supplement the Chess Sage.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was in no hurry, calming his emotions first before planning to enhance himself after completing the inventory.</p><p></p><p>The flowing light vanished.</p><p></p><p>As the effect of the Martial Elixir took hold, Li Che's qi and blood were rapidly recovering.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>The【Immaculate Heart】Dao Fruit in his chest was pounding fervently.</p><p></p><p>Immaculate Heart·Restrain Divinity! The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless black divine essences rapidly converged before his eyes, as if countless rays of light were being swallowed, and darkness began to coalesce.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, it took on the appearance of Huang Xiwang.</p><p></p><p>Only, it was in a gloomy color.</p><p></p><p>Just like Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiwang, just restrained by the Immaculate Heart, seemed dazed, as if he had been pulled back from the dark underworld of hell, the whole person bewildered and confused.</p><p></p><p>Still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing Li Che, the light in his eyes gradually returned.</p><p></p><p>The light grew brighter and brighter...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a golden glow seemed to appear! Hum—</p><p></p><p>Huang Xiwang's dark body trembled, opening his mouth and letting out a long howl.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine consciousness waves struck, causing the golden core that had been tinged with a layer of black light to float up!</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>Was this resistance? Restraining divinity... The divine general he had summoned was actually still resisting?</p><p></p><p>Was it because Huang Xiwang was a Divine Element Transcendent?</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but speculate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He watched the struggling and resisting Huang Xiwang calmly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Raising his eyebrows, he flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's figure suddenly appeared, and as soon as he appeared, his gaze was dazzlingly bright as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Then he greedily looked at the restrained Huang Xiwang.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately sensed Xue Daofu's intention.</p><p></p><p>"You want to... devour him?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes and smiled. "Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll grant it to you."</p><p></p><p>"He's yours now."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Xue Daofu's divine general figure instantly shot up, his five fingers like hooks, black qi surging, ruthlessly grasping Huang Xiwang's head.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he crushed it with a bang! Billowing black smoke, Xue Daofu opened his mouth and frantically sucked in, countless black smoke continuously pouring into Xue Daofu's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's aura was also constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he had surpassed his former self when he was alive.</p><p></p><p>On his body, divine auras emerged one after another, finally stabilizing at fifteen divine auras, reaching the level of penetrating a hundred and fifty acupoints throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>When Huang Xiwang was completely devoured, Xue Daofu's aura also returned to calmness, the black qi rolling, and he clasped his hands in reverence and fervor to thank Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you... my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel that Xue Daofu's loyalty to him was almost at its maximum!</p><p></p><p>"The divine generals that were restrained... can actually devour and enhance each other?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had not anticipated before.</p><p></p><p>However, Xue Daofu's current powerful aura had added quite a few trump cards for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"If I keep feeding Niu Yi... how strong will he eventually become?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed brightly.</p><p></p><p>He snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Niu Yi disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the temple, the cold wind howled, moaning mournfully.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether the scene of Niu Yi devouring Huang Xiwang had frightened the Linguan Temple Deity on the altar.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple had become eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Element Divine Nature Chess Pieces that the Hunting Divine Hall's branch hall master collected in total were fifty pieces, which is not a small amount."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Divine Manifestation Divine Nature Chess Pieces, when detonated in a great avalanche, the power will definitely be more powerful and terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Avalanche Lotus Bullet would be able to rise again.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out Huang Xiwang's Spatial Jade, the Spatial Jade of a Divine Element Transcendent, which was truly very attractive to him.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine consciousness invaded the Spatial Jade, directly tearing open the barrier of this exquisite Spatial Jade.</p><p></p><p>The inner space was vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine consciousness swept through, beginning to inventory.</p><p></p><p>After opening the jade, the first step was to find the Divine Essences!</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>Divine Essences emerged one by one before Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Dense and numerous...</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine essences, surging wildly! Li Che was stunned as he looked at them, then his face twitched.</p><p></p><p>"As expected... even richer than the previous one!"</p><p></p><p>The collection and foundation of a refined Divine Element Transcendent was indeed not something a crude martial artist could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Especially the branch hall master of the Hunting Divine Hall, an assassin organization!</p><p></p><p>"Two Six Dao Divine Essences, twenty Seven Element Divine Essences, eighty Eight Extremes Divine Essences... the rest are negligible."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly... so rich!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was dazzled.</p><p></p><p>He first raised his hand and grabbed two Six Dao Divine Essences, their majestic divine essences surging wildly.</p><p></p><p>The flawless Six Dao Divine Essences had not been absorbed even half! Clearly, it was the reserve funds for the Hunting Divine Hall's branch hall master to set up in the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Now they all belonged to him, Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After collecting all the Divine Essences, Li Che's emotions were stirred as he continued to inventory.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapons were quite ordinary, with two Seven Element top-grade divine weapons, one sword and one round shield.</p><p></p><p>Offensive and defensive, they were quite complete.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they did not quite suit Li Che, so after a simple inventory, he collected them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at his Spatial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, the divine weapons he had looted had accumulated to dozens.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were not a few Seven Element divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to find a time to fence them..."</p><p></p><p>"Golden Light Prefecture may not be able to accommodate them all, wait until I go to the Dao City... go to the Dao City to fence them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Calming his expression, he continued to inventory.</p><p></p><p>Next were the methods, which gave Li Che a pleasant surprise! Seven Element Divine Element Technique! "The Seven Element Suspended Thought Transcendent Divine Core Technique"! A divine core technique of the Seven Emotions Thought Divine Essence!</p><p></p><p>A method that can be cultivated to the Divine Element Transcendent realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was excited for a while, but then became calm, after all, he was currently cultivating his nature, still striving to condense the Divine Manifestation.</p><p></p><p>His divine talent was indeed not very good.</p><p></p><p>However, this was at least a path that could allow him to understand the Divine Element realm.</p><p></p><p>After browsing for a while, Li Che suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Element Transcendent, three Tribulations..."</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Spirit Tribulation, Divine Body Tribulation, and Embryo Breath Tribulation, what the Hunting Divine Hall's branch hall master had only passed was the first Tribulation, the Primordial Spirit Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"If he cultivates to the Divine Body, the Fire God's Cannon might not be able to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"However, later if I replace it with the avalanche Raven Crossing empowered by the Divine Element Divine Nature Chess Pieces, the power should be enough to blast him to death."</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the technique and continued to inventory, and he really found some good things.</p><p></p><p>A golden leather book appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Soaring Void Eight Steps"! "This is... the martial sage's body technique secret?"</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Element Transcendent also collected the martial sage's secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was delighted!</p><p></p><p>He had thought that gathering the five volumes of the martial sage's secret techniques would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, it was not as difficult as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Martial sage secret techniques were not rare, the main difficulty was in the cultivation difficulty! By the Grand Ancestor realm, basically everyone would cultivate one martial sage secret technique.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation for breaking through to the martial sage realm.</p><p></p><p>"Now I have mastered four martial sage secret techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformation Dragon-Elephant, the Chaos Unify the Heavens Staff, the Thousand Mountains Lone Walker Saber, and now the obtained Soaring Void Eight Steps!"</p><p></p><p>"When I complete the true meaning of the five martial sage secret techniques, and refine my five viscera with the true meaning of the five martial sage secret techniques, I will be able to easily step into the Grand Ancestor realm and kill ordinary Grand Ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"The young prince Ji Hai still has one volume..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remembered it very clearly.</p><p></p><p>That was something he had already claimed.</p><p></p><p>Continuing the inventory, the harvest still did not stop.</p><p></p><p>The collection of a Hunting Divine Hall branch hall master, in order to maintain the operation of such a large branch hall, was extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty bottles of Grade 6 low-grade Dragon Blood Martial Elixir, each containing one Grade 6 Martial Elixir, and fifty-seven bottles of Grade 7 top-grade Martial Elixir, as for Grade 8 and Grade 9, there were even more..."</p><p></p><p>"This should be to reward and console the assassins under his command, right?"</p><p></p><p>"They're all mine now."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>He was in an extremely good mood.</p><p></p><p>He carefully inventoried the harvest again.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Satisfactory."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The inventory was complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, stretched, and his whole body made cracking sounds.</p><p></p><p>His powerful qi and blood surged like a storm.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>His whole heart calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes, flowing light flashed out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly transferred the maturity of the Immaculate Heart Dao Fruit to the【Chess Sage】Dao Fruit, supplementing the remaining 2% maturity of the【Chess Sage】Dao Fruit!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that the heavens and earth had suddenly become quiet.</p><p></p><p>A pin drop could be heard! </p><p></p><p>Only the pounding sound of the Dao Fruit in his chest, like thunderous explosions, growing heavier and heavier! Exploding like thunderclaps in his ears! Many Dao Fruits pulsed in unison!</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless black and white lights were flashing incessantly before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Chess Sage (Lv4, 0%)】</p><p></p><p>It's done!</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly opened his eyes, and in an instant, his pupils seemed to be cut open by a grid.</p><p></p><p>The black and white lights flashed incessantly, like falling black and white meteors outside the chessboard!</p><p></p><p>Powerful forces suddenly pulled him into the boundless heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>The towering Dao Tree rose up, piercing the clouds, its umbrella-like canopy spreading, encompassing the heavens and earth! He wasn't sure if it was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that this Dao Tree had become even thicker and larger!</p><p></p><p>The branches spread out, the green leaves crystal-clear and lush, the veins on the leaves seemed to be woven into a world.</p><p></p><p>One leaf, one world!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruits hung on it, the black and white lights dazzling and brilliant! That was... the Chess Sage Dao Fruit! Li Che looked at it, feeling as if his mind and spirit were being drawn and absorbed by the Dao Fruit! The next moment, a chessboard woven with intersecting lines spread out from under Li Che's feet, and he stood on a star position.</p><p></p><p>While the star position on the other diagonal was that Chess Sage Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the Dao Fruit stood facing each other on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The next instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows couldn't help but contract.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if the chessboard was beginning to distort and collapse.</p><p></p><p>Behind that star position Dao Fruit, outside the chessboard, there seemed to be a vague and indistinct human figure, holding a chess piece, about to drop it.</p><p></p><p>The figure was too ethereal and transcendent.</p><p></p><p>That palm stretched across the chessboard, like the palm of the Buddha, obscuring the sun.</p><p></p><p>Snap—</p><p></p><p>The white chess piece, like a white meteor, fell!  Heavily landing on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth exploded, thunderous rumbles! Li Che's consciousness instantly retreated from the boundless heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>His eyes opened, the interwoven chessboard network covering his eyes! His mind and spirit had become absolutely calm in an instant, even to the point of being devoid of emotion!</p><p></p><p>Who was that? The one dropping the chess piece outside the Dao Fruit... who was it?!</p><p></p><p>No joy, no sorrow.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were as calm as an icy lake.</p><p></p><p>But he saw...</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit Lv4, Second Tribulation, Nascent Divine Ability (Chess Sage·Great Avalanche) Promoted, Obtained Divine Ability (Chess Sage·Limitless)】</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit's Second Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Divine Ability, Limitless!</p><p></p><p>7,000 words, 15,000 today, seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes, seeking continued reading!

        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Two temple gods?" </p><p></p><p>"How can there be two auras of temple gods?!"</p><p></p><p>In front of the city lord's manor, the four people facing off were all briefly stunned.</p><p></p><p>None of them spoke, their eyes flashing beneath their masks.</p><p></p><p>The surging and terrifying aura of the temple god rising in the distance was mixed, while the aura of the temple god within the city lord's manor was relatively pure, with a powerful aura of divine dominance.</p><p></p><p>It should be said that both auras of the temple gods possessed strong divine dominance.</p><p></p><p>However, the erupting aura of the temple god in the distance seemed to have fused with the extremely violent and blood-thirsty aura of a martial warrior.</p><p></p><p>Like an invincible rampaging dragon stretching its body, its bones and muscles resonating, it let out a roar towards the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Infant Patriarch narrowed his eyes: "Didn't Cao Guang say... that only one temple god was being worshipped? How is there another temple god aura appearing?"</p><p></p><p>"Worshipping two temples in one city? Treating the temple gods like monkeys?"</p><p></p><p>If there were two temple gods within Fei Lei City...</p><p></p><p>It was too dangerous!</p><p></p><p>This was not in line with the planned scheme!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was also extremely shocked, gripping the ram's horn hammer, his brows furrowed beneath the cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>The situation had changed.</p><p></p><p>He was already starting to hesitate whether he should flee.</p><p></p><p>Two temple gods... He was afraid he might get beaten to death. Especially in Cao Guang's plan, the Thousand Buddha Feast even wanted to elevate this mysterious temple in Fei Lei City to the Nine Yang level.</p><p></p><p>That would be a Nine Yang level temple god...</p><p></p><p>If not in peak condition, he might not be able to defeat it.</p><p></p><p>Add in the other abruptly appearing temple god, completely outside of the plan...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's toes were already tensing, preparing to flee.</p><p></p><p>The experts in the Corpse God Sect's big-nosed and big-eyed masks also planned to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Infant Patriarch had even turned around, holding the hem of his large red robe, hopping and scurrying, intending to flee.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the city lord's manor.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood intertwined, in a massive secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang knelt in the center, dressed in a white robe, his hair disheveled. On the floor, a wooden basin was carved with patterns, flowing with crimson blood, surrounded by various wooden figurines of spiritual infants in different poses.</p><p></p><p>These wooden figurines were all the handiwork of the woodcarvers of Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>It was Cao Guang who had spent a large sum of money to commission these woodcarvers to take on this task.</p><p></p><p>But Cao Guang's money... was not so easily obtained?</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang suddenly clapped his palms together, chanting incantations, reciting the obscure words from the "Sutra of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord".</p><p></p><p>It was more like a sacrificial prayer.</p><p></p><p>His expression was devout and reverent, as if he had offered up his soul, presenting his own faith, just to obtain power and undergo transformation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Throughout all of Fei Lei City, all the woodcarvers who had carved wooden figurines for the Thousand Buddha Feast, suddenly felt a "buzzing" in their heads, losing all will, as if they had witnessed the divine, stripped of their beliefs.</p><p></p><p>They walked out of their houses like soulless zombies, kneeling on the rain-washed cobblestone ground, arms outstretched, extremely devout.</p><p></p><p>Threads of divine energy seeped out from these woodcarvers' bodies, wriggling and twisting, like countless streams converging into the sea, quickly flowing towards the direction of the city lord's manor.</p><p></p><p>Inside the city lord's manor.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's hackles rose, retreating a few steps, standing outside the room, not daring to step inside even a little.</p><p></p><p>But he also had a touch of fanaticism in his heart - the power of the temple god...</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity that could allow his divine foundation to break through to the intermediate realm.</p><p></p><p>If it depended on his own cultivation, he didn't know how long it would take, or if he would even have a chance in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the power of the temple god was the simplest and most direct method.</p><p></p><p>Just like his father, he had already given up the possibility of breaking through to higher realms relying on his own innate talents, planning to borrow the power of the temple god.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple appearing in the human world was a glimmer of hope for many cultivators who had reached a dead end.</p><p></p><p>It allowed them to touch heights they had never been able to reach before.</p><p></p><p>As for the price that needed to be paid...</p><p></p><p>The sacrifices required...</p><p></p><p>What did it matter to these cultivators? The ones dying were just common folk, no better than pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan retreated to the doorway, also with a touch of reverence. He craved the power of the temple god.</p><p></p><p>Worship the god!</p><p></p><p>Pray to the god!</p><p></p><p>With the blood and divine energy of a thousand spiritual infants, plus a thousand wooden figurines, since they were the products of the hard work of the master woodcarvers, although they were not divine wooden figurines, the divine energy could still be extracted from the woodcarvers through the wooden figurines.</p><p></p><p>These... were all offerings! The god should awaken! Rumble—</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, it was as if a thunderous roar had suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the city lord's manor, the ground began to collapse and shatter, countless swirling dust particles rising, like crushed sand and gravel, flying about in the raging wind.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang opened his eyes, a vertical line appearing between his brows, blood seeping out from his white robe little by little.</p><p></p><p>He kept retreating, his expression revealing satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"The thousand infant figurine sacrifice has succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>"The temple god has accepted our offering!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the scene within the secret chamber began to undergo a thunderous transformation. The countless flying sand particles began to pile up, revealing a layout and structure identical to the mysterious temple of the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord" outside the city! There was even an altar, flickering red candle lights, and the statue of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord deity seated on the altar!</p><p></p><p>However, the deity statue was slightly trembling, as if about to stand up.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed a little weak, unable to rise.</p><p></p><p>A pair of eyes flowed with unparalleled fury, the third eye on its brow emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Everything around was changing.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan only felt a wave of invisible fluctuations spreading, the secret chamber like a two-sided puzzle, with the flip revealing a transformation of the image and form! Or one could say, the mysterious temple was slowly replacing... the city lord's manor!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang knelt before the deity statue.</p><p></p><p>The vertical line between his brows glowed brilliantly, the blood on his body growing increasingly dense.</p><p></p><p>"Temple god, please descend to the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"With my body, it shall be your divine form!"</p><p></p><p>"Awaken—"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang spread his arms, his expression devout, his white robe completely turning blood-red, extremely eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan was greatly alarmed, seeing the black mist gradually spreading from the wooden deity statue, a terrifying divine energy aura of overwhelming dominance intertwining and spreading all around.</p><p></p><p>Thump! Beads of sweat on his forehead, Cao Qingyuan was learning for the first time that the method of worshipping and summoning the god was actually like this.</p><p></p><p>Father Cao Guang, he actually planned to use his own flesh and blood to replace the wooden deity statue, allowing the temple god to descend into his physical body...</p><p></p><p>This... was too crazy! Was this the method Cao Guang had thought of, not only to break through to the divine foundation realm, but also to attempt to break through to the divine manifestation realm?!</p><p></p><p>But once the temple god occupied the physical body, would Cao Guang... still be Cao Guang?</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood being eroded by the temple god's power, in the end... would he become a demonic undead guardian like the temple god?</p><p></p><p>It was too dangerous, practically walking on a tightrope!</p><p></p><p>But Cao Qingyuan could not persuade his father. The Thousand Buddha Feast and this ritual, Cao Guang had been preparing for too long, it was the only glimmer of hope that a person at the end of their path could see, impossible to turn back with just a few words.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan dared not breathe, staring at the scene of the black mist from the wooden deity statue pouring into Cao Guang's physical body.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, who knew how long...</p><p></p><p>The black mist from the wooden deity statue had completely flowed into Cao Guang's physical body, and Cao Guang's flesh was covered in dense, wriggling tadpole-like markings, spreading all the way to the vertical line between his brows.</p><p></p><p>Then, the vertical line cracked open...</p><p></p><p>Like suddenly opening an eye.</p><p></p><p>The third eye, opened!</p><p></p><p>Its gaze was a deep, endless red, like a glowing hot branding iron.</p><p></p><p>An expression of pain appeared on Cao Guang's face.</p><p></p><p>"No... something's not right..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah... why... where is the divine energy? Where is the power I wanted?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang covered his face, the tadpole markings writhing.</p><p></p><p>The divine energy... was so weak that he almost thought the temple god descending into his body was just a fake. With just this bit of temple god divine energy, what could it be used for?!</p><p></p><p>What could it be used for?!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang roared continuously, filled with fury, resentment, despair, and bewilderment! It shouldn't have been like this! Suddenly, Cao Guang's expression became extremely angry and sensitive, like a child whose pride had been pricked, his voice becoming shrill and piercing.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not allowed to speak!"</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Cao Guang screamed, his hair flying wildly, the tadpole markings on his body rapidly writhing, the deep red of the third eye growing even more intense!</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the direction of the Xu family estate, another surge of temple god divine energy also shot up into the sky, as if a second temple god had descended.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's eyes became extremely furious and frenzied, Cao Guang's own will completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>As if his mind had been completely eroded by the wrathful divine energy, like a cultivator possessed.</p><p></p><p>"Thief... thief..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah—the thief who touched the deity's head!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Transformed into the temple god, Cao Guang let out a roar, instantly turning into a blood-colored flash of light, charging out of the mysterious temple that had invaded the city lord's manor at an extremely terrifying speed! Whoosh! Cao Qingyuan lying at the doorway was suddenly affected, his divine energy almost bursting out of his body, his divine foundation nearly unable to withstand the imminent explosion.</p><p></p><p>He collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. His "Wrathful Amitabha" divine energy at the lower Nine Yang realm was utterly powerless against the temple god's realm.</p><p></p><p>This was... an unrivaled temple god of the same realm? But Cao Qingyuan shakily got up.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble... it seems something has gone wrong..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan wiped the fresh blood from his mouth and nose, his expression changing constantly.</p><p></p><p>He then ran towards the manor's treasury.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue felt the terrifying power surging in his physical body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The condition was extremely good!</p><p></p><p>Better than ever before!</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The physical body broke through the limits of the human body, and the shackles of flesh and blood were broken free! After crushing the divine chess pieces of the temple god, the physical body in the Ascending Tower state seemed to become even more excited. With each breath, the divine power of the temple god was fully integrated into the body.</p><p></p><p>Just like a car needs oil, the divine power of the temple god was like that oil... He could even mobilize the divine power of the temple god to unleash attacks.</p><p></p><p>"In the Ascending Tower state, the fusion of the physical body and the divine power is so perfect... even more harmonious than imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the transformation, and was even more amazed by the fusion of the physical body and the divine power in the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>Because the Qi-Blood Martial Dao and the divine cultivation were incompatible.</p><p></p><p>The Qi-Blood Martial Dao was more about strengthening the physical body and preventing the invasion of divine power, but the divine power and the Qi-Blood were independent forces.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in the Ascending Tower state, the divine power of the temple god and the physical body were almost perfectly fused.</p><p></p><p>If he were to unleash martial techniques, he could also unleash divine power! It was as if with a single punch, he could unleash divine martial techniques, and those techniques would be based on the divine power of the temple god!</p><p></p><p>Although it would not last long, and once the divine power of the temple god was exhausted, he would be unable to maintain the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>The Ascending Tower was like stepping on the power of the gods, step by step, to reach higher!</p><p></p><p>"So... the stronger the divine power of the temple god, the stronger the power gained from the Ascending Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I need to visit a more powerful and bizarre temple later."</p><p></p><p>As for the divine power of the temple god...</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of absorbing it.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy clouds gathered, and the rain pattered down on the ground soaked in blood.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xu had died.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had lamented before his death, the master had used a bull-slaughtering knife to kill a chicken.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrifying transformation of Li Che's Ascending Tower state, Old Master Xu had a clear understanding of his own position and status.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had only pointed out a shot, relying solely on the strength of his physical body, without even using the power of the temple god, it was as if he had just put the car in neutral without even pressing the accelerator... The terrifying power had completely shattered Old Master Xu's internal organs, blasted his divine foundation, and extinguished his life force.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the suppression of his cultivation level, Li Che also felt the tremendous strength of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>In terms of Qi-Blood, it might have barely reached the divine vein level, but the physical strength was far more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The internal energy had also turned blood-colored, extremely fierce and powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how it compares to the true energy of a Qi-Blood Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, not thinking about it further.</p><p></p><p>He looked up, with faint golden smoke drifting in his pupils, calmly gazing towards the distance, in the direction of the Marquis Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Three-Eyed Spirit Baby Temple God had sensed him, he had also sensed the presence of the temple god.</p><p></p><p>The long, black and vigorous hair that fell to his waist was like a cloak, Li Che felt the surging Ascending Tower state, the hazy scarlet internal energy clothes burning around his body, the thick veins like coiling dragons trembling and twisting, turning his neck and the great dragon-like spine seemed to roar.</p><p></p><p>This was perfect timing...</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Xu family was too fragile, crumbling at a touch.</p><p></p><p>He was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Perfect, he also wanted to personally feel... just how powerful the temple god's power was?</p><p></p><p>Boom! A scarlet beam of light shot over from the distance, shattering countless raindrops in its path, causing them to explode into a hazy mist!</p><p></p><p>With a dull thud, the ground of the long street immediately sank in, with radiating spider web-like cracks constantly expanding, causing the pooled water to churn and bubble.</p><p></p><p>The distorted scarlet divine power, like radioactive flowing light, continued to be released.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's exposed skin was covered with writhing tadpole-like patterns, and the third eye in the center of his forehead was a solid scarlet color.</p><p></p><p>"Little thief..."</p><p></p><p>The shrill voice came from Cao Guang's throat, like a child in the midst of voice change, furious and piercing!</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a cute cow-faced mask, his towering and upright figure with a triangular back like a demonic face, looked at this Cao Guang who was no longer Cao Guang...</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed: "Oh, it's you."</p><p></p><p>"Little thief!" </p><p></p><p>Cao Guang shrieked, his body suddenly pressing down, with him as the center, the ten-meter sky and earth fell into a terrifying state, the raindrops seemed to be boiling and jumping on a scorching hot pan, like bouncing beads.</p><p></p><p>"Come, touch it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, his five fingers suddenly swept forward.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the remaining seven temple god divine chess pieces floated up, like seven small black holes suspended in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He had just crushed one, consuming the temple god's divine power to attack the furious True Lord of the Three-Eyed Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The remaining seven were Li Che's entire stock.</p><p></p><p>The temple god's scream abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>As if someone had grabbed his throat.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Marquis Mansion had become a complete ruin, and in the ruins...</p><p></p><p>A bizarre temple that emanated a strong temple god aura grew out, as if breaking through from the ground, appearing within the city.</p><p></p><p>The spider web-like cracks radiated from the bizarre temple as the center, like the branches of a great celestial tree, extending towards all parts of the city.</p><p></p><p>"Feilei City is doomed..."</p><p></p><p>"This Cao Guang... is really ruthless, completely disregarding the lives of the people of Feilei City, perhaps... in his eyes, the common people are no different from pigs and dogs."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing a cat-faced mask, narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre temple had migrated into the city, and the entire city would be infected by the divine power of the temple god. If it did not leave for a long time, they would all become temple god evil spirits and cursed corpses.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason why the major families in the city planned to make a profit and move out of Feilei City after learning that the city lord Cao Guang was going to hold a Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet.</p><p></p><p>And Cao Guang had obtained the power of the temple god, and could even control these cursed corpses.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, Cao Guang's plan was not just to sacrifice a thousand spirit children, but the entire city of Feilei City!</p><p></p><p>"Trash worse than pigs and dogs!"</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qingshan couldn't help but have an iron-gray face and curse.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, this was the overall state of the remote and marginal cities in the great world. Cultivators used all kinds of means to obtain power from the bizarre temples.</p><p></p><p>Add to that the various sects and factions secretly stirring up the winds and clouds.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the common people suffered too much.</p><p></p><p>The two high-level experts of the Corpse God Sect and the Spirit Baby Sect's Spirit Baby Patriarch all focused their gaze.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Baby Patriarch's face under the mask was extremely excited: "It's done, it's done!"</p><p></p><p>"But what's going on with the two temple gods fighting?"</p><p></p><p>"There's only one bizarre temple near Feilei City, where did the other temple god come from?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Baby Patriarch was completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but Li Qingshan and the high-level experts of the Corpse God Sect were also very confused.</p><p></p><p>Boom! When Cao Guang, carrying the temple god and being controlled by the temple god's will, shot out from the ruins of the Marquis Mansion, turning into a blood python piercing through the sky and rushing towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of several people flashed, having an urge to go and watch the show.</p><p></p><p>"A battle between temple gods?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a rare occurrence... Where did this intruding temple god come from?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan grinned, the mood of a spectator surging up.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he still suppressed this emotion, his gaze sweeping over and weighing the Goat Horn Heavenly Hammer in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Then his gaze fell on the two high-level experts of the Corpse God Sect and the Spirit Baby Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the cat-faced mask suddenly became cold and indifferent, with overwhelming killing intent surging out.</p><p></p><p>Since the temple gods were fighting, let the temple gods fight their own battles...</p><p></p><p>He would hammer them.</p><p></p><p>These trash... must all die!</p><p></p><p>Kill them and then run!</p><p></p><p>As long as the two temple gods didn't both stay, it would be easy for him to escape.</p><p></p><p>Just do it!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a step forward, the overwhelming divine power in the Goat Horn Heavenly Hammer surging out, causing all the wind and rain to twist and distort.</p><p></p><p>He swayed his body, the tip of his foot tapping the surface of the pooled water, splashing up, rushing towards the small Spirit Baby Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, are you crazy? The temple gods have come out, and you still don't leave? Are you not afraid of being left behind in the city?!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Baby Patriarch shouted in alarm, hastily counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>The two high-level experts of the Corpse God Sect also acted, the six-desire divine power raging and surging, one wave of divine foundation after another floating out from behind their heads, the divine light bursting and flowing!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his sleeve, the Goat Horn Hammer lightly falling, but suddenly exploded with earth-shattering terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>"Heh... I just want to kill you all!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rain kept falling.</p><p></p><p>Gathering on Cao Guang's chin, dripping down like threads, like a broken string of pearls, falling continuously.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang felt his consciousness return to his own body.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit numb, a bit annoyed! The divine power... the divine power of the temple god was so scarce and pitiful! It seemed to have been drained long ago.</p><p></p><p>With such a temple god, he had spent years carefully planning, preparing to sacrifice the entire city...</p><p></p><p>Was it worthy?!</p><p></p><p>"What a disappointing god!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang gritted his teeth, his heart chilled, now he only hoped that the scarce temple god divine power could help him break through to the divine foundation realm, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Suddenly, Cao Guang regained control of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>He saw the scene in front of him clearly.</p><p></p><p>A mask, a cute cow.</p><p></p><p>And then the overwhelming terrifying Qi-Blood, as well as the divine power pressure!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The emotions of disbelief surged in his heart...</p><p></p><p>What the hell? Why is it you again, you cow!</p><p></p><p>However, what truly made him feel horrified, fearful, and trembling was...</p><p></p><p>The seven pitch-black chess pieces floating in front of the Ox Demon, emanating an extremely dense temple god divine power aura.</p><p></p><p>It turned out, the temple god divine power he had craved so much...</p><p></p><p>Was right in front of him, within reach, just a step away...</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang suddenly realized why his consciousness was able to regain control of his body.</p><p></p><p>You came to show off? And I came to get beaten, is that it?</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, what a disappointing god!" </p><p></p><p>Cao Guang could only scream out in agony before being kicked, exploding into a mist of blood and being blasted away.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

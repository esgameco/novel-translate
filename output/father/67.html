        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The body of Zhao Xuanhai was surrounded by a crowd that was impossible to break through.</p><p></p><p>The officials had already arrived, and the officers in black robes covered the body with a white cloth and dispersed the onlooking crowd.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, in a quiet corner, a spirited horse neighed and exhaled hot air.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli and Xu Beihu were sitting respectfully, and in front of them was a wooden statue of the ancestral deity.</p><p></p><p>The wooden statue of the ancestral deity, about the size of a palm, made the two sons of the Xu family extremely devout and respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Old Patriarch, is there really no problem with that Li Che?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Heli asked with some uncertainty, furrowing his brows. He still felt there was something strange about Li Che, which was his intuition.</p><p></p><p>"The old man has investigated, there is no problem..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, it's not him, this person's qi and blood are perfectly tempered, and his physical strength also matches the tempered perfection, under the old man's spiritual perception, he could not have hidden his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"As for his spiritual nature, it is extremely weak and can be ignored... It matches the spiritual intensity that was drawn when he just promoted to a wood carving master."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, he cannot be the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>Even if a spiritual cultivator came in spirit form to investigate, they could not have misjudged.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivators, with their refined spirits, have perception abilities far surpassing those of ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli, hearing this, finally completely dispelled the doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xuanhai is dead... and he died in the identity of the Sect Master of the Lingying Sect, the matter is a bit troublesome..."</p><p></p><p>"It was you who informed Zhao Xuanhai about Li Che becoming a wood carving master, and the result was that Zhao Xuanhai died on the way, the Xu family... has a bit of mud on their pants that can't be washed off."</p><p></p><p>"And Li Che may also have some suspicions, but the problem is not big."</p><p></p><p>"The real problem comes from the City Lord Cao Guang, if he really starts to doubt, it will not be good for our Xu family."</p><p></p><p>"I will go to the City Lord's mansion, you two should stay in the Xu family manor, don't wander around, especially you, Heli..."</p><p></p><p>"That Ox Demon who can kill Zhao Xuanhai also has the ability to kill you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's skin crawled at these words, and his hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu next to him also trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The wooden statue of the ancestral deity glanced at Xu Beihu: "You don't need to tremble, that Ox Demon... probably doesn't deign to kill you, if he wants to kill you, trembling won't help, it's better to die quickly."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's mouth twitched, but he had no words to refute.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the City Lord is going to hold a 'Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet', it is inevitable. I and several other spiritual cultivators have chosen to cooperate with the City Lord... Once the banquet is successful, we spiritual cultivators will all receive great benefits!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter is grand, you two must pay attention to it, especially you, Heli, prepare well, and strive to gain benefits when the banquet is successful... See if you can forge a spiritual foundation in one go!"</p><p></p><p>The wooden statue said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's breathing paused slightly, and a gleam of joy flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual foundation, ah... If he could seize this opportunity, it would be a great thing for him. How many cultivators like rivers of nature were stuck at the step of forging a spiritual foundation? Although the spiritual foundation forged through the "Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet" might not be very stable, as long as he could forge a spiritual foundation, that would be enough! Once he forged a spiritual foundation, he would live for two hundred years, what else could he ask for?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Can I cultivate two kinds of spiritual natures?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was burning, his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>It was not about using the Thousand Slivers technique to absorb other people's spiritual natures, the so-called containing two kinds of spiritual natures, but about truly cultivating two kinds of spiritual nature laws, and being able to condense two kinds of spiritual foundations in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Others may not be able to do it, they may be disturbed by the collision of the two spiritual natures and lose their sanity, but I'm different..."</p><p></p><p>"I have the Dao Fruit [Untainted Heart], a pure spiritual nature, untainted and flawless... I actually have a chance to try it."</p><p></p><p>Cultivating two kinds of spiritual nature laws... In the future, he would be able to forge two kinds of spiritual foundations.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement to his combat power would definitely be huge.</p><p></p><p>After pondering the feasibility for a moment, Li Che no longer thought much about it, and began to flip through the golden book "Cultivation Law of the Great Anger Amitabha from the Temple of Great Scenery".</p><p></p><p>"The Temple of Great Scenery..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, this was officially marked.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this cultivation law came from the Great Scenery Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>And in terms of rank, it was even higher than the Nine Yao Angry Cry Demon-Subduing he had previously obtained from司慕白.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, [Anger Amitabha] is an Eight Extremes level cultivation law!</p><p></p><p>He opened and carefully read through it.</p><p></p><p>With his previous experience in cultivating [Angry Cry Demon-Subduing], Li Che's comprehension ability was much higher than before.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"'Wrathful Amitabha'... requires the cultivation of one's qi and blood, activating one's own qi and blood, surging through the heart and mind, with the blood rising in anger..."  Li Che pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>After committing the content fully to memory, he stood up, clenching his five fingers, and the pure and unblemished Qiankun space expelled a massive iron broadsword weighing 800 jin.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the long blade, the heavy sensation flowed from his hand. Li Che's breathing was steady as he slowly circulated the qi and blood within his body.</p><p></p><p>He did not know any blade techniques, but that did not prevent him from wielding this blade using the techniques of the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist, with his inner qi and blood surging in response.</p><p></p><p>The sound of piercing the air wailed and howled, like rumbling thunder!</p><p></p><p>It was as if an angry spiritual beast was coursing through his meridians, his entire body trembling with powerful sinews, the tiger bones roaring in fury!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body quickly turned a fiery red, steam rising, and the falling snow in the sky was evaporated and melted. According to the cultivation method of the 'Wrathful Amitabha', he nurtured the divine nature. The wandering divine nature in the heavens and earth gradually coalesced.</p><p></p><p>It was like a scarlet celestial spark, diffusing and approaching.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's heart trembled, the 'Chess Sage' Dao fruit erupting, and a black chess piece condensed in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>This chess piece... was formed by the condensation of the divine nature of the 'Wrathful Amitabha'!</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered thoughtfully, clenching his five fingers fiercely, like the roar of an angry Amitabha Buddha. Wispy strands of white mist suddenly drifted out from beneath Li Che's skin!</p><p></p><p>The wrathful divine nature contained within this chess piece had actually fused into Li Che's body.</p><p></p><p>The Mud Pill (Nidan) in Li Che's brow suddenly glowed, his eyes turning scarlet.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of divine nature requires the opening of the inner landscape (Neidao) in the Mud Pill, and the nurturing of divine nature within the inner landscape...</p><p></p><p>But each person only has one inner landscape, which means that Li Che needs to nurture two types of divine nature within a single inner landscape.</p><p></p><p>This is the root of the chaos!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was solemn as he carefully sensed the state of his own inner landscape. If there was even the slightest irregularity... he would have to abandon the cultivation of the second type of divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth suddenly became deathly quiet, and Li Che felt as if he could hear the sound of his own heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>Crystal clear, like thunderous roars in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Then, from the 'Pure Heart' Dao fruit, the pure and flawless divine nature surged forth, flowing into the Mud Pill inner landscape.</p><p></p><p>The 'Resentment' and 'Wrath' divine natures, which were almost boiling and colliding violently, began to calm down due to the influx of the Pure Heart divine nature.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Pure Heart had a harmonizing and lubricating effect...</p><p></p><p>With the soothing of the Pure Heart, the two divine natures stabilized without incident.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The icy sensation of the snowflakes striking his face caused Li Che to open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A gleam of joy flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Wrathful Amitabha' is complete!"</p><p></p><p>An unexpected joy! Li Che had not even imagined that he could directly refine the Wrathful Amitabha divine nature into a 'chess piece' form. If he could refine ten-eight such chess pieces, wouldn't the Wrathful Amitabha divine nature reach the realm of cultivation like a river? "If I could slay a cultivator of the Wrathful Amitabha divine nature... wouldn't that be a fast track to establishing my Immortal Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>The combination and matching of Dao fruits seems... more effective than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Within the inner landscape, the gradual refinement of the Wrathful Amitabha divine nature will take some time.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused his divine nature cultivation and flipped through the second golden-bound book.</p><p></p><p>This book was a divine nature secret technique manual, 'Wrathful Amitabha Golden Robe'. A defensive divine nature secret art, once cultivated, the defensive power would greatly increase, forming a 'Amitabha Golden Robe' around the body! Immune to blades and arrows, unharmed by fire and water!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze sharpened, taking a deep breath...</p><p></p><p>Defensive divine nature secret arts made him think of his own 'Namo Gatling Wood Crow'. Once the Amitabha Golden Robe was formed, the automatic defense would mean his firepower... might not be threatening enough.</p><p></p><p>"Glimpsing the whole from a part, with the Amitabha Golden Robe, there must be other defensive divine nature secret arts..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder that night I couldn't annihilate Zhao Xuanhai and the others..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I infused divine nature into the Wood Crow, increasing the explosive power, facing defensive divine nature secret arts, simply increasing the number of Wood Crows doesn't seem to work..."</p><p></p><p>"If faced with Immortal Foundation cultivators activating the Amitabha Golden Robe, I might not even be able to break through the defense."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, a sense of anxiety rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I need to try using the 'Immortal Craftsmanship' Dao fruit to develop a..."</p><p></p><p>"Namo Barrett Wood Crow?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Don't stop reading, everyone must read to the last page, hold on to the reading, don't give up on Old Li, there's still a chance to save him!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

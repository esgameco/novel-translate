        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thud! Thud! The muffled footsteps, like bells and drums, approaching from afar.</p><p></p><p>The thick snow on the ground, mixed with rainwater, stirred up rippling waves like a shaking quilt, spreading out from the distance and crashing onto the blue stone steps in front of Xu's wood carving shop, erupting into waves of snow like crashing tides.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave, as if each step would stir up such ripples.</p><p></p><p>The wailing cries, circling endlessly, came from the other end of the long street to this end.</p><p></p><p>As if the gates of hell had been opened, the wailing ghosts...</p><p></p><p>Howling out, walking the human world at night! In the alleys.</p><p></p><p>The old man listened to the approaching footsteps, feeling the intense spirituality mixed in the footsteps, gently patting the child Lü Chi beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Go, foolish child."</p><p></p><p>"For a martial artist to get involved in the battle of a spiritual cultivator... is too much."</p><p></p><p>The old man said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lü Chi's eyes showed no fear, but rather burned like a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>"Master, leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Consider it an early surprise for my unmarried junior sister!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi grinned crookedly, revealing a dazzling smile.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he took out a thumb-sized wooden sculpture from his bosom. Though small, it was a vivid carving of a child holding a red-tasseled spear, with a bun hairstyle, wearing a red belly warmer, and surrounded by red silk.</p><p></p><p>Evidently the work of a great master.</p><p></p><p>Glaring eyes, angry gaze, domineering...</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi pressed the thumb-sized wooden sculpture against his brow, and suddenly there were sparkling particles of spirituality floating out from the sculpture, the spirituality contained within.</p><p></p><p>All of it was absorbed into Lü Chi's brow, as the wooden sculpture crumbled into dust and sand slipping through his chubby palms.</p><p></p><p>A red dot appeared on Lü Chi's brow, his eyes burning with fury!</p><p></p><p>"My unmarried junior sister is going to die miserably!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I'm so angry!"</p><p></p><p>"Prince, help me!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi shouted, his anger surging, his eyes burning, his aura rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled, flicking his finger, and a red silk ribbon flew out, wrapping around Lü Chi's body.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi's face was completely obscured by the spirituality of raging fury that emanated from him!</p><p></p><p>The swirling snow and wind enveloped him, the red silk ribbons coiling around him, as if he was stepping on a tornado, a terrifying sight. The old man stroked his beard and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The spirituality of fury.</p><p></p><p>[The Furious Third Prince]!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The pattering of winter rain mixed with snow pellets rained down from high above, falling on the oiled paper umbrella, bouncing like marbles.</p><p></p><p>Under the umbrella, a figure in white robes, whiter than the snow, with a handsome yet eerie beauty, eyes filled with melancholy, a tear mole at the corner of the eye, as if about to pour out all the sorrow in the world.</p><p></p><p>The strands of hair on his forehead gently swayed, revealing Sī Mù Bái's tear-stained face.</p><p></p><p>Holding the umbrella with one hand, he walked step by step, each step causing the snow on the ground to roll and surge forward, clearing a clean path for him to walk.</p><p></p><p>He was strolling leisurely towards Xu's wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Unconcerned about the situation inside the wood carving shop, no matter how tragic and urgent it might be.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Zhao Chuán Xióng having his head severed by the Ox Demon, or the four blood-exchanging martial artists battling and chasing the Ox Demon, the heart-pounding pursuit...</p><p></p><p>None of it caused his rhythmic steps to show the slightest panic.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Chuán Xióng is dead."</p><p></p><p>Sī Mù Bái pursed his lips, the vivid tear mole seeming to exude even more profound sorrow, his tear-filled voice tinged with grief.</p><p></p><p>"How unfortunate... Dead is dead, I'm so afraid, so afraid that Zhào Xuán Hǎi will come trouble me..."</p><p></p><p>"The divine constable killed me, I'm so afraid, so sad... Wuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Sī Mù Bái was shrouded in sorrow, cultivating his spiritual nature, using emotional states as the basis to activate his spiritual powers. Refining one's emotions is a must-learn lesson for every spiritual cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the tear-filled sorrow, his eyes were clear and lucid.</p><p></p><p>Sī Mù Bái looked at the Xu wood carving shop in the snowy night, the sorrow mixed with gloom, for the Ox Demon had appeared.</p><p></p><p>During the day, Zhao Chuán Xióng had brazenly taken Chén Dà Bǎo away, and now caused a commotion outside the Xu wood carving shop, clearly provoking the Ox Demon's attack.</p><p></p><p>But even Sī Mù Bái had underestimated the Ox Demon's rate of power increase.</p><p></p><p>The remnant of the [Weeping Demon-Subduing] spiritual power he had left on Zhao Chuán Xióng transmitted back the information, letting him know that the Ox Demon had already exchanged blood!</p><p></p><p>"So fast... This Ox Demon, who is he really?"</p><p></p><p>Sī Mù Bái was truly curious.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he racked his brain, he could not find a match for the Ox Demon in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Whether martial artists or spiritual cultivators, none seemed to fit the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This city... does not need heroes."</p><p></p><p>"Tonight."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see this lone hero off on his journey."</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái held an oiled paper umbrella, and the raindrops sliding off the umbrella brim were like the tears falling from his sorrowful eyes.</p><p></p><p>Though the thought of killing the Ox Demon Hero filled Sī Mùbái's heart with a barely suppressed excitement, the sadness was still overwhelming, and he couldn't help but want to smile wryly.</p><p></p><p>Part crying, part laughing, his sobs were like a ghost's.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái's raised foot came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>A dull thud! The snow, like a cotton quilt, was stirred up and scattered into the distance.</p><p></p><p>His stiff neck raised with difficulty, his expression carved in wood, utterly rigid with anguish.</p><p></p><p>The snow, surging forward like a tidal wave, melted under the intense heat, becoming the river's current, as if there was a raging fire ahead, burning and melting the ice and snow down the entire street!</p><p></p><p>But above that surging tide,</p><p></p><p>a child with fiery eyes, their features indistinct, their body wrapped in red silk like a dancing dragon, their black hair swirling wildly like underwater plants.</p><p></p><p>Their chubby, well-nourished fists clenched in anger, glaring fiercely at him.</p><p></p><p>That divinity, so intense, blooming like a red lotus.</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái's sorrowful face, grief so deep it couldn't be washed away, stared at the child like a red lotus, his hairs standing on end.</p><p></p><p>"Such divinity... the wrathful divinity, a Fourth-Order... [Wrathful Prince]?"</p><p></p><p>Down the entire street...</p><p></p><p>Under the high heat, the rain and snow melted, the falling rain turning into a torrential downpour, pounding loudly on the umbrella, soaking the originally elegant Sī Mùbái through.</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái's face flushed an unnatural red.</p><p></p><p>He coughed violently, the grief in his eyes seeming to shatter, replaced by fear.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth-Order?"</p><p>"Impossible! How could Flying Thunder City have a Fourth-Order divine foundation?!"</p><p>"How could this be?!"</p><p>"This Ox Demon... has someone backing him up!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood roaring like an angry python, the rain falling on his burly form instantly evaporating.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè, wearing a cute ox mask, felt the rain pattering on his straw hat, slightly puzzled as the snow... had all melted into rain? But he couldn't dwell on the changes in the weather, as four fiery auras were closing in, surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>His foot stomped heavily, the bluestone bricks cracking and a spider-web of fissures spreading.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè paused his ox-like, demonic figure, his eyes behind the mask calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Here, in the remote area of Xu's Wood Carving Shop, far from his own courtyard, these four bloodthirsty experts had created the illusion of him being trapped with no escape.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè did not retreat.</p><p></p><p>Three elite blood-refining experts from the Spirit Infant Sect, arrayed before him, blocking his three directions of escape.</p><p></p><p>They wore children's masks, some crying, some laughing, some angry...</p><p></p><p>And further in the distance, like a sharp spear standing upright on the rooftop, was Sī Mùbái's subordinate blood-refining expert Guō Zhàn, bow drawn, arrows nocked, watching him indifferently, the rain tracing lines down his chin.</p><p></p><p>No matter how torrential the rain, it could not make his aimed arrows waver in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Run, Ox Demon, run!"</p><p>"Swallowed the bait, no, the ox bait... and still want to escape? There's no such cheap deal!"</p><p></p><p>The three blood-refining experts of the Spirit Infant Sect, their masked gazes sinister as they stared at Li Chè.</p><p></p><p>"There's nowhere left to run. Surrender peacefully, and let us see..."</p><p>"What kind of hero's face is hidden behind that Ox Demon mask of yours?"</p><p></p><p>A blood-refining expert wearing a crying child's mask sneered.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè, wearing the straw hat, his stretchy clothes completely soaked through by the rain, perfectly outlining his burly, muscular frame.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>A dead end? No escape route?!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the current situation... had truly driven him to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv. 1, 90%)]</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit prompt appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Just a little more...</p><p></p><p>But soon.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè suddenly raised his head, his eyes burning with battle intent, the murderous aura suppressed within his heart now unleashed without restraint! In this moment,</p><p></p><p>all the anxiety and unease he had endured since crossing into this world, all the fury and killing intent at seeing the Spirit Infant Sect's rampant tyranny - it would all be fully vented in this battle!</p><p></p><p>I will...</p><p></p><p>Annihilate! All! Of! You!</p>

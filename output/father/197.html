            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone with brilliance, as still as a deep well.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (LV4, 0%)】</p><p></p><p>Finally... it's done! As the third Dao Fruit obtained by Li Che, in terms of progress, it has actually been a bit slow.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Saint Dao Fruit had already been upgraded to LV4 before this Untainted Heart Dao Fruit, mainly because the advancement of the Untainted Heart was not that easy.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the rapid upgrade was mainly due to him continuously and frantically absorbing sixth-grade divine essence crystals to make up for the progress.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he had also absorbed the divine essence power of a Soul Shedding Immortal Realm cultivator, as well as the divine essence of six Black Armor Blood Guards...</p><p></p><p>Finally, he was able to push the Untainted Heart to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's jet-black hair whirled and flew, his eyes opening and closing, and in the depths of his pupils, a wisp of white mist seemed to be rolling, gradually becoming more and more, gradually filling his pupils.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Immensely powerful forces suddenly burst forth, even though Li Che had now stepped into the Great Grandmaster realm, his physical body unparalleled, his strength tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>But he was still effortlessly pulled into the boundless heaven and earth! Vast, boundless, ancient! This was Li Che's constant perception of this world.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Tree rose from the ground, spreading its canopy like a great net, lush and verdant, gently swaying, and every vein on every leaf was clearly visible under Li Che's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind trembled slightly, the leaves of the Dao Tree were as clear as jade, swaying gently in the breeze, the rustling sound like the sound of the world's rotation.</p><p></p><p>Dao Fruits hung on it, shimmering with brilliance!</p><p></p><p>And one of the white Dao Fruits emitted a pure radiance, like a low-power light bulb, shining brightly, suspended and reflecting.</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart Dao Fruit! The Dao Fruit detached from the Dao Tree and flew towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>A fierce wind blew, and turbulent currents shot out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt his black hair whirling, his ink-black robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and touched the floating Dao Fruit, and in that instant of contact, it was as if an invisible electric current had surged through his entire body! In an instant, Li Che felt that his soul had become clear and clean, as if all impurities had been washed away.</p><p></p><p>Like lying in a warm pool, so comfortable that he couldn't help but want to fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not resist this drowsiness, in fact, he couldn't resist it, his eyelids fluttering up and down, and he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The world was silent, and even with his eyes closed, his vision was all a moist white.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He only felt that his spirit had a kind of unprecedented comfort, as if it had been washed a thousand times, completely clean and spotless.</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip, drip—</p><p></p><p>The raindrops that had gathered were dripping from the eaves, forming lines and continuously falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could clearly feel everything, his divine sense had become clear and pure, not strengthened, but extremely refined.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was a sense of his soul having been washed, with no more barriers between his spirit and flesh.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was open and calm, without joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The radiance before him flowed like the long river of time, quietly flowing.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit LV4, Second Shedding, Nascent Divine Ability (Untainted Heart·Restrain Spirit) Promoted, Obtained Divine Ability (Untainted Heart·Spirit Summon)】</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart Dao Fruit...</p><p></p><p>Second Shedding!</p><p></p><p>Divine Ability, Spirit Summon?! Li Che's gaze flickered slightly, Restrain Spirit had been promoted to Spirit Summon...</p><p></p><p>What is Spirit Summon?</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no idea, but the Divine Ability must be higher than the Nascent Divine Ability, at least the growth potential would be greater, this was undoubtedly true.</p><p></p><p>A deep sleep, thoroughly cleansing the soul, allowed Li Che's entire body to relax, his spirit at ease, his mental state better than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Inhaling and exhaling, long and steady.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the prompt changed again.</p><p></p><p>【Spirit Summon (Divine Ability): Deities in Silence, Darkness like Tides, Untainted like Light, I Summon the Myths】</p><p></p><p>【First Realm: Summon Deities】</p><p></p><p>【Shatter Fragmented Spirits, Souls Return, Deities Come to Me, I See the Deities】</p><p></p><p>【Second Realm: ???】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed as he looked at the flowing light in front of him, his heart slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Because the information... seems to be a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>Deities in Silence, Darkness like Tides? It seems to reveal some great secret, yet says nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but think of the mysterious temples that kept sprouting up in this world, with temple deities in them, as if they were the continuation of deities that had perished...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze rippled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation level rises higher, the more he knows... the more awe he will have for this world.</p><p></p><p>Great Grandmasters are very strong, but as the realm of cultivation advances, one will see the scenery at the higher reaches, and understand what true power and terror is.</p><p></p><p>"Deities..." </p><p></p><p>"They're all dead."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured the words Li Qingshan had once said to him.</p><p></p><p>He inexplicably felt a slight heaviness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was as if just mentioning or even thinking about this topic would bring a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, dispelling these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to study the Divine Ability he had just obtained.</p><p></p><p>"Summon Deities... Can it bring back the dead deities?"</p><p></p><p>"Deities see me, I see the deities?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to his understanding, it was like this.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes slightly, the flowing light slowly flowed through his mind, as if imparting and teaching Li Che what the [Summon Deities] of the first realm of Spirit Summon was.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Che slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The power of Summon Deities... Borrow the power of the deities?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I won't be returning it once I borrow it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but raise the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, this [Summon Deities] Divine Ability is a bit like the [Qi Saint] Dao Fruit combined with [Pluck the Stars Eyes], able to absorb the divine essence of temple deities and condense them into chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>And then achieve the purpose of borrowing the power of the "dead" deities.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the temple deity divine essence chess pieces, it is more tyrannical... more forceful in borrowing power.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, only feeling that his mind had become much more clear and transparent, his divine sense washed and purified, seemingly even slightly translucent, as if it had become even more free of impurities.</p><p></p><p>The second shedding of the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit did not bring the same intense reaction as the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] and [Qi Saint] Dao Fruits.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Golden Armor directly caused Li Che to transform into the Furnace Body, and the Qi Saint Dao Fruit caused Li Che's divine sense to mature prematurely, both of which involved enduring pain.</p><p></p><p>But this second shedding of the Untainted Heart Dao Fruit was more like a massage-like baptism, quietly and gently completing the transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Borrow the power of the deities..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the figure standing under the eaves leaned forward.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the entire person plunged into the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>But then disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was already in the mysterious Fire-Eyed Gibbon Deity Temple.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple was as quiet as ever, the white candle flames flickering, emitting a faint sound of the dancing fire.</p><p></p><p>Even, because Li Che had absorbed too much of the deity's divine essence, the mysterious temple seemed to have a kind of holy and tranquil serenity.</p><p></p><p>This made the temple guardians stationed outside extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Because the mysterious temple had been too honest lately.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che appeared, the Gibbon Deity statue on the altar seemed to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's ink-black robe fluttered, a harmless and gentle smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across, landing on the Gibbon Deity statue...</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over here!"</p><p></p><p>"Bastard!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>His expression slightly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Did he just hear something? Was it an auditory hallucination?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his gaze locked onto the Gibbon Deity statue, and his eyes gradually revealed a sinister color.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to...</p><p></p><p>Really hear the deity speaking?</p><p></p><p>But, was this deity cursing him?</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che, was gentle and polite, honest and upright, how could this deity curse him?</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a step forward, coming to the front of the altar, staring at the Fire-Eyed Gibbon Deity.</p><p></p><p>The sound of cursing in his ears gradually began to subside.</p><p></p><p>As if they were a little embarrassed to be stared at by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, the tip of his foot touching down, his figure floating and landing on the altar.</p><p></p><p>"Again... bastard!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, whatever."</p><p></p><p>The Gibbon Deity's voice carried a bit of resignation and hopelessness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suppressed the urge to laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his palm pressed down on the top of the Gibbon Deity's head.</p><p></p><p>On that bald head.</p><p></p><p>Divine Ability, Summon Deities!</p><p></p><p>Souls Return!</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Li Che only felt the entire mysterious temple shaking and trembling, the Fire-Eyed Gibbon Deity statue seeming to be covered in cracks.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle! Towering death qi and black qi gushed out from the cracks in the deity statue, extremely dense! As if in an instant, they transformed into countless black serpents like ink!  Li Che's gaze focused, his figure instantly bouncing back, landing on the ground of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom! </p><p></p><p>The sounds of explosions made the air seem to be corroded and dissolved in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's toes touched down, his speed reaching the extreme.</p><p></p><p>When he was at the Grandmaster realm, Li Che had already tempered his physical body into a Furnace Grandmaster, the so-called Furnace Grandmaster being a perfected physical body, with maximum growth potential, like a furnace, able to refine the essence of the physical body to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of extreme state.</p><p></p><p>And now, although Li Che had just stepped into the Great Grandmaster realm, he had broken through based on the foundation of a Furnace Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was in no way inferior to some well-known Deity Manifestation Great Grandmasters who had been famous for decades.</p><p></p><p>"Death qi... a bit similar to the death qi of the Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, his five fingers clenched, and he suddenly struck out.</p><p></p><p>Dragon roar exploded, Dragon Elephant howled! A death qi serpent was instantly shattered by him, exploding into an extremely dense black death qi firework.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body trembled, the tendons and bones on his fist all vibrating in an instant.</p><p></p><p>These death qi serpents were very strong, even if a Half-Step Great Grandmaster encountered them, they would likely suffer heavy injuries, or even be corroded and have their flesh and blood consumed by the death qi.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fist, pushing it out horizontally, the true essence of the Dao whirling, his heart pounding like a furnace, the surging powerful energy, striking out with unyielding divine might.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even fused the blood qi halo and divine might together.</p><p></p><p>The power of the divine might became even more terrifying! Slap slap slap—! As all the death qi that had shot out from the Gibbon Deity statue were scattered and suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt the Heavenly Earth Chessboard shaking.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, countless Untainted Heart divine essence chess pieces trembled, actually exploding into divine essence mist, turning into root-like whips that lashed out, penetrating into the cracked deity statue.</p><p></p><p>Gurgle gurgle...</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart tentacles writhed, as if devouring something.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the mysterious temple, his arms hanging down.</p><p></p><p>The powerful blood like mercury flowed slowly, emitting the roaring sound of a raging river.</p><p></p><p>His expression was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>You call this Summon Deities?</p><p></p><p>But, feeling the gradually emerging deity divine essence in the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, Li Che no longer cared too much about it.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>A Gibbon completely condensed from the deity's divine essence appeared.</p><p></p><p>As if directly moving the deity statue from the mysterious temple...</p><p></p><p>And placing it in the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind returned, only to find that the deity statue on the altar had completely dried up, scattered and broken on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart jumped, feeling the entire mysterious temple shaking! Rumble rumble—!!! Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>An extremely terrifying aura of death crisis instantly shrouded Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's toes touched down, appearing at the entrance of the mysterious temple, looking towards the rolling mist of the Demon Spire.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Demon Spire shaking incessantly, the next moment, as if split in half by a powerful sword technique, the mist dispersed, the Demon Spire divided in two!</p><p></p><p>A blue finger suddenly pointed out from the Demon Spire.</p><p></p><p>Extremely dense death qi swirled around that blue finger! The terrifying level of divine essence pressure made the entire heaven and earth seem to freeze in an instant, the air not even able to flow a bit.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Che had forged the Seven Revolving Divine Foundations, in the face of such terrifying divine essence pressure, he didn't even have the strength to move a single finger! Terrifying! Extremely terrifying! As if wanting to drag him down to the Eighteen Layers of Hell, never to rise again! Extremely terrifying! Like facing a realm of death, countless death qi gushing and rolling out, like a vast sea, wanting to drown him, to devour him.</p><p></p><p>The death qi serpents that had gushed out from the deity statue before were simply insignificant in the face of this blue death qi finger! Li Che's eyes darkened.</p><p></p><p>His mind moved.</p><p></p><p>The [Qi Saint] Dao Fruit throbbed.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a thought flashed.</p><p></p><p>The entire person disappeared from the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>And that blue death qi finger, after Li Che disappeared, then fell onto the mysterious temple with irresistible force.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble! The walls crumbled into powder, the roof crushed in an instant, the white candle flames dimly burning, swallowed by the dust, completely extinguished and vanished.</p><p></p><p>The entire mysterious temple disappeared without a trace, leaving only the deathly silence as the main melody.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Spire raged, shaking incessantly, roaring waves after waves!</p><p></p><p>The mountains and earth trembled, the entire mountain seemed to be shaking, as if about to collapse!</p><p></p><p>At the middle of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yang Hao, the temple guardian stationed at this mysterious temple, was suddenly horrified, all the temple guardians instantly awakening.</p><p></p><p>They drew their swords and came, standing outside the Demon Spire.</p><p></p><p>Watching the rolling, restless Demon Spire, their whole bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Spire rose higher and higher, the rolling mist...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mist surged into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Oppressive, cramped, terrifying... and the irresistible, as if it would reduce them to ashes, the terrible divine rank! It was as if a terrifyingly powerful divine being was roaring and howling in the mysterious altar.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yangchao did not know when he had fallen to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Every inch of his flesh and blood was trembling and shaking from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter...</p><p></p><p>The rain, falling from thousands of feet above.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth became calm, the rain falling on the ground, splashing up mud.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yangchao and many divine messengers sat on the ground, staring blankly ahead.</p><p></p><p>Ahead...</p><p></p><p>There was only a huge deep pit...</p><p></p><p>The mysterious altar disappeared, the mysterious mist vanished, even the oppressive, cramped, and constantly emanating divine mysterious temple also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That Eight Extremes Fire-Eye Mysterious Gibbon Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>As if it had been...</p><p></p><p>Erased from the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Luo Hua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The gale force winds instantly exploded, countless raindrops instantly bursting into water mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che landed, taking a step down, and the entire courtyard floor instantly sank and collapsed, spider web-like cracks instantly radiating outwards.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the gale force winds finally calmed, and the rain water flowed smoothly again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the rain curtain, his ink-black robe soaked by the rain.</p><p></p><p>He slowly straightened up, but his brow was furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"In the mysterious altar, what was there exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the fingers that had descended, shrouded in an extremely dense deathly aura, tearing open the mysterious altar and mysterious mist.</p><p></p><p>An air of solemnity could not help but emerge in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What was that thing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart felt slightly heavy.</p><p></p><p>Even the joy of the newly hatched Immaculate Heart Dao Fruit had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This Fire-Eye Mysterious Gibbon Mysterious Temple was just one of the Eight Extremes Mysterious Temples, but the terrifying existence that had torn open the mysterious altar had brought such a terrifying rank.</p><p></p><p>"That rank... Spiritual Origin Embryo Shedding? Or... Spiritual Embryo?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, the boiling blood in his body gradually calming down.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the flying chess piece left in the Mysterious Temple had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Fire-Eye Mysterious Gibbon Mysterious Temple... had been erased.</p><p></p><p>Was it because he had summoned the temple deity away?</p><p></p><p>Pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Shaking off all the rain water, he sat down on the bamboo chair.</p><p></p><p>He began to study the Gibbon Temple Deity that he had summoned to the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, he saw the quiet Gibbon Temple Deity floating beside the [Heavenly Expanse].</p><p></p><p>The rank pressure was very strong, the divine nature of the temple deity distorting the lines of the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, sinking down into a depression.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he had absorbed the Heavenly King divine nature chess piece in the Golden Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine nature of the temple deity was extremely majestic, far beyond what a single chess piece could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"This should belong to the Divine Appearance divine nature, the rank pressure is extremely strong, the temple deity is said to be unrivaled at the same rank, which is indeed true."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is only relative to divine nature cultivators. As for the temple deities themselves, even at the same rank, there are still differences in high and low."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at this temple deity statue completely condensed from the divine nature of the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>He tried to use his divine sense to stir up waves, to communicate with it.</p><p></p><p>But it seems that only when he had just entered the Mysterious Temple could he hear the voice of the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>Now, even though he had summoned this temple deity to the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, he could not hear its voice.</p><p></p><p>After the failed attempt at communication, Li Che was somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>If he could communicate with this temple deity, he should be able to understand the connection between the Mysterious Temple and the Mysterious Altar, and perhaps glimpse the secrets hidden behind the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, the inability to communicate is also good.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, knowing secrets is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>When a person knows secrets that are beyond their level of understanding, the only thing it brings is harm, not benefits.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Gibbon Temple Deity statue, looking and looking...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>"To break through to the Divine Appearance, one needs to observe the temple deity, to outline the divine statue..."</p><p></p><p>"Then can I..."</p><p></p><p>"Can I directly fuse this temple deity statue into my divine foundation? After it merges with my divine foundation and becomes one, wouldn't I be able to step into the Divine Appearance realm directly?"</p><p></p><p>"And the Divine Appearance divine nature obtained will be the power of the temple deity... unrivaled at the same rank."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened at this thought.</p><p></p><p>This idea could no longer be erased.</p><p></p><p>He began to try to fuse the temple deity statue in the Heavenly Earth Chessboard into his divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Eye Mysterious Gibbon Temple Deity belongs to the Surprise divine nature among the Seven Emotions divine natures.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, while operating the Immortal Painting Spiritual Avatar, began to activate the Surprise divine nature techniques, and in the process of activating the techniques, he gradually drew the divine nature of the temple deity in the Heavenly Earth Chessboard into his divine foundation through the Summoning Divine Technique.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A Surprise divine foundation the size of a millstone appeared behind Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of the temple deity initially had some resistance...</p><p></p><p>But slowly, under the soothing of the Summoning Divine Technique, the divine nature of the temple deity eventually gave up the resistance and chose to gradually merge in.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his gaze shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>His mood suddenly became extremely good!</p><p></p><p>Others' divine statues carved from observing temple deities, but Li Che...</p><p></p><p>He directly carved out a temple deity! Imagine, in future battles, Li Che could directly reveal seven temple deities behind him! That rank pressure, it should be able to directly scare the opponent into wetting their pants.</p><p></p><p>"However, now that I've opened this door, my other divine foundations... it's best to do the same, summon temple deities to merge in order to stabilize them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there is no shortage of Mysterious Temples.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining the Summoning Divine Technique, he continued to draw the divine nature of the Gibbon Temple Deity into his divine foundation, a process that Li Che estimated would take about three to four days.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't too concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>During the interval of his divine foundation fusing with the temple deity's divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Li Che began to take stock of the harvest from this trip of killing enemies.</p><p></p><p>The Spatial Orb of the Shadow Guard True Person was almost shattered by him, covered in cracks, with a feeling that it could collapse at any moment. Li Che carefully took it out, confirmed that the internal space had not been damaged, and only then did he relax.</p><p></p><p>Rippling his divine sense, he tore open the barrier and explored inside.</p><p></p><p>He began to take stock.</p><p></p><p>Three and a half pieces of Six Dao Divine Nature Crystals, one piece had absorbed half, the remaining three were brand new.</p><p></p><p>There were as many as twenty pieces of Seven Element Divine Nature Crystals, and even more of the Eight Extremes Nine Luminaries divine nature crystals.</p><p></p><p>The wealth of this Shadow Guard True Person was indeed much richer than the crude Grand Master Warrior Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>As for medicinal pills, it was a bit lacking, but Li Che didn't mind too much.</p><p></p><p>"Six Dao Divine Technique - Merging Shadow Divine Technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at it, and for divine techniques, he was not very interested, feeling that his divine nature talent was a bit inferior to his martial dao.</p><p></p><p>However, this Merging Shadow Divine Technique, its function is not bad either, he can practice it and see.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were not many surprises.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard True Person's martial dao cultivation was average, although he was a Grand Master, he had ultimately broken through by being crafty, and did not collect any profound martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Only an ordinary Grand Master supreme skill, obviously in martial dao, this Shadow Guard True Person had no great ambitions.</p><p></p><p>It was the collection of the six Black Armor Blood Guards that gave Li Che a little surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Six Dao Divine Martial Heaven Soldier Fusion Strike Technique!"</p><p></p><p>This is a military fusion strike technique!</p><p></p><p>The minimum number of people is six, and the maximum can reach a thousand! Those kinds of ten thousand, hundred thousand fusion strike techniques, their rank would not be just Six Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating this kind of fusion strike technique can connect the qi and divine nature of the formation members, enhancing them by a large realm."</p><p></p><p>"If a post-Grand Master realm cultivates it, it can even allow each Grand Master to possess the blood intensity of a Furnace Grand Master in a desperate battle!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between a Furnace Grand Master and an ordinary Grand Master is in the blood intensity, which is a tyrannical blood forged by a thousand temperings.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a temporary reaching of that level... it's still not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Fusion strike technique..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, his gaze shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his Grand Master realm blood, the Grand Master realm Immortal Painting Spiritual Avatar, he should be able to maintain about fifty of them...</p><p></p><p>As his blood and divine nature increase, this number will increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the thousand-person level in the future will not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Thousand-person fusion strike...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred, carefully studying this Heaven Soldier Fusion Strike Technique.</p><p></p><p>After firmly remembering this fusion strike technique in his mind, Li Che stood up and used his blood and divine nature to fuse into divine ink, drawing out six Immortal Painting Grand Master Li Che avatars in the courtyard, letting them cultivate this Heaven Soldier Fusion Strike Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Painting Dao Fruit needs to be pressed more and more.</p><p></p><p>Pressing it more can make the Immortal Painting Dao Fruit molt.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the avatars diligently cultivating the fusion strike technique, he leisurely left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity's divine nature was still continuously merging into the Surprise divine foundation, and after the fusion was complete, Li Che would be able to step into the Divine Appearance realm.</p><p></p><p>Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Holding an oiled paper umbrella, he strolled through the rain alley, the bluestone ground washed clean.</p><p></p><p>Li Che came to a small restaurant, the smoke curling, the fragrance wafting.</p><p></p><p>Even though the rain was pouring, it could not cover up the rich aroma of the dishes wafting out of the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog was lying at the door, as lazy as ever.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, holding the umbrella, crouched in front of the big black dog, staring at it for a while, feeling that the big black dog seemed to have gotten a bit fatter.</p><p></p><p>"Time to lose weight, dog."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed the big black dog's head, then entered the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, the usual, pack one portion."</p><p></p><p>"And two liang of fine wine, I'm in a good mood."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant boss slowly walked out, glanced at Li Che, and slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Old Li, have you come into contact with something unclean?"</p><p></p><p>The boss said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>However, the boss did not say much more, just said to wait, then lifted the curtain and went to the cooking area.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked deeply at the back of the boss.</p><p></p><p>Unclean thing...</p><p></p><p>What unclean thing? Li Che was silent.</p><p></p><p>After packing the food, Li Che bid farewell to the boss and the big black dog and left the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>The boss, wearing a clean white robe, held a golden leaf, standing quietly at the door, the breeze blowing, his sleeves fluttering.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog let out a big yawn, adjusted to a comfortable position, and continued to sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The news of the annihilation of the Prince Xiao Haiwei's funeral procession finally reached the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>It caused a huge uproar! But the various forces all remained silent, not daring to say a word.</p><p></p><p>After all, that funeral procession had a Divine Origin True Person, but that Divine Origin True Person died in an extremely tragic manner, as if he had been punched to death.</p><p></p><p>When Nan Lihuo heard this news while drinking tea and discussing with Li Qingshan how to get in touch with the Ox Demon and Horse Face to stir up trouble.</p><p></p><p>When the news reached the Zheng Lei Peak, many outer disciples were discussing it endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo didn't even know whether he should be happy or not.</p><p></p><p>"Well, Xiao Haiwei is dead, this matter is big enough in itself, being reduced to ashes... is just adding fuel to the fire."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo waved his hand, not taking it seriously.</p><p></p><p>But while he said he didn't take it seriously, his mood was beyond delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshan, help me contact the Ox Demon and Horse Face, the cooperation we discussed before... I think we can proceed with it."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo took a sip of tea, barely suppressing the smile at the corners of his mouth, and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, in his azure robe, naturally knew what Nan Lihuo was talking about.</p><p></p><p>The assassination of the Prefecture Chief of the Golden Light Prefecture, Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>This was something they had agreed on before, and he, Li Qingshan... would finally have a task with a sense of existence! "After all, Su Huai is a court official, assassinating him... the Temple Guardians and the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau should not ignore it..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo said.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Underworld is indeed not weak now, but Zhu Chaoyang, a Grand Master, is guarding the Temple Guardians, and Lu Yao, a Divine Origin True Person, is in the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau...</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master and a Divine Origin True Person, even if they are just symbolic obstructions, are still no small trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Chaoyang and Lu Yao are just there to slack off, they shouldn't go all out."</p><p></p><p>"But we can't let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took out the Underworld Divine Communication Mirror: "The Ox Demon has responded, saying he can do it."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che is now extremely wealthy and does not lack divine crystals, his daughter still needs them, and his wife's future cultivation also needs them.</p><p></p><p>For a married man, earning money to support the family has never been too much.</p><p></p><p>As for the remuneration that Nan Lihuo had promised, although it was little, a small mosquito is still meat!  Moreover, since the Underworld has made the promise, it naturally has to fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>This is the most basic professional ethics.</p><p></p><p>"Then in three days."</p><p></p><p>"And the Monkey Deity needs to intervene and obstruct the experts of the Heavenly Monitoring Bureau and the Temple Guardians, the remuneration... five pieces of Seven Element Divine Nature Crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo gritted his teeth, summoning a Grand Master... naturally had to pay a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>He had Li Qingshan convey the message.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, Horse Face, and Monkey Deity responded almost instantly.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qingshan saw in the Underworld Divine Communication Mirror, neatly and uniformly, their responses.</p><p></p><p>Cat Face: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's face was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>He had a sense of participation!</p>

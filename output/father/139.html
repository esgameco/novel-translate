            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gold Light Manor City.</p><p></p><p>Fallen Flower Alley, a small workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the courtyard, tilting his face upwards, allowing the snowflakes to fall on his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The scorching blood coursed rapidly under his skin, the bursting heat instantly melting the snowflakes into water.</p><p></p><p>"My Xixia is four years old now."</p><p></p><p>Four years old... </p><p></p><p>Time flies so quickly, in the blink of an eye, the little girl who was once just a tiny infant is now a lively and energetic young girl of four.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his eyelids slightly, the corners of his lips curling up into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Watching his daughter grow up safely and gradually mature.</p><p></p><p>As an old father, he felt a sense of pride and joy.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was born on a snowy day, so whenever the snow falls, it means her birthday is drawing near.</p><p></p><p>Today is Xixia's fourth birthday.</p><p></p><p>At the age of four, it also means the fifth Dao fruit should appear.</p><p></p><p>He was not in a hurry, gently closing his eyes, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he reviewed his cultivation progress so far.</p><p></p><p>In the inner realm of his Nirvana, the eight divine foundations floated, each emitting a brilliant glow, the powerful divine nature surging and roaring like a storm.</p><p></p><p>The seven emotional divine natures had all been forged into divine foundations, seven divine foundations...</p><p></p><p>The difficulty was not small, the repulsive force between them was extremely terrible. If it were not for his "Untainted Heart" divine nature, which also forged a divine foundation and acted as a barrier to isolate them, the collisions and conflicts between the seven divine foundations would have left Li Che dizzy and unable to control.</p><p></p><p>Once the Untainted Heart divine nature was removed, the seven emotional divine natures mixed together would be like seven different colored threads tangled and impossible to unravel.</p><p></p><p>In other words, his current divine nature cultivation, according to the highest divine foundation cultivation, belongs to the divine foundation realm.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the sixth-rank "Suspended Thought Fearless Golden Emperor" divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Based on the original "Suspended Thought Flowing Sword" divine foundation he learned from the Xue family of Flying Thunder, he had now overlaid the same-attribute divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>This would also be Li Che's main divine foundation cultivation, striving to cultivate it to divine foundation perfection and reach the level of visualizing the divine image.</p><p></p><p>He could enter the Golden Divine Palace to observe the divine statue of that Emperor every half a year, which was the best opportunity to cultivate the Golden Emperor's divine image.</p><p></p><p>"My talent in the divine nature path is indeed average, although I have many divine nature crystals to assist my cultivation, the speed of my divine nature breakthrough is still a bit slow."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head slightly, sighing a little.</p><p></p><p>The "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" had enhanced his martial dao talent, making him a martial dao prodigy, unparalleled in horizontal tempering.</p><p></p><p>Now, the martial dao had indeed not let down this Dao fruit, stepping into the Furnace Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>And he had also mastered three supreme martial arts, one of which was the self-created Dragon Elephant True Essence, which could integrate the true essences of other supreme martial arts into it.</p><p></p><p>The second was the top-grade supreme art, Eight Flood Dragons Overturning the River, passed down by Li Qingshan from the Qian Yuan Divine Sect's Golden Light Division.</p><p></p><p>The third was the low-grade supreme art, Azure Thunder Body, obtained from the Shangguan Family.</p><p></p><p>At the Sect Master realm, in addition to tempering the body, one must also refine the five viscera and six bowels! Integrating the true essence into the five viscera and six bowels, making them unyielding, cultivating both externally and internally, without any flaws, one can then assault the Great Sect Master realm!</p><p></p><p>And true essence can only be born from supreme martial arts, so Sect Masters mostly cultivate one supreme martial art! Similarly, there are levels of entry, minor accomplishment, great accomplishment, master, and transformation, and if one supreme martial art is cultivated to the master level, true essence can be born, and if cultivated to the transformation level, the true essence can be transformed into a true form! The combination of martial dao true essence and divine image power is extremely terrifying! This is also the realm of the many divine image ancestors in the Gold Light Manor City.</p><p></p><p>They have immersed themselves in the martial dao for countless years, slowly grinding one supreme martial art to the transformation level.</p><p></p><p>But that's all there is to it, to break through to the Great Sect Master, one supreme martial art reaching the true form level is far from enough.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao true form is just a basic requirement to become a Great Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao path is long and arduous..." Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>He is now just at the initial Sect Master realm, just beginning to refine the five viscera and six bowels, to advance to the Great Sect Master realm, it should still take several more years...</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivation of supreme martial arts, Li Che is not worried, his talent is not bad, with gradual cultivation, he will surely reach the true form level!</p><p></p><p>And the Dragon Elephant True Essence, fusing various true forms, who knows what kind of power it will transform into?</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel some anticipation and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this supreme art that was born from the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao fruit and self-created by him, Li Che still harbored great expectations.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Flowing light appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Name: Li Che]</p><p></p><p>[Bonds: Li Nuanxi (daughter)]</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruits: Immortal Craftsman (lv3, 88%), Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (lv3, 55%), Untainted Heart (lv3, 15%), Chess Saint (lv3, 10%)]</p><p></p><p>[Nascent Divine Abilities: Immortal Craftsman·Thousand Splitting Hands, Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra·Ascending the Tower, Untainted Heart·Restraining the Divine]</p><p></p><p>[Prompt: For every year the bonded object grows up safely, a new Dao fruit can be obtained]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The familiar interface appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The peaceful and stable cultivation, the overall improvement was not small, the maturity of the "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit had already reached 88% of lv3, very close to lv4.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had set about manufacturing five "Dragon Fang Bodhi" bullets, engraving on them a spiral pattern that could accelerate the gathering of divine power.</p><p></p><p>Making the penetrating power and the explosive divine power of the bullets even stronger! But that's all, it's still very difficult to improve the maturity of Immortal Craftsman.</p><p></p><p>And the production of ordinary divine wooden sculptures can hardly improve the Immortal Craftsman standard, unless he enters the mysterious temple and captures the divine nature of the temple deity into the wooden sculpture, only then can he accelerate the improvement of Immortal Craftsman.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also plans to busy himself with the upcoming tasks for a while, and then start working on improving the "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit to lv4.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che really enjoys this kind of stable and peaceful life.</p><p></p><p>As long as he cultivates, carves, and nourishes his divine nature, it's simply too comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Tranquil and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the tree wishes to be still, but the wind does not stop, this world has never been a peaceful and stable world.</p><p></p><p>Even the Gold Light Manor City is full of surging undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>Factions fighting each other openly, the five major sects also constantly plotting against each other, the aristocratic families also competing for interests, frictions never-ending.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardianship Bureau is completely focused on the three ominous temples outside the city, which are full of potential great terrors at any time.</p><p></p><p>The City Lord's Mansion and the Temple Guardianship Bureau, as well as the Celestial Observatory, are not on the same page, seemingly eyeing the Divine Sect greedily.</p><p></p><p>Within the Divine Sect, there are also the evil people of the Corpse Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Sect is also corroding the high-level experts of the major forces in the Gold Light Manor City, like a venomous snake opening its bloody maw, wanting to swallow the entire city.</p><p></p><p>The world... has never been stable.</p><p></p><p>Only when one's own strength is strong enough, strong enough to support a stable realm...</p><p></p><p>Can one truly achieve carefree enjoyment, watching the winds and clouds, and savoring life.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes and exhaled a turbid breath.</p><p></p><p>After being so calm for so long, it was the calm before the storm.</p><p></p><p>As the Four-Armed Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple shook, the Mysterious Spire expanded, and when the powerful experts of the Qian Yuan Divine Sect arrived to open the Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple and conduct the temple deity resonance test...</p><p></p><p>The storm might no longer be able to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>When he went through the sect assessment before, Li Qingshan said that the temple deity resonance test would probably be a year after the sect assessment, so after Xixia's birthday, it should be the temple deity resonance test.</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity resonance test... Li Qingshan said that this time it's going to be big, different from before. In the past, the temple deity resonance, the Qian Yuan Divine Sect's main sect would bring the top-notch spiritual children from the four prefectures and the state capital to test together."</p><p></p><p>"But this time, in addition to the Cloud State, the ten branch sects under the jurisdiction of the Lingnan Dao's capital city, even the capital city itself will dispatch powerful experts, bringing spiritual children..."</p><p></p><p>"For the inheritance of the Four-Armed Furious Third Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple outside the Gold Light Manor is of the highest rank, even among the Four Sovereign Mysterious Temples, it belongs to the top-tier.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the shaking of the Mysterious Spire and the emergence of the Third Prince's inheritance have attracted the attention of all forces.</p><p></p><p>And the temple deity of the Third Prince's temple is a child, so the matter of temple deity resonance will naturally be highly valued by all parties.</p><p></p><p>This temple deity resonance... has attracted the attention of the entire Lingnan Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Divine Sect had already laid its roots in the Gold Light Manor City, also because of the fame of the Four-Armed Furious Third Prince's Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che was pondering and summarizing, completing the review of his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that the heavens and earth suddenly became extremely quiet!</p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump! Violent pulsations were transmitted from within his chest, the Dao fruits of "Immortal Craftsman", "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra", "Untainted Heart", and "Chess Saint", all four of them were violently palpitating!</p><p></p><p>As if welcoming a new companion!</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him shifted, the familiar scene, like a mirror emerging from the water, slowly reflecting...</p><p></p><p>Roar—</p><p></p><p>The vast and profound earth, as if ancient deities were roaring in fury, in the boundless heaven and earth, a precious tree towered up to the clouds!</p><p></p><p>Countless leaves trembled, flashing countless streams of light! A seven-colored fruit, accompanied by seven-colored radiance, hung on the treetop.</p><p></p><p>The growth scenes of Xixia this year flashed by like a panorama, reflecting the vast heaven and earth! Li Che's black hair and bright eyes gazed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Sparkling with crystalline brilliance, there was curiosity and expectation.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's birthday, the day he opens his Dao fruit blind box...</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was very much looking forward to it! A year of guardianship, finally reaped the harvest today.</p><p></p><p>Xixia is four years old, the fifth Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>It has arrived!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Your daughter is four years old, with some twists and turns, tenacious and unyielding, safe and sound, and has obtained the Dao fruit "Immortal in the Painting"]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The prompt converged into flickering golden light, dazzlingly bright.</p><p></p><p>The fifth Dao fruit! Li Che knew that if his daughter was safe and sound, his future... Dao fruits would only become more and more.</p><p></p><p>And the attributes of the Dao fruits, what they specifically would be, he could not determine, nor could he fathom.</p><p></p><p>Just like opening a blind box, very exciting.</p><p></p><p>Just like this time, seeing the name of the fifth Dao fruit, Li Che was as bewildered as when he first saw the "Chess Saint" Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Immortal in the Painting? Is this going to make him a talented scholar wielding the wolf-hair brush?</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seems to have figured out some of the different implications of the Dao fruits.</p><p></p><p>"Profession?"</p><p></p><p>"Are these Dao fruits going to let me ascend to divinity through different professions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled amusedly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's not necessarily the case, because the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit does not belong to the profession category, so it should not be generalized, there is still probability.</p><p></p><p>The interface has given him opportunities, binding him to his daughter's bonds, and for every year his daughter lives safely, he can obtain a Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>This Dao fruit is just nascent, without any maturity, he needs to slowly accumulate the maturity.</p><p></p><p>The origin of this opportunity is very profound.</p><p></p><p>Because his cultivation has grown, his contact with the world has also deepened.</p><p></p><p>He has seen the temple deities, seen the overlapping mythologies, so when his mind trembles, he can't help but wonder...</p><p></p><p>The Dao fruits he has obtained, bound to his daughter, is it because his daughter's identity is special?</p><p></p><p>My Xixia...</p><p></p><p>Could she be the reincarnation of some great being?</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, his mind violently trembling, this thought once born, he could not suppress it at all, as if a cold feeling had instantly enveloped his entire body.</p><p></p><p>He dared not think about it deeply.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Even if she is the reincarnation of a great being... so what?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao fruits are in my possession, and I, Li Che... am Xixia's father!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are some plots and schemes behind it, I only wish for my daughter to be safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze gradually calmed down, the coldness in his body also dissipated, and in his chest, it was as if a furnace was burning, radiating scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I become strong enough..."</p><p></p><p>"I will fear no evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Become stronger!</p><p></p><p>Only then can he protect his daughter, protect his wife, protect the family that belongs to him! [Immortal in the Painting (Dao Fruit): Blood as ink, divine nature condensed into spirit, immortals in the painting, painting all things to life]</p><p></p><p>His mind trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The introduction of the new Dao Fruit "Immortal in the Painting" appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Immortals in the painting, painting all things to life..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, he was still a bit bewildered about this introduction.</p><p></p><p>But he can be sure that this Dao Fruit will involve the use of blood and divine nature.</p><p></p><p>"Just try it and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit (Immortal in the Painting): lv1, 0%]</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his chest, the Dao fruit trembled.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and sensed, as if electric currents were surging, spreading from his mind, allowing him to gradually understand the meaning of this Immortal Dao fruit in the painting.</p><p></p><p>A single word - "Painting"! In the courtyard, snow was falling heavily.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes for almost ten breaths, then suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of unexpected smile appeared on the corner of his lips.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and tapped on the Nirvana Palace between his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the eight divine foundations within shook violently.</p><p></p><p>The [Fearless Golden Heavenly King Divine Foundation] rumbled and trembled, grinding like a millstone, and divine essences were extracted.</p><p></p><p>The meridians in his body roared, and the powerful Furnace Sect Master's blood and qi overflowed from his palms, merging with the divine essences, turning into dense black ink in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao fruit in the painting pulsed again, and a pure white, flawless sheet of paper appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the gentle wind blowing in the courtyard, the corners of the paper fluttered.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the paper, his eyes flickering. This paper was manifested from his pure spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was extremely small, almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>However, the blood-divine ink formed by the fusion of divine essences and blood qi still had some consumption.</p><p></p><p>But it was not too much.</p><p></p><p>"I can paint..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the paper and the divine ink in his hand, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Because, painting... he was not very good at it.</p><p></p><p>This was an art, requiring dedication and learning.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the [Immortal Artisan] Dao fruit, that was more about enhancing his craftsmanship talent.</p><p></p><p>You let him carve, do handicrafts, or even hand-craft a Desert Eagle, he could do it.</p><p></p><p>But to ask him to paint... it might not be feasible.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the frown on Li Che's brow smoothed out. "The key of the Immortal in the Painting is not the painting itself."</p><p></p><p>"The process is not important, what matters is... the result."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought of the Golden Third Prince he had fought with in the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he splashed the dense ink out.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh...</p><p></p><p>The dense ink was absorbed by the pure paper like a dragon drinking water, and gradually, the image of the Third Prince wearing a golden halo, stepping on wind and fire wheels, with golden divine silk wrapped around his arms and holding a fire-tipped spear, emerged on the pure paper.</p><p></p><p>Li Che blinked his eyes as he looked at the vivid Third Prince in the painting.</p><p></p><p>And the Third Prince in the painting also blinked his eyes at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Then, he leaped out of the painting, only this time, he was formed entirely of black ink, becoming the Ink Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>The painting has a spirit, the Immortal in the Painting! Walking out of the painting, entering reality!</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>The Ink Third Prince, stepping on ink-colored wind and fire wheels, flew around the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes flickering with different colors.</p><p></p><p>After sensing for a while, he smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Although his blood qi has not reached the Furnace level, it is at the Sect Master level, and his divine essences are at the divine foundation realm... Since I painted him with my divine essences and blood qi, he is almost on par with my cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers, and the ink-colored Third Prince immediately exploded in the air, turning into countless black ink droplets that evaporated into black mist and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che continued to experiment, this time extracting the divine essences of all seven divine foundations and fusing them with his blood qi, forming the blood-divine ink.</p><p></p><p>"Let's paint a self-portrait."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The paper floated in the air, and the colorful divine ink was splashed.</p><p></p><p>The colored ink blended, shimmering like colorful lights, the paper trembling, and then an image of Li Che with a touch of meticulous brushwork appeared on the scroll.</p><p></p><p>The Li Che in the painting smiled and took a step, immediately detaching from the paper, lifelike.</p><p></p><p>Li Che inexplicably felt a connection with the "Immortal in the Painting" version of himself.</p><p></p><p>Consuming nearly half of Li Che's blood qi as a Furnace Sect Master, along with half the divine essences of the seven divine foundations...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal in the Painting Li Che possessed about 70% of Li Che's strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a thought, commanding the Immortal in the Painting Li Che to attack him.</p><p></p><p>The two fought in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che severed his control over the Immortal in the Painting Li Che, yet the Immortal in the Painting Li Che could still fight independently, and his movements were in accordance with Li Che's own combat habits.</p><p></p><p>He even possessed techniques like the Thousand Spider Silk and the Bodhi Tear of Blood, and could use them.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che had painted them in when creating the image.</p><p></p><p>"Bang—"</p><p></p><p>Li Che snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal in the Painting Li Che instantly turned into colorful ink mist and exploded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered with a trace of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Because memories had surged into his mind, memories of his battle with himself.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The consumed blood qi and divine essences used for the painting had all returned to his own body.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"If I use the Immortal in the Painting clone for cultivation... won't the divine essences and blood qi cultivated be able to return to me as well?"</p><p></p><p>"It's like having another me cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood became excited. Originally, he was worried that his divine essence talent was too poor, and it would take him years to fully refine the seven divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Lacking in talent? Make up for it with quantity! Paint seven versions of himself, according to the seven divine essences, and cultivate slowly!</p><p></p><p>"However, according to the feedback from the [Immortal in the Painting] Dao fruit, without actively interrupting or engaging in battle to consume the divine essences and blood qi, the Immortal in the Painting clone can only exist for a maximum of three days."</p><p></p><p>"Battle will consume blood qi and divine essences, so it cannot exist for a long time. But for cultivation, replenishing and adding divine essences and blood qi, the existence time should be extended by a day..."</p><p></p><p>"But still only four days..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable, after all, this is a newly born Dao fruit. As the [Immortal in the Painting] Dao fruit matures, the existence time of the Immortal in the Painting clone will become longer, and it can contribute more to my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Immortal in the Painting clone... painting all things..."</p><p></p><p>"Let me try again."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gathered divine essences and blood qi, and painted a Martial Elixir.</p><p></p><p>He put it in his mouth and bit down with a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...</p><p></p><p>A bit sweet.</p><p></p><p>Useless.</p><p></p><p>Fake.</p><p></p><p>It only had the appearance, without any medicinal properties, unable to be self-sustaining.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind suddenly moved, and he painted a Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a brand-new Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet appeared in his hand, identical to the one he had personally created.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was...</p><p></p><p>Too perfect.</p><p></p><p>Although it consumed blood qi and divine essences, was that a flaw?</p><p></p><p>Was the small consumption of blood qi and divine essences a flaw?</p><p></p><p>The real Dragon Tooth Bodhi, even with his [Immortal Artisan] Dao fruit-enhanced craftsmanship, still required him to carve for ten days or half a month, and the slightest mistake would ruin the entire bullet.</p><p></p><p>Although the artisan's skills were exquisite, they also liked to slack off. To be able to create from nothing... why bother with meticulous carving?</p><p>The Immortal in the Painting... an armory!</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but smile widely.</p><p></p><p>This Dao fruit is amazing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind suddenly moved again...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Four Divine Weapons [Purple Flame Snake Spear] hidden in Xixie's arm...</p><p></p><p>His blood qi surged, and divine essences gushed out! Grind the ink! Bring the paper!</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately painted one out.</p><p></p><p>But then, there was no "but then".</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear he painted had only the appearance, without any aura of rank or power.</p><p></p><p>Just like the elixir.</p><p></p><p>It needs to have the external form and the internal essence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was like a child who had just received a new toy, playing with it joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Painting this, painting that...</p><p></p><p>He even painted his wife Zhang Ya, and when she leaped out of the paper, Li Che's eyes lit up, thinking of new bone-refining and vein-opening techniques.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sky, the clouds were rolling, and the snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Winter had arrived, and the sky was darkening quickly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not continue to study the [Immortal in the Painting] Dao fruit, mainly because his divine essences were almost depleted.</p><p></p><p>Painting consumes divine essences, and while his blood qi recovery as a Furnace Sect Master was fast, his divine essences were not.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving the workshop courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Li Che painted seven Immortal in the Painting clones, each using a different color of ink corresponding to the seven divine essences, and each Li Che clone had a different emotion on their face.</p><p></p><p>Angry Crying, Extreme Fear, Pensive Thought, Furious Anger, Joyful Madness, Startled Fierceness, Worried Spirit...</p><p></p><p>Seven divine essences, seven divine foundations.</p><p></p><p>He had them sit and cultivate diligently in the room, and he also thoughtfully gave each clone a Nine Radiance Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Nine Radiance Divine Essence Crystals he had obtained from Shangguan Zhenghe were completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He still had a lot of Ten Radiance Divine Essence Crystals left, but after experiencing the rapid effects of the Nine Radiance, the efficiency of the Ten Radiance Crystals made him a bit disdainful.</p><p></p><p>He patted his hands.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the seven Immortal in the Painting clones sitting neatly and diligently cultivating in the room, Li Che was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although his divine essence talent was indeed weak, he had many "selves" now! And in battle, when his divine essences were almost depleted, he could just detonate a clone with a thought to quickly replenish his divine essences...</p><p></p><p>Although there were basically no battles that could deplete Li Che's divine essences, it was still a trump card.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, he locked the door and left the workshop courtyard, heading towards the Fly Restaurant he often frequented, located in the depths of Falling Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog at the entrance lazily glanced at Li Che, yawned, and continued sleeping by the fire.</p><p></p><p>Li Che ordered the birthday meal he had specially prepared for Xixie, the chef's craftsmanship was excellent, and Xixie loved it, especially the sweet and sour pork ribs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che collected the prepared birthday meal into his Spatial Storage, then bowed and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog grunted, watching Li Che depart.</p><p></p><p>The snow-covered mountains, the willow branches dripping with icy pearls.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked out of the alley, his ink-black robe fluttering in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes fell on his shoulders, but were instantly evaporated by the invisible blood qi.</p><p></p><p>The streets were white with snow, and the long street was desolate.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not directly return to the Thunderclap Peak of the Divine Sect, but instead came to a courtyard in an alley.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Under the faintly glowing snow, a solitary lamp burned quietly.</p><p></p><p>Today was Xixie's fourth birthday, and of course, Old Chen could not be absent.</p><p></p><p>This courtyard was where Old Chen had moved to after leaving the Listening Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xixie was supposed to see Old Chen once every six months, but it seemed that Old Chen had sensed some problems with himself.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, six months ago, Old Chen had refused Li Che's request to take him to see Xixie.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Che had planned to help Old Chen resolve the corpse curse imprint and the corpse qi within him.</p><p></p><p>However, after discovering the corpse qi, Old Chen seemed to have his own plans, so Li Che had stopped his actions.</p><p></p><p>And now, Li Che had also figured out Old Chen's purpose.</p><p></p><p>In the lamplight.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sat alone under the eaves, sipping hot wine.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the wine cup, facing the direction of the Divine Sect's Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>His face occasionally showed a smile, as if reminiscing the times when he bickered with little Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Sighing deeply, Old Chen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xixie, you're four years old today, ah."</p><p></p><p>"This old Chen wishes you a happy birthday one last time."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen raised his wine cup.</p><p></p><p>"Cheers, you do as you please."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled and drained the warm wine in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"Drinking alone, not inviting me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled as he appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was startled.</p><p></p><p>Then his expression changed slightly: "Ah Che? Don't come over! I'm infected with the corpse qi from the Corpse Divine Sect..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che had appeared in front of him in the blink of an eye, his palm gently tapping Old Chen's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The powerful blood qi of the Furnace Sect Master erupted, completely evaporating the corpse qi within Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>"See, the corpse qi is gone now," Li Che said gently. "Come on, it's Xixie's birthday, how can we not have you, Old Chen?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the corpse qi that had filled his body disappear without a trace, Old Chen was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Then he was shocked to the core.</p><p></p><p>"You... you've become a Sect Master?!"</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly votes and recommend votes, reading is very important, everyone should not let the book go, Old Li is working hard to update, thank you!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

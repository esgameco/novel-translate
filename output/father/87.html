        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The buffalo mask reflected the flickering flames, and the wooden statue of the temple deity gripped his arm, its vertical eyes rolling and gurgling, as if a scorching, fiery atmosphere was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>In the air, there seemed to be a silent roar, like waves crashing one after another.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity glared, all three of its eyes filled with rage.</p><p></p><p>As if it was roaring at the greedy and insatiable Ox Demon in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Enough is enough! Take it and leave!</p><p></p><p>Don't try to push your luck further! But Li Che was completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>The eyes beneath the mask's twin holes burned with a smoldering glow, as if observing a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Shen Ji Fa (Supreme Eighth Extreme): Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Shen Ji】</p><p></p><p>【Origin: Branch of the Wrathful Divinity, the collective fury of the masses, absorbing with the three-eyed divine gaze, embodying the divine will in a carved wooden statue, blessed by the True Lord, evolving into this technique】</p><p></p><p>【Advancement: If one obtains the Three-Eyed Compassionate True Lord and the Three-Eyed Awe-Inspiring True Lord, they can forge the Supreme Seventh Element Three-Eyed Three-Spirit True Lord Shen Ji】</p><p></p><p>【Requirement: Wrathful Divinity, cultivate to the River Peak realm】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The flowing text prompt in front of him gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>A surge of profound information flooded his mind, and Li Che's eyes narrowed, filled with a touch of delight.</p><p></p><p>Breaking free from the wooden statue's grip, Li Che instantly leapt off the altar, landing on the ground, calming his emotions and silently absorbing the influx of information.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Shen Ji Fa?!"</p><p></p><p>"And it's the Supreme Eighth Extreme Shen Ji Fa, while the Startling Spiritual Base Technique I obtained from Elder Yang's family was only the Inferior Ninth Brilliance..."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Eighth Extreme Shen Ji Fa..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was somewhat delighted and quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qingshan said that in the Mysterious Temple, one can obtain the temple deity's gifts, and many divine techniques and Shen Ji Fa are obtained from the Mysterious Temple. Therefore, many untamed and unexplored Mysterious Temples are sought after by cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"So, this is what they call the temple deity's gift?"</p><p></p><p>Although it was more like the temple deity's impatience to get rid of him, Li Che was still very happy.</p><p></p><p>"This temple deity's Shen Ji Fa seems... to have an advancement path!"</p><p></p><p>"By obtaining the Three-Eyed Compassionate True Lord and the Three-Eyed Awe-Inspiring True Lord's Shen Ji Fa, one can forge the Supreme Seventh Element Three-Eyed Three-Spirit True Lord Shen Ji!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered, his emotions slightly fluctuating, his eyes growing increasingly bright.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I'm not the only one who wants to forge the Seven Emotion Shen Ji, although it's a joint forging, the thought process is actually quite similar."</p><p></p><p>"Forging three divine Shen Ji into one, while I plan to forge seven Shen Ji."</p><p></p><p>More or less the same.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation path and thought process are essentially the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt inexplicably happy, as the path ahead became clearer, and he had something to look forward to.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, Elder Qingshan said that this Mysterious Temple is a branch of the Four Guardian Mysterious Temple. Does that mean... in the future, the Shen Ji can also be further enhanced and modified through that Four Guardian Mysterious Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"This Ten Capital Mysterious Temple can refine an Supreme Eighth Extreme Shen Ji Fa... Does that mean the Four Guardian Mysterious Temple can refine Shen Ji Fa at the Three Purities level?"</p><p></p><p>The Shen Ji Fa was completely absorbed into his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had stayed in the Mysterious Temple for a bit longer today.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's ears twitched slightly, as his enhanced martial arts had strengthened his five senses and six perceptions.</p><p></p><p>He heard a hurried yet extremely faint sound coming from outside the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Someone is coming!</p><p></p><p>Li Che left behind a Thunder Talisman anchor and then clenched his five fingers, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The door of the Mysterious Temple was opened.</p><p></p><p>A white-robed figure, wearing a faceless mask, rushed in quickly, the mask reflecting the countless distorted flames.</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity's divine aura has fluctuated... Was there someone just now in the temple?"</p><p></p><p>"Who was it?!" </p><p></p><p>He hadn't even opened the temple door yet... and appeared inside the Mysterious Temple? What kind of strange thing is this!</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure, with his hair flying, had eyes filled with grave seriousness beneath the mask.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling winter thunder, snaking electric light.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the white-robed figure's neck stiffened, slowly raising his head.</p><p></p><p>The movement changed!</p><p></p><p>The wooden statue of the temple deity... was different from before! Looking at the altar, the wooden statue seemed to be trying to grab something...</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure only felt his divine aura obstructed, clearly sensing the temple deity's unstoppable fury, surging like a tidal wave crashing against him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but let out a muffled groan, as if sinister black markings were slowly emerging and crawling on his body.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure's body trembled, and then...</p><p></p><p>His knees bent...</p><p></p><p>Slowly kneeling down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to his independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>His tall figure stood still, putting away his mask and shedding his clothes.</p><p></p><p>"What a pleasant surprise, I didn't expect to obtain a Shen Ji Fa in the Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Eighth Extreme."</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head, looking at the gradually darkening sky, as night was about to fall.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun, reflecting on the black tiles of the roof, burned a fiery red.</p><p></p><p>"Now that my 'Wrathful Amitabha' has reached the River Peak realm, I'm just one step away from the Shen Ji... It's just the right time to attempt it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che contemplated, but forging a Shen Ji was clearly not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Forging a Shen Ji will inevitably trigger violent divine aura fluctuations in heaven and earth, unable to be hidden, and will expose me..."</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, if it's disrupted midway, it may even result in backlash, completely different from the martial arts breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the chair, playing with a carved wooden statue, but his mind was considering the preparations needed for forging the Shen Ji.</p><p></p><p>"First, I can't do it in the city, I need to find a tranquil place outside. Secondly, I need to set up traps and hidden mechanisms, and... my vital energy and martial arts cultivation must be strong enough. In the next few days, I'll consume the remaining Python Blood Martial Elixir to refine and transform it into vital energy cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I have the 'Dragon Elephant Golden Armor' Dao Fruit, my physical body is formidable, even without Profound Vein cultivation, my physical strength is no weaker than Profound Vein, perhaps even stronger. Forging the Shen Ji should be without any issues."</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Li Che immersed himself in the workshop again, taking out the "Bloody Bodhi Tear" mechanism he obtained from Elder Yang's family.</p><p></p><p>This thing has tremendous power, and even Shen Ji cultivators would face great threat from it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it's difficult to make, and Li Che only has one, which he has already used. He'll need to prepare more.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the "Bloody Bodhi" spiritual wood Elder Yang collected is large enough, and Li Che estimates he should be able to make three "Bloody Bodhi Tears".</p><p></p><p>After working for a while, Li Che stopped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sky had completely darkened, he didn't stay in the workshop any longer.</p><p></p><p>He left the workshop and went to the Golden Brilliance Pavilion, as Li Qingshan had intervened, the City Lord's Mansion had completely withdrawn, no longer having any intentions towards Li Che and Xie Xie.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with the downfall of the Yang family and the decline of the Si family, the Sha family's entire clan moving away, the powerful families in Feilei City were now only the Xu family. Unexpectedly, the order in Feilei City had become unusually good.</p><p></p><p>After ordering a table of good wine and delicacies, Li Che returned to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, Xie Xie was sitting on a bamboo chair under the eaves with Old Chen, eating fruits.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen doted on Xie Xie, often buying her many delicious things, and in the winter when fruits were expensive, Old Chen still spent money to buy them for Xie Xie.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che return, Xie Xie excitedly jumped off the chair and ran towards Li Che, throwing herself into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Father, are we going to move? Can we take Old Chen with us?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xie's eyelashes fluttered, her large eyes filled with reluctance.</p><p></p><p>The seated Old Chen was momentarily stunned, his eyes becoming much gentler, grabbing a gourd, pulling out the stopper, and taking a gulp of wine: "This girl..."</p><p></p><p>"You two are going to the capital city to cultivate, what would Old Chen go for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said, "Old Chen, don't be modest, come with us. Xie Xie has been taught martial arts by you since she was young, and when you go to the capital, you'll get to see Xie Xie overwhelm the young talents of other cities and forcefully enter the Divine Sect, won't you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Chen was suddenly at a loss for words: "This girl, she may look cute and sweet, but her strength surpasses the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"At the age of three, no one in the city can match this little brat!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen burst out laughing, as if he could already see the scene of Xie Xie dominating the young talents of other cities in the capital.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xie had one hand around Li Che's neck, scrunching up her little nose in displeasure: "Old Chen, I'm Xie Xie, Li Nuanxie, not little brat!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, okay, okay, little brat Xie Xie."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen laughed in response.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xie was annoyed and pouted, not saying anything.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, get ready. In a few days, I'll go with you to resign from your woodcarving master position at the Xu family..." Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen still had some hesitation: "Doesn't an Enlightened Child only take their own family members? Will I be appropriate to go?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, your spot won't be taken away." Li Che pursed his lips and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Chen no longer resisted.</p><p></p><p>In a few days, after the Enlightened Child selection at the Golden Brilliance Pavilion is over, Li Che plans to also talk to his uncle and the others, so they can all move to the capital city together.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feilei City... is no longer safe.</p><p></p><p>The night fell.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan returned with a glowing face, walking with a sense of vigor.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi, who was in the midst of fighting with Xixia over a scooter, looked up puzzledly at his master, who seemed to have been rejuvenated, and at his young age, he had already discerned many of the adults' secrets.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi rolled his eyes and continued to fight with Xixia over the scooter.</p><p></p><p>"Don't play anymore, big brother Lü Chi, you play." </p><p></p><p>Xixia was quite generous, handing the scooter to Lü Chi, then went to sit under the eaves, her chubby little hands propping up her chin, looking a bit melancholy.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Li Che, who was teaching Zhang Ya martial arts, suddenly swept his gaze over.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi shuddered all over, hastily jumping up from the scooter, feeling as if the scooter was burning his butt, and Li Che's gaze was like a thousand knives cutting him.</p><p></p><p>He felt like crying, but he hadn't even provoked Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked over to Xixia: "Is Xixia unhappy?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia pouted her little mouth: "Xixia misses Niunie Master, Niunie Master hasn't come to see Xixia for several days, I miss him."</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused.</p><p></p><p>That Niu Mo doesn't seem to be a good person, how can this girl think of him so much?</p><p></p><p>However, since his daughter has a wish, Li Che naturally will fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, maybe your Niunie Master knows you're moving and is preparing a gift for you?" Li Che pinched Xixia's chubby little cheek.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Lü Chi, however, was secretly rolling his eyes in the direction where Li Che couldn't see his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The adults' secrets, Lü Chi had already cleverly seen through.</p><p></p><p>An old man, deceiving his mother-in-law, getting a spring romance in his old age.</p><p>A father, coaxing his daughter, pretending to be a master.</p><p>In the adult world, everything is fake.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered, winter thunder flashed among them, sparkling with lightning.</p><p></p><p>After helping his wife Zhang Ya delve deeply into bone divination last night, Li Che felt refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, dressed in a blue robe, was sitting on a wooden chair, flipping through a book. A hot stove was burning beside him, boiling water for tea, the steam swirling.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi was sitting cross-legged below, cultivating his spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>The book Li Qingshan was reading was the "Compendium of the Mechanisms of the Tang Clan", which he had obtained from Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>The old man knitted his brows as he looked at the book, and said to Li Che: "Mechanisms... was it with the mechanisms inside that you killed the Yang family's divine foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"The Tang clan's mechanisms are indeed formidable, but also complex. This book is only a fragment, and the mechanisms recorded in it... are mostly vague. Yet you were actually able to manufacture them? Your craftsmanship is truly impressive..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and smiled, with a touch of strangeness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The way of mechanisms... requires talent.</p><p></p><p>It's not something that can be done with just a bit of skill.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the glorious Tangshi clan, how magnificent they were. But ever since the divine fetus that guarded their clan fell, there have been few geniuses of mechanisms born, and the Tangshi clan has gradually fallen into obscurity.</p><p></p><p>Because many of the Tangshi mechanisms, even with diagrams, cannot be manufactured without the right talent.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent in the way of mechanisms should not be wasted. When you enter the Divine Sect, I will introduce you to a person who should be able to teach you a lot about the way of mechanisms."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not refuse, as he was quite interested in the way of mechanisms, and if he could learn more mechanisms, it would greatly help the maturation of the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Li Qingshan for a while, Li Che went to call Old Chen, planning to go to the Xu family to resign from his woodcarving apprenticeship.</p><p></p><p>"Going to the Xu family? I'll come along, it's on the way."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan lazily got up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback, on the way? On what way?</p><p></p><p>But he didn't say much, as Li Qingshan's openly acknowledged identity in Feilei City was basically the top guest.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three of them arrived at the Xu family's inner city woodcarving workshop, and Li Qingshan casually wandered off on his own.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen made their intention clear, and in a moment, Xu Huili, dressed in a white robe, and Xu Beihu hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, are you resigning from your woodcarving apprenticeship at Xu's?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it because your daughter's identity as a spirit child has been recognized by Senior Qingshan, and you are about to go to the capital city?" Xu Huili smiled as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>His expression was very complex, unable to imagine a muddy-footed person rising to such a position, and it had only taken about three years.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Li Che was the Niu Mo, Xu Huili could not be certain.</p><p></p><p>Because when Cao Qingyuan and Zhang Xiangyang went to Li Che's courtyard, they were also watching from afar.</p><p></p><p>The Niu Mo fought with the Yang family's divine foundation, but Li Che appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>So they excluded the guess that Li Che was the Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>And even if Li Che was or was not the Niu Mo... it no longer mattered.</p><p></p><p>With a Divine Sect strongman backing Li Che and his daughter, no one in Feilei City dared to touch them.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was confirmed that Li Che was the Niu Mo, what could they do about it? The fact that the Niu Mo had killed the Yang family's divine foundation had already shaken the entire Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Huili heard this news, he was completely dumbfounded. He never imagined that when the Yang family's divine foundation struck, the Niu Mo could still counterattack and kill him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili immediately felt that it was impossible for the Niu Mo to be Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che had only cultivated for three years, how could he have reached the level of killing a divine foundation? "Manager, the matter of just keeping the name is fine... we are not in Feilei City, but still taking the salary from the Xu family, it just doesn't feel quite right."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head and refused Xu Huili's offer.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao naturally also refused along with him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili was not surprised, as he had obviously expected Li Che's attitude. </p><p></p><p>Originally, the Xu family's attitude towards Li Che after he became a master woodcarver was not enthusiastic, and Li Che had only worked at the Xu family for three years, with one of those years as a porter, so there was not much emotional attachment, which was normal.</p><p></p><p>After symbolically persuading them for a while, Xu Huili agreed to Li Che and Chen Dabao's resignation.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, has the Third Young Master not returned yet?"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Che asked Xu Huili.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili squinted his eyes: "The Third Brother went out of the city to lead a team to eliminate evil spirits, he may have gone quite far, it's usually half a year before he comes back, which is normal."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded upon hearing this, and did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>The two of them left the woodcarving workshop.</p><p></p><p>The winter rain was drizzling on the oiled paper umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's whole body felt relaxed and unrestrained, more so than ever before, but since he was already semi-retired, he didn't have much attachment to the Xu family woodcarving workshop anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Ache, let's go, I'll treat you to some wine."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xu family mansion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili informed the family head Xu Nanming about Li Che and Chen Dabao resigning from their positions as Xu family woodcarving masters.</p><p></p><p>"Normal, Li Che plans to accompany his spirit child daughter to the capital city, and as for Chen Dabao... these past few years, his mind has not really been on the woodcarving work, so resigning is fine. But he thinks that by tagging along with Li Wannuo the high-quality spirit child, he can enter the Divine Sect in the capital city? That's a bit presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming was handling the many documents in his hands, the Shi family, the Yang family, and the An family, some were toppled, some were wiped out, some were relocated... the Xu family had suddenly become the largest aristocratic clan in Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Too many businesses were suddenly taken over, and Xu Nanming had been busy as a bee during this period.</p><p></p><p>He had failed to break through to the divine foundation, and had long since given up the idea of breaking through, so he had focused all his attention on the expansion of the family's businesses.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was as if his wishes had been fulfilled, and Xu Nanming was in an extremely good mood, after all... the Xu family had grown to its strongest in two hundred years under his hand, how could he not be elated?</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a windfall, it was still the achievement of Xu Nanming.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Xu You? Still hunting evil spirits outside the city? Send him a message and have him come back... The City Lord's Mansion has sent a message, as soon as the Divine Sect's Acceptance Envoy leaves, the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet will be held immediately, so summon Xu You back..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili was taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Why summon the Third Brother back?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili knitted his brows.</p><p></p><p>The Shi family, the Yang family, and the An family had all withdrawn, and the Xu family's three young masters were now only him. Once the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet was held, he would undoubtedly be the biggest beneficiary.</p><p></p><p>He might even have the opportunity to assault the divine foundation, and at this time, summoning Xu You back to share the benefits, he was not too willing.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Nanming only looked at him with a deep gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think your chances of forging a divine foundation are that high?"</p><p></p><p>"The Old Patriarch has high hopes for you... If our Xu family can produce another divine foundation, then after the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet, when we go to other cities, we can continue our two-hundred-year legacy."</p><p></p><p>"So, your assault on the divine foundation is only allowed to succeed, not to fail."</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili said, "I understand, so I will work hard..."</p><p></p><p>"Work hard? Ridiculous... Your qi and blood cultivation is only just barely at the qi channel level, your failure rate in forging a divine foundation is extremely high..."</p><p></p><p>"Take advantage of the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet, with the help of the temple gods' divine nature, let Xu You and Beihu become your assistants... Only then can you succeed, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Old Patriarch's intention."</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili was stunned, suddenly feeling his whole body's hairs standing on end.</p><p></p><p>Xu Huili swallowed hard, unable to help but feel a bit dry-mouthed.</p><p></p><p>"How... how to assist?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming paused his hand movements, and the next moment, he raised his head from the many documents.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a ferocious smile full of white teeth.</p>

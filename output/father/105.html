        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down the elder uncle who was trying to get up, letting him continue drinking.</p><p></p><p>The elder uncle was swaying back and forth, but he didn't refuse, and sat back down in the chair, continuing to drink with Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked to the courtyard gate, his expression slightly cold, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Creak.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, revealing two figures in official uniforms.</p><p></p><p>The uniforms were black and red in color, embroidered with red cloud patterns, made of a special material, straight and upright, with a golden "Zhen" character embroidered on the chest.</p><p></p><p>The official uniforms of the Temple Guardians!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed as he recognized the two visitors, who were Temple Guardian officials, as this uniform was too conspicuous and well-known in the city of Jingguan.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Li Che?"</p><p></p><p>After opening the door, the gazes of the two Temple Guardian officials fell upon him.</p><p></p><p>The two powerful spiritual pressures seemed to linger, forming an aura of unspoken might, making one's heart tremble when their gaze fell upon you. This was a unique spiritual technique possessed by the Temple Guardian officials.</p><p></p><p>Although the pressure exerted by the two had no effect on Li Che, it was like a gentle breeze to him.</p><p></p><p>Still, Li Che took a deep breath, his expression changing slightly as he cupped his hands in greeting: "Greetings, Sirs."</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardians, as the military force of the Great Scenery Dynasty, could be understood as the Six Gates, and although they mainly dealt with the affairs of the mysterious temples, they would intervene in any matter related to the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the Temple Guardian officials at his home made Li Che's eyes narrow.</p><p></p><p>Was the speed this fast?</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be, when he killed Qin Yuqing, he didn't leave any clues, and even had Qin Yuqing's gray-faced spy provide an alibi for him.</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't have been exposed this quickly.</p><p></p><p>The leading official narrowed his eyes, raising a Temple Guardian official token, looking at Li Che with an indifferent gaze: "Come with us, the Chief Official wants to ask you some questions."</p><p></p><p>"The Chief Official?" Li Che's heart sank slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Observation Bureau, the Chief Official... was equivalent to a level below the Supervisor.</p><p></p><p>Why would such a figure have business to inquire about him for no reason?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they suspected Qin Yuqing's death was related to him?</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow, glanced at the courtyard, and then followed the two officials into the dark alley.</p><p></p><p>He took out two gold leaves and handed them to the officials.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask which Chief Official wishes to interrogate me?"</p><p></p><p>However, the two officials had a faint smile: "Bribing us Temple Guardian officials is a serious crime. If we take your bribe and it's discovered, we'll be whipped."</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood immediately.</p><p></p><p>They wanted more money.</p><p></p><p>He then took out ten more gold leaves and handed them over.</p><p></p><p>This time, the officials did not refuse, directly pocketing the money, clearly the previous amount was not enough.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry too much. Chief Official Zhang Lianhao just asked us to bring you over. He has some questions he wants to ask you about Qin Yuqing, the Third Miss of the Qin family, who was tragically killed in her own home."</p><p></p><p>"In our investigation, this Third Miss of the Qin family had secretly abducted many cultivators from Feilei City before her death."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we need to question all cultivators from Feilei City, and as for why the Chief Official specifically summoned you, we don't know."</p><p></p><p>The two officials openly divided the twelve gold leaves in front of Li Che, smiling as they spoke to him.</p><p></p><p>They were quite satisfied with Li Che's cooperative attitude.</p><p></p><p>Coming out on a late night like this, they were already in a bad mood, but now that they had collected some gold leaves, earning some travel money with just a few steps, it wasn't bad at all.</p><p></p><p>"Although you have the cultivation of blood transformation, I'm sure you have nothing to do with the death of that Third Miss of the Qin family. Rumor has it that she was a true qi master and a cultivator with a complete spiritual foundation..."</p><p></p><p>The officials said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che felt a bit relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the courtyard seems quite lively, having a family banquet? Should you go tell your family members? So the banquet won't be anxious," the official looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his hands: "I just passed the third-rank guest scholar examination at the Heavenly Observation Bureau today."</p><p></p><p>"The family members insisted on holding a banquet to celebrate this good news. I initially refused, but the family members said it was a great occasion, so they held a banquet. Since you two officials have come late at night, why don't you join us for a drink before you leave?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che's words fell, the two officials' expressions changed slightly, and the spiritual pressure permeating the air paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Third-rank guest scholar of the Heavenly Observation Bureau?"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, their eyes revealing a surprised look.</p><p></p><p>Then, they took out the gold leaves they had just divided and returned the full twelve to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are a colleague from the Heavenly Observation Bureau, although you are an external guest scholar, you are also a public official. We did not know, and are not guilty. Li Guest Scholar, please do not take it to heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Che waved his hand, pushing the gold leaves back.</p><p></p><p>To firmly establish a foothold in the city, he naturally had to maintain good interpersonal relationships.</p><p></p><p>"How can I take it back? After all, you two officials have come all the way here late at night. Consider it as a reward for your trouble." Li Che smiled and invited the two Temple Guardian officials into the courtyard for a drink.</p><p></p><p>The two also gave face and did not continue to be overbearing.</p><p></p><p>After drinking, Li Che briefly told Zhang Yajia, then they all left together.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Jingguan City, the Temple Guardians.</p><p></p><p>As the largest military force in Jingguan City, it was filled with powerful cultivators, as the Temple Guardians had to be constantly vigilant against the outbreaks of the mysterious temples. If the spiritual energy from the temples outside the city infected and created evil spirits, the Temple Guardians would need to dispatch people to exterminate and suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Scenery Dynasty had given a lot of power to the various families in the cities, the deterrence of the Temple Guardians was still terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Guardians' headquarters was different from the Heavenly Observation Bureau's treasure tower. </p><p></p><p>The main gate had three openings, each with two black door panels. On the left and right sides of the gate were huge stone carvings of dragon-like creatures, vivid and lifelike, containing powerful spiritual energy that made one's soul tremble under their fierce glares.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were multiple pavilions and towers, with flying eaves and upturned corners, but they were not as towering as the eight-story treasure tower of the Heavenly Observation Bureau, mostly two to three-story pavilions, exuding a sense of solemnity and coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, please." </p><p></p><p>The two officials' attitude had become much more amiable towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Temple Guardians, the dense spiritual energy was almost palpable, naturally forming a sense of oppression. If ordinary martial artists who had not cultivated spiritual energy came here, they might not even be able to circulate their qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression looked unpleasant as he slowly followed the two officials.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, they arrived in front of a two-story pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Chief Official is waiting for you inside."</p><p></p><p>After opening the door, Li Che thanked the two officials and stepped into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Chief Official of the Temple Guardians, in terms of status, was equivalent to the level of a Supervisor at the Heavenly Observation Bureau, but the power in their hands was far greater. After all, under a Chief Official, there were ten spirit foundation realm officials, and under each of those officials, there were dozens of officials.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful Chief Officials even had over a hundred officials under their command.</p><p></p><p>How could the lone Supervisor of the Heavenly Observation Bureau compare to that?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the two were independent departments with different functions, so they could not be directly compared.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che stepped into the pavilion, the officials silently closed the door behind him.</p><p></p><p>A fragrant aroma of tea permeated the air. Li Che looked around and saw a rosewood desk, and next to it a small tea table with a boiling kettle, the green tea leaves swirling in the hot water.</p><p></p><p>A figure in a red-patterned tiger-striped official robe was sitting upright at the desk, carefully preparing the tea.</p><p></p><p>The dense spiritual energy almost seemed to have a tangible presence, permeating the air and making it difficult to breathe.</p><p></p><p>The flickering candles around the room provided ample illumination.</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Che, greetings to the Chief Official."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man lifted his head, a fierce scar across his face.</p><p></p><p>He held the teacup, took a sip of tea, then slightly raised his eyes, his gaze falling on Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Instantly, the spiritual energy in the entire pavilion, as if under the terrifying control of the spiritual awareness, was gathered and concentrated above Li Che's head.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>The two cold, emotionless words came from Chief Official Zhang Lianhao's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Under the spiritual pressure, Li Che began to act, his face extremely pale, his legs trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Chief Official, are you referring to... the notorious Ox Demon from Feilei City?"</p><p></p><p>"I may have come from Feilei City, but I have my family with me. How could I be that wicked Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che gritted his teeth, as if struggling greatly to withstand the spiritual pressure, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Silence reigned, the only sound being the bubbling of the boiling water in the kettle.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao quietly watched Li Che for a long time, then slowly said, "Someone said you are the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, his eyes almost bulging: "Slanderous lies."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon is said to have killed the old master of the Yang family in Feilei City, who was a spirit foundation cultivator. Are you saying I can kill a spirit foundation cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you really think I can kill a spirit foundation cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual awareness scanned Li Che's body repeatedly, but Li Che's qi and blood were concealed by the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" technique, and his spiritual energy was suppressed by the "Untainted Heart" Dao fruit, so it could not be detected.</p><p></p><p>After the spiritual scan failed to yield any results, the pressure finally dissipated, and the spiritual energy in the pavilion seemed to become refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a blood transformation martial artist, cultivating like a tranquil stream... You cannot kill a spirit foundation cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao withdrew his spiritual awareness, no longer suppressing and interrogating.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on becoming a third-rank guest scholar of the Heavenly Observation Bureau."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was drenched in sweat, cupping his hands, but did not say much.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Chief Official, I am new to Jingguan City. Who is it that has slandered me as the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao poured a cup of tea and pushed it towards Li Che: "Drink the tea, don't be angry.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The process of the Zhen Temple Office handling cases is as follows - first, intimidation, then solving the case.</p><p></p><p>"As for saying that you are the Ox Demon, you might know him - his name is Zhang Xiangyang, the former divine hunter of Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>"He has joined the Lingying Sect, and is now detained in the Zhen Temple Office's prison. He revealed that you are the Ox Demon, and also said that the death of Qin Yuqing of the Qin family was caused by the Ox Demon, wanting to curry favor by taking the blame."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed. The Zhang Xiangyang who had escaped before actually appeared in the imperial capital, and was now locked up in the prison. </p><p></p><p>That was the top security area of the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but reflect on his own methods, thinking that he should have found an opportunity to eliminate Zhang Xiangyang earlier, then there wouldn't have been this kind of interruption today.</p><p></p><p>"So it was the divine hunter Zhang..." Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"The words of the evil Lingying Sect are not to be trusted!" Li Che gritted his teeth: "The Lingying Sect has committed countless atrocities in Feilei City, and even the city lord Cao Guang has joined the Lingying Sect, sacrificing a thousand spirit children... they are completely inhumane!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao's gaze was calm, as if he was used to it, and he nodded: "Yes, they are very inhumane."</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it, but I still called you here to ask, do you know Xu Beihu? He was a Feilei City resident, killed by Qin Yuqing's torture, and she also had her sights set on the An family who moved to the imperial capital, preparing to strike, but then she died."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao took a sip of tea and squinted as the steam came out.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go now, be careful. The Lingying Sect's Lingying Dharma Master has escaped, and I heard that your daughter... seems to have taken the Lingying wooden sculpture? Once the ritual is complete, there will be a connection, and that Lingying Dharma Master may still come to covet your exceptional spirit child daughter."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Che's face changed drastically, his eyes bulging.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Dharma Master? The Lingying Sect... is so vicious, my whole family has moved into the imperial capital, yet they still won't let us go?!"</p><p></p><p>"The security in the imperial capital will not be a problem, but I'm afraid he might sneak out at night and attack your family."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao glanced at the trembling and fearful Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"I've asked everything I needed to, you can go back now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, angry and trembling, thought about seeking Zhang Lianhao's protection.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao smiled and without even looking, just waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no choice but to leave the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the Zhen Temple Office compound.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's anxious and angry expression immediately returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>There was another person in that pavilion just now, and he was filled with murderous intent towards him.</p><p></p><p>The chessboard of heaven and earth was constantly shrouding, and Li Che clearly sensed that person's aura, as dark as if it would drip water...</p><p></p><p>"Is it someone from the Qin family?"</p><p></p><p>That aura was somewhat familiar, the same as when he shot the gray-faced spy at the entrance of the Qin mansion before.</p><p></p><p>As for the official Zhang Lianhao, he didn't seem to have any murderous intent towards him, he should be acting on someone else's behalf, but his words were full of deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiangyang... the Lingying Dharma Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this official Zhang trying to fish?"</p><p></p><p>"Fish? The Ox Demon hasn't had fish bait in a long time..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao poured another cup of tea, and after a moment, a figure emerged from the shadows - it was Qin Haonan, the brother of Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>"What? Do you think it was him who killed your sister?"</p><p></p><p>"This little change-blood martial artist, his spiritual nature is as weak as a stream... do you think he could have killed her?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao asked.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan stroked his beard: "It seems not, but that Zhang Xiangyang from Feilei City said that this Li Che is somehow related to the Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this man has entered the Qin Tian Monitoring Office... becoming a third-rank guest official, otherwise, I wouldn't have hesitated, I would have just directly taken action and killed him." Qin Haonan sighed regretfully: "If he is the Ox Demon, he won't surrender meekly, he will reveal his trump card and resist."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan spoke directly, without any embarrassment in front of Zhang Lianhao about committing murder.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he got the recommendation of Li Qingshan, if you really kill him, won't you be afraid that Li Qingshan will return and directly smash your head with that ram's horn hammer?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Li Qingshan is probably just currying favor with that exceptional spirit child daughter of his, his recommendation is likely just a personal favor..." </p><p></p><p>"This Li Che is just a change-blood martial artist, if he dies, he dies."</p><p></p><p>"How could Li Qingshan offend my Qin family for his sake?"</p><p></p><p>"However, according to what Zhang Xiangyang said, this Ox Demon... even if it's not Li Che, is still related to Li Che's family, Li Che's daughter Li Nuanxi is also very close to the Ox Demon, Zhang Xiangyang saw with his own eyes that the two may... be teacher and disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan looked at Zhang Lianhao.</p><p></p><p>"You better think it through, that is an exceptional spirit child selected by the Qianyuan Immortal Sect's branch sect..."</p><p></p><p>"That would provoke not just Li Qingshan, but directly the Qianyuan Immortal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sipped his tea and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Send him off."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan frowned and glanced at Zhang Lianhao, without saying much, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Zhen Temple Office compound, he stood on the long street in the dark night.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Sect is indeed not easy to offend..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Qin Haonan headed towards the direction of the Jinfie Gate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Li Che returned home, the family was still awake.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Che had returned safely, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that nothing happened, it's good that nothing happened..." Uncle Li Liang had sobered up a lot, after all, Li Che was taken away by the Zhen Temple Office, and everyone knew the fearsome reputation of the Zhen Temple Office.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, his brow deeply furrowed: "It's because of the Feilei City incident, right? Ah, that damned Cao Guang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted them for a while, and then everyone left.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya put Nuanxi to sleep, then grabbed Li Che's waist: "Husband, are you really alright?"</p><p></p><p>She knew Li Che's true identity, so she was very worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, the imperial capital was much stronger than Feilei City, so the sense of security naturally plummeted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Zhang Ya's head: "I'm fine, aren't I back safe and sound? Moreover, I am now a third-rank guest official of the Qin Tian Monitoring Office, even if the Zhen Temple Office has no evidence, they don't dare to easily move against me."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pressed her cheek against Li Che's sturdy chest, listening to the vigorous heartbeat, and her heart calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>She lightly hummed.</p><p></p><p>"As the head of the family, you can't have anything happen to you... we have to watch Nuanxi grow up together."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, in two months it will be the Immortal Sect's branch sect entry examination, Nuanxi is basically a shoo-in as an Immortal Sect disciple, no one dares to touch her, and once she enters the sect, she'll be even more untouchable."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, don't worry, everything is fine with your husband."</p><p></p><p>"Let your husband check, have you been practicing the martial arts I taught you properly? Have you mastered those vein-opening techniques? Maybe I should teach you some new ones."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? New moves?"</p><p></p><p>In Zhang Ya's soft and gentle voice, the husband and wife entered into the vein-opening cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went out refreshed and energetic, heading to the Qin Tian Monitoring Office to be on duty. He put on the robe of the Qin Tian Monitoring Office guest official, but still wore the black elastic shirt underneath.</p><p></p><p>Being on duty was also simple, just following Senior Official Qinghuang in the tea room to drink tea and idle away.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to take on the task of making a spirit energy crystal wooden sculpture?"</p><p></p><p>Qinghuang was squatting on the chair, barefoot, cracking melon seeds.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Che's question, she took out the task book and started flipping through it.</p><p></p><p>"There is one, the inner disciple of the Xinhuan Temple who cultivates the Wrath God, needs a level ten 'Fierce Eyes Subdue Ghosts' type of god statue, without a reference temple god, so the wood carving master can freely create, but after the finished product, the other party needs to see if they are satisfied, and then decide whether to accept it or not."</p><p></p><p>Qinghuang said.</p><p></p><p>"And if they are not satisfied?" Li Che frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The other party can refuse to accept it, this is the task agreement, if you can't accept it, then don't take this task." Qinghuang said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded: "How much is the reward?"</p><p></p><p>"Two level ten spirit energy crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Only two?" </p><p></p><p>Qinghuang gave Li Che a strange look: "The market price is like this, and besides, you don't think two level ten spirit energy crystals is little, right? Your monthly salary is only three..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gave an embarrassed smile, his monthly salary... had already been spent.</p><p></p><p>As a moonlight clan member, Li Che naturally hoped the price would be as high as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Take it?"  Qinghuang cracked a melon seed, blinking her big eyes and asking.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it!" </p><p></p><p>"No reference temple god, free to create?" Li Che narrowed his eyes thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qinghuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had some thoughts, this was the first job he had taken, the first shot to establish his reputation.</p><p></p><p>If he wants to earn more spirit energy crystals in the future, and quickly reach level 3 maturity of the 'Untainted Heart' Dao fruit...</p><p></p><p>The reputation of this single task is extremely important! Grasp the reputation well, and high spirit energy crystal tasks will come one after another!</p><p></p><p>"A level ten spirit energy wooden sculpture, what can really set it apart is not the spirit energy content contained... so I can only put effort into the connotation."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up slightly, thinking about his previous speculation, based on his memory of the god statues, he has an extra boost in divine craftsmanship...</p><p></p><p>Now he can really experiment with this task.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Eyes Subdue Ghosts... need fierce eyes and subdue ghosts..."</p><p></p><p>"Then it should be that..."</p><p></p><p>"Leopard head, iron face, and knotted brows!"</p><p></p><p>"The great general who banishes evil and slays ghosts, the iron-faced divine lord of the Termination Mountain, the exalted one who sweeps away demonic auras..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhong Kui!"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>BOOM!!! A violent roar erupted!</p><p></p><p>The huge purple dragon god illusion that almost completely covered Xixi suddenly stiffened...</p><p></p><p>Then it quickly retreated like dissipating smoke.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, it crashed to the ground, tearing countless crevices and cracks in the large stone courtyard!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Xixi's appearance was finally revealed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Purple flames were wrapped around Xixi's arm-like lotus stems, her entire arm seemingly turned purple!</p><p></p><p>A sinuous purple python was coiled around her!</p><p></p><p>The flickering purple fire, like the forked tongue of the python, instantly heated the air! A purple flame snake pattern emerged on Xixi's brow, vivid and lifelike.</p><p></p><p>As if a small snake had been engraved into her brow!</p><p></p><p>Her eyes also ignited with purple flames, the spreading flames directly transforming and suppressing the golden flames of the Golden Prison Fire Jade Body, turning them into purple flames! Xixi's eyes opened and closed, her small leg maintaining a kicking posture forward.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying dragon god that the young prince Yihui had transformed into was just kicked away by her!</p><p></p><p>Xixi's purple eyes burned fiercely, looking disdainfully at the young prince Yihui who was less than ten meters away! As she retracted the small foot that had kicked out.</p><p></p><p>The moment it touched the ground,</p><p></p><p>it was like a huge stone thrown into a lake! Boom! Xixi's body suddenly erupted with an extremely powerful level of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Fierce winds whipped up, forming giant surging waves, spreading out in concentric circles in all directions! Without a word.</p><p></p><p>Xixi, so small, suddenly took a step forward, instantly turning into a purple lightning bolt! Fast! Extremely fast! In an instant, she appeared in front of the young prince Yihui who had just stabilized his stance.</p><p></p><p>The purple fire flickered, in a moment, the oppressive force on Xixi's body, like a mountain crushing down, heavily struck the young prince Yihei!</p><p></p><p>Then it turned into a fleshy fist clenched! The young prince Yihei was kicked away, his mind dazed, and in that dazed moment, his eyes were completely plunged into madness. At this moment, he was inexplicably stimulated, as if the fire in his bloodline was completely ignited by the purple flame in front of him! Uncontrollable...</p><p></p><p>Completely uncontrollable! Yihei completely lost his will, the purple dragon god illusion became increasingly substantial, almost obscuring Yihei's figure!</p><p></p><p>The dragon claw reached out, colliding with the fist Xixi had struck out!</p><p></p><p>The two purple colors collided! Instantly exploded, countless purple ripples spreading, scorching hot! As if there were rolling thunder, roaring dragon cries!</p><p></p><p>The rumbling explosion sound emptied the airflow above the courtyard! Boom! The "dragon claw" of the young prince Yihei instantly shattered, as if pierced by a terrible force.</p><p></p><p>But countless purple intentions spread out, re-condensing into dragon claws, striking down viciously!</p><p></p><p>Thud! The ground instantly sank, countless shattered blue stones flew in all directions, sand and stones swirling!</p><p></p><p>But Xixi's small foot just lightly touched the ground, and she moved like a leaf blown by the wind.</p><p></p><p>Appearing behind the young prince, her waist twisting, her body swinging at high speed, with a slap...</p><p></p><p>Her foot struck the young prince's body, sending his huge frame flying out.</p><p></p><p>As easily as kicking a ball! </p><p></p><p>Xixi's tiny body, like a hydrogen balloon, gently undulating, her toes just lightly touching and she flashed and moved away.</p><p></p><p>So agile!</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast to capture.</p><p></p><p>The young prince let out a roar, his entire body covered in dense purple energy!</p><p></p><p>The human form could no longer be seen.</p><p></p><p>In those eerie purple eyes, a ferocity and... fear surged! As if awakening the fear hidden deep in his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! Counterattack!</p><p></p><p>The dragon god illusion transformed by the young prince rushed out extremely fast, the dragon head opening its sharp fangs, rolling in purple energy, whipping up a gale, roaring!</p><p></p><p>He ran wildly, each step heavy and powerful!</p><p></p><p>The airflow rolled, the dirt and sand all rose! The entire courtyard was violently shaking, as if it was about to be completely overturned! The many children standing on the edge of the courtyard were horrified!</p><p></p><p>The vibrations from the ground and the sound waves transmitted through the air made their bodies tingle as if electric currents were striking them.</p><p></p><p>Haisheng, Gongyuan Liang, Gongyangxiu and the others didn't even have time to cheer for Xixi, their hearts terrified, staggering back!</p><p></p><p>Is this really a confrontation between a four-year-old and a five-year-old?</p><p></p><p>You're all just kids, why are you so strong?! Too strong!</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy even stopped stuffing food into his mouth, his face twitching uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the bloodline talent? So terrifying... the bloodline of the Martial Saint, truly so horrifying?"</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"No... not only the bloodline of the Martial Saint Yimolie, but also the bloodline of her mother..."</p><p></p><p>Yunye's soft voice said.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that this young prince Yihei's mother... is a dragon lady from overseas!"</p><p></p><p>Yunye said.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy's face twitched: "A dragon lady from overseas? Not human? My goodness, Yimolie has such heavy tastes?"</p><p></p><p>Yunye shook her head: "Of course, this is just a rumor after all, whether the young prince's mother is really a dragon lady from overseas, it's hard to say..."</p><p></p><p>"The Pacifying King has kept the news very tightly under wraps, only a few top experts would know."</p><p></p><p>"But now, looking at the young prince's bloodline talent... this rumor is likely true."</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo, Wang Kuyu and others were also startled by the intensity of this battle at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The fight between the two little ones was even comparable to the clash of master martial artists! At least, in terms of explosive power and destructive force, they were almost no different!</p><p></p><p>Even the invisible sense of oppression would make ordinary masters find it difficult to withstand, easily being beaten to death! They were truly two little monsters!</p><p></p><p>These two together haven't even reached ten years old yet!</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu furrowed his brows, a strange light flashing in his eyes: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... Xixi also has... bloodline talent?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu took a deep breath, couldn't help but make such a guess.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xixi currently pressing and beating the young prince, he couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes flickered, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline talent... impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che and Zhang Yajie's bloodline are quite ordinary, even... not noble."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a bloodline mutation? Because of the wrath of the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus and the mysterious temple of the Third Prince?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo murmured.</p><p></p><p>He thought of Xixi's talent displayed in the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think that Xixi's bloodline... might have changed in the Golden Divine Palace?</p><p></p><p>He didn't think in the direction of Xixi obtaining the Four Sovereign Top-Grade Divine Weapons.</p><p></p><p>That would be too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>But he had sent Xixi into the Golden Divine Palace once, and Xixi had brought out a divine beast butterfly, and also caused strange changes in the God's Pavilion of the Heaven King Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... this is divine affinity?"</p><p></p><p>"The divine affinity Xixi obtained in the Golden Divine Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu heard this and suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>That's right! This little girl must have entered the Golden Divine Palace! When Xixi was ranked 21st on the Divine Child List of the Dao City, it had already shocked the Dao City.</p><p></p><p>Now it makes sense!</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes were bright! Wang Kuyu also looked over, and the two exchanged a knowing look.</p><p></p><p>Right!</p><p></p><p>Divine affinity!</p><p></p><p>A situation where the temple deity is extremely fond of, and has a destined connection with the deity, is called divine affinity.</p><p></p><p>"If this is the case... this time the temple deity's resonance... Xixi might have a chance to take the lead!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Golden Light Peak, 100 meters away.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and the Supervisor were both silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sudden reversal of the situation on the courtyard, they were at a loss for words for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Li, are you a hidden Martial Saint?" Lu Yao glanced at Li Che and joked.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Martial Saint bloodline, how could this little girl be so powerful? Li Che smiled, his eyes shining, as he had guessed the real reason.</p><p></p><p>The flying thunder chess piece he had left in Xixi's body had finally sensed the movement of the purple flame snake spear hidden in Xixi's arm! This Four Sovereign Top-Grade Divine Weapon naturally could not be controlled and wielded by the current Xixi.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Actively triggering it would be different! Li Che stroked his chin, entering research mode.</p><p></p><p>The power of the dragon, will it activate the purple flame snake spear?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... this is a way to help Xixi master the fire spear?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>On the courtyard, it was quiet, only the roar of the two clashing forces howling and swirling! The purple flame snake pattern on Xixi's brow flickered.</p><p></p><p>Xixi's pupil's purple flames suddenly flashed, she felt so powerful now! The small spear in her arm constantly emanated power! Xixi felt she was so strong now! Xixi is strong, and strength brings change! She let out a childish cry! Pressing her arms down, her body soared into the air, her chubby little feet lightly touching the broken ground.</p><p></p><p>Airborne, then facing the charging purple ferocious dragon head of the young prince Yihei, she heavily stepped down! Boom! The purple energy exploded, like a water balloon squeezed to burst!</p><p></p><p>That roaring purple dragon head instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>However, after the explosion, the countless purple energy, as if taking root, quickly gathered together again.</p><p></p><p>But during the process of the dragon head reforming, Xixi, using the force of kicking the dragon head, had already flipped and mounted on the back of the purple dragon god illusion.</p><p></p><p>Her two white chubby feet rose up, her big toes even wiggling happily a few times! Xixi is riding a dragon!</p><p></p><p>How happy!</p><p></p><p>From now on, Xixi has another hobby! Fighting, riding dragons, and setting off fireworks!</p><p></p><p>Roar! The purple dragon transformed by the young prince kept roaring, constantly shaking and struggling!</p><p></p><p>The just-formed dragon head opened and closed, spewing rolling hot waves! "Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"Be good!" </p><p></p><p>Xixi shouted loudly! The next moment, her arm rose up, the transparent purple light flashing on her arm, the purple flames rolling and jumping, the light dazzling! In her tiny body, there was actually terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>A fist ruthlessly struck out! The force like a collapsing mountain! Heavily pounding on the neck of the young prince Yihei's dragon illusion, the entire dragon illusion, as if encountering terrible oppression.</p><p></p><p>Thud...</p><p></p><p>It crashed to the ground like a body thrown down.</p><p></p><p>The ground instantly sank more than a foot, with a spider web of cracks radiating out ferociously! Viewed from above, it was like a purple flower blooming! The mud, stones, surging and spreading out, rumbling loudly, the momentum extremely grand!</p><p></p><p>Countless billowing dust clouds instantly shrouded the surroundings like a curtain, blocking everyone's vision.</p><p></p><p>Then, there were screams, struggling sounds, like dragon cries, or like slaughtering pigs...</p><p></p><p>As if a huge earthworm, constantly twisting and rolling in the mud!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The ground shook again...</p><p></p><p>The dust and debris spread out like waves.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Continuous explosions, like using a huge hammer, constantly pounding something...</p><p></p><p>That sound made people's scalps tingle, their whole bodies feeling weak.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master Xue Dumu's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>This kind of battle situation was something he had never imagined...</p><p></p><p>The young prince Yihei, actually being suppressed to this extent, even being pounded on the ground!</p><p></p><p>Yihei had already unleashed his bloodline talent!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dumu's expression was extremely unsightly, but there was a conflicted look flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hesitating whether to intervene or not.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he intervened to stop it, what if the young prince could turn the tables? Xue Dumu's aura was surging, his hair and beard all standing on end, the powerful Grand Master's blood pounding, extremely conflicted.</p><p></p><p>And just as Xue Dumu was about to make a move, Wang Kuyu in front of the temple swung his whisk, also forming a mudra.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master and the Divine Celestial...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Between people, they are secretly competing against each other.</p><p></p><p>However, the two of them are only competing secretly, and the real result will depend on the outcome of the struggle between Xixia and the young prince.</p><p></p><p>They have not used their divine sense to probe.</p><p></p><p>They only use their eyesight to observe the situation in the rolling dust cloud! But in the end, Xue Dufu could not help himself.</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly, suddenly waving his sleeve, but it had no killing power, only releasing a gust of air.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the rolling surging dust cloud was blown away, revealing the scene in the arena.</p><p></p><p>But when they saw the scene in the arena clearly, Xue Dufu's eyes suddenly widened, his hair stood on end, and cold sweat unconsciously soaked his clothes.</p><p></p><p>And the six black-armored soldiers, at this moment, held their breath, and the next moment, they all drew the saber they had on their backs with a crisp sound! The gleam of the swords flashed, and the sharp and deadly aura suddenly swept through the entire arena!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stared at the six soldiers with wide eyes, gripping the ram's horn hammer, and the thunderous roar of thunder and lightning came from his left.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing's sleeves were rolled up, carried on his back, and the majestic and righteous divine nature rolled out from his body.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou was even more fiery and fierce, and the red-tasseled spear in her hand trembled, and the bursting flames seemed to be about to explode.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the divine generals colliding with each other was like the waves crashing against each other, bursting into countless white waves!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of feet away.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's eyes flashed, waving his sleeve to wrap up Li Che and Tang Ren, and the Monitoring Supervisor also slowly pulled out the erhu, and they all crossed and descended gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Deputy Supervisor of the Dao City Qingtian Monitoring, Lu Yao!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes narrowed, his hand grasping the hatchet at his waist, and he said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Qingtian Monitoring is the official force of the Great Jing Dynasty. Do you want to help the Divine Ancestor and oppress the young prince? Aren't you afraid that the prince will settle the score with you after the autumn?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu spoke coldly, immediately throwing out a big hat.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao came from Dao City, just like Wang Kuyu, both of them were Divine Element Perfected Ones, and even more difficult to deal with than Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>Because Wang Kuyu was known as a good-natured person who didn't like to fight much.</p><p></p><p>And his breakthrough was short-lived, as a newly promoted Divine Element Perfected One, Xue Dufu could still have the confidence to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Yao was different, the Deputy Supervisor of the Dao City Qingtian Monitoring, a person who had broken through the Divine Element for more than a decade, his foundation was far beyond Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>With Lu Yao's appearance, Xue Dufu would feel great pressure.</p><p></p><p>Li Che landed on the large platform in front of the Divine Palace, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the situation in the arena, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Because.</p><p></p><p>The dust had cleared.</p><p></p><p>The scene was truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>The purple dragon shadow had disappeared, and the previously arrogant and invincible young prince Yihui had his clothes torn and covered with cracks, being sat on by Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Although the hidden divine armor protected his body, so that every punch Xixia landed had the protective power of the divine armor to resist.</p><p></p><p>But this invisible protective power was now covered with cracks, almost about to shatter under the pounding.</p><p></p><p>Yihui was in a miserable state, like a dog chewing on mud.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were scattered, as if he had lost his light.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense the gazes around him, Xixia reluctantly got up: "It's really hard."</p><p></p><p>Then, she punched the virtual image of the divine armor that automatically protected its master again, causing the protective power to be completely shattered, like broken glass scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Yihui's head was buried deep into the ruins again.</p><p></p><p>The whole person was small and motionless.</p><p></p><p>Xixia hurriedly jumped up.</p><p></p><p>This shouldn't need compensation, right? Xixia's big eyes rolled around, looking at the young prince lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Her chubby little hand reached for the young prince's waist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>This posture... so familiar, just like when he first touched a corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Niuiu Shifu said that after winning the opponent, you have to take his Qiankun Jade, that's the spoils of war!" Xixia squatted down, tilting her little butt, and muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!" Xue Dufu was furious, stepping down, his powerful martial will surging, suddenly appearing next to Xixia who was about to take the Qiankun Jade from the young prince Yihui's waist.</p><p></p><p>Towering above her, like a fierce tiger seeing a fledgling.</p><p></p><p>However, before Xixia could feel suffocated, she felt the world spinning, and when her vision cleared, she found herself next to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao had acted, lightly waving his sleeve to bring Xixia to Li Che's side.</p><p></p><p>"The great master of the Qi and Blood Martial Dao, actually yelling at a child... how embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's smooth black hair fell down, speaking lightly.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's sleeve swayed in the wind, but he didn't care about Xixia being taken away.</p><p></p><p>His original intention was just to scare Xixia away.</p><p></p><p>Beating up the young prince and then wanting to take his Qiankun Jade, this was naturally not allowed! It was already embarrassing, if the Qiankun Jade was taken away by a little girl, then the young prince's face... would be completely trampled into the mud.</p><p></p><p>If this news reached the ears of Yimogli, who was currently suppressing the rebellion, Xue Dufu would inevitably be charged with dereliction of duty and have his skin peeled off!</p><p></p><p>"This girl has won the young prince, but she wants to take the Qiankun Jade, such humiliation... how can I, the old man, sit and watch the young prince suffer?" Xue Dufu said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He also fearlessly stared at Lu Yao.</p><p></p><p>He had the backing of the Pacification King Yimogli, so he naturally had the confidence.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu also knew why the Qingtian Monitoring's Lu Yao chose to stand on the Divine Ancestor's side... </p><p></p><p>It was also because of the prince.</p><p></p><p>The prince's current Zhizhou rebellion had been suppressed for too long, and the Corpse God Sect was also constantly growing stronger...</p><p></p><p>The court... also had some suspicions about the prince.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had to show his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yao, you, the Deputy Supervisor of the Dao City Qingtian Monitoring, dare to bully my young prince... If it were the Supervisor of the Qingtian Monitoring in the Divine Capital, it would be another matter, but if this news reaches the prince's ears, you wait for the prince to demand an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu picked up the young prince who was pretending to be unconscious on the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he frowned coldly, with a murderous aura rolling towards Lu Yao.</p><p></p><p>One was Lu Yao, the other was Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Even if this news reaches the prince's ears, I, Lu Yao, am not afraid. Li Nuoci is the second-rank guest of my Qingtian Monitoring, and as the Deputy Supervisor of the Qingtian Monitoring, protecting her life is only normal."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's brought to the Divine Capital, I'm in the right."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's hair and beard were flying, standing with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Besides..."</p><p></p><p>"If you lose, you have to admit defeat. If the Qiankun Jade on the waist is taken away, it can only be counted as losing to a better person."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, the more you practice, the better you'll get."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao spoke bluntly, not at all polite because Xue Dufu was a grand master under Yimogli.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xue Dufu was not even among the top five grand masters under Yimogli...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's face looked extremely ugly, and the six black-armored soldiers also drew their sabers, forming a continuous military force with their aura.</p><p></p><p>But they were only confronting each other.</p><p></p><p>Because Nanlihuo waved his hand, and the various peaks within the Divine Sect's branch sect all had bursting auras.</p><p></p><p>There were virtual images and divine foundations...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators within the sect were fearless.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's temper even exploded, wanting to break out.</p><p></p><p>However, he was stopped by Weng Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Impulsive, don't escalate the conflict, do you really want to leave the other party behind?" Weng Wuyu said in an old voice: "We're just putting on a show... just to maintain appearances."</p><p></p><p>"The Shrine God Resonance is about to begin, and no one wants to make a big fuss."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan reluctantly put away his ram's horn hammer.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain top, the great snow howled and flew.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu hugged the young prince with one arm, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good... a divine child of the Golden Light Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"A divine Qiankun Golden Light Branch Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu repeated "good" three times, then turned and stepped heavily down the mountain, the entire Golden Light Peak shaking.</p><p></p><p>He shot out, hugging the young prince and arcing towards the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>The six black-armored soldiers also retreated into the air one by one.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, who was being held by Li Che, couldn't help but struggle at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Why did they run away? Remember to fulfill the bet!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is waiting for you, you little slave!" Xixia shouted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che quickly tapped her on the head.</p><p></p><p>Xixia immediately hugged her head, looking aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, it hurts..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said impatiently, "Didn't I teach you? Don't be a hero outside, be low-key. What if you meet an opponent you can't beat and get beaten up?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes were full of tears, her small mouth pouting, her chubby cheeks puffed up.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, Xixia's hands hurt..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed Xixia's chubby arm that looked like a lotus root.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xixia's inner Fire Spear had been activated, and Li Che was afraid it would affect Xixia, although it was mostly unlikely.</p><p></p><p>The third eye on his forehead faintly glowed.</p><p></p><p>Divine Ability... Plucking Star Pupils!</p><p></p><p>After a glance, Li Che couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Because... Xixia's arm had completely changed! The toughness of the flesh and blood was much stronger than before! Now, the tendons, membranes, and muscles of Xixia's arm that contained the divine weapon were even not weaker than his own Furnace Sect Master! This was the power of the divine weapon overflowing and affecting Xixia!</p><p></p><p>Similar to... Washing the marrow and cutting the hair! This is simply...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled, the Four Subdued Divine Weapons... also have this kind of effect? </p><p></p><p>No, he should say that the divine legendary weapons actually have such an effect?</p><p></p><p>This is an extremely great benefit for martial dao cultivation! Li Che's eyes flashed, he seemed to vaguely understand something.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the martial dao in this world has a constantly rising upper limit, and before the appearance of the Divine Nature Law and the widespread distribution of the Mysterious Shrine, it was extremely difficult to cultivate to the level of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But now, there are even Martial Saints, and even above Martial Saints!</p><p></p><p>Li Che guessed that this may be related to the subtle enhancement of the flesh and blood by these divine weapons! He wonders if the Equaling Heaven Mask he obtained, which is a remnant divine legendary weapon, also has such a powerful physical effect?</p><p></p><p>However, his Equaling Heaven Mask is a remnant divine legendary weapon...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he will have to wait until he has collected the complete divine legendary weapon before he can find out.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Xixia was fine, Li Che also let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This girl... is frightening.</p><p></p><p>When Xixia said she was in pain, Li Che's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>He thought she had been injured by the grand master Xue Dufu...</p><p></p><p>The murderous intent was about to burst out.</p><p></p><p>However, even now, Li Che's murderous intent has not completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carefully observed again, not only the arm, but the whole body.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Xixia's condition was better than ever before, his mood finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's fists were slightly reddened on the surface, it seems she was too excited and punched too hard just now.</p><p></p><p>In addition, under Li Che's Plucking Star Pupils perception, the purple flame snake spear, the Fire Spear in Xixia's arm, after beating the dragon god purple eyes of the young prince, just sank into silence.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed to feel a sense of regret and boredom.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>Disdaining that the dragon was just a fake dragon, not drawing out what it wanted to draw out...</p><p></p><p>Unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>It seems to have sensed a strong personality.</p><p></p><p>However, the Plucking Star Pupils on Li Che's brow slightly brightened.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the purple flame snake spear in Xixia's arm was exhaling a wisp of purple gas that seemed like a dragon...</p><p></p><p>Long and winding, undulating continuously, like a scaly dragon, like a crocodile body, like a horned dragon!

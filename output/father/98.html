        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Furious Eight-Armed Lotus Jail Deity Haunts the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince! Li Che looked at the information fed back by Qian Xi's hand, and there seemed to be a faint glimmer of light flickering above his pupils.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't help but take a deep breath!</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple of the Four Sovereigns! A Four Sovereigns level temple!</p><p></p><p>What level was the Mysterious Temple in Fei Lei City again...?</p><p></p><p>It was only at the Ten Sovereigns level, far, far away from the Four Sovereigns... Li Che couldn't help but furrow his brow, feeling the surging and roaring river that seemed to have become extremely scorching hot due to its divine nature, with his whole body's blood and qi slightly surging.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of such a temple deity... If it were to be absorbed into a chess piece, and then activated with the attitude of ascending the tower.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that he would be burst open. Li Che soon calmed down. He had never been a person who was emotional. After thinking it through, he had a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although the divine nature of the Four Sovereigns level Mysterious Temple was indeed very attractive to him, but... he must proceed slowly and cautiously, not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple at the Four Sovereigns level is absolutely not comparable to the pit deity that he had patted bald in the Ten Sovereigns Mysterious Temple in Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of the Ten Sovereigns Mysterious Temple is equivalent to the God Foundation level...</p><p></p><p>Then the Four Sovereigns... what level would that be equivalent to? God Manifestation? God Element, or even higher God Embryo?</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, but his mind could not calm down for a long time... The main reason was that when there was an idea in the human heart, that idea would take root in the heart like branches and vines, constantly spreading and enveloping the whole heart.</p><p></p><p>"The divine nature of the Four Sovereigns Temple deity is dangerous, dangerous... but if there is a chance to enter this Mysterious Temple, I still have to find an opportunity to try it, who knows if it will succeed?"</p><p></p><p>A wild ambition arose in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are more careful plans. If the plans are well-made, even if he can only pluck a divine nature chess piece, that would be enough to be his trump card.</p><p></p><p>In addition...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, and there seemed to be a flickering flame in the bottom of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Furious Eight-Armed Lotus Jail Deity of the Third Prince... He always felt that this temple deity's name seemed familiar.</p><p></p><p>Before, Li Qingshan had told him about the deity with the fine spirit hound, holding a three-pointed double-edged sword, with a vertical eye in the middle of his brow...</p><p></p><p>And now there is the Furious Eight-Armed Lotus Jail Deity of the Third Prince...</p><p></p><p>"The myths of the two worlds... seem to be overlapping, a coincidence or...?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt like his brain was about to explode, and he dared not think too deeply about it.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, in my current state, I am too insignificant... If the sky collapses, there will be someone tall to hold it up. Now, I just need to protect my wife and daughter, and watch my daughter grow up slowly."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not stay by the river for too long, lightly tapping his toes, his figure flew up and returned to the caravan.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, why didn't you take Xixie to play in the water?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie poked her head out from Zhang Ya's arms, pouting her little mouth, very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed her head.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen beside them looked at Li Che suspiciously. Why did this guy react so strongly to the Mysterious Temple? "Alche, you should have a reverent attitude towards the Mysterious Temple, don't go prying into things that you cannot bear because of so-called curiosity."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said earnestly: "You are now a father, you have to think about your children and wife."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, he knew Old Chen had a good heart.</p><p></p><p>The big-headed Lv Chi was crouching his head, obediently unlike himself.</p><p></p><p>He saw Li Che's curiosity and excitement towards the "Furious Third Prince" Mysterious Temple, and his heart sank. He hurriedly kept a low profile.</p><p></p><p>This guy is a ruthless and vicious person who dares to go and wipe out a three-year-old girl's family.</p><p></p><p>Escort leader Qian He also looked at Li Che with surprise. Just now, the fleeting display of Li Che's skills was not weaker than his own, the great six-change blood transformation martial artist.</p><p></p><p>This Master Li is deeply hidden.</p><p></p><p>But it's also normal, after all, he is a master wood carver, having some foundation is also normal.</p><p></p><p>"Escort Leader Qian, that Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the most terrifying Mysterious Temple outside of Jingang Prefecture, is a Four Sovereigns level Mysterious Temple that has not been destroyed, and has been a temple for over 500 years..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect branches and the Imperial Court's Temple Guarding Department and the Imperial Observatory have all dispatched strong cultivators to be stationed in Jingang Prefecture, just to keep a close eye on the situation of this Mysterious Temple, to prevent the temple deity from going berserk and causing disasters across the land."</p><p></p><p>Qian He was very familiar with the situation of this Mysterious Temple. </p><p></p><p>Mainly because every time there are outsiders coming to Jingang Prefecture, they will ask about it, and after answering so many times, it has become a muscle memory.</p><p></p><p>"It's normal for Master Li to be curious, the Four Sovereigns Mysterious Temple, outsiders won't have a chance to see it in their lifetime..."</p><p></p><p>Qian He smiled.</p><p></p><p>But then he became serious: "Master Li, be curious all you want, but don't get too close. The temple deity's divine nature has extremely strong infectious and bewitching power. Once your mind and spirit are drawn in, and you enter the Mysterious Altar, half your life will be gone."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Third Prince is located in the extremely dangerous Nine Dragon River, ordinary people can't even get close."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Mysterious Altar' of this Mysterious Temple has already formed. Once you get close, and are swallowed by the Mysterious Altar, even Sect Masters and God Manifestation cultivators will have no return."</p><p></p><p>Qian He finished speaking, and then suddenly grinned: "The Third Prince Mysterious Temple is our pride in Jingang Prefecture... After all, among the four prefectures under Yunzhou, only our Jingang Prefecture has a Four Sovereigns level Mysterious Temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mouth twitched, what's there to be proud of?</p><p></p><p>Such a dangerous thing...</p><p></p><p>However, Qian He had gotten into the mood, and Li Che was also happy to learn about the information of the Mysterious Temple, so the two continued to chat along the way.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It took half a month to travel from Fei Lei City to Jingang Prefecture City, mainly because they were following the merchant caravan, not rushing all the way.</p><p></p><p>The scorching sun hung high, dispelling the biting cold of winter.</p><p></p><p>Noon.</p><p></p><p>The caravan of carriages arrived at the city gate of Jingang Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The majestic and towering city walls, standing on the earth, like a terrifying giant rising from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragon River surges ceaselessly, branching off a tributary flowing through Jingang Prefecture City, like a long sword, dividing the prefecture city in two.</p><p></p><p>In the sunlight, the tributary river water does not show any turbulence, rippling with golden light, and in the distance, one can see large ships dotting the surface, sailing and competing.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this calm and gentle tributary of the great river was once opened up by a legendary prefect of Jingang Prefecture, diverting the river into the city, opening up a convenient waterway for Jingang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This move not only changed the water transportation and people's livelihood of Jingang Prefecture, but also diluted the divine nature in the Nine Dragon River and sent it into the city of Jingang Prefecture, bringing great improvement to the divine cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With the evaporation of the water vapor, the diluted divine nature merged into the air, increasing the concentration of divine nature, making it a cultivation paradise for divine cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The city walls of Jingang Prefecture City are extremely wide, standing at the city gate, looking left and right, the ends of the city walls are hazy and difficult to see at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Under the surrounding city walls of the prefecture city, there is a blue-green peak rising from the city interior, like a beast crouching outside the city walls, encircling this mountain peak within.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Daddy, it's so big!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie poked her head out of the carriage, blinking her big eyes, exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>Not only Xixie, even Li Che's heart was slightly shaken, after all, the impact of this ancient city and majestic city walls was quite strong.</p><p></p><p>Far beyond the comparison of Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>After paying the city entry fee, the caravan entered the outer city of the prefecture. Although it is called the outer city, it is actually much more grand than the inner city of Fei Lei City, with a wide blue stone road that can accommodate ten carriages side by side, with shops lining both sides, displaying goods, dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a feeling of suddenly arriving at a prosperous era in the midst of a chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that this was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Like the city of Fei Lei, there are too many of them. Just a little bit of the impact of the Mysterious Temple's release of strangeness would be enough to overturn a city.</p><p></p><p>Even if some of the power holders in the city have a little crooked mind, the people would be miserable.</p><p></p><p>Under the jurisdiction of Yunzhou, there are only four prefecture cities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no matter how prosperous the appearance of the city is, there will also be unknown sordidness and a mess underneath, it's just that he is just starting to get in touch with it now.</p><p></p><p>Qian He was very enthusiastic, perhaps because Li Che was a master wood carver, his attitude was extremely warm.</p><p></p><p>After entering the prefecture city, he also helped Li Che's group find an inn.</p><p></p><p>The inn was not of high standard, but it was fine as a temporary resting place, and Li Che was not picky, although he was now very rich, with a wealth foundation comparable to a great family.</p><p></p><p>"Escort Leader Qian, could you please do me a small favor? I and my group are not familiar with the prefecture city, and we plan to stay in the prefecture city in the future, so I would like to ask Escort Leader Qian to help us find a place to live."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out a silver ingot weighing nearly ten taels and handed it to Qian He.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li is too polite, leave it to me." </p><p></p><p>Qian He laughed heartily, took the money without any scruples, and left after cupping his fists.</p><p></p><p>After the group checked into the inn, Old Chen couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go out and take a stroll, and ask about the Divine Sect branch's entry examination for Xixie..."</p><p></p><p>"There are still two or three months before the branch entry examination, why the hurry?" Li Che held Xixie and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go inquire, see if Xixie has any competitors... This is very important."</p><p></p><p>"Although Senior Qingshan has guaranteed that Xixie's excellent innate talent can enter the branch, after entering the branch, there are still first, second, and third class, what's called outer disciples, inner disciples, and core disciples..."</p><p></p><p>"My little stinky Xixie must enter the core disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen hung a wine gourd on his waist and gave a big thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't argue with him, so he let him go.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by like sand between the fingers.</p><p></p><p>It was a month's time.</p><p></p><p>Jingang Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Outer City, Hear Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>A small three-room courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Winter has passed, but the chill of early spring is still biting, the spring cold is freezing, and people still have to wrap themselves tightly.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the courtyard, under the peach blossom tree, Li Che sat quietly, wearing a black tight-fitting robe, letting the biting early spring wind blow on his body.</p><p></p><p>Slowly opening his eyes, a faint heat seemed to be emanating from his body, as if the temperature of the entire courtyard had risen.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, a glimmer of light flickered past.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Che</p><p>Bonds: Li Nuanxi (daughter)</p><p>Dao Fruits: Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 48%), Dragon Elephant Vajra (Lv3, 13%), Untainted Heart (Lv2, 18%), Chess Saint (Lv2, 3%)</p><p>Nascent Divine Abilities: Immortal Craftsman - Thousand Splitting Hands, Dragon Elephant Vajra - Ascending the Tower</p><p></p><p>The overall transformation of the Dao Fruits was quite significant.</p><p></p><p>In just over a month, Li Che entered the prefecture capital, but he was very discreet, after all, he had just arrived and preferred to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he spent his time cultivating in the courtyard he had purchased, carving wood sculptures, making mechanisms, and improving his firepower.</p><p></p><p>With the improvements he made to the single-shot "Wood Raven", by incorporating expensive spirit wood and infusing it with divine power, its destructive power was greatly enhanced. Now a single shot could kill a cultivator at the Tranquil River Realm.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator at the Divine Foundation Realm, they would be shattered by no more than five shots.</p><p></p><p>Of course, due to the expensive materials used in the improved "Spirit Wood Raven", the quantity produced was limited, with Li Che having a total of only six hundred rounds.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the progress on the "Southern Void Immortal Craftsman Barrett" was also accelerated. He used the seventh-grade spirit wood "Dragon Fang Boxwood" to construct the mechanical body, combining the Bodhi Tears and the Spirit Wood Raven, demonstrating its formidable penetrating power. Li Che temporarily named it the "Primordial Southern Void Immortal Craftsman Barrett".</p><p></p><p>The completion of the Primordial Barrett directly raised the maturity of the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit to 48%, bringing him closer to reaching Lv4.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che already felt the difficulty in further advancement, and he increasingly yearned for the complete records of the "Tang Clan Mechanisms".</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Vajra had also slowed down in its progression after reaching Lv3. Even after breaking through the Mysterious Meridians, its progress only increased by a meager 10%.</p><p></p><p>To break through to Lv4, merely stepping into the Divine Meridians might not be enough, and he might need to attempt to become a Qi and Blood Grandmaster to have a chance.</p><p></p><p>The Untainted Heart and Chess Saint Dao Fruits did not see much advancement recently, as Li Che had not been killing many people and thus did not absorb much divine power.</p><p></p><p>The Chess Saint Dao Fruit, after the "Thousand Buddha Feast", had reached Lv2 due to the abundant divine power absorbed from the chess pieces. Li Che studied it and found that his ability to refine divine chess pieces had become faster.</p><p></p><p>In just this one month, his Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord divine foundation had been completely stabilized after refining the divine wrathful essences of Cao Guang and Cao Qingyuan, and the divine power was now firmly rooted, no longer at risk of dissipation.</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze rustled the leaves, creating a soothing sound in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was happily playing with the old Chen on a scooter, the young and old enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>The old Chen had always found scooters to be quite boring, being so old, how could he possibly play with such a childish toy? But since coming to the prefecture capital, whenever he was idle and bored, he would hop on the scooter, as if a new world had been opened up for him.</p><p></p><p>He had even made his own scooter and often competed in skill with Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the courtyard, there were various training weapons and equipment, and Zhang Ya, dressed in a white tight-fitting outfit, was practicing with a solemn expression. Suddenly, she felt a surge of energy flowing through her body, rushing into her skin, causing it to flush with a healthy glow and become even more resilient. It seemed that her entire physical constitution had undergone a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Beneath her delicate frame, the large tendons could be seen pulsing and trembling.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, I've opened my meridians!" Zhang Ya exclaimed breathlessly, her previously dark eyes now shining brightly with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes and approached Zhang Ya, gently caressing her and nodding with a smile, acknowledging her achievement.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, you have successfully opened your meridians. My wife is truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Receiving Li Che's praise, Zhang Ya could no longer suppress the smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly remembering something, she tiptoed and leaned close to Li Che's ear: "Now that I've opened my meridians, my physical resilience has greatly increased. My dear, you can be a bit more... forceful tonight..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was at a loss for words. What kind of thoughts were running through this delicate wife of his? The first thing she thought of after successfully opening her meridians was this?</p><p></p><p>"My dear, I've actually researched a few positions that can help consolidate your meridian opening..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black dungeon, the air was thick with the stench of blood and decay.</p><p></p><p>A black wax candle was lit, casting a dim glow that illuminated the scene within.</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds echoed as a rope supporting a heavy object swung back and forth.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the dungeon, a figure hung by their wrists, their white shirt stained with bloody lash marks. Their hair was disheveled, and blood dripped from their mouth and nose, their face swollen and unrecognizable.</p><p></p><p>In front of the hanging figure, a beautifully carved armchair was placed, and a well-dressed noblewoman sat upon it, covering her mouth and nose with a white embroidered handkerchief. Her delicate willow-like brows were furrowed, expressing a mix of disgust and coldness.</p><p></p><p>"You escaped from Feiliu City?"</p><p></p><p>"My son died in Feiliu City, and you, a worthless dog, dare to live?"</p><p></p><p>The woman's voice was tinged with madness, as if she could no longer contain her grief.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the news from Feiliu City, the woman felt as if the sky had collapsed. The fact that her useless son Cao Guang had died was one thing, but her son Cao Qingyuan had also perished in Feiliu City...</p><p></p><p>He was a piece of flesh that had come from her womb. Tears streamed down the woman's face, and the dungeon seemed to be filled with the mournful wails of ghosts emerging from the underworld.</p><p></p><p>The woman raised her hand, and her long, pale fingers with beautifully manicured nails clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the bound Xu Beitu trembled, and numerous divine essences permeated the area. Ghostly infant-like figures emerged from his legs, armpits, neck, and hair, releasing thick black mist.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beitu's breathing became labored, and agonized roars erupted from his throat.</p><p></p><p>The pain of his flesh being devoured was excruciating, causing his entire body to tense up and convulse.</p><p></p><p>"I told you... I've said everything I know..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beitu was in agonizing pain.</p><p></p><p>He had a keen sense of smell and, upon learning that Xu Heli planned to sacrifice him and Xu You to assault their divine foundations, he had fled. He had brought his family to the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't long before the news of the calamity in Feiliu City and the deaths of City Lord Cao Guang and the Young City Lord reached him. He knew then that he was in trouble, and sure enough, the next day, he was captured and brought to the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>The woman was Cao Qingyuan's mother, the Third Miss of the Qin Family, Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>"I know you've said everything... but I just want to torture you. How dare you escape when my son is dead? Do you think you deserve to live comfortably?"</p><p></p><p>The woman spoke in a crazed manner, and the ghostly figures became more excited, tearing at Xu Beitu's flesh with greater fervor.</p><p></p><p>After torturing him for a while, the noblewoman finally left the dungeon, her voluptuous figure graceful as she stepped into the bright sunlight.</p><p></p><p>A masked figure silently appeared before her.</p><p></p><p>"Have you found Zhang Xiangyang? And what about that Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>The noblewoman discarded her handkerchief, her beautiful face now cold and cruel.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Miss, we have not yet found any trace of the Ox Demon, it's as if he has vanished. But as for the Feiliu Divine Constable Zhang Xiangyang, we have obtained some leads. Since he is a Zhenming Tribunal official, we thought he might go to the Tribunal..."</p><p></p><p>"I want results, not the process! Go and capture him! Zhang Xiangyang is the only cultivator who escaped from the City Lord's manor, and I want to torture him. How dare he live when my son died so horribly?"</p><p></p><p>The masked figure fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The crazed noblewoman soon calmed down, her brows furrowing as she spoke: "Has the gifted child from Feiliu City arrived in the prefecture capital yet?"</p><p></p><p>"That useless man Cao Guang... organizing that Thousand Buddha Feast, and even letting an exceptional spiritual child escape? Protected by Li Qingshan? Before Li Qingshan left, why did Cao Guang miss that spiritual infant?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's eyes gleamed with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon? Xu Beitu speculated that the Ox Demon might be the wood carving master Li Che from Feiliu City..."</p><p></p><p>"According to the records, this Li Che only has a newly replenished martial cultivation, with meager divine power. How could he be the Ox Demon who can easily slaughter divine foundations? Moreover, the Li family left the prefecture capital before the Thousand Buddha Feast..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, is the Dharma Master of that spiritual child still alive? He managed to survive the Goat Horn Hammer of Li Qingshan... He has some skill, could he have killed my son?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing closed her eyes, and the image of her son's blood-stained face was seared into her mind.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, her willow-like brows trembled slightly, and her eyes opened, filled with icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>"A gifted spiritual child, huh..."</p><p></p><p>"Feiliu City, of all places, actually produced a gifted spiritual child, and Cao Guang even let her slip away, allowing her to survive until Li Qingshan came?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this all just a coincidence? There are no such things as coincidences in this world!"</p><p></p><p>"And that twenty-two-year-old spiritual child... haha, what a joke, it's clearly not a genuine one."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuqing's crimson lips seemed to be dripping with blood.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After making arrangements with his wife Zhang Ya to assist her in consolidating her meridian opening tonight, Li Che tidied himself up and left the Hear Flower Alley courtyard, intending to first go to the other property he had purchased in the prefecture capital, which he used as a wood carving workshop, to refine the newly completed "Primordial Southern Void Immortal Craftsman Barrett".</p><p></p><p>Afterward, he planned to go to an inn and order a feast of fine wine and delicacies to properly celebrate his wife's meridian opening breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out of the alley and onto the main street, his steps slowed slightly, and he narrowed his eyes, looking ahead.</p><p></p><p>There, Dahu Lü Chi, accompanied by two individuals wearing official uniforms and carrying Zhenming Tribunal badges on their waists, were approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Hm? Has his identity as the Ox Demon been reported?</p><p></p><p>[Author's Note: Please support me with monthly tickets and recommendation votes.

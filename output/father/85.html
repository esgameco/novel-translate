        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cold wind was howling, and the falling rain had turned to ice.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the alley, the dense bloody aura was intertwined and unbearably pungent.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan rushed up, his powerful blood energy striking the air, emitting a wailing sound of surging airflow. He arrived at the alley entrance and could already smell the scent of blood before even entering.</p><p></p><p>The ground was in disarray, with many long street bricks covered in cracks, remnants of the fierce battle still visible.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the alley, under his feet was not rainwater, but thick, crimson blood.</p><p></p><p>So much blood had been spilled that it had dyed the stagnant water red! When Cao Qingyuan saw the corpse of Yang Jing, the patriarch of the Yang family, his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Even he, who was accustomed to seeing corpses, could not help but feel his heart churning at this sight.</p><p></p><p>The way Yang Jing had died... was too tragic!</p><p></p><p>His entire body was riddled with countless bloody holes, drained of blood, and his head had been blown apart.</p><p></p><p>These methods were so cruel that they sent chills down one's spine and caused goosebumps to rise.</p><p></p><p>"This Niu Mo... so malicious, so vicious..."</p><p></p><p>"True to his infamous nickname, the Niu Mo, the demonic head!"</p><p></p><p>"A hero? He doesn't even deserve to be called a hero!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan took a deep breath, his hand resting on the saber at his waist, his breathing unsteady.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his nausea, Cao Qingyuan grabbed the rotting, fleshy corpse of Yang Jing. He didn't want to come here, but his city lord father had ordered him to retrieve Yang Jing's body... so he had no choice but to come.</p><p></p><p>"How tragic and lamentable, a patriarch cultivator who had stood tall in Feilei City for centuries, now dead in such a miserable way..."</p><p></p><p>"The Yang family is too unfortunate, all their experts wiped out, the patriarch killed so cruelly... the Yang family is completely ruined now."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, what had the Yang family done wrong? It seemed they hadn't done anything wrong...</p><p></p><p>It was just from the moment they agreed to help the city lord's manor capture that spirit child from the Xu family that they had set out on the path to their demise.</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo single-handedly slaughtered the entire Yang family!"</p><p></p><p>"The cause... was going to the Xu family to capture the spirit child..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan narrowed his eyes, Li Che's daughter, that high-grade spirit child...</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>With a bang, the surging blood energy shook, and Cao Qingyuan hoisted the bloodless corpse of Yang Jing and disappeared into the alley.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The golden light flowed, as if within the pupils of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His physical body and blood energy suddenly swelled and boiled, like raging waves crashing against a riverbank.</p><p></p><p>The Dao fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra], finally reached Level 3, undergoing a transformation and giving rise to the embryonic form of a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The embryonic form of a divine ability...</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra: Ascend the Tower!</p><p></p><p>This was the transformation Li Che had been anticipating for a long time, more difficult to achieve than the Dao fruit [Immortal Craftsman], a kind of slow-grinding cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The key was to engage in intense battles, which would stimulate the Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the rapid advancement of Li Che's [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit was also greatly related to that volume of the "Tao Family Mechanism Essentials".</p><p></p><p>The mechanisms recorded in it, which Li Che had integrated with his own ideas and attempted to replicate, provided a wealth of experience for the [Immortal Craftsman].</p><p></p><p>"The embryonic form of a divine ability... Ascend the Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Different Dao fruits could give rise to different embryonic forms of divine abilities, and could these embryonic forms then evolve into true divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but anticipate the moment when these embryonic divine abilities would transform into true divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, when the Dao fruit reaches Level 4 or Level 5, the divine abilities will be able to undergo that transformation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>With a stirring of his mind, the Dao fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] in his chest pounded, and with each beat, it felt as if a blazing flame was burning and surging! [Embryonic Divine Ability (Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra: Ascend the Tower): Boiling divine nature, flesh and blood ascending high, perfect tempering, the gods shall see me]</p><p></p><p>A line of golden text appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Frowning, puzzled, Li Che found this introduction somewhat difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After a brief perception, Li Che did not activate [Ascend the Tower] in the study, but feeling the restless, almost boiling and transforming blood energy, Li Che speculated that [Ascend the Tower] should be an even more powerful state enhancement than the "Golden Vajra Transformation" of the Dao fruit itself! The furious Golden Vajra Transformation was already extremely powerful... If he were to unleash Ascend the Tower, would he directly reach the Divine Realm level?</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't be sure, but his heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>"At the Level 3 Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra, the amplification to my blood cultivation will be tremendous, even without relying on the embryonic divine ability, the benefits to me will be greater..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>However, he still slowly suppressed his excited emotions, from killing the Yang family patriarch, to utilizing the [Flying Thunder Chess Piece] coordinate anchor left in the study to return to the study.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's movements were very fast, and it was precisely because of this that he managed to return to the courtyard before Cao Qingyuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was intentionally rushing, it's just that killing Yang Jing didn't take much time, and secondly... using the Flying Thunder Chess Piece to escape was a plan he had already formulated.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Niu Mo identity was exposed or not, Li Che actually didn't care anymore.</p><p></p><p>With the powerful Daoist Sect master Li Qingshan standing up for him, his safety as a 22-year-old spirit child and the daughter of an elite spirit child was guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Bringing his fingers together, he drew a line in the air, tearing open a rift.</p><p></p><p>From it, he extracted a jade talisman with intricate patterns, the Spatial Talisman of the Yang family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the extraordinary quality of this Spatial Talisman, far surpassing the ones he had previously obtained from Simo Bai, Yang Kaihei, and others, Li Che's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"An even higher quality Spatial Talisman?"</p><p></p><p>The [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit trembled, and the pure white divine nature of the Untainted Heart surged and erupted, engulfing the high-quality Spatial Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling...</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt the [Untainted Heart] Dao fruit trembling at an extremely high frequency, and then it directly devoured and refined the Yang family patriarch's Spatial Talisman. The spatial dimension... expanded greatly, becoming much larger! If it was originally the size of a small room, now the spatial dimension was as large as a basketball court! Li Che's lips curled into a smile, marveling at how much gold leaf it would take to fill such a vast space.</p><p></p><p>Killing enemies was not the key, but taking stock of the opponent's wealth was the most pleasing thing.</p><p></p><p>That was the harvest he had earned through his own abilities, so the joy was justified.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty gold ingots, a thousand gold leaves, five thousand four hundred and sixty taels of silver..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed as he counted the wealth of a patriarch cultivator, these mundane riches were enough to astound him.</p><p></p><p>That was a fortune that ordinary people could never even imagine in their lifetime!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's ability to accept such wealth had also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted, and he began to take stock of other items.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Grabbing with his five fingers, a long spear with red patterns emerged from the spatial dimension, and he grasped it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The moment he grabbed the spear, Li Che felt his brain buzzing! It was as if there were horrifying screams ringing in his ears, almost piercing his eardrums and shattering his mind!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>A divine weapon! Nurtured by divine nature, possessing extraordinary sharpness and abilities, extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators of divine nature, spiritual cultivation methods, divine nature wood carvings, and divine weapons were what they pursued the most! Li Che had never seen a divine weapon before, not in the possessions of Simo Bai, Yang Kaihei, Zhao Xuanhai, Zhou Ruoguan, and the others.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhao Xuanhai's refined iron long sword could not be considered a divine weapon! His hand suddenly turned jade-like, the [Immortal Craftsman: Thousand Analyses] technique! Suddenly, information flowed into Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Top-Grade): Bloodstained Shocking Spear]</p><p></p><p>[Craftsmanship: Forged from a hundred-year-old cold iron, mixed with the blood and divine nature of the demonic bird "Shocking", then tempered in a blazing...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fire was forged a thousand times and a hundred times, able to activate the "Startling Divine Nature". When the spear is fired, all spirits are startled, captivating the soul!</p><p></p><p>Mastering: The Startling Divine Nature technique, cultivating the nature like a river and above.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the information analyzed by Qianxi, Li Che was slightly stunned, never expecting that Qianxi had this ability.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that he could even analyze the name of the divine weapon, the forging technique, and so on. Perhaps, this is Qianxi's true potential?</p><p></p><p>A top-grade divine weapon of the Nine Yang! Li Che took a deep breath, no wonder he is a Divine Foundation Cultivator, his family's wealth is far beyond the reach of paupers like Zhao Xuanhai.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you use this divine weapon when fighting me? Were you careless? Or was it because at that time, the old master of the Yang family had already been occupied by the Divine Foundation divine nature, so he could not actively activate the divine weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, and he couldn't help but think about it.</p><p></p><p>If the divine weapon had been used, Yang Jing's strength might have been stronger, and he might not have died so miserably. However, this is all hindsight now, and at present...</p><p></p><p>This startling spear now belongs to the Li family!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the divine weapon, Li Che unexpectedly discovered many rare materials, among which... Li Che had a piece of the "Bodhi Tear Blood" required for the "Blood Flesh Red" spiritual wood, as well as a few other spiritual woods, which were obviously prepared for carving divine nature wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>Even after reaching the Divine Foundation realm, one cannot lack divine nature wood sculptures, it's just that the requirements for the wood sculptures are higher.</p><p></p><p>Just like practicing martial arts requires elixirs, and cultivating divine nature, one cannot do without divine nature objects.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the divine weapon and the various spiritual woods, Li Che continued to check the list.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a Divine Foundation technique?!"</p><p></p><p>The "Nine Yang Startling Fierce Divine Foundation Forging Technique"! A Nine Yang-level technique for forging the Divine Foundation! What a treasure!</p><p></p><p>The Cultivating Nature technique is precious, but the Divine Foundation technique... is even more precious!</p><p></p><p>It is the hidden essence of every powerful family, and Li Che didn't even find it in the Yang family's treasure vault. It turned out that the old master of the Yang family was carrying it with him all along!</p><p></p><p>With the Forging Divine Foundation technique, Li Che's heart was greatly relieved, at least he now has a path to forge the Divine Foundation in the future.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the 81 black Divine Foundation divine nature chess pieces extracted from Yang Jing's body in the "Chess Saint" Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also a Divine Foundation fragment, containing a mighty "Startling Fierce" divine nature, enough for him to quickly cultivate to the Cultivating Nature like a River realm.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the inventory, Li Che was a bit dazzled.</p><p></p><p>He stored all the gains in the expanded Qiankun space, then stood up and went to the window, feeling the winter rain mist spraying on his face.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fluctuating emotions gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the study, intending to try the changes in his martial arts talent brought about by the upgraded "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>He took a meditation cushion and sat down, then opened the Qiankun space, and a jade bottle fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Python Blood Martial Pill."</p><p></p><p>He poured out a scarlet pill and swallowed it. Immediately, it felt like a heavy stone falling, with a "thud" sound from his throat all the way down to his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Instantly, his stomach was like a furnace, and his blood qi began to boil uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>It surged through his four limbs and meridians! ...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The steamy heat was twisting and rising in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan's second grandfather, the other Divine Foundation Initiate in the City Lord's Mansion, Cao He.</p><p></p><p>He had taken off his clothes, revealing his sunken chest with palm prints. The mighty Patriarch true qi was wriggling like a venomous snake on the wound, making it difficult to heal.</p><p></p><p>Cao He closed his eyes, grasping a three-eyed spiritual infant statue, and strands of black divine nature flowed from it and were swallowed into his mouth, treating his injury.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan stood beside him, his eyelids lowered.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was the flesh mountain of Yang Jing's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang paced back and forth, admiring this flesh mountain full of bloody holes. The blood had been drained completely, and there was hardly any bloody smell in the air.</p><p></p><p>"What a Ox Demon, just at the Cultivating Nature realm, yet he could kill a Divine Foundation Cultivator... Poor Yang Jing, he has become the stepping stone of this Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"Killing Divine Foundation Cultivators at the Cultivating Nature realm, the story of the Ox Demon will surely spread in the jianghu."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang praised.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan suddenly raised his head, his gaze flickering: "Father, is that Ox Demon Li Che?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether it is or not, it no longer matters..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che and his daughter, we cannot touch them for now..." Cao Guang shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Is Li Che the Ox Demon? </p><p></p><p>This question... has no meaning to Cao Guang anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the visitor from the Qianxuan Immortal Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan fell silent and then asked.</p><p></p><p>"Although the visitor is only a disciple, but after all, it is the Qianxuan Immortal Sect, the number one sect in the Lingnan Way, and their status is there."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the visitor is Li Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang reached out his hand and gently touched the blood-riddled corpse of Yang Jing, his movements very gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan... is he famous?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Cao Qingsuan's question, Cao Guang took a deep breath and glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"I should have sent you to Yunzhou earlier, so you could have seen the world... Then you wouldn't have asked such a question..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan paused.</p><p></p><p>You could have just directly said that my experience is lacking, no need to go around in circles and imply that I'm ignorant.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Divine Foundation Ranking?" Cao Guang said, his fingers finding a spot on Yang Jing's body and pressing into it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Foundation Ranking! Cao Qingsuan took a deep breath: "Is this Li Qingshan a powerful figure on the Divine Foundation Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Foundation Ranking is issued by the Great Scenery Dynasty's Astrology Bureau, evaluating the powerful figures in the jianghu across the Great Scenery. In addition to the Ranking, there is also the Divine Appearance Map, and those who enter the Ranking, whose Divine Foundation and Divine Appearance are at least at the Fourth Rank..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan is among the top ten on the Yunzhou Divine Foundation Ranking, his Divine Foundation is complete, and he is preparing to observe the Divine Appearance!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang closed his eyes: "I never expected that the messenger from the Qianxuan Sect's Yunzhou branch this year would be Li Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>"To breakthrough to the Divine Appearance, one needs to condense divine nature to observe the ancestral divine appearance... During the observation, the divine nature cannot be disturbed. Li Qingshan's Divine Appearance has not descended from the mountain, his divine nature is not on his body, so now he can only use his Patriarch's physical body to fight, no wonder..."</p><p></p><p>"This is our luck... Otherwise, we would have been hammered to death long ago."</p><p></p><p>"This Li Qingshan, known as the Yunzhou Hammer Overlord, his Purple Gold Hammer divine weapon has crushed the heads of many powerful figures... His reputation is truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"We're lucky."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"So, this Li Che and his superior spiritual child daughter, we cannot touch them for now."</p><p></p><p>"No matter whether Li Che is the Ox Demon or not, since Li Qingshan has revealed his identity to protect him, we dare not move against him."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Feast must be accelerated..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid this Li Qingshan is planning to hammer my head."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang abruptly opened his eyes, his brows furrowed into a "川" shape.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?!"</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is Yang Jing's divine nature? The divine nature in his body... how come not a drop is left?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's divine nature surged, constantly attacking, and his five fingers clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>With a "bang" sound...</p><p></p><p>The huge flesh mountain of Yang Jing's corpse in front of him twisted and writhed, then exploded into pieces, with shattered flesh and bones flying all over the hall.</p><p></p><p>The nearby Cao Qingsuan was even splattered all over, standing dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>As for Cao Guang, he seemed a bit ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Who has devoured all the divine nature in Yang Jing's body? Is there someone from my sect in Feiluo City? No... that shouldn't be..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Ox Demon?!"</p><p></p><p>"Could this Ox Demon be... one of our own people?!"</p>

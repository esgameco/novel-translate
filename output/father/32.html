        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, in order to stabilize the situation, he disguised himself as the Ox Demon and set out.</p><p></p><p>Due to the self-made elastic clothing, he did not immediately activate the Golden Ape Transformation, and since he was not a 1.9-meter-tall figure, he would not be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at his uncle's house, following the familiar path as he remembered.</p><p></p><p>From afar, he saw a familiar Bagua staff.</p><p></p><p>The figure crouching on the ground, with the Bagua staff on his back, was the tempering martial artist who had joined Zhao Chuanxiong in attacking him when he killed the Liu family.</p><p></p><p>"The tempering martial artist... coming to do this kind of thing?"</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed aimed at me."</p><p></p><p>His uncle's family had no one who practiced martial arts, and his cousin Li Zhengran was just a scholar without any fighting prowess, let alone mobilizing a tempering martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Just provoking a sinew-refining martial artist would be like using a bull knife to kill a chicken.</p><p></p><p>So, the other party's purpose was not simple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since his uncle had come to notify him, wanting to borrow a place to stay in the Xu family mansion, Li Che had a 70% chance of believing that the other party was indeed coming for him.</p><p></p><p>"70% chance... this certainty is already too high, the Lingying Sect has never given up on Xixing, and their methods have become more extreme."</p><p></p><p>"Are they trying to force my wife and daughter to move out of the Xu family mansion through my death?"</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, then opened them again, and the killing intent beneath the ox-demon mask was overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>However, the more the killing intent was revealed, the calmer he became.</p><p></p><p>The "Dragon Elephant Golden Ape" Dao fruit in his chest was violently pulsing, absorbing and suppressing all the auras around Li Che.</p><p></p><p>This was a minor transformation after the "Dragon Elephant Golden Ape" Dao fruit had matured to 60% of its divine nature.</p><p></p><p>In addition to releasing the activated "Golden Ape Transformation", it also had the effect of completely devouring the blood qi and aura, hiding his cultivation and spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che called this state the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant", like a sleeping dragon and elephant, without causing any ripples in his movements.</p><p></p><p>After concealing his aura with the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant", Li Che stepped into the courtyard without leaving any footprints, as if merging into the wind and snow, approaching the figure wearing the girl's mask.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow howled and roared.</p><p></p><p>The figure crouched on the ground, staring at the crack in the door with a faint smile, completely unaware of Li Che's silent approach.</p><p></p><p>When he sensed something was wrong, Li Che had already appeared behind him, suddenly activating the Golden Ape Transformation, his physical body instantly swelling up like an inflated balloon, the bones colliding and thundering, the great tendons twisting and resonating!</p><p></p><p>In the echoing roar, he had transformed into a giant cast in pure iron! The almost solidified blood qi like a sea serpent grew and spread, and the internal force of the python within also spewed forth, merging into the blood qi, coiling around one of Li Che's arms.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, the fist Li Che clenched came crashing down!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power, the moment it collided with the flesh of the martial artist wearing the girl's mask, exploded and released, the skin bursting open, blood spraying!</p><p></p><p>The bones seemed to let out cries of being overburdened, almost as if they were about to break.</p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff martial artist was dragged several meters in the snow, accompanied by surging air currents and swirling white mist, slamming hard into the earthen wall, causing the accumulated snow on the black tiles to shake and fall.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you..."</p><p></p><p>The hoarse voice came from the mouth of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Echoing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, Li Zhengran was terrified, shivering with fear, enveloped in a chill.</p><p></p><p>The fight outside, he was afraid... that it would spill over into the house.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>In the snow pile.</p><p></p><p>The figure struggled to get up, half of his body was torn and bloody, the blood dripping from the hand gripping the Bagua staff.</p><p></p><p>The girl's mask was cracked and looked rather ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff martial artist coughed up blood, his eyes filled with shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at him indifferently, without any more words.</p><p></p><p>That one sentence just now... was enough.</p><p></p><p>Killing, no need for more words.</p><p></p><p>Just kill.</p><p></p><p>This Bagua staff martial artist had already been added to Li Che's must-kill list, in addition to him, there was also Zhao Chuanxiong, the entire Lingying Sect... they had all been added to his list.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has encountered him... isn't it just convenient? Then send you on your way!</p><p></p><p>Twisting his thick neck, the back muscles rippling and undulating, the spine springing up like an angry dragon.</p><p></p><p>With one step, the snow in the courtyard suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the hazy snow mist, the towering figure wrapped in surging spiritual power tore through the snow, appearing in front of the Bagua staff martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Raising his palm, the air flow was shattered, clenching his fingers, the air seemed to be crushed!</p><p></p><p>The fist he struck out came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Like a white tiger in the snow, he fiercely slammed down a tiger's paw amidst the raging winds!</p><p></p><p>The crisis of death instantly enveloped the Bagua staff warrior.</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine that in just one short month, this vicious villain Niu Mo had grown to such a terrifying and powerful extent! Tempering the bones... complete! A month ago he was just beginning to temper his bones, but now... he had already reached completion! What a monster?! But at this moment, he could not afford to think too much, as a roar of fury erupted!</p><p></p><p>Summoning all his strength, igniting his inner energy, facing the lightning-fast and ferocious tiger's fist, he had no choice but to block it with the Bagua staff!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Niu Mo's fist pressed down heavily, ruthlessly slamming into the Bagua staff!</p><p></p><p>The staff instantly bent, letting out a mournful cry!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force of thousands of pounds gushed out, as if the very air had been shattered in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The wind, snow, and mist between the two dispersed, like ripples spreading across a water surface!</p><p></p><p>The snow that had been flung high up was like the curtain rising on a stage! His jet-black and vigorous hair danced wildly, and the eyes behind the mask shone brightly like stars!</p><p></p><p>The Bagua staff warrior only felt a chill, the terrifying power surging through the arms gripping the staff, dispersing his triple-layered inner energy, causing his bones to shatter and blood vessels to burst, leaving him drenched in blood.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che remained relaxed, clenching his fist and slamming it down forcefully.</p><p></p><p>In the recoil, the Bagua staff was knocked out of the warrior's hands, and then another fist came, this one infused with the Xu Family's Eight Shattering Spear that Li Che had just mastered that morning - a fist like a spear! Tearing through the raging airflow, unleashing the might of thousands of pounds, it slammed heavily into the chest of the Bagua staff warrior.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a muffled explosion had gone off, the airflow the warrior had been inhaling, as well as his ribs, were shattered under the force of the punch, accompanied by his internal organs being torn apart and scorching hot blood being splattered across the rising curtain of snow.</p><p></p><p>His steel-like flesh and bones still emanated a scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che retracted his fist, his eyes behind the mask indifferently sweeping over the lifeless body of the Bagua staff warrior, a tempering-the-bones martial artist, whom he had brutally beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>With this, a name was crossed off the list of those he must kill.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood permeated the wailing wind and snow in the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The family in the house had already been terrified, not daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Especially when they saw the murderous Li Zhengran through the crack in the door, their legs felt weak and they nearly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this terrifying Niu Mo was not a bloodthirsty person.</p><p></p><p>His appearance here seemed to be solely for the purpose of killing the Lingying Sect martial artist wielding the Bagua staff and wearing the child's mask.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran was drenched in cold sweat, but mustered the courage to peek through the crack in the door again.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw that outside, the wind and snow had calmed, and the Niu Mo had already disappeared, leaving only a blood-stained corpse on the ground, the blood staining the Lingying wooden sculpture, making it appear quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran dared not look anymore, his whole body trembling as he returned to the house. Even the uncle did not dare to smoke, the whole family huddled together in complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A rustling sound came from outside the house.</p><p></p><p>The crunching of footsteps on the soft snow.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, it's me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the call from the courtyard, Uncle Li Liang immediately showed a look of joy: "It's Ahe!"</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran, Liu Chunming, and the others also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Che, the wood carver from Xu's Workshop, had arrived, it gave them a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>After opening the door, the solemn-faced Li Che, dressed in black and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, stood outside.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe..." Cousin Li Zhengran swallowed hard and hurriedly spoke, describing the recent events in a flustered manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed drastically: "Niu Mo? The one the authorities have a 500-taels bounty on?!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Pack up and leave immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter is not something we can get involved in. You'll be safer at the Xu Family estate."</p><p></p><p>"That deceased was a tempering-the-bones martial artist, and Niu Mo was able to kill him with a single punch - how terrifying must he be? Let's get out of here quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes revealed a flash of profound fear, then he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the uncle's family was immediately alarmed. A tempering-the-bones martial artist? </p><p></p><p>Those were the kind of great heroes who could scale walls and leap across rooftops.</p><p></p><p>For such a person to have died in their small courtyard... they had to get out of here as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they had already packed their belongings.</p><p></p><p>So, after quickly gathering their things, they followed Li Che in leaving the blood-stained courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was empty, and it fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The wailing wind and snow whirled in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes drifted down, landing on the crooked and cracked child's mask in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Alone, it spoke of desolation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Holding the wood carving that exuded a strong spiritual essence, Xu was both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>If a wood carving possessed spiritual power, it could be called a wood carving master, and the identity would become noble. In any prominent family or clan, a wood carving master would be treated as an honored guest.</p><p></p><p>Although one became a wood carving master, there were still hierarchical distinctions based on the strength of the spiritual power imbued in the wood carvings.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual cultivators, in order to enhance the nobility of the wood carving masters, would categorize them according to the strength of the mysterious temples as proclaimed by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>For example, after becoming a wood carving master, if one could consistently imbue the carved wood with spiritual power, they would be called a "Ten Capital" wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>When the carved wood possessed spiritual power at the level of the divine objects in the "Nine Luminaries" mysterious temple, they would be called a "Nine Luminaries" wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, congratulations... I was right about you. I knew you would become a wood carving master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu You was very happy, playing with the wood carving that Li Che had gifted to cultivate the spiritual power of the Xu family's [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword]. There seemed to be a light in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you have become a wood carving master, I can rest assured to carry out the cleansing missions."</p><p></p><p>Xu You smiled. Basically, no one dared to touch the daughter of a wood carving master, and the Xu clan would spare no effort to protect her, not allowing any harm to befall her, in order to curry favor with the wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Xu clan only had one elderly wood carving master, and it was already extremely difficult for him to maintain Xu Heli's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che becoming a wood carving master would naturally receive great attention.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, he had actively revealed his talent and wood carving skills...</p><p></p><p>In addition to the timing being about right, it was also to actively make the Xu family pay attention, ensuring Xixia's safety in the future in Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was also the reason of adding bargaining chips for Xu You.</p><p></p><p>Xu You was completely delighted for Li Che, after chatting with him for a while, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>He needed to inform the Xu family of Li Che becoming a wood carving master, so that the Xu family would pay full attention to it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was cool and the snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Xu You, who had disappeared at the end of the long street, and gently exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a piece of flying snow was torn apart in the blurry scene.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, dressed in plain clothes, appeared in the courtyard, his back hunched as he looked at Xu You's retreating figure, his eyebrows raised.</p><p></p><p>"You're a man who remembers kindness. By revealing your talent as a wood carving master, and then entering the Divine Sect, with this background, Xu You won't need to worry too much about being bullied in Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Honest people are often easily bullied. With more background, it won't be so easy to bully them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a breath of hot air in the cold weather.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you rarely appear these days. This time, have you found the location of the main headquarters of the Spirit Infant Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che poured a bowl of hot tea from the boiling pot for Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan did not hesitate, taking the hot tea and sitting under the eaves with Li Che, slurping it down.</p><p></p><p>"I've got some clues. It seems I've figured out that the Spirit Infant Sect is deeply involved with the government, and I thought their headquarters would be in the Prefect's Mansion, but after infiltrating the Prefect's Mansion, I found that was not the case..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan slurped the hot tea, frowning as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow also furrowed upon hearing this: "Not in the Prefect's Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense, the Prefect's Mansion, after all, is the official residence of the Great Jing Dynasty. Even if the Spirit Infant Sect is so rampant, to actually set up their headquarters in the Prefect's Mansion, openly defying the face of the imperial court, once this news spreads in Feilei City, hehe... even the Jinguang Prefecture's Temple Inquisition Office is not to be trifled with."  Li Qingshan snorted.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Jing Dynasty now cares most about its reputation. Although the dynasty is in decline, the dignity of the nation still needs to be maintained," Li Qingshan extended his hand, catching a snowflake and crushing it into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, you actually became a wood carving master... This is a bit beyond my expectation. It seems this old spiritual child has quite a keen sense of spirituality."</p><p></p><p>"Just right, since you've entered the Divine Sect, I can introduce you to the 'Wood Carving Ridge'. That way, you'll be able to establish a better foothold within the Divine Sect, and it will also be easier to obtain the spiritual wood carvings Xixia needs for her cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also took a sip of tea, his eyebrows raised: "Is spiritual wood carving so scarce within the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at Li Che and grinned: "Within the various sects, the 'Ten Capital' level wood carvings are not in high demand, but the 'Nine Luminaries' and 'Eight Extremes' level spiritual wood carvings are highly sought after..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, indicating he understood.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Dao Fruit [Immortal Craftsman], Li Che's current abilities should allow him to carve the highest quality "Ten Capital" wood carvings.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nine-star level divine wood carving left Li Che completely clueless... </p><p></p><p>It was as if he was missing some crucial catalyst.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and sighed deeply: "Being a master wood carver is a lucrative profession. Those who become master wood carvers have their path of divine cultivation secured... However, the advancement of a master wood carver's rank is also extremely dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Except for the Tenth Realm, for every subsequent rank, breaking through by relying on one's own enlightenment is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Therefore, one needs to capture the divine energy of the corresponding level's mysterious temple deity, and then enshrine that captured divine energy within the wood carving in order to advance. This is also why the ranking of master wood carvers is similar to the ranking of mysterious temples."</p><p></p><p>As if recalling something, Li Qingshan fell into deep thought for a moment. "Young Li Che, have you ever been to a mysterious temple before?"</p><p></p><p>Mysterious temple? Li Che couldn't help but shake his head. </p><p></p><p>He had heard of it, but had never been there.</p><p></p><p>These mysterious temples had sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain in the changed world, accompanied by mysteries and evil omens, bringing calamity to the human realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the rise and fall of a country's national power was greatly related to these mysterious temples.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, this old man will come find you, and I'll take you to the Tenth Realm Mysterious Temple outside the city. The 'temple deity statues' in the mysterious temple are the key for a master wood carver to advance. By observing the temple deity statues and capturing their level of divine energy, that is the crucial factor."</p><p></p><p>"While the mysterious temple has not yet advanced to the Nine-Star level, go take a look. Once this mysterious temple advances to the Nine-Star level... then it will be too dangerous to go."</p><p></p><p>"And also... I can make use of your tempering power..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan finished the hot tea in his bowl, chewing on the tea leaves as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the seemingly pensive Li Che, Li Qingshan shook his head with a smile and quietly disappeared into the wind and snow, not stirring even a flake of snow.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious temple, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a puff of hot air, watching the disappearing Li Qingshan in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of anticipation flickered in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of anticipation...</p><p></p><p>of finally being able to touch the true mysteries of this world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inner city of Feilei, at the Xu Family Estate.</p><p></p><p>The lights were bright, dispelling the bitter cold.</p><p></p><p>In the main seat, the current Xu Family patriarch, Xu Nanming, sat in the grand chair, carefully appreciating a wood carving.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a flash of something unusual appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Below, Xu You pressed his lips together, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"So it really is a 'Tenth Realm' divine wood carving. That Master Li has... truly advanced to become a master wood carver?"</p><p></p><p>"He's only twenty-two years old, right? How impressive... truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>A twenty-two-year-old master wood carver, no, one should say that he truly started learning wood carving only three years ago, yet in three years he has achieved the status of a master wood carver... Such talent, he is truly a treasure!</p><p></p><p>"My daughter is a treasure, and I, the father, am also a treasure... This father-daughter pair are both treasures."</p><p></p><p>After returning the "Three Immortals Riding Ox Suspended Thought Sword Statue" to Xu You, Xu Nanming waved his hand to dismiss him.</p><p></p><p>"Father, now that Master Li is a master wood carver, our Xu Family must properly protect Xixia's safety, so as not to disappoint Master Li." Before leaving, Xu You said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Go on." Xu Nanming waved his hand indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"I take my leave." Xu You's expression, which had been filled with joy, disappeared, replaced by a gloomy look as he retreated.</p><p></p><p>After Xu You left, Xu Nanming respectfully cupped his hands towards the dark area behind the room.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, an aged voice drifted out from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, cough... It seems the Qianyuan Divine Sect has sent someone to Feilei City in advance, but I don't know who the visitor is... The downfall of the Si Family has the shadow of the Divine Sect, and this Li Nuanxi is a top-grade spirit child. We Xu Family cannot control her, and we will eventually have to go to the Divine Sect. As for this master wood carver Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>"He may not stay with us either."</p><p></p><p>"Achieving the status of master wood carver in just three years, his future potential may even reach the Nine-Star, or even the Eight Extremes level!"</p><p></p><p>"But alas, this person will eventually soar, and will not remain with the Xu Family..."</p><p></p><p>"The great changes in Feilei City are imminent... Since that is the case, for such a master wood carver..."</p><p></p><p>"What use is it for us Xu Family to keep him?"</p><p></p><p>The faint and aged voice carried a touch of indifference.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Heleiling to go with an attitude tomorrow, and request to purchase a 'Tenth Realm' divine wood carving. If this Li Che graciously accepts the order, then so be it. If he doesn't accept the order..."</p><p></p><p>"Then let the City Lord's Mansion have it. The City Lord is currently putting pressure on the three major aristocratic families, and needs to conscript more wood carvers..."</p><p></p><p>"For a newly advanced 'Tenth Realm' master wood carver, the City Lord..."</p><p></p><p>"Should be quite satisfied, I suppose."</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the aged and hoarse voice murmured.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Nanming felt a chill run down his spine, and cold sweat beaded on his forehead.</p>

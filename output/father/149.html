            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was wearing a horse-faced mask and gripping the Immortal Craftsman Barrett with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Because he had continuously sniped several Dragon Tooth Bodhi in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>The barrel of the Immortal Craftsman Barrett was somewhat difficult to withstand, vaguely overburdened.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Craftsman Barrett... also needs to be upgraded."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stowed the mechanism away, couldn't help but ponder in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The last two consecutive Dragon Tooth Bodhi, suppressed the arrows of Wen Long Mountain with pure firepower."</p><p></p><p>"Hit, but didn't kill."</p><p></p><p>"Wen Long Mountain... his physical body is not weak, the power of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi is still a bit lacking, and Su Huai is watching beside him, it's not realistic to sneak attack him by teleporting over."</p><p></p><p>In fact, at the moment the Dragon Tooth Bodhi hit, Li Che's idea of teleporting over was still very strong.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Huai was right beside Wen Long Mountain, this cultivator who seemed to have condensed a spiritual body posed a great threat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was outnumbered, and could only flee.</p><p></p><p>"The update and upgrade of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi needs to be accelerated, try to integrate it with [Great Avalanche], the pure Bodhi Tears of Blood effect is no longer enough for a Grandmaster-level martial artist, who can basically rely on the control of flesh and blood to suppress the lacerating power of the Bodhi Threads."</p><p></p><p>"There's also the penetration effect, when the opponent is wearing defensive divine weapons and armor, the effect will be weaker, an inferior-grade divine weapon and armor requires two shots, and must hit the same spot consecutively."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty is not small, the failure rate is extremely high."</p><p></p><p>Under the horse-faced mask, Li Che's brow furrowed after a brief review in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was not satisfied with the sniping effect this time.</p><p></p><p>Although this time the duel ended with the horse-faced mask piercing the opponent, it was only a piercing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che originally intended to kill Wen Long Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The two deadly Dragon Tooth bullets were aimed at his Nirvana Acupoint between the eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the farther the distance, even with the precision guidance of the [Chess Sage]'s Dao fruit, there was still the possibility of error.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Wen Long Mountain was not a motionless target.</p><p></p><p>He could move.</p><p></p><p>"Improving the firepower equipment is imminent."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"And the key to improving the Immortal Craftsman Barrett is in the spiritual wood..."</p><p></p><p>"Mount Shengling... I hope you won't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>The words seemed to dissolve into the heaven and earth like a gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che's figure then sprang out again, changing positions, the sniper's position was exposed, so he had to find a new position.</p><p></p><p>Found another hidden position again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che descended silently, not making a sound.</p><p></p><p>The pure spiritual nature condensed into a sheet of paper, the spiritual nature and vital energy intertwined, splashing ink to paint the immortal in the painting!</p><p></p><p>Grabbing with five fingers, he directly pulled out an Immortal Craftsman Barrett from the paper.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Craftsman Barrett drawn from the painting can also be used, but its durability is even lower.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Craftsman Barrett drawn from the painting can only withstand about two Dragon Tooth Bodhi shots before shattering into ink mist.</p><p></p><p>Set up the sniper.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth chessboard expanded again.</p><p></p><p>Sense, aim.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth are the chessboard, everything is in sight.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's Hawk Eye Technique, no matter how extraordinary, how can it compare to the Chess Sage's eye that grasps the overall situation? While keeping a close eye on Wen Long Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He also locked onto the direction of Mount Zhengfeng.</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced from the Underworld...</p><p></p><p>Let tonight, see some blood.</p><p></p><p>Let the world know...</p><p></p><p>He, the horse-faced, is not an archer, but a...</p><p></p><p>Sniper.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack crack—</p><p></p><p>Rolling thunder!</p><p></p><p>The gigantic figure of the Thunder God descended on the summit of Mount Zhengfeng, a terrifying electromagnetic field storm swept relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>The scattered stones on the ground were shattered by the striking thunder.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood in place, gripping the Goat Horn Heavenly Hammer, his hair hanging upside down, his blue robe already torn apart by the thunder, leaving only his pants and his extremely muscular upper body!</p><p></p><p>Late Grandmaster realm, vital energy strong as a dragon! The divine foundation has been completely carved into the Pensive Thunder Subduing Evil Golden Vajra...</p><p></p><p>Meaning, Li Qingshan's divine manifestation breakthrough, only the last step remains! That is to...</p><p></p><p>Absorb the carved divine manifestation into his body!</p><p></p><p>And this is also the most dangerous step.</p><p></p><p>He had explained to Li Che long ago that the impact of cultivating the divine foundation also requires extremely strong physical body, needing to reach the Mysterious Meridian realm to steadily step into the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The same is true for the divine manifestation realm.</p><p></p><p>To steadily step into the divine manifestation, the vital energy cultivation must reach the middle Grandmaster realm or above, the early Grandmaster realm is not safe enough.</p><p></p><p>If the one condensed is the Seven Elemental Divine Manifestation, the late Grandmaster realm cultivation is enough, but if you want to condense the Six Sages Divine Manifestation...</p><p></p><p>The late Grandmaster realm cultivation is still lacking.</p><p></p><p>The danger is extremely high, if the physical body cannot withstand the terrifying power of the Six Sages Divine Manifestation, it will be shattered by the crazy spiritual nature, becoming a slave to the spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>Every year, there are many cultivators who go astray in the cultivation of spiritual nature, going mad, being enslaved by the spiritual nature. </p><p></p><p>Gradually exhausting their vital energy and dying.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Li Qingshan is walking on a tightrope! Many people are not optimistic about Li Qingshan's reason is also like this.</p><p></p><p>The Six Sages Divine Manifestation, the rank is too high.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, it also requires an even stronger physical body to bear it! Or... some specialized divine objects to enhance the physical body strength! But Li Qingshan doesn't have any!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The surrounding void, the spiritual nature of the divine manifestation cultivators, like wave after wave, constantly crashing.</p><p></p><p>Various divine manifestations and spiritual natures colliding, creating one wave after another.</p><p></p><p>South Separation Fire and Supervisor Zheng, the two Elemental Manifestation Elders, were suppressing the three Corpse Deity Sect Seven Elemental Corpse Deity Envoys in battle, every time Supervisor Zheng struck, that two-stringed instrument would involuntarily make a sound.</p><p></p><p>But both South Separation Fire and Supervisor Zheng have not relaxed, because they both know that these three Corpse Deity Envoys are just going through the motions, not giving it their all.</p><p></p><p>They are focused on the breakthrough situation of Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>If they judge that Li Qingshan can successfully absorb the Six Sages Divine Manifestation...</p><p></p><p>Then these three Seven Elemental Corpse Deity Envoys, are likely to reveal their true abilities at the moment Li Qingshan is about to succeed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Seven Elemental Corpse Deity Envoys... have condensed the Silver Demonic Qi that the Cursed Silver Corpse possesses, which is powerful enough to rival the divine qi of a Grand Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's battle intent soared, her Crimson Emperor Flame Divine Manifestation belongs to the type that grows stronger the more it fights, once she enters battle mode, she becomes completely frenzied.</p><p></p><p>There is no such thing as holding back, she is just frantically bombarding a divine manifestation cultivator wearing a mask and night clothes.</p><p></p><p>That cultivator is furious: "Zhu Hongdou, why are you just targeting me to attack?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's eyes were scarlet, the flames burning fiercely, the Crimson Emperor Flame Divine Manifestation behind her stood tall and disdainful.</p><p></p><p>"Old bastard Shangguan Jie, don't think that just by wearing a mask, I won't recognize you."</p><p></p><p>"Last time, to pretend to be pitiful in front of Xixia, you let me injure you a bit, this time... I'm going to stab you to death, old dog! Hand over your life!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's spear that spewed fire tongues pointed, the fire light rolled up.</p><p></p><p>Roaring as she charged towards the masked Shangguan Jie.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie was really about to get angry!</p><p></p><p>They are all divine manifestation cultivators of the Golden Light Prefecture City, they can recognize each other's divine manifestations, wearing masks and night clothes to fight, is just to give each other a face.</p><p></p><p>Like Zhang Qingzheng, Weng Wuyu, Lin Xiu, and the one wearing a goat mask who is the Deputy Supervisor of the Heavenly Mandate Supervisory Office, they are all just going through the motions in the confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhu Hongdou, like a Husky whose tail has been stepped on, is attacking him Shangguan Jie with a life-and-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>You really don't understand human relationships at all, woman!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie really doesn't have the energy to pay attention to Li Qingshan's situation, can only strive to resist.</p><p></p><p>This Zhu Hongdou is for real, she is really fighting for her life!</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Jie is in the divine manifestation middle realm, he dares not underestimate the divine manifestation initial realm Zhu Hongdou...</p><p></p><p>After all, this woman's divine manifestation has been refined to the Six Sages level!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack crack!</p><p></p><p>The electric snakes coiled wildly, the rain poured down like columns.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was soaked by the rain, the bloodiness on his body was washed away a lot.</p><p></p><p>His expression was a bit dazed, returning to the city lord's mansion, his expression was a bit unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai sat holding a cup, poured a cup of tea and handed it to Wen Long Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"General Wen Long, the reason for your defeat is not because of you, that horse-faced one used mechanisms, not true archery."</p><p></p><p>"You were defeated by the mechanisms, not the archery."</p><p></p><p>"So, what is there to be disappointed about?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said with a smile, his brows raised, with a bit of flamboyance.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wen Long Mountain's mood calmed down a lot, the bullet hole in his chest kept pulsing, after a moment.</p><p></p><p>The countless Bodhi Threads that had split apart were squeezed out by his flesh and blood, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This is very similar to the Tong Clan's mechanisms..."</p><p></p><p>"At the peak of the Tong Clan's prosperity, with their mechanisms and terrifying mechanism beasts, even Divine Embryo Realm great cultivators felt threatened, how can it be just empty fame."</p><p></p><p>"You were defeated by the Tong Clan's mechanisms, it's not something to be ashamed of."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai picked up a Bodhi Thread, saying indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"This horse-faced one, seems to be related to the Tong Clan, or rather... the forces behind the Bull Demon Horse-faced, are related to the Tong Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"The centipede may die but not its spirit, it really is very tenacious."</p><p></p><p>"But the Tong Clan has long since perished, just the Tong Clan... how can they stir up any big waves."</p><p></p><p>An invisible force burst forth, the Bodhi Threads were directly burned to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"The Tong Clan's Divine Embryo Ancestor in the past, was simply cleaved by my master with one sword, and the Tong Clan's most prized fifth-level mechanism beasts, were also seized by my master."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's lips curled up in a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Just a dying waste."</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's heart trembled slightly, a gleam of fanaticism flashed in his eyes: "The Prince is after all the Martial Saint of the current era, naturally powerful."</p><p></p><p>A gleam of longing also flashed in Su Huai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"General Wen Long, don't worry, this injury... you won't have suffered in vain, the lord of this manor will certainly find a way to avenge you."</p><p></p><p>"This horse-faced one... when there's a chance, the lord of this manor will behead him for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai comforted, trying to win over his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's gaze sharpened, shaking his head: "The lord of the manor doesn't need to bother, my archery supreme skill, the Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Divine Arrows... is about to reach the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Once it reaches the Transformation Realm, and forms a true domain, when we shoot again, I will definitely shoot through the horse-faced one!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful self-confident aura suddenly burst forth from Wen Long Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's gaze flashed with a strange color.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will congratulate General Wen Long in advance."</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain cupped his fist, then looked towards the direction of Mount Zhengfeng where the lightning was flashing.</p><p></p><p>"My lord... can you still lend a hand?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain asked.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai shook his head: "No need."</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"That horse-faced one is keeping an eye on you, as soon as you shoot an arrow, he will snipe to obstruct you."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan also knows very well, his divine manifestation breakthrough will certainly become the target of many, so... he hired this horse-faced one to act."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite worth it."</p><p></p><p>"This horse-faced one, is a top-tier assassin hidden in the darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Comparable to the Hunting God Pavilion's assassins."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai gently swirled the tea cup, speaking.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain fell silent, his heart slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Su Huai's evaluation of the horse-faced one to be so high.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Hunting God Pavilion... is an extremely mysterious and terrifying assassin organization.</p><p></p><p>They have even assassinated Divine Embryo Realm great cultivators! The horse-faced one...</p><p></p><p>Is actually comparable to the Hunting God Pavilion's assassins? Su Huai glanced at him and smiled: "Of course... he's only the lowest-level assassin in the Hunting God Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai looked towards Mount Zhengfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Your best chance of action was interrupted by the horse-faced one, now to intervene again is already too late."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>"Has succeeded."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Inhale, exhale.</p><p></p><p>Extremely steady, tranquil as usual, as if rippling and undulating with the breeze.</p><p></p><p>The rain outside the city is not as urgent as the rain inside the city, even mixed with some unmelted snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the horse-faced mask, crouched in a new sniper position.</p><p></p><p>Since he promised Li Qingshan that he would take action tonight, Li Che naturally would not go back on his word.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth chessboard enveloped the entire Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto the numerous figures around Mount Zhengfeng.</p><p></p><p>Those figures had extremely majestic auras, after all they were divine manifestation cultivators, on the heaven and earth chessboard, they were like bright lights.</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention on the most intense battle.</p><p></p><p>That was the battle between the Red Cloud Peak Master Zhu Hongdou and Shangguan Jie, it was truly... a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the others' going through the motions, this battle, Li Che couldn't ignore it even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Jie, the ancestor of the Shangguan Clan, the father of Shangguan Zhenghen, an enemy..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment, and after realizing that Shangguan Jie was the enemy, he no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>He did not sense the aura of death and decay from Shangguan Jie's body, which surprised him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shangguan Zhenghen was a member of the Corpse Deity Sect, but it seemed Shangguan Jie was not.</p><p></p><p>However, even if Shangguan Jie was not from the Corpse Deity Sect, Li Che had no sympathy for him.</p><p></p><p>The enmity between them was irreconcilable, and with Shangguan Jie appearing tonight, trying to disrupt Li Qingshan's breakthrough, there was nothing more to be said...</p><p></p><p>Two words.</p><p></p><p>Shoot you!</p><p></p><p>The third eye on Li Che's brow suddenly emitted a brilliant light, and the seven divine foundations on his back manifested. The seven divine natures surged like seven raging rivers, pouring into the Immortal Rifle created by the [Painting Immortal] technique. The Dragon Fang Bodhi bullets roared furiously, like an enraged dragon emerging from the river, and they shot out ferociously.</p><p></p><p>The roar echoed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But the Dragon Fang Bodhi bullets silently transformed into a black line and pierced through the air.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Hongdou!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie extinguished the flames on his body, seething with rage!</p><p></p><p>Venomous hatred, fury, and murderous intent surged from him, and he was forced to unleash his true anger.</p><p></p><p>His attacks became increasingly ruthless, without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou... you've gone too far! No, it was Li Qingshan and Zhu Hongdou who have gone too far. Li Qingshan killed his son, and Zhu Hongdou bullied him in his old age! How could Shangguan Jie swallow this?</p><p></p><p>Sizzle—</p><p></p><p>Countless arcs of lightning burst forth, and Shangguan Jie's blood and qi erupted, intertwining with numerous blood-colored thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly shot out into the air, like a bolt of lightning, at the ultimate speed.</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan family's ultimate technique, the Azure Thunder Body!</p><p></p><p>The divine natures erupted, and the Seven Extreme Terrifying Deific Slaughter Spirits appeared behind Shangguan Jie! A deity that exuded a sense of fear and disrupted the mind. Zhu Hongdou's eyes turned scarlet, and her long spear trembled, brimming with battle intent.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes suddenly widened in surprise.</p><p></p><p>For Shangguan Jie, who had unleashed the Azure Thunder Body and exuded a sense of oppression, was suddenly struck by an invisible arrow.</p><p></p><p>He flew erratically in the air.</p><p></p><p>A dense blood mist burst from his chest! Pu—</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie roared, his eyes revealing a look of terror.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Hongdou, you vicious and despicable woman!"</p><p></p><p>"You are a peak elder of the Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"You ambushed me!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie was bleeding, and in his roar, he slammed a palm onto the blood-misted area of his chest, trying to control the terrifying divine nature and blood that had erupted within him.</p><p></p><p>However, his body suddenly grew cold.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Thunder Body shattered countless raindrops in the night sky and shot forward.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment he stabilized his form, another Dragon Fang Bodhi bullet silently shot towards his Nirvana Palace.</p><p></p><p>The true form of the divine spirit completely enveloped the surroundings, forming an impenetrable defense!</p><p></p><p>But how could Zhu Hongdou give up this opportunity?</p><p></p><p>Clenching her five fingers, the true form of the Crimson Emperor Flame Deity suddenly pierced through Shangguan Jie's divine spirit with a crimson flame spear!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie continued to bleed in the air, filled with shock, anger, and fear! "Ma Mian—!"</p><p></p><p>It was Ma Mian! The treacherous and vicious archer who had killed his son, Shangguan Zhenghen! The despicable dog hiding in the shadows and shooting sneak attacks! As soon as Zhu Hongdou had pierced through Shangguan Jie's divine spirit, the Dragon Fang Bodhi bullet silently shot towards him...</p><p></p><p>The terrifying penetrating power of the high-speed rotation directly pierced through Shangguan Jie's other chest. Zhu Hongdou trembled with excitement, and the flames on her body continued to flicker.</p><p></p><p>It felt so good! Like having an assistant...</p><p></p><p>It felt so good!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie was a divine spirit realm cultivator, and although Zhu Hongdou had only formed a sixth-tier divine spirit, they were evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>But now, the balance had been broken!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie, severely injured, felt uneasy and roared continuously. He turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhu Hongdou had no intention of letting him escape. Enjoying the advantage, Zhu Hongdou showed no mercy, unleashing one deadly strike after another!</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>On the Zheng Lei Peak!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's hair stood on end as he burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>His arms spread wide, his muscular body covered in bulging veins and blood-red qi that twisted into three blood-qi serpent dragons!</p><p></p><p>Eight Serpent Coiling the River!</p><p></p><p>The three blood-qi serpent dragons wrapped around the Thunder Shock Golden Ape divine spirit carved from divine foundations, and they strained to pull it into the Nirvana Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the three seventh-tier Corpse Deity Sect emissaries, as well as the ancestral elders and sect masters of the other families, were all focused on whether Li Qingshan could withstand the pressure of the six divine spirits entering his inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Two blood-qi serpent dragons suddenly erupted from Li Qingshan's body!</p><p></p><p>Five blood-qi serpent dragons!</p><p></p><p>They wrapped around the divine spirits and in a single breath, violently pulled the six divine spirits into the Nirvana Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Li Qingshan's body was enveloped in a dense blood mist, but countless thunderbolts crackled around him, as if forging a true body of thunder!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha—"</p><p></p><p>"The divine spirits! I've succeeded, old master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Everyone...</p><p></p><p>Surprised, aren't you? Unexpected, isn't it?!</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence, then a chorus of curses and shouts erupted around them. "Damn it! Despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Serpent Realm? A master-level Eight Serpent Coiling the River?!"</p><p></p><p>"How cunning, hiding it so well!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators who had been closely monitoring Li Qingshan's breakthrough immediately began cursing angrily.</p><p></p><p>Some who had been hoping that Li Qingshan's physical body would not be able to withstand the pressure of the six divine spirits and would disintegrate were shocked and furious.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had hidden it too well! Cultivating a master-level Eight Serpent Coiling the River technique...</p><p></p><p>The success rate of integrating the six divine spirits was at least 70%! They had been tricked! The divine spirit auras erupted one by one, and they scattered in various directions like falling trees and scattering monkeys.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's body was wrapped in thunderbolts, and his pupils had flashes of lightning dancing within.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the Ram Horn Heavenly Hammer.</p><p></p><p>His speed suddenly increased!</p><p></p><p>Behind him, countless thunderbolts wove into a pair of lightning wings, and with a single flap, he shot through the sky like a thunderbolt!</p><p></p><p>It was as if an extra bolt of lightning had appeared in the heavens! When the thunderbolts dissipated, Li Qingshan, his body coiled with five blood-qi serpent dragons, soared through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Ram Horn Heavenly Hammer, he appeared behind the bleeding Shangguan Jie, who was being attacked by Ma Mian and Zhu Hongdou.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie's face was ashen, and his eyes had lost the will to live.</p><p></p><p>"Why...?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is it me again?!"</p><p></p><p>Boom—! A hammer strike fell! Shangguan Jie's divine spirit was shattered, and then his head was blown apart by the hammer blow...</p><p></p><p>Exploding into pieces!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thick death qi swirled.</p><p></p><p>The three seventh-tier Corpse Deity Sect emissaries, their eyes behind their masks suddenly changing.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a trap!"</p><p></p><p>When they saw Li Qingshan suddenly erupt with five blood-qi serpent dragons, they realized it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Too late to stop Li Qingshan! That Li Qingshan, who had secretly and suddenly unleashed the Fifth Serpent power, exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>It was supposed to be a desperate life-or-death breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan had turned it into a sneaky and underhanded affair!</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo smiled.</p><p></p><p>What a Li Qingshan, he even managed to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>However, it was understandable, as Li Qingshan had previously shown him no trust whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>The two-stringed instrument hanging on Jingzheng's waist softly emitted a melody, not finding it unusual.</p><p></p><p>Because, he had given birth to an Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>He could naturally sense Li Qingshan's hidden abilities.</p><p></p><p>Having an Primordial Spirit or not, it was a difference in state...</p><p></p><p>"Jingzheng, time to cast the net!"</p><p></p><p>"Swallow these three seventh-tier Corpse Deity Sect emissaries, and the Corpse Deity Sect's arrangements in the Golden Light Prefecture will completely collapse."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said.</p><p></p><p>Jingzheng smiled, and the originally thin and frail body under his plain clothes suddenly swelled, the aged white beard instantly bulging with muscles!</p><p></p><p>His brow trembled! The powerful Primordial Spirit power swept through the night sky, as if freezing everything in place!</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying positional pressure made the three seventh-tier Corpse Deity Sect emissaries turn pale, their movements becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they unleashed a torrential death qi.</p><p></p><p>Bronze-colored flesh bodies erupted with a silver halo!

        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night grew increasingly dark.</p><p></p><p>The rain pattered on the straw hat, splashing up a hazy mist, and the powerful aura of the confronting warriors seemed to have cooled down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was fierce, as if all the accumulated ferocity of two lifetimes had been unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head up, looking at the dark sky, and the transparent raindrops fell, instantly misting up the ox-mask and blurring his vision.</p><p></p><p>The environment was very harsh, but... for Li Che, it was the perfect timing and location.</p><p></p><p>The icy cold rain was the best for sapping one's blood and energy.</p><p>The pitch-black night was the best for concealing one's figure.</p><p>Combining the two, it was the most suitable moment to suppress one's aura and launch a stealthy attack.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>In the rainy night, the three masked Lingying Sect's blood-refining experts roared and instantly struck! The exploding blood energy rumbled and shook the air! Turning into three blood-red figures, they burst through the misty rain, heavily stomping the ground in a surrounding formation, swift as three bolts of lightning, charging towards the burly Ox Demon! The nine major tendons on the Ox Demon's back trembled, unleashing an overwhelming force, as he abruptly took a heavy step back, the powerful momentum blasting up a transparent water wall over ten feet high!</p><p></p><p>And his bulging back slammed heavily into the brick wall behind him!</p><p></p><p>The wall instantly collapsed, with billowing clouds of dust and debris mixed with the rain, creating a chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>The three arrived in an instant, but they had lost their target.</p><p></p><p>The three Lingying Sect experts, their eyes narrowed behind the masks, exchanged glances... in their perception, they could no longer sense the Ox Demon's blood energy!</p><p></p><p>"He's gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible... As blood-refining warriors, their blood energy is as brilliant as a fire in the night, how could it have disappeared and vanished?"</p><p></p><p>"Find him!"</p><p></p><p>Being experienced blood-refining warriors, the three immediately made a joint decision.</p><p></p><p>Originally gathered together, they scattered, leaping over the high wall, wanting to use the open space to search for the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Such a massive figure, even in the rainy night, should not be able to hide completely! However, after climbing up the wall, their focused gazes swept the area, but they still could not locate the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>The towering Ox Demon's figure had seemingly melted into the rain, vanishing without a trace!</p><p></p><p>"Damn, he's really troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>"Not there?!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful blood energy surged around, dispersing the rain and suppressing the dust, but there was still no trace, only the shattered bricks and stones on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Where... did he go?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan's eyesight was exceptional, and even though the rain was pouring heavily, obscuring the vision, he still caught the moment when the high wall was smashed, with countless bricks and stones falling to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>A figure like a ghost had silently darted out.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the ostentatious blood energy of the blood-refining level had been completely concealed within his body!</p><p></p><p>From bursting and flaunting to discreet and low-key, all within a single breath! What a bizarre technique? Warriors could not possibly have such a skill, even the most refined concealment martial arts could not achieve such effortless control!</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan's scalp tingled, filled with doubt and vigilance, his heart pounding in his ears, even drowning out the sound of the raging rain.</p><p></p><p>"He's come for me!"</p><p></p><p>"His target... is me!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan narrowed his eyes, but he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable...</p><p></p><p>A master archer lurking in the shadows was an immense threat to any warrior, making it impossible to fight at ease.</p><p></p><p>So, the common wisdom in battle was to eliminate the archer first.</p><p></p><p>"But... how dare you?!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan couldn't help but sneer coldly, as his blood energy surged into his eyes, unleashing a powerful eye technique. Even in the torrential rain, his vision was as clear as day, taking in everything.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Ox Demon, sticking close to the wall, swiftly fleeing while suppressing his power, only slightly splashing the water.</p><p></p><p>"There he is!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan let out a fierce roar, instantly shattering the tranquility of the rainy night. In the distance, the three Lingying Sect blood-refining experts immediately reacted, turning their heads to look.</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan's eyes were filled with murderous intent, since Simo Bai had ordered him to kill the Ox Demon, he would give it his all! His five fingers gripped like hooks, the steel feathered arrow instantly turned, the great steel bow creaking as it was fully drawn, the bowstring trembling, in a flash of lightning, the arrow was released like a shooting star!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sound of the bowstring snapping back echoed like a thunderclap on the flat ground!</p><p></p><p>But the arrow flew without a sound! </p><p></p><p>The air rippled with shallow waves, silently and invisibly cutting through the falling raindrops! Even the arrow's trajectory did not deviate in the slightest due to the rain's obstruction!</p><p></p><p>This shot displayed archery skills of the highest level, perfect in both timing and angle!</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head up indifferently, his cold, emotionless eyes behind the straw hat.</p><p></p><p>This shot was indeed perfect...</p><p></p><p>But not perfect enough.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che ran, his sleeves billowed, and he simultaneously flung out, instantly unleashing bolts from hidden crossbows with a "humming" sound, firing in succession!</p><p></p><p>Sleeve crossbows!</p><p>Thrown sniping!</p><p></p><p>The wooden bolts fired from the running crossbows collided with the blood-refining expert's perfectly released arrow, causing its trajectory to shift! The wooden bolts exploded into splinters flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che just kept running, not caring about the incoming arrows, letting them slam into the high wall above him, blasting out massive craters like cannon fire!</p><p></p><p>With his Immortal Dao Fruit reaching Level 3, Li Che's mastery and control of the sleeve crossbows had reached an extremely high level, reaching the grandmaster tier in terms of martial arts proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No, it's just one step away from the boundary..." "Crossbow?" </p><p></p><p>In the distance, standing on the rooftop, Guo Zhan, who had his gaze locked onto the position of the Ox Demon, narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Crossbow... a mere plaything without the essence of archery!"</p><p></p><p>As a divine archer, Guo Zhan had arduously cultivated the art of archery for nearly three decades, being deeply devoted to the bow. Compared to the crossbow, which lacked the essence of archery, he felt utterly disdainful.</p><p></p><p>His five fingers curled like hooks as he reached into his quiver, drawing out three feathered arrows. Tilting his chin up, the rainwater dripped down his jaw. The bow was drawn to its full crescent, and the three arrows were released in unison! This time, they did not fly silently, but rather, the three arrows pierced the air, shattering the raindrops and leaving a long, whistling sound in their wake!</p><p></p><p>However, under the dark high walls, the Ox Demon merely continued to expressionlessly unleash a barrage of wooden crossbow bolts, one after another, with a howling sound.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! The three arrows were once again spent!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>His archery, which he took pride in, was actually suppressed by the crossbow!</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan's eyes suddenly narrowed, unaware that during the exchange of fire, the Ox Demon had already closed the distance, now less than ten zhang away from him.</p><p></p><p>Ten zhang... not too far, not too close, but for a blood-cultivated warrior, a single full-power burst could quickly close the gap. For the physically weak archer, being approached to within ten zhang by the enemy... was extremely dangerous! Boom! His foot stomped heavily on the ground, and the rippling waves of his blood-cultivated qi spread outward. He began leaping between the rooftops, continuously firing arrows as he did so. However, soon...</p><p></p><p>His heart raced as he reached for his quiver, only to find it empty!</p><p></p><p>His bow... had no more arrows!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had obviously noticed this as well, and its speed suddenly increased, its powerful blood qi unleashed without restraint. At the peak of its explosion, it flung its sleeve, and a barrage of wooden crossbow bolts was unleashed in a chain reaction, kicking up a dense spray of raindrops!</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan gritted his teeth, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. No longer retreating, he remembered that even though he had run out of arrows, he was still a blood-cultivated warrior! Although his close-quarters combat was not as strong as other blood-cultivated warriors.</p><p></p><p>He drew a shining long sword from his waist, his blood qi flowing into it, and charged towards the Ox Demon instead of retreating! As long as he could hold the Ox Demon in place, the three blood-cultivated experts from the Spirit Infant Sect would arrive to join the fight! Together, they would ensure the Ox Demon's demise!</p><p></p><p>Li Che, watching Guo Zhan charge back, did not seem surprised.</p><p></p><p>He did not activate the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao fruit. Instead, the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit in his chest cavity hummed and pulsed, as if an invisible five fingers had clenched it tightly! He stomped his foot heavily on the ground, shattering the blue bricks, and a fan-shaped curtain of water splashed forward.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's left and right hands each manifested a mechanism!</p><p></p><p>In his left hand, the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus! In his right hand... the Wood Raven!</p><p></p><p>Li Che abruptly pressed the mechanism in the Wood Raven's eye area, causing the internal flint to violently collide and spark a fire, which then ignited the internal fuse!</p><p></p><p>The Wood Raven seemed to instantly light up its eyes, with golden flames flickering in its carved eye sockets! Instantly, a powerful propulsive force erupted.</p><p></p><p>A sound like the tearing of heaven and earth, akin to the roar of a rocket launch...</p><p></p><p>"Beep—"</p><p></p><p>The Wood Raven, like a reckless charging bird, shot towards the charging Guo Zhan at an extreme impact speed.</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan was highly alert, but he had never seen this wooden bird before.</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast, he couldn't evade it!</p><p></p><p>The reflexes of a blood-cultivated warrior made him instinctively draw a sword to slash the bird.</p><p></p><p>In the moment he slashed the exploding bird...</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming sense of crisis suddenly surged in his heart!</p><p></p><p>Yet, as the wooden bird shattered, the terrifying explosive force and impact, as if long suppressed, were suddenly unleashed!</p><p></p><p>It engulfed him in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"Boom—!!!"</p><p></p><p>Brilliant flames, billowing smoke, and the concussive waves that shattered the raindrops radiated outward, rampaging in all directions...</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the three blood-cultivated experts from the Spirit Infant Sect, who had been rushing forward, abruptly halted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in place, his left hand holding the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus mechanism, calmly watching the unsurprising scene unfold...</p><p></p><p>Behind the Ox Demon mask covering his face, his eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>"Playing with arrows..."</p><p></p><p>"How can that be as fun as playing with explosives?"</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It's still not enough.</p><p></p><p>His body swayed, instantly shattering the wind and rain, charging towards the bloodied and half-dead Guo Zhan, who was howling in pain.</p><p></p><p>His left hand suddenly flung out the Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus.</p><p></p><p>The Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus exploded in the air, and as it spun at high speed, countless wooden needles, laced with deadly poison and resembling ox hair, poured down from the rain, converging towards the wounded and defenseless Guo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan, covered in blood, a bit dazed from the explosion, swung his sword, shattering many of the wooden needles. But with a single gap, a few still managed to pierce his bloodied and exposed flesh.</p><p></p><p>Instantly...</p><p></p><p>A numb sensation spread through his blood, permeating his entire body!</p><p></p><p>"Concealed weapons... and they're poisoned too!"</p><p></p><p>"At least the Ox Demon is venomous!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this... all you're capable of, so-called hero?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Zhan felt a chill throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the heavens and earth, a silver thread was pulled taut, wrapping around and embedding itself in Guo Zhan's neck. The towering figure of the Ox Demon now stood behind the poisoned Guo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>"I am but a demon who seeks to indulge, not a hero," Li Che said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his two hands yanked apart!</p><p></p><p>The thousand spider threads suddenly tightened! Behind him...</p><p></p><p>A massive head burst forth, spraying a blood geyser several zhang high!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The already deep night seemed to become even more dense, with a series of black vortices swirling like thick smoke, hovering around the deep pit.</p><p></p><p>In front of each black vortex stood figures dressed in white robes, wearing white masks with a blood-red "eight" character written on them. They were the Eight Extreme Corpse Deity Envoys of the Corpse Deity Sect!</p><p></p><p>There were a total of six of them! A terrifying and oppressive aura permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master?!"</p><p></p><p>"It couldn't be the Grand Master..."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, one of the Corpse Deity Envoys spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master is not interested in the Bizarre Temple, they are a group of lunatics pursuing the limits of the physical body, breaking through the void, aiming to join the ranks of the immortals..."</p><p></p><p>"The only valuable thing in the Golden Light Prefecture City is that Four-Guardian-level Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince Bizarre Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible to attract the Grand Master here."</p><p></p><p>Several Corpse Deity Envoys spoke in succession.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"This terrifying power, the lingering spiritual energy, and the awe-inspiring aura hidden within..."</p><p></p><p>"It really resembles the Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>One Corpse Deity Envoy squatted down and broke off a piece of the melted and re-solidified rock crystal.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the air violently rippled, and a black dot appeared out of thin air, slowly growing larger and more turbulent.</p><p></p><p>Like a black ink dragon dancing in the void, it formed a huge black smoke vortex three meters in diameter.</p><p></p><p>From the vortex, a figure stepped out, and the powerful pressure of its realm instantly swept over, suppressing the Eight Extreme Corpse Deity Envoys.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Envoy!"</p><p></p><p>This was a terrifying existence wearing a white robe, with a blood-red "seven" character written on the mask - the Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy! Each Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy was a powerful Primal Realm expert, having attained the perfected Curse Bronze Corpse and a strand of Silver Qi, just one step away from the Curse Silver Corpse!</p><p></p><p>"Was it Xu Jiuqing who died?"</p><p></p><p>"Useless..."</p><p></p><p>"Embedded in the Golden Light Branch Sect for so long, fed so many resources to cultivate the Curse Bronze Corpse, and yet he died just before the crucial 'Temple God Resonance'."</p><p></p><p>"Was that Seven Element Mother-Child Corpse Curse Seal recovered?"</p><p></p><p>The cold and oppressive pressure of the realm overwhelmed the Eight Extreme Corpse Deity Envoys, who dared not speak much. Within the Corpse Deity Sect, the pressure of realm was even more terrifying, as they all cultivated Corpse Cursing techniques, and the pressure of a Curse Bronze Corpse over a Curse Iron Corpse was over ten times that of a divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing's soul essence attached to the Curse Seal arrived here, and he encountered, along with Huang Shiyi, a suspected Grand Master expert... both were killed."</p><p></p><p>An Eight Extreme Corpse Deity Envoy reported in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy's icy gaze fell upon the mud-like Huang Shiyi, not hiding his disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Trash!"</p><p></p><p>"All the Grand Masters of the Great Jing Dynasty are under the surveillance of our sect's informants... there is no Grand Master in the Golden Light Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"And you think that level is the Grand Master? Absolute fake."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy ordered coldly, "Find the culprit! The Temple God Resonance is about to begin... now that the Golden Light Prefecture has gathered many powerful experts, including some from the Dao City, keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>"Investigate in secret."</p><p></p><p>"Also, there are many spirit children and divine children, find opportunities to infect them. Even if only one divine child joins our sect, it will be a huge gain for us!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy issued orders and dispatches.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, that Ox Demon who has been specifically hunting our sect's members... I just returned from the Flying Thunder City, Cao Guang's sacrificial city plan was disrupted, and that Ox Demon's traces were found there."</p><p></p><p>"This ox has ruined my plans... I will settle the score with him sooner or later, and have him slaughtered for beef!"</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of the white robe, a strand of Silver Qi instantly shot out and fell upon Huang Shiyi's mud-like corpse, causing it to instantly vaporize. The Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy then stepped into the black vortex and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The six Eight Extreme Corpse Deity Envoys respectfully bowed and also stepped into the black vortex one by one.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the cold winter, snowflakes fell like a melancholic rain, unable to cleanse the rivers and mountains, only adding to the twilight chill.</p><p></p><p>On the turbulent Jiulong River, a massive and majestic Bizarre Temple sat in the middle, causing the water to ripple with disturbance.</p><p></p><p>Around the Bizarre Temple, within a thousand-zhang range, stood a group of elite Garrison Commanders in black and red uniforms, their hands forming seals as powerful spiritual energies erupted from their bodies, weaving a grand celestial net to envelop the temple.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds came from the river, as if boiling water, and the Bizarre Temple itself seemed to be in constant turmoil, with a furious roar echoing from within, as if a figure trapped beneath was struggling to break free.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure in embroidered Qilin robes strode across the river, the Garrison Commander-in-Chief, Xie Jing.</p><p></p><p>With Xie Jing's arrival, the Garrison Commanders whose spiritual awareness had been disrupted quickly regained their composure and redoubled their sealing efforts.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing pressed his palm onto the turbulent river, and intricate spiritual writings instantly spread out like a master calligrapher's strokes, gradually calming the Bizarre Temple's agitation. However, the expanded range of the Bizarre Aura could no longer be compressed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's brow furrowed with concern.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of a two-stringed instrument, the erhu, rang out, and an elderly man in plain clothes, carrying a small bamboo stool, approached Xie Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Monitoring Director, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing looked at the Monitoring Director, who had arrived with the erhu music.</p><p></p><p>"Two possibilities... Someone may have accidentally awakened the Temple God by entering the Bizarre Temple."</p><p></p><p>"The second possibility..."</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director turned to look towards the direction of the Gold Light Sect's mountain gate, where the Gold Light Peak stood like a shining sword piercing the sky.</p><p></p><p>"On the Gold Light Peak... the Heavenly King is on the move."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Fallen Flower Alley of the Golden Light Prefecture, a black figure suddenly descended, shattering the snow that had accumulated in the courtyard. The intense power instantly slammed the snow against the walls, creating a muffled thud.</p><p></p><p>Scorching, sizzling heat dissipated the snow, forming a hazy mist that filled the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths, Li Che finally moved, removing his hat and mask. He sat down heavily, feeling the strain on his body.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I pushed myself too far. The Temple God's spiritual power was too high, even for my Furnace Patriarch physique. Absorbing only a third of the Temple God's essence pieces has already reached my limit."</p><p></p><p>Li Che examined the numerous knife wounds on his flesh, a result of the overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and began practicing the Dragon Elephant True Essence, his body emitting a roaring dragon-like aura as the wounds gradually healed.</p><p></p><p>After changing into a new set of black robes, Li Che returned to the inner room, where seven spirit paintings of himself sat in meditation, their spiritual energies merging.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered whether to create another spirit painting to continuously train the physical body in the courtyard, but ultimately decided against it, as the physical feedback would be limited compared to the spiritual benefits.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied with the day's gains, Li Che took a sip of water and began to assess his accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing had been completely destroyed, his soul scattered, finally avenging the threat to Xixing. Moreover, he had obtained the Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal's mother seal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual chess pieces, like soldiers wielding spears, surrounded and gradually consumed the potent corpse energy of the Corpse Curse Seal. This mother seal was far more powerful than the child seal, and its refinement would take considerable time, but once successful, Li Che's ability to detect Corpse Deity Sect experts would reach a new level.</p><p></p><p>"This Seven Element Corpse Curse mother-child seal... will undoubtedly be a valuable asset."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Gathered as one, their positions have likely reached the level of the Seven Primes..."</p><p></p><p>"After refining, will we be able to investigate the holder of the Six Corpse Curse Seal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought about this, but the holder of the Six Corpse Curse Seal... how powerful must that person be? He shook his head, Li Che did not dwell on this question, and instead felt the restless and angry Seven Prime Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly manipulated and brought over two dark golden Divine Essence Chess Pieces that were so heavy they almost made the chessboard lines sink down.</p><p></p><p>The Seal immediately quieted down and became obedient.</p><p></p><p>Like evil spirits, they trembled under the scolding of the left and right door gods.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and manipulated the Untainted Divine Essence, slowly refining and tempering it.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, Li Che's fingers tore open the air, revealing two Qian Kun Jade.</p><p></p><p>One was obtained by the close-combat expert Xu Jiuqing, and the other... was the treasure of the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy whom he had beaten into a muddy mess when he entered the Golden King Ox Demon state.</p><p></p><p>Harvests always bring about anticipation and a beautiful mood.</p><p></p><p>Activating the two Qian Kun Jades at the same time, Li Che's divine sense split in two, one on the left and one on the right, beginning the investigation.</p><p></p><p>The Qian Kun Jades of these two Deity Boundary experts...</p><p></p><p>Surely they wouldn't disappoint him, Li Che?</p><p></p><p>Li Che began to count the harvest.</p><p></p><p>"The divine essence crystals of the two... eight pieces of Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals! Twenty pieces of Nine Luminaries Divine Essence Crystals, one hundred and ten pieces of Ten Capitals Divine Essence Crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was delighted, as these divine essence crystals, similar to his Untainted Divine Essence, could quickly enhance the Untainted Divine Essence and increase the condensation speed of the Seven Emotions Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>They were the most practical things.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are no Seven Primes Divine Essence Crystals..." Li Che felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>But this was normal.</p><p></p><p>With four pieces of Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals recorded, Li Che was already very happy.</p><p></p><p>After the divine essence crystals came the divine weapons and elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers, and a sword weapon sheathed in its scabbard fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>His palm suddenly turned jade-colored, "Thousand Shard Hand... Analyze!"</p><p></p><p>【Divine Weapon (Seven Primes Superior Grade): Lü Xuanbing Yang Sword】</p><p>【Craftsmanship: Forged from thousand-year cold iron and red gold, infused with the Divine Essences of Shock and Wrath, tempered by raging flames a hundred times, simulating the sword of a Sword Immortal, can channel "Shock Divine Essence" and "Wrath Divine Essence", the sword emits ice and fire】</p><p>【Mastery: Shock Divine Essence, Wrath Divine Essence, Sword Dao Master, Illusion Realm and above】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A Seven Primes Divine Sword, forged to simulate the sword of a Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>"The sword of Immortal Lü?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flashed with a hint of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Was he one of the Eight Immortals? After pondering for a moment, he put the divine sword away.</p><p></p><p>Aside from this divine weapon, Xu Jiuqing's collection only had one or two Ten Capitals Divine Weapons, after all, he was a Hall Elder, although a spy, he still diligently fulfilled his duties.</p><p></p><p>He didn't seem to have engaged in much corruption and bribery.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the Seven Primes Inferior Grade divine weapon that Xu Jiuqing had handed over to Shangguan Qingliu to threaten Xixia...</p><p></p><p>Li Che became displeased.</p><p></p><p>His previous judgment was definitely too early.</p><p></p><p>As for that Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy, the Qian Kun Jade did not contain any Seven Primes Divine Weapons, only one Eight Extremes Inferior Grade divine weapon...</p><p></p><p>He was very poor.</p><p></p><p>Li Che kindly explained that he must have come in a hurry and didn't bring any Seven Primes Divine Weapons.</p><p></p><p>As for the elixirs, Li Che was quite delighted.</p><p></p><p>Raising his palm, a bottle containing a dense and boiling death qi, encased in black jade, appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"A Seven-Tier Inferior Grade Death Qi Condensed Martial Elixir!"</p><p></p><p>"This guy didn't exchange all his divine weapons for this elixir, did he?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered with surprise and delight.</p><p></p><p>With such dense death qi, this Seven-Tier elixir, even for him, if consumed, would have a tremendous tempering effect on the body.</p><p></p><p>For someone who had reached the Furnace Sect Master physique, this kind of elixir would be truly effective.</p><p></p><p>There was only one Seven-Tier elixir, six Eight-Tier Death Qi Martial Elixirs, and the rest were Nine-Tier Martial Elixirs, which were better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Jiuqing was a traitor who had cultivated the Copper Corpse Curse, so he didn't have a single proper martial elixir, only death qi martial elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could only accept them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After happily storing the elixirs, Li Che continued to inventory the techniques.</p><p></p><p>The techniques were more varied.</p><p></p><p>But the only ones that caught Li Che's eye were two. The ones that were worthy of his attention were now only two.</p><p></p><p>As a Gold Light Division Sect Deity Boundary Elder in charge of a peak, Xu Jiuqing possessed a supreme true meaning cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The Superior Grade true meaning cultivation technique "Lü Xuanxian Sword Classic"! Not weaker than the Superior Grade true meaning cultivation technique "Eight Crocodiles Overturning the River Skill" that Li Qingshan cultivated. Both were supreme true meaning cultivation techniques of the Deity Sect, superior grade, higher than the Shangguan family's Cyan Thunder Body.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between the Deity Sect and the aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>However, the supreme cultivation techniques possessed by the Zhen Temple and the Imperial Observatory should also be at the superior grade level.</p><p></p><p>Another supreme cultivation technique in hand, the Dragon Elephant True Essence would become even stronger! Li Che felt that his Dragon Elephant True Essence might need a new name...</p><p></p><p>"Integrating various supreme cultivation techniques into one, let's call it the 'Myriad Transformation Dragon Elephant'!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, after all, he was the creator of this supreme cultivation technique, so changing the name was up to him.</p><p></p><p>The second technique was from that Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>It was not a supreme cultivation technique, but a divine essence secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, looking at the scroll shrouded in a black death qi.</p><p></p><p>"Time-Space Corpse Art?"</p><p></p><p>A supreme divine essence secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Reaching minor accomplishment would allow one to transform into a black death qi mist and traverse space.</p><p></p><p>"Oh... so this is the untethered spatial traversal technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>That technique that had kept him waiting until the flowers wilted from Xu Jiuqing?</p><p></p><p>It wasn't worth a hair of his Flying Thunder Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, it required pre-marking coordinates, and then traversing to the designated location.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency difference between the two was like the gap between gigabit network speed and 10 megabit network speed.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not completely underestimate this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's trash-tier in terms of mobility, this Time-Space Corpse Art... involves time and space..."</p><p></p><p>"Reaching great accomplishment, not only would the death qi spatial traversal speed increase, but one could also... briefly condense time!"</p><p></p><p>"Time suspension? Although only for half a breath, less than a second, for experts in combat, this moment of time condensation could be extremely fatal, greatly affecting the rhythm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused, his heart couldn't help but become wary.</p><p></p><p>But along with the wariness... he was also somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Can I cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>"If I can cultivate it, can I... integrate it into the Dragon Fang Bodhi Bullet?"</p><p></p><p>"If I can make the target's time condense, while my own speed does not decrease, wouldn't that be an extremely bizarre variable-speed sniper bullet?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was deeply moved, and he began to study it intently, even if he couldn't cultivate it himself, he would research it and integrate it into his mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard was quiet, Xixia had just celebrated her birthday, some were cultivating, some were sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked out of the study, recalling the painting avatar division.</p><p></p><p>Then, after extinguishing the candle, he stretched, his entire body crackling.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the flow of light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 86%), Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv3, 70%), Untainted Heart (Lv3, 7%), Chess Saint (Lv3, 15%), Painting Immortal (Lv1, 5%)】</p><p></p><p>The summary of the Dao Fruits appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at it, his mood was good.</p><p></p><p>Excluding the Immortal Craftsman, the maturity of the other Dao Fruits had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit, because he had opened the Golden King Ox Demon Ascent state and killed Xu Jiuqing and an Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy, the increase was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>The Chess Saint Dao Fruit also improved a lot after absorbing the corpse's divine essence.</p><p></p><p>As for the Painting Immortal Dao Fruit, although he had just obtained it, Li Che's avatar divisions were very diligent.</p><p></p><p>Everything was thriving and steadily improving.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His blood and qi flushed through his body, and Li Che returned to the room.</p><p></p><p>What startled him was that the oil lamp in the inner room was still lit, and his wife Zhang Ya was sitting in front of the lamp, staring blankly at the flickering flames.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, Zhang Ya was waiting for his return.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhang Ya guessed that Li Che would go out and do something tonight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the grand commotion from the Flowing Sword Peak had also been sensed by Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>That was a Deity Boundary expert, so Zhang Ya naturally worried about her husband's safety.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che return, Zhang Ya hurriedly got up and rushed into Li Che's embrace, wrapping her arms around her husband's waist.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're safe, it's good that you've returned safely..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes softened, gently patting his wife's delicate shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>"I'm the pillar of this family, I won't let myself get into danger."</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted her tenderly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya raised her face buried in Li Che's embrace, her eyes revealing a crystalline luster: "But I'm still worried and frightened."</p><p></p><p>"You have to believe in your husband's might and strength," Li Che smiled: "For the sake of this family, I won't and can't let anything happen to myself..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, I still have you and Xixia to care for."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pursed her lips.</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed heartily, directly lifting his wife's long legs, and headed towards the inner room.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be silly, Xixia is sleeping with me tonight."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya flushed in panic.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, she won't hear a thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmly summoned the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, enveloping Xixia securely.</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife then began the development and consolidation of the Tempering Bone posture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was unable to get up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, refreshed and energetic, prepared breakfast for the whole family.</p><p></p><p>He first teleported to the courtyard in Falling Flower Alley, calmly entering the small restaurant, the sleepy black dog was yawning and waving its paws.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, what's for breakfast today?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered the small restaurant, asking.</p><p></p><p>A handsome young man walked out from the kitchen, glancing at Li Che: "Only buns."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take a hundred!" Li Che teased the big black dog at the door.</p><p></p><p>The young man's face darkened: "No, only thirty, no more."</p><p></p><p>"Then just thirty." </p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>The young man turned and went back into the kitchen, bringing out three steaming baskets, letting Li Che take them himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't hesitate, taking thirty buns and also buying a large jar of soy milk: "Boss, since I'm buying so many buns, can you give me the soy milk for free?"</p><p></p><p>"Scram."</p><p></p><p>Li Che chuckled, tossing a gold leaf, then kicked the big black dog at the door who wanted to snatch a bun, laughing as he left in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The young boss restaurant owner calmly collected the gold leaf, glancing at the disappearing figure, then grabbed a bun and fed it to the big black dog, petting its head as he did so.</p><p></p><p>Li Che brought back the breakfast, and everyone ate happily.</p><p></p><p>Xixia alone ate ten buns, her mouth dripping with oil: "Daddy, these meat buns are so delicious!"</p><p></p><p>"I want them again tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia held a big meat bun in each hand, excitedly exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, why is Mother still sleeping in?" Xixia asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Your mother overdid the Tempering Bone yesterday, let her rest well." Li Che said calmly.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen puffed on his pipe, pulling Li Che aside.</p><p></p><p>He tapped the ash out of his pipe, his cloudy gaze filled with a hint of hope.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che..."</p><p></p><p>"Do me a favor, I want to see some blood."</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Dao Fruit gave birth to the fourth form of divine ability! The [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit has finally been upgraded to LV3!</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the divinity of Shangguan Zhenghen, the maturity level was significantly increased from devouring a virtual form's divinity.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che felt the greatest improvement came from within the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>He extended his claws towards the statue of the Golden Heavenly King Temple.</p><p></p><p>The black-golden temple deity chess piece he absorbed directly allowed the [Chess Saint] chess piece, which had been stuck at LV2, to undergo a metamorphosis and reach LV3 level!</p><p></p><p>This is another divine ability embryo after the Thousand Slice Hand, Ascending the Tower, and Restraining the Deity. Li Che had always looked forward to the divine ability embryo of the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the divine ability embryo... is actually a strengthened version of the divine secret art, much more powerful in might, and born from the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Extremely extraordinary, which is why Li Che had always looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Chess Saint] pounded with excitement, its vibrating frequency exceeding previous times.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, and his spiritual awareness seemed to appear on the expanded heavenly earth chessboard of the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>[Divine Ability Embryo (Chess Saint · Great Avalanche): The chess is like a towering mountain, the momentum like the heavens collapsing, the divine of the Great Avalanche, the deities dare not witness it.]</p><p></p><p>The introduction appeared in flowing golden text, slowly flowing across his vision.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood calmed down, his eyes shining, his spiritual sense expanding.</p><p></p><p>He could find that under the expansion of his heavenly earth chessboard, his perception range had become wider, and... even if the perspective was pulled higher, he could see the scene clearly.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he could move the Thunderbolt chess pieces over a larger and wider range, more freely at will.</p><p></p><p>Not only that...</p><p></p><p>Li Che could even... vaguely obtain the perspective of others through the chess pieces placed on them.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, blue smoke swirled up, and a rippling scene was revealed as if a mirror had been washed.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, Xixia was being carried by Sanguan Yin, the two slowly walking down the mountain path, blowing in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the two were talking about, the image was there, but the sound could not be synchronized for now.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that when the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit's maturity level increased a little further, he should be able to transmit the sound as well.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and wiped it, and the scene changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya was diligently cultivating her martial arts under the oil lamp in the house, with beads of sweat the size of beans falling from her forehead.</p><p></p><p>To avoid dragging down her husband and daughter, Zhang Ya was also working hard to improve herself.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Li Che's lips, and he flicked his finger, and the scene immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, he sensed the effects of the divine ability embryo "Great Avalanche".</p><p></p><p>This effect, like the Ascending the Tower and Restraining the Deity at first, left him completely puzzled and clueless.</p><p></p><p>Even with the introductory text, Li Che looked at it as if he hadn't seen it at all.</p><p></p><p>But as the feedback came, Li Che gradually understood the meaning of the "Great Avalanche".</p><p></p><p>"I see... is this a manifestation of a force?"</p><p></p><p>"Like the Great Avalanche Deity, the ultimate suppression, more like an enhancement of the level of suppression!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this, there is the explosive release of the divine chess pieces...</p><p></p><p>Even, to be able to imbue the divine chess pieces... with the power of killing! In the room, Li Che sat quietly in meditation.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and two black chess pieces suddenly appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the divine chess pieces from the originally killed Fishing Gang Deputy Leader Liu Jinsheng, they were intertwined and suspended in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability Embryo, Chess Saint · Great Avalanche!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head back, and his black hair flew and danced wildly behind him.</p><p></p><p>And his pupils seemed to have changed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The white part of his eyes was covered with a black grid of intersecting lines, and the pitch-black pupils had turned into chess pieces placed on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the two black chess pieces in his palm suddenly merged and converged into one, the divinity contained within the chess pieces boiling like boiling water, bubbling and restless!</p><p></p><p>He flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>The chess piece instantly turned into a straight black line, shooting out and crashing into the ground of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion, the airflow surging and shooting, rolling smoke and dust, howling debris! The powerful shockwave spread out in ripples.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stacked his divine power to form a divine power wall in front of him, blocking all the flying debris.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually detonate the chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"And the power is extremely formidable! The divine chess pieces condensed from the divinity of the virtual form cultivator have the virtual form's suppressive power, and the explosive power after detonation is not weaker than a virtual form cultivator's attack."</p><p></p><p>"This is just two chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"What if there are more?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Che acted on it.</p><p></p><p>He raised his palm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he absorbed all the divine chess pieces from Liu Jinsheng's body, converging them in his palm, converging!</p><p></p><p>Countless chess pieces merged into a black chess piece the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>This is the accumulated divinity of a virtual form realm cultivator's lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The large black chess piece floated above Li Che's palm, its surface occasionally having restless protrusions, as if boiling water was rolling inside, containing terrifying destructive power.</p><p></p><p>If thrown out, it might be able to wipe out this small courtyard directly.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>Not just this small courtyard! Li Che had no idea how powerful the destructive power was.</p><p></p><p>After all, the accumulated power of a virtual form realm cultivator's lifetime, melted together and exploding...</p><p></p><p>How terrible would it be? And this is just the divine power of one virtual form cultivator gathered, if it were two, three... or even hundreds, thousands of virtual form cultivators' divine power... detonated at the same time!"Is this... the Great Avalanche?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a shocking mushroom cloud seemed to be slowly rising...</p><p></p><p>Shaking this idea out of his head, exhaling a breath, his expression became extremely solemn, the chessboard reflected in his eyes, but he felt that controlling this chess piece compressed to the extreme had become extremely difficult...</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers, and countless divine chess pieces automatically dispersed.</p><p></p><p>They turned into chess pieces floating around him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's black robe was blown up by the wind blowing through the sleeves.</p><p></p><p>In the dark night, the divine chess pieces suspended around him were glittering, but no matter how they flickered, they could not outshine the excitement in his shining pupils.</p><p></p><p>That dazzling and earth-shattering mushroom cloud seemed to be completely imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Spiritual Wood Raven can be upgraded again!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nan Liehuo sat cross-legged on a cushion, facing the temple deity, the three incense sticks in the incense burner emitting blue smoke.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo closed his eyes, his hair disheveled, his powerful spiritual awareness almost enveloping the palace and beyond.</p><p></p><p>"Since you two have come, please come in and sit down."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo spoke lightly, his voice gentle.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a faint laughter that resounded: "Sect Master Nan, this old man's bones won't go in, I'll just appreciate the scenery of Golden Peak outside."</p><p></p><p>That was the Astronomical Observatory Supervisor dressed in cloth, holding a two-stringed instrument and a small stool.</p><p></p><p>By the Supervisor's side was a figure dressed in black and red robes, extremely upright, with a sword at his waist, his eyes extremely sharp and domineering.</p><p></p><p>The moment he appeared, countless divine powers seemed to roar.</p><p></p><p>"The Astronomical Observatory Supervisor and the Garrison Temple Chief Supervisor, visiting Golden Peak at night... Golden Peak is truly flourishing."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo stood up, brushed off his clothes, and slowly walked out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory Supervisor, the Garrison Temple Chief Supervisor, and the Golden Peak Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>These three were the top powerhouses in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Each of them stomping their feet could make the capital city tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Has the disciple you recently accepted opened the Divine Abyss?" </p><p></p><p>The Garrison Temple Chief Supervisor Xie Jing's gaze fell on Nan Liehuo's body, speaking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Nan Liehuo's sleeves billowed in the wind, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What did she obtain from the Divine Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Chief Supervisor Xie Jing asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo tilted his head: "Supervisor Xie, is this something you should be asking?"</p><p></p><p>"What my disciple obtained from the Divine Abyss, do you in the Garrison Temple need to be explicitly told?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you in the Garrison Temple have the qualifications for that?"</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory and the Garrison Temple were both imperial powers.</p><p></p><p>But in the local area, the power of the Divine Sect was no weaker than the other two, so Nan Liehuo did not back down at all.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's palm rested on the hilt of the ancient and ordinary long sword at his waist, and instantly, on the mountaintop, the sword qi raged and roared, as if countless sword cultivators had instantly materialized, ready to draw their swords.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo suddenly rolled up his sleeves behind him, his hair flying, and his eyes also turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"You two, don't be so confrontational, let old me play a piece of two-stringed music to calm your tempers."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor smiled and shook his head, then sat on the small stool and started playing the two-stringed instrument.</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing and Nan Liehuo listened to the sound of the two-stringed instrument, and the anger in their hearts instantly subsided, their emotions becoming as calm as an ancient well.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the city, in the heart of the Nine Dragon River, the Eight-Armed Prison Lotus has been furious three times at the Prince of the Three Terrors' mysterious temple, and one of those times, the deity of the Prince of the Three Terrors' temple showed signs of awakening!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's voice was extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's eyes rippled, but his voice regained its warmth as he said, "What does that have to do with my disciple entering the Divine Abyss? They are nearly a hundred miles apart... How could what my disciple obtained in the Divine Abyss affect the Prince of the Three Terrors' temple?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's grip on the long sword tightened, the veins on his hand protruding: "My Garrison Temple's divine agents are on the front line of the Prince of the Three Terrors' temple's mysterious abyss..."</p><p></p><p>"As their Chief Supervisor, I naturally need to know the situation."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it concerns the lives of my Garrison Temple brothers."</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing's voice was extremely cold: "Nan Liehuo, I don't know what you're up to..."</p><p></p><p>"But if you dare to harm the lives of the eight hundred divine agents of my Garrison Temple guarding the mysterious abyss..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing raised his chin, the veins rolling and ferocious under the skin of his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xie Jing..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I quit this office, I will still kill you, Nan Liehuo!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's warm expression disappeared: "It's as if my Divine Sect disciples haven't gone to suppress the mysterious temple either..."</p><p></p><p>"If something happens to the mysterious temple, won't those Garrison Temple disciples of mine be spared?"</p><p></p><p>"Xie Jing... Can't you talk properly without dying?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing shook his head, as if saying he couldn't talk properly.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned and left, his divine power exploding like a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor also stopped playing the two-stringed instrument, chuckling: "You two are really something, every time you meet, you have to argue."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said warmly, "He's just jealous that I've taken in such a precious disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a precious one, a three-year-old prodigy, and can even open the Treasure Pagoda Divine Abyss... This time, what did she obtain in the Divine Abyss that caused the disturbance hundreds of miles away at the Prince of the Three Terrors' temple?" The Supervisor stroked his beard and asked.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo shook his head: "Just a fifth-rank divine divination art."</p><p></p><p>"Just that?" The Supervisor furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"That's what Xixia said, as for whether there were any other opportunities, I don't know. Oh yes, Xixia also brought out a butterfly from the Divine Abyss, is it possible that this butterfly caused the disturbance?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo thought of something and asked.</p><p></p><p>The well-read Supervisor was puzzled when he described the appearance of the butterfly.</p><p></p><p>"This old man has never heard of this divine beast butterfly, I'll have to go back and check the classics before saying anything."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor said, then picked up the two-stringed instrument and the small stool and left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The monitor paused before leaving, looking at the lonely Nanlihuo standing atop the mountain peak, his clothes billowing in the wind under the mountain's illumination.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Nan, no matter what grievances you have with the Patriarch... Now, the Corpse God Sect is approaching aggressively, posing a threat. It would be best if all the powers in the Imperial City unite together."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the mountains of corpses and seas of blood in the prefectures of Jizhou will be the fate of our Imperial City as well."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Nan, please consider the bigger picture."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo nodded gently.</p><p></p><p>The old monitor sighed deeply and drifted away.</p><p></p><p>The mountain wind was cold and desolate.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo rolled up his large sleeves, draping them behind him, the fabric clinging tightly to his emaciated frame.</p><p></p><p>"The bigger picture..."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo smiled gently, muttering to himself, then turned and re-entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged on a cushion, praying to the deities.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The heavenly-earthly chessboard expanded, enveloping an area with a radius of several miles centered on the small workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the Qiankun Jade belonging to Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>With the effortless tearing of the Qiankun Jade's barrier by Qianxi's hand, Li Che's mind directly probed into it, beginning to inventory the harvest.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu's words, this harvest was to be split evenly with Mianmian.</p><p></p><p>But Niu Mo and Mianmian were both Li Che, so he simply took the entire lot without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He first focused on the Divinity Crystals, the collection of a Patriarch, so they should not be low-grade.</p><p></p><p>One Divinity Crystal after another was extracted by Li Che from the Qiankun Jade, and Shangguan Zhenghen was indeed far wealthier than the Vice Sect Master of the Fishing Clan, Liu Jinsong.</p><p></p><p>Although both were Void Appearance Realm cultivators, their assets were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shangguan Zhenghen had the backing of the Shangguan Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Divinities Crystals amounted to fifty-two, and the Nine Luminaries Divinity Crystals were as many as fifteen! The only regret was that there were no Eight Extremes Divinity Crystals.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che felt a pang of disappointment, he had expected as much.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Eight Extremes Divinity Crystals were excellent cultivation resources, and if Shangguan Zhenghen had obtained them, he would have definitely refined and cultivated them.</p><p></p><p>However, this harvest was more than enough to allow Li Che to cultivate for a long time, even to forge the other three Divinity Foundations and cultivate them all to the Divinity Foundation Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were not many divine weapons, only two. According to Qianxi's analysis, one was an Eight Extremes divine weapon, and the other... had actually reached the Seven Element level!</p><p></p><p>A Seven Element divine weapon!</p><p></p><p>And it was a massive eighteen-foot long halberd!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>With a clench of his fingers, that Seven Element divine halberd was extracted from the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Instantly, a surge of roaring thunder snakes and countless howling air currents erupted...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Seven Element Superior Grade): Wyrm Bone Wind Thunder Halberd]</p><p>[Craftsmanship: Forged from thousand-year Mysterious Iron, combined with the bones of a Seven Element Demonic Wyrm, weighing three thousand jin, can channel multiple divinities, possessing wind and thunder anomalies, able to summon the Wyrm Spirit to assist in battle]</p><p>[Wielder: Blood Qi Master and above, Divinity Foundation Realm and above]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's dark hair flew, feeling the heft in his hands, his mood greatly elated.</p><p></p><p>With a "boom" sound, his physical body suddenly swelled up a notch.</p><p></p><p>Under the Vajra Transformation, his strength was formidable, and wielding this Wyrm Bone Wind Thunder Halberd was just right! Casually swinging it a few times, it stirred up howling winds and surging air currents, and Li Che was very satisfied as he stored it away in the Qiankun Space of the [Immaculate Heart] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Eight Extremes divine weapon, it was a Thought-Responsive Armor that could freely change size, with extremely strong defensive power, able to withstand an attack from a Patriarch without sustaining any damage.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen must have been wearing it as an everyday garment, but he had removed it when indulging in the Cloud Pavilion, resulting in being surrounded and killed by a Divine Sense Cultivator, a Void Appearance Cultivator, and a Sniper.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it was quite humiliating.</p><p></p><p>The number of medicinal pills was extremely abundant, making Li Che truly feel a sense of sudden wealth, as the cultivation of the Cursed Copper Corpse required a great demand for the Corpse God Myriad Ghost Solidifying Martial Pill.</p><p></p><p>After Qianxi's analysis, he found that this type of pill was not actually refined with human flesh and blood as imagined, but rather with various precious herbs, combined with the blood of demonic beasts, and the collected death qi to refine into a martial pill.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it was still a herbal martial pill, not an evil pill.</p><p></p><p>Pills refined with human flesh and blood would have extremely severe side effects, and the cost-effectiveness would be far inferior to pills refined with demonic beast blood and precious herbs.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Li Che could consume and refine them without worry.</p><p></p><p>"Nine bottles of Corpse Qi Solidifying Martial Pill, one of which is an Eight Extremes Martial Pill! Eight bottles of Superior Grade Corpse Qi Solidifying Martial Pill!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen had prepared so many pills... to firmly establish the foundation of the Cursed Copper Corpse!</p><p></p><p>Wow! Now it's all Li Che's to enjoy! Li Che smiled crookedly, everything now belonged to the Li family. His fingers tore open the air, storing all nine bottles of pills into the Qiankun Space.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if these pills would be enough for him to cultivate to the Blood Qi Master Realm?! Suppressing his excitement, Li Che continued to inventory the harvest.</p><p></p><p>In terms of Divinity Cultivation Methods, he finally found the Dread Divinity Cultivation he had been longing for.</p><p></p><p>And it was quite complete, from the Nourishing Nature, Divinity Foundation, all the way to the Void Appearance and Divine Sense Realms.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Seven Element Extreme Dread Seizing Divine Killing Divine Sense Cultivation', this is the foundation cultivation method of the Shangguan Family... A Seven Element Divine Sense Cultivation, which means the Shangguan Family's Patriarch has cultivated a Seven Element Divine Sense!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered as he flipped through this Divine Sense Cultivation, then stored it away.</p><p></p><p>Next were the Divinity Secrets and Martial Arts, which Li Che selectively perused.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze settled on a blue-colored booklet.</p><p></p><p>A True Meaning Absolute Skill!</p><p></p><p>The "Azure Thunder Body"! This was the Shangguan Family's True Meaning Absolute Skill!</p><p></p><p>Li Che could no longer suppress the smile on his lips, throwing his head back and laughing heartily.</p><p></p><p>A True Meaning Absolute Skill!</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, it was very important.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had passed on to him the Sect's Absolute Skill, the "Eight Wyrms Overturning the River Technique", which was a mid-grade Absolute Skill! Now that he had obtained the Shangguan Family's "Azure Thunder Body", the second Absolute Skill, perhaps it could have a penetrating influence and enhancement on the "Dragon Elephant True Strength" he had created.</p><p></p><p>"No... I should say it will be devoured. My Dragon Elephant True Strength will be able to fully integrate the true meanings of these Absolute Skills."</p><p></p><p>"That means, the Dragon Elephant True Strength I unleash may contain the true meaning of the Azure Thunder Body, as well as the Eight Wyrms Overturning the River Technique!"</p><p></p><p>"When I reach the Patriarch Realm, cultivating True Meaning Absolute Skills will be crucial... The stronger the true meaning, the more likely one can refine Divine Incantations, and only then will one be qualified to step into the Great Patriarch Realm..."</p><p></p><p>In the room, Li Che gripped the "Azure Thunder Body", his eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>He gradually organized his path forward.</p><p></p><p>He had already undergone the four transformations of the Divine Vein, and was close to the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The news that the Patriarch of the Five Great Families of the Imperial City, Shangguan Zhenghen, had been assassinated on the Nine Dragons River, swept through like a storm. Even after a month, it could not be calmed.</p><p></p><p>That was the Patriarch of a prominent family, of such an exalted status? And he was a Void Appearance Realm expert, yet he still met such a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shangguan Family tried to cover it up, the news of Shangguan Zhenghen's cultivation of the Cursed Copper Corpse and collusion with the Corpse God Sect still leaked out.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although many sighed in dismay, not many felt sympathy. The Corpse God Sect was associated with rebellion, and once one was tainted by it, they might be considered a rebel, so who dared to openly take a stance?</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu, Li Qingshan, and the mysterious Archer, in such a combination, had killed Shangguan Zhenghen, which made many major powers feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Many seemed to see a glimpse of the time when they had single-handedly attacked and killed many Corpse God Sect rebels from the Fishing Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, since the day Lin Xiu, Li Qingshan, and the mysterious Archer Mianmian had struck down Shangguan Zhenghen, they had not made a move again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a black outfit, sat quietly on a stone chair in the courtyard, sipping tea while facing old Chen, occasionally glancing towards the house.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, are you done yet?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been waiting for almost half an hour!</p><p></p><p>Today, they had planned to go to the Imperial Peak to see Xixie, and the couple had started preparing early.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya had been busy since yesterday, going to the market to buy a lot of ingredients, and had gotten up early this morning to cook dozens of dishes, packing them into lunchboxes.</p><p></p><p>She had even instructed Li Che to use his Blood Qi to keep the dishes warm.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, are you not going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Chen Dabao, who was puffing on a dry tobacco pipe.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen shook his head, "I can't go up the Imperial Peak... I'll just see Xixie when she comes down the mountain every half a year."</p><p></p><p>"I should stay in the city and find some work to do."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had learned to smoke the dry tobacco pipe together with the elder, and without Xixie around the Listening Flower Alley courtyard, Old Chen no longer had as many reservations.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when Xixie was at home, Old Chen basically did not smoke.</p><p></p><p>Smoking and drinking made Old Chen feel quite content, but it also made him feel a bit bored.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and couldn't help but say, "Do you need my help?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was now a Third-Grade Guest Official of the Heavenly Mandate Observatory, and had taken on many tasks, making quite a few connections, his gentle nature allowing him to have a good interpersonal network.</p><p></p><p>If he was willing, finding a job for Old Chen would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'm just looking around casually, getting by day by day. It's not easy living in the Imperial City, I can't just keep eating for free, can I?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen joked.</p><p></p><p>"You can eat me out of house and home, and I'll still think you're impressive."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen nodded, took another puff of the dry tobacco pipe, then stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've made an appointment with a friend in the city, I'll go check it out."</p><p></p><p>"I'm off then."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen grabbed the pipe, stepped out of the alley, waving his hand and humming a little tune as he left.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the inner room, Zhang Ya had finally finished dressing up.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, let's go, we mustn't keep Xixie waiting, I miss her so much."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pulled Li Che and hurried out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent, you were the one dragging your feet, and now you're the one rushing.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the day when the inner disciples challenge the true disciples once a month."</p><p></p><p>"Qin Huofire from the Qin Family, I heard he has broken through to the Tempering Bone Realm, and is loudly declaring that he wants to challenge Xixie..."</p><p></p><p>"Xixie's strongest point is her traps, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Xixie's cultivation this past month can withstand him..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya became anxious and started talking a lot.</p><p></p><p>"And that Qin Huofire even requested that Xixie not be allowed to use her traps, what kind of person is that? Simply bullying my Xixie! No sense of honor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his mouth, also feeling indignant on Xixie's behalf! That's right, why shouldn't she be allowed to use the traps she had mastered through her own efforts?!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was not at all worried about this challenge.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the upgraded Chess Saint Dao Fruit, he could observe Xixie's situation in real-time. Now that his daughter's strength had increased so much, he knew it very well. In just one month, Xixie's improvements...</p><p></p><p>She was practically the reincarnation of the Three Primes!</p><p></p><p>If she didn't kill someone, it would be a miracle!</p><p></p><p>50,000 words! It really wasn't easy, sitting in front of the computer writing all day, 1,200 words a day, my butt is numb. Unfortunately, I haven't reached the point of being recommended for publication yet, so please vote for monthly tickets, recommend tickets, and continue reading. Old Li will keep updating! Keep going!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

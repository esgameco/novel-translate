        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured, his heart couldn't help but stir a little. This was truly a rare opportunity. If he could find and kill Shi Mu-bai, who was obsessed with making Xixia his spirit child medium... it would put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the relationship between Li Che and Shi Mu-bai was irreconcilable.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che had the chance to get rid of Shi Mu-bai, he absolutely would not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"A divine cultivator... I've heard that only a profound martial artist can contend with them. Now that I've activated the second state of the [Dragon Elephant Vajra], I wonder if I can fight one?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps... a hundred black kites in succession bombardment could kill one?"</p><p></p><p>"However, the main thing about divine cultivators is their mysterious methods. The reason only profound martial artists can contend with them is because they have qi and blood permeating the six directions, with unwavering will, closing off the six consciousnesses, so they can remain unaffected by divine influences."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to kill Shi Mu-bai... was difficult.</p><p></p><p>This was the direct descendant of the Shi family, a prominent clan in Flying Thunder City. Even though he was currently severely injured, the security around him was top-notch.</p><p></p><p>And to kill Shi Mu-bai, he would have to infiltrate the Shi family's inner sanctum...</p><p></p><p>"It's too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that in the inner city, there is an elder Shi who has forged a divine foundation guarding the place... I fear I may not return if I go there."</p><p></p><p>He suppressed the stirring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A divine foundation cultivator... in his current state, he couldn't provoke them, for they were on a different level entirely!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not in a hurry. Xu You had said that Shi Mu-bai had nearly had his divine nature shattered, and it would take at least one or two years for him to recover.</p><p></p><p>During this time, as he continued to improve his own strength, he could look for opportunities to strike.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Che had mastered the blood replacement technique, if he could formally step into blood replacement...</p><p></p><p>His chances of success would be greater.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a night of commotion.</p><p></p><p>Xu's woodcarving shop had returned to its usual orderly routine.</p><p></p><p>The woodcarvers had started taking orders again, and the porters were bustling, moving wood materials and finished woodcarvings, earning their hard-earned wages.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, as usual, carved woodcarvings, practiced martial arts, and secretly researched the manufacture of high-difficulty mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Che also fulfilled his promise, leaving work a little earlier every day to return to the courtyard and teach Zhang Ya martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had returned. A trip to the great prison was nothing unusual for this old jianghu veteran, leaving no lingering psychological shadow.</p><p></p><p>Light snow was gently falling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went to the outer city shop, bought some braised beef, and brought back some old yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Old Chen sat in a rattan chair, watching the crooked and twisted Xixia practicing her horse stance, squinting his eyes and couldn't help but expose his yellow teeth in a grin.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Xixia, keep your waist straight, your arms straight, and your horse stance stable."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen uncovered the gourd lid and took a sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, wrapped in a red padded jacket, her small face flushed red from the cold, turned to look at Li Che who had just returned, and tattled, "Dad, Grandpa Chen called me 'little stinky Xixia'!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not 'little stinky Xixia', I'm Xixia, Li Nuan-xia!"</p><p></p><p>The little girl puffed out her cheeks as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>Full of lively spirit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed her head: "Then you just get stronger, and next time Grandpa Chen calls you 'little stinky Xixia', you can just beat him up."</p><p></p><p>Xixia heard this and her big eyes blinked, nodding repeatedly: "Dad is right!"</p><p></p><p>Then, Xixia puffed out her cheeks and focused even more on practicing her horse stance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat down next to Old Chen, the two of them drinking wine while watching Xixia practice.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder she's a top-grade spirit child, her spirituality is truly abundant... innate divine nature, and her talent for martial arts is also above average. If it weren't for her young age, she could have already succeeded in spirit refinement by the age of three."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, old Chen doesn't have the methods to cultivate divine nature, so I can't help little stinky Xixia advance her divine nature prematurely..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said regretfully, looking at Xixia's reddened small face with gentle eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This spirituality... is both a blessing and a curse. If you, boy, hadn't moved into the woodcarving shop early, this girl Xixia might have already been harmed by the spirit infant cult."</p><p></p><p>"Now, not only is the spirit infant cult eyeing her, but Shi Mu-bai is also keeping an eye on Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>"In such times... it's hard to live."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen suddenly gulped down a mouthful of wine, sighing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to live..."</p><p></p><p>"We parents... can only do our utmost to protect our daughter. Whoever wants to harm her, even if it means death... I'll bite off a piece of their flesh."</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up a piece of beef, chewing it slowly while speaking.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The two months passed by in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the rain in the alley.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain poured down, shrouding the world in a haze.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops pattered on the black tiles, making a dripping sound.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, Li Che slowly circulated his qi and blood. The roaring sound of rushing water was like the tide crashing against his refined sinews and bones!</p><p></p><p>"Circulating the qi and blood for the second time, entering the initial stage of blood replacement..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up from inside the house, his muscular upper body bare, emanating steaming heat. He clenched his fist and swung it forcefully, causing the air to let out a whooshing explosive sound. </p><p></p><p>The explosive power was far stronger than when he was tempering his bones!</p><p></p><p>"In two months, after stepping into the realm of blood replacement, my qi and blood has progressed from the first circulation to the second. Completing one blood replacement per month, reaching the full six circulations will only take half a year."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone with excitement, feeling a bit of regret that the blood replacement method he had obtained only went up to six circulations. </p><p></p><p>The middle-grade blood replacement method he cultivated was already complete at six blood circulations. The Guo Zhan he had killed before was a martial artist who had perfected the six-circulation blood replacement method.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain the superior nine-circulation blood replacement method, he would need to circulate his blood nine times. His blood would be like quicksilver, containing even more powerful energy. His strength, speed, and physical body would be refined to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I learned from Old Chen that even if the blood replacement method is perfected at six circulations, it can still be upgraded. Based on the existing six circulations, I can continue to cultivate the superior nine-circulation blood replacement method..."</p><p></p><p>"So, if I have the chance, I should try to get my hands on the superior blood replacement method."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched, his entire body of sinews and bones resonating, the nine major tendons on his back trembling with powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>After wiping the sweat from his training with a clean towel, Li Che put on his outer garments and sat down in a chair, taking out the "Compendium of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms".</p><p></p><p>Looking at the increasingly absurd and bizarre mechanisms recorded, Li Che couldn't help but feel at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"The twelve mechanisms recorded, with the 'Wood-Crossing Crow' being the eighth. Going further back, they become more and more absurd and bizarre, almost existing only in theoretical possibility... However, the seventh mechanism, the 'Bodhi Tears of Blood', is worth trying."</p><p></p><p>According to the introduction, the Bodhi Tears of Blood required extremely ingenious craftsmanship, was time-consuming and laborious, but its destructive power was truly strong! Ruthless and powerful!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very interested.</p><p></p><p>"The Compendium of the Tang Clan's Mechanisms... Old Chen must have obtained this classic text from somewhere."</p><p></p><p>If he didn't possess the 'Immortal Craftsman' dao fruit, Li Che wouldn't even be able to understand it.</p><p></p><p>After closing the book,</p><p>Li Che closed his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, prompts gradually appeared...</p>

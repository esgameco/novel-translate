            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain poured down, obscuring the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>The darkness was oppressive and suffocating, like the dead of night!</p><p></p><p>The winter clouds brought a more terrifying force than the summer rain, instilling a powerful sense of oppression over the entire Jin Guang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the heavens and earth were collapsing, the mountains and rivers shattering!</p><p></p><p>The Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The carriage raced swiftly, the wheels turning and splashing up water, continuously breaking through the accumulated water.</p><p></p><p>After winding through many turns in the city, the carriage finally arrived calmly back inside the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of that inconspicuous pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure wearing an iron mask slowly got off the carriage, holding an umbrella to shield himself from the torrential winter rain, the raindrops splattering on the umbrella and bursting into a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>He knocked on the door, and the door opened a crack, with a black-robed figure looking him up and down.</p><p></p><p>Then the door was opened, allowing him to enter the interior.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room.</p><p></p><p>The iron-masked figure strode quickly, circulating his qi and blood as he walked, evaporating the moisture on his body.</p><p></p><p>He arrived in the room, where the figure wearing the golden mask was handling some documents.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure stopped his movements, raising his head to stare at the iron-masked figure, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"You have a tail following you?"</p><p></p><p>The iron-masked figure was startled: "Why does the master say so?"</p><p></p><p>"My 'Cautious Inquiry Immortal' divine sense is trembling and pulsing... indicating that you have encountered a problem, or rather, you have brought back a great threat."</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure suddenly stood up from behind the desk.</p><p>His eyes became extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>"However... for my 'Cautious Inquiry Immortal' divine sense to be slightly trembling, it means that the strength of the one who has come is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure's large sleeves billowed behind him, emanating a powerful and distorted force.</p><p></p><p>"A small prefecture like this, with its business expanding, is truly troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"First, there was a failed mission, with two Nine Radiance Assassins dead, and now you have a tail following you..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really quite vexing!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure sighed.</p><p></p><p>The business expansion of the Hunting God Pavilion was something the headquarters had requirements for.</p><p></p><p>If this month's report was sent back to the headquarters, he was afraid he would be laughed at.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion had not just recently stationed in Jin Guang Prefecture, the Observation Pavilion was their operation, and the Pavilion Master of the Observation Pavilion was their person, cultivated for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Now, directly taking over the Observation Pavilion should have been a smooth transition.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked eyes narrowed, his head turning, his figure appearing outside the door.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind blew, the raindrops like bullets! The rain pattered on the golden mask, slowly sliding down.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the distant sky, where the fierce winds and swirling clouds seemed to have a great sun sinking into the sea, gradually sinking and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The air in the heavens and earth seemed to be rolling with scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"The extinguishing of the Martial Dao will, roaring in the heavens and earth with deep resentment..."</p><p></p><p>"A great master has perished."</p><p></p><p>"The only openly known great master in Jin Guang Prefecture is Xue Dufu!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>And the black-iron masked figure behind him was trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be? How could Xue Dufu...?"</p><p></p><p>"I just negotiated cooperation with him, and he was willing to continue assassinating Li Che and Zhang Yafuzi!"</p><p></p><p>The black-masked man exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>He had just left, and Xue Dufu, this great master... had already been killed in the city?</p><p></p><p>"The fact is that a great master has perished."</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure shook his head, believing in his own perception.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Guardians Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Rage of the Third Prince's Mysterious Temple... has not yet opened the temple god resonance, but a great master has already fallen... the chaos is gradually appearing."</p><p></p><p>"Great opportunities are ahead, and chaos is about to occur."</p><p></p><p>"This temple god resonance gathering may... far exceed past expectations!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure was unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Around the divine capitals and Dao cities, if the Four Guardians Mysterious Temple opened its mysterious hall, with the manifestation of opportunities, it would also be accompanied by brutal slaughter.</p><p></p><p>To compete for the opportunities of the Four Guardians, the fall of Immortal Cultivators was not an unusual occurrence.</p><p></p><p>"However, I must clarify that this has nothing to do with our Hunting God Pavilion, otherwise... Xue Dufu, as a great master under the command of the Goddess Demon Rites, although only a Spiritual Vortex Great Master, will still bring trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Don't let others pin the black pot on us."</p><p></p><p>The calm voice came from the golden-masked figure.</p><p></p><p>The black-iron masked figure cupped his fists, his body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure shook his head and turned to walk back to the desk, intending to continue completing the unfinished documents.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>His footsteps abruptly stopped, the moment his feet touched the wooden floor.</p><p></p><p>Like the powerful strike of a large drum, the sound waves spread out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure's eyes narrowed, the pupils under the mask shrinking.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense burst forth uncontrollably, swirling and raging.</p><p></p><p>Slowly turning around, he looked towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>A wooden sculpture was silently and quietly falling with the rain.</p><p></p><p>It was a seated Guanyin statue on a lotus pedestal.</p><p></p><p>With a benevolent expression and hand gestures.</p><p></p><p>Falling with the raindrops.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>His entire body's pores instantly stood on end, exuding scorching hot air.</p><p></p><p>A sense of terror that almost suffocated him erupted from the depths of his heart the moment he made eye contact with that wooden Guanyin statue!</p><p></p><p>What is this?! Why...</p><p></p><p>This seemingly ordinary wooden sculpture is giving him such a bone-chilling feeling!</p><p></p><p>As if it could burn mountains and boil the seas!</p><p></p><p>As if it could extinguish all life!</p><p></p><p>But it's just a wooden sculpture!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure's entire body was boiling with qi and blood, his divine sense raging, and a divine elixir core wrapped in overwhelming divine sense instantly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Countless divine energies, like boundless rays of light, burst forth from his back.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was almost instantly pressed down to the ground by the irresistible positional pressure of the Immortal Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fingers, and the air instantly congealed.</p><p></p><p>The Guanyin wooden sculpture, which was about to crash to the ground, was sealed and frozen in the air by his powerful divine cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops gathered into palms, trying to support this Guanyin wooden sculpture!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>It was heavy! Incomparably heavy! This Guanyin statue was as heavy as a collapsing mountain.</p><p></p><p>He... could not support this Guanyin! The palms formed by the gathered raindrops shattered like a broken mirror.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Guanyin statue crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the golden-masked figure's pupils...</p><p></p><p>The Guanyin statue began to swell, distort, undulate, and explode! Light! Dazzlingly brilliant light!</p><p>Erupted from within that Guanyin statue!</p><p></p><p>One divine chess piece after another, containing incomparable turbulence and clamor, colliding with each other, igniting dazzling light and heat! The terrifying power contained within...</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure felt his divine sense frozen.</p><p></p><p>"Flee—!!!"</p><p></p><p>A roar.</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked figure's toes slammed down hard.</p><p></p><p>His body had not yet launched.</p><p></p><p>The explosion...</p><p></p><p>had occurred!</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!!!</p><p></p><p>When the endless light, shockwaves, and scorching hot destructive energy waves, wrapped in the turbulent and boiling divine power, were unleashed! The deafening explosion sound was the one that slowly rose.</p><p></p><p>Like the thunderous collision of clouds in the sky, echoing on the earth! Endless light and heat, and the instant eruption! A huge ball of light, constantly expanding, the ground instantly shattered, under this seemingly slow but rapidly expanding ball of light, like paper.</p><p></p><p>Countless shattered stones flew up, and then were extinguished into dust by the terrible light and heat! The earth seemed to be struck by a meteor-like great hammer from the vast sky in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Swelling, then smoothing out, like the rising and falling of great waves! The ground became like a water surface, fragile and weak!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth overturned!</p><p></p><p>Burning the sky and boiling the seas!</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!!!</p><p></p><p>The ultimate brilliant flames raged out!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man could only manage to turn around, as if seeing a dazzlingly brilliant sun bursting in his field of vision!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A great master had died!</p><p></p><p>His unyielding Martial Dao will permeated the heavens and earth, causing many powerful figures in Jin Guang Prefecture to have their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Even the raging and roaring heavy rain that swept the sky and earth seemed unable to wash away the strong resentment left behind by the death of this Martial Dao great master.</p><p></p><p>This was a great master after all! The Martial Dao will was almost solidified into substance, crushing any martial artists below the great master level like towering mountains, making their qi and blood congeal and difficult to circulate! Achieving a pressure akin to the divine sense realm!</p><p></p><p>Yet, such a figure was killed! Murdered on the streets! Even... after being killed, he was only sensed by the world.</p><p></p><p>No one even witnessed the grand scene of a great master being murdered that would be etched into the history of Jin Guang Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The sound of breaking through the air resounded, amidst the ruins.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another flew over rapidly, their eyes extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Cultivator ancestors of the four great families, as well as many Pseudo-Immortal and Master-level figures, stood on the edge of the terrible crater.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the molten lava-like blood still corroding the ground in the deep pit.</p><p></p><p>Dumbfounded, eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>"A great master has really died."</p><p></p><p>Qin Dizun's gaze flickered, with a hint of shock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Who did it?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Family ancestor's expression was extremely solemn, with a trace of terror in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>To be able to kill a great master, they would likely be able to easily kill these Immortal Cultivators as well.</p><p></p><p>Qin Dizun walked into the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle—</p><p></p><p>The intense heat had not dissipated, the powerful Martial Dao will of the great master constantly evaporating!</p><p></p><p>He walked to a spot in the ruins and slowly squatted down, picking up an extremely scorching arrow shaft.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star Arrow..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme arrow technique of the Celestial Dragon Mountain's divine archer..."</p><p></p><p>Just by grasping the arrowhead, Qin Dizun felt the terrifying true qi and chaotic divine sense lingering on the arrow, like venomous snakes trying to burrow into his body.</p><p></p><p>His expression trembled repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Who? </p><p></p><p>Such malicious divine sense, such domineering true qi! But the most important point...</p><p></p><p>The one who killed the great master Xue Dufu was a Master! The true qi lingering on the arrow shaft proved this point!</p><p></p><p>"A Master killing a Great Master..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Dizun's face became solemn, his gaze flickering and flowing.</p><p></p><p>"Such a physique... such a flesh body..."</p><p></p><p>A Master killing a Great Master was not unheard of, it was easier than an Immortal Cultivator killing an Immortal Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Because the mutual suppression between martial artists was not as absolute as between divine sense realms.</p><p></p><p>But it was still an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>A Master... that must be a terrifying Master indeed, to be able to reverse the invulnerable flesh and blood of a Great Master and unleash such domineering spiritual vortices!</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know... but we should be able to guess, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you all still remember that battle between the Underworld Divine Ape and Xue Dufu the Great Master some time ago?"</p><p></p><p>Many experts exchanged glances and discussed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Several of the high-level figures still staring at the ruins on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Felt the earth begin to violently shake!</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain falling from the sky suddenly stopped! Everyone felt as if they were standing on a rocking boat, swaying.</p><p></p><p>Qin Dizun's hair stood on end as he quickly turned his head.</p><p></p><p>Several Immortal Cultivator ancestors rose up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>They saw...</p><p></p><p>The darkness under the black clouds...</p><p></p><p>Turning into a dazzling day! Light! Endless light, instantly erupting from an area of the prefecture!</p><p></p><p>All the light and sound in everyone's eyes were robbed by that brilliant sun-like light rising!</p><p></p><p>Only endless void and blankness remained! Destruction!</p><p></p><p>The intense aura of destruction exploded and dissipated in Jin Guang Prefecture! The earth cracked and the mountains collapsed!</p><p></p><p>Countless houses in the entire prefecture were shaking, as if struck by a natural disaster of a dragon turning over.</p><p></p><p>And this...</p><p></p><p>was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Prefectural Governor's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Patter, patter!</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain mixed with fierce winds, howling and wailing!</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain fell like sharp arrows from the sky, but they were all deflected by the figure sitting on a blood cloud, holding a long spear with a headless corpse on it.</p><p></p><p>That figure wearing the Divine Ape mask, his eyes flowing with golden flames.</p><p></p><p>The unrestrained laughter of "Haha, haha, haha" came from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The entire Prefectural Governor's Mansion seemed to have fallen into a deathly silence in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Prefectural Governor's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Prince Ye Haiwei was carefully cultivating his divine sense in the room, but he felt an unprecedented restlessness and annoyance.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, his dragon-god purple pupils flashing with light, like a mirror reflecting the flowing light.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow silently appeared, floating behind Ye Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Ye... something has happened."</p><p></p><p>"Xue Dufu... is dead."</p><p></p><p>The solemn words from the black shadow made Ye Haiwei's face turn deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"How... how could this be?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu had gone to seek a mission from the Hunting God Pavilion, how could he have died? From the Black Armor Shadow Guard's Immortal Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The True Man seemed to have merged into the darkness, his appearance indistinct.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the manor."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Monkey carried Xue Daofu's corpse..."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Divine Monkey killed Xue Daofu."</p><p></p><p>This Celestial True Man spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's body swayed, for he was indeed a great master, although only a newly ascended Grand Celestial Master.</p><p></p><p>But upon entering the realm of the Grand Celestial Masters, the difference was immense!</p><p></p><p>Refining one's martial will, their combat prowess became terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>Even on the battlefield, a Grand Celestial Master could single-handedly face off against a thousand elite troops!"This is a provocation," the Shadow Warrior True Man sighed.</p><p></p><p>The young prince must have offended someone he shouldn't have, but then again...</p><p></p><p>It was also possible that the prince had enemies?  The enemies of Pacifying King Ji Moli were scattered across the world, so it was not unheard of for them to vent their anger on Ji Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>"Young prince, this servant will go take a look." A faint voice came from the black shadow.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Armored Blood Guards will protect you, nothing will happen."</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei opened his mouth slightly.</p><p></p><p>A slight sense of oppression in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The death of Xue Daofu, a Grand Celestial Master, finally made him feel a tinge of fear.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Warrior True Man had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The door opened.</p><p></p><p>Six Black Armored Blood Guards entered in succession, guarding the young prince in the center.</p><p></p><p>They each gripped the long handles of the saber they carried on their backs.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The moment the door opened, a tremor shook the earth!</p><p></p><p>In his own room, the young prince Ji Haiwei saw a magnificent mushroom cloud slowly rising!  As dazzling as the most brilliant fireworks...</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the gates of the Prefectural Manor.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai, dressed in scholar's robes, with elite Divine Guard soldiers by his side, appeared before the Prefectural Manor gates, staring at the Divine Monkey perched atop a blood cloud.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey made a tossing motion.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's headless corpse was then flung high into the air, tracing an arc.</p><p></p><p>It crashed to the ground, splashing water over three feet high, the intense and stimulating scent of blood lingering. Su Huai's pupils constricted as he stared at Xue Daofu's fallen corpse, his chest heaving violently.</p><p></p><p>The elite Divine Guard soldiers also looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey chuckled lightly: "Let the young prince wait..."</p><p></p><p>"Come one by one."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Suddenly, an immensely powerful divine force, gathering the rainwater, wove into an enormous palm, ruthlessly striking down!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying divine force pressure seemed to freeze time and space.  Countless raindrops exploded into mist! However, </p><p></p><p>the Divine Monkey simply sat atop the blood-red clouds, instantly fleeing into the distance, ignoring the divine force pressure of the Celestial True Man.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Warrior True Man floated in the air, his entire body shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>His indifferent gaze passed through the myriad of anguished raindrops, looking at the rampaging Divine Monkey.</p><p></p><p>This Shadow Warrior True Man had a complex mood.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu was also his colleague...</p><p></p><p>Together they protected the young prince Ji Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>But now that Xue Daofu was dead, he also felt a sense of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Monkey... you said, come one by one."</p><p></p><p>"Does that include me?"</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial True Man?!"</p><p></p><p>A dazzlingly brilliant Celestial Elixir slowly rose from behind him, like the rising moon on the sea.</p><p></p><p>The golden light in the Divine Monkey's mask-covered eyes shone brightly, without a trace of fear, as he smiled: "Of course."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the Divine Monkey clenched his five fingers.  A faint laughter came from behind the mask.</p><p></p><p>"Bang--"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey's five fingers pressed against the side of the mask like a blooming flower, then spread open, mimicking an explosion sound from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Warrior True Man was startled, his eyes instantly narrowing.</p><p></p><p>But then, as the Divine Monkey's explosive-like action ended!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>And on the horizon...</p><p></p><p>A dazzlingly brilliant golden mushroom cloud rose.</p><p></p><p>Thundering from the ground!</p><p></p><p>What was that?!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! Shaking!</p><p></p><p>Destruction!</p><p></p><p>The darkness was dispersed, illuminated like broad daylight, a massive mushroom cloud slowly rising, soaring over a hundred meters high, then the scorching smoke sank.</p><p></p><p>The entire earth seemed to be shaken like a swaying carpet, countless blue stones shattered and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Undulating, violently undulating...</p><p></p><p>The land surged in waves! The entire earth suddenly sank, then the shockwaves spread out like a billowing cloud of dust in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying gales shot and surged, scorching heat spreading!</p><p></p><p>Sweeping up vast amounts of sand, dust, and rubble! Tens of meters, hundreds of meters, thousands of meters! The shockwaves formed concentric circles, whipping up white waves, enveloping dust and soil, spreading in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Countless buildings shook, the ones closest were instantly collapsed by the impact!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying explosion of a hundred and five divine chess pieces' worth of divine power! Truly horrifying! The entire Observation Pavilion seemed to collapse in an instant, countless towers and halls destroyed, countless houses reduced to ashes! The relentless shockwaves, tearing everything apart!  "Damn it--!!!!"</p><p></p><p>A roar of fury, yet unable to drown out the explosion in the slightest! The one with the golden mask, at the very center, chose to flee first, activating his Celestial Elixir to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine force was unleashed, forming a protective barrier around him, resisting the scorching and terrifying shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>But the divine power of the Avalokitesvara Lotus Bomb had not only destructive power, but also the corrosive and devastating radiation of its violent divine force! The golden mask's protective barrier only lasted for less than three breaths before it was covered in cracks and shattered, forcing him to flee rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He burst out of the hall, his burning clothes billowing, amid the spreading explosion flames.</p><p></p><p>Like a cannonball, he shot out forcefully, plunging into the Nine Dragon River, where the shockwaves had whipped up waves dozens of meters high.</p><p></p><p>Countless river waters surged and crashed, waves pounding the shores, stones piercing the void! The golden-masked figure emerged from the river, crouching on the surface, disheveled and wretched.</p><p></p><p>His golden mask had been melted away in many places.</p><p></p><p>Behind the mask,</p><p></p><p>his eyes stared blankly at the scene of destruction before him, flashing with golden light.</p><p></p><p>Even a Celestial True Man...</p><p></p><p>at this moment, felt a chill throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>"Almost on par with a Celestial True Man's full-force large-area divine force art..."</p><p></p><p>"Below the Celestial Realm... either death or severe injury."</p><p></p><p>His expression was grim.</p><p></p><p>The destructive power was too great.</p><p></p><p>And, caught off guard...</p><p></p><p>Even he, a Celestial True Man with immense divine power, could only withstand it for a moment before escaping.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Sect's foundations in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Seems to have been completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The Observation Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Gone!</p><p></p><p>Who?! Who was it?! Unrestrained fury swept over him, the Hunting God Sect's Sect Master wearing the golden mask had never imagined suffering such a heavy blow!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the golden-masked figure thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Among the many intelligence reports, he had heard of the mushroom cloud before.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time the mushroom cloud had bloomed.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>The golden-masked Hunting God Sect's Sect Master thought of a name.</p><p></p><p>Chilling, icy, murderous intent surging.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld's intimidation, huh?! The billowing smoke and dust had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The mushroom cloud, towering over a hundred meters, was still roiling!</p><p></p><p>Like a giant umbrella, wanting to expand and cover half the Golden Light Prefecture city!</p><p></p><p>Even dozens of miles away, one could still see this grand sight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mount Divine Hawk.</p><p></p><p>Faint tremors came.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in meditation on Mount Divine Hawk, Luo Luo suddenly sensed something.</p><p></p><p>As a Celestial True Man, with a Celestial Elixir condensed, his divine spirit had been greatly enhanced, his perception extremely keen.</p><p></p><p>The slightest tremor immediately put him on alert.</p><p></p><p>He shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, also bursting out from the Mount Divine Hawk was the Mechanism Master Tong Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, sharing an unspoken understanding and smiling.</p><p></p><p>Then they looked towards the direction of the Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>They saw a dazzling mushroom cloud blooming under the thick dark clouds, illuminated by the light!

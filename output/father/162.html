        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The messengers of the Temple Guardians' Office, upon hearing this, revealed expressions of surprise in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew of the Ox Demon and Horse-Face! But this was the first time they learned of the origins of the Ox Demon and Horse-Face!</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>The few of them exchanged glances, their eyes flashing with bewilderment. Their hearts couldn't help but be astonished - this force called the Underworld, how had they never heard of it before? Although it was obscure and unheard of, they dared not underestimate it.</p><p></p><p>For the names of the Ox Demon and Horse-Face were already renowned throughout the Golden Light Prefecture. Who would dare to underestimate them? Li Qingshan calmly looked at the messengers of the Temple Guardians' Office, his hands clasped behind his back, his feline-masked face with eyes shining dimly.</p><p></p><p>He had arrived late.</p><p></p><p>He had missed the hot action.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was not big, he still wanted to get a piece of the participation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had revealed the name of the Underworld after careful consideration. He had previously asked Li Che whether he should publicize the name of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had said to let it happen naturally.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan immediately understood - just let the natural publicity be.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this...</p><p></p><p>How natural was this?</p><p></p><p>Although the cat-faced Li Qingshan had not acted himself, by adding a name, wasn't it equivalent to saying that he, Li Qingshan, had participated in this rat extermination operation?</p><p></p><p>With a faint smile, the voice of the old cat-faced man gradually resounded throughout the heavens and earth, echoing near and far.</p><p></p><p>The divine messengers of the Temple Guardians' Office glanced around and found that the old cat-faced man had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The few of them frowned at each other, not pondering further what the Underworld was for a force.</p><p></p><p>Cautiously, they headed towards the interior of the Heart Monkey Temple to investigate the situation.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Heart Monkey Temple,</p><p></p><p>The three divine messengers had their hair standing on end. The dense smell of gunpowder permeated the air, along with the incessant surging of divine energies, extremely turbulent, making one feel nauseated.</p><p></p><p>Even if their cultivation was slightly weaker, their divine energies would be disrupted and end up harming themselves.</p><p></p><p>This was the divine radiation left behind by the explosive opening of the Avalokitesvara Lotus.</p><p></p><p>The entire Heart Monkey Temple had become a ruin, with most of the temples collapsed.</p><p></p><p>As the divine messengers explored further, their expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Cult!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Heart Monkey Temple, there were actually so many evil people of the Corpse Deity Cult! Many of them were not even from the Heart Monkey Temple, but had hidden inside, being driven out from the Golden Light Prefecture by the "Green Ox and Horse" duo, and had no choice but to take refuge in the stronghold of the Corpse Deity Cult.</p><p></p><p>Yet they never expected to be found by the Ox Demon and Horse-Face, and all wiped out in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>This matter was no simple thing.</p><p></p><p>The divine messengers quickened their movements, beginning to rapidly investigate the now half-ruined Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>They found one corpse after another, riddled with bullet holes.</p><p></p><p>"Cursed Bronze Corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the current Abbot of the Heart Monkey Temple, Abbot Xuanli! He was... pounded into a pulp."</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless! Truly worthy of the Ox Demon's hatred of evil!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The name of the Ox Demon was already well-known to the high-level experts of the Temple Guardians' Office.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they truly felt the Ox Demon's ruthlessness and hatred towards the Corpse Deity Cult.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, come and take a look quickly!"</p><p></p><p>A divine messenger ran over with an extremely grim expression.</p><p></p><p>The captain followed, drawing his saber, and the other divine messengers also followed.</p><p></p><p>They saw that courtyard.</p><p></p><p>They saw the densely piled corpses in the courtyard, and the withered monk blocking the courtyard gate, as well as the shattered Zhong Kui statue split in two.</p><p></p><p>They could almost imagine what had happened there.</p><p></p><p>The monk had fought to the bitter end, trying to prevent these evil souls from becoming vengeful ghosts, completely losing the chance to be reborn.</p><p></p><p>The divine messengers sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The evil people of the Corpse Deity Cult... truly deserved their fate!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon and Horse-Face... are true heroes!"</p><p></p><p>The captain sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, there's also a cat-face."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and heavy snow.</p><p></p><p>The flames of the Heart Monkey Temple gradually diminished.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a cow-face mask, stood on a large tree, wrapped in a black robe, his black clothes fluttering in the winter wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The pupils behind the mask reflected the gradually subsiding flames of the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Master Faxkong, it's not that Li Che didn't want to save him, but that he could no longer be saved.</p><p></p><p>The oil had run out, the lamp had burned out, consuming everything...</p><p></p><p>He was still alive, but only barely hanging on by a thread.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che killed Xuanli and broke the Thousand Soul Banner, a technique for nurturing ghosts, Master Faxkong's mind became empty, and he departed without regret, his life force already exhausted.</p><p></p><p>This was a master worthy of respect.</p><p></p><p>He used his own life to maintain the declining orthodox lineage of the Qitian Temple in its current glory.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heart Monkey Temple was one of the three inherited orthodox lineages of the Qitian Temple.</p><p></p><p>Master Faxkong had upheld the remaining face of the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gazed at it pensively, and the heavenly and earthly chessboard once again enveloped the area, with himself as the star position, expanding to encompass the entire Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>After ensuring that all the evil people of the Corpse Deity Cult had perished, he dispersed the heavenly and earthly chessboard, disappearing into the icy and snowy world like a gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>When his figure reappeared,</p><p></p><p>He had already returned to the small courtyard workshop in Luohua Alley in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Snow was falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the snowy curtain, and this time, he had truly exerted his full strength, successfully killing a Silver Radiant Cursed Bronze Corpse.</p><p></p><p>He had killed a Seven-Element Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a lower-ranked Seven-Element Corpse Deity Envoy, it also meant that in terms of combat power, Li Che had now reached the level of a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>If he did not open the Tower Ascension, and did not rely on the temple deity's divine energy chess pieces, he would have a chance of defeating a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Summarizing and reviewing this battle,</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart raced. This battle... was his most upright and straightforward one yet, except for the Barret sniper shot fired by Horse-Face.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the time, the Ox Demon, from the moment he acted to when he blew the opponent away, was basically a hard-hitting confrontation of pure strength!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very satisfied with this battle.</p><p></p><p>However, being satisfied is one thing, but he cannot be too complacent. He still needs to review the shortcomings of this battle and summarize the experience.</p><p></p><p>This battle was slightly more difficult than the one where he killed Wenlong.</p><p></p><p>Wenlong was not as strong as this Silver Radiant Cursed Bronze Corpse in the physical realm!</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (Lv3, 97%)]</p><p></p><p>This battle increased its maturity by 7%.</p><p></p><p>Not much, but not little either.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che had previously gained a huge boost in maturity from killing Wenlong, and this Silver Radiant Cursed Bronze Corpse was roughly on par with Wenlong in overall strength.</p><p></p><p>It should have only given him about a 5% increase, and the extra 2% came from clearing out the remaining Corpse Deity Cult evil people in the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Almost there."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up in a smile. He never intended to directly advance to the next stage in this wave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was only 3% of the maturity left to reach the next stage.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che really wanted to, he could use the divine energy transfer from the [Immaculate Heart] Dao Fruit to forcibly boost the maturity.</p><p></p><p>But not only would it require an enormous amount of Immaculate Heart divine energy to forcibly raise the Lv3 Dragon Elephant Vajra Dao Fruit's maturity.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's intuition also told him that if he could rely on his own battle accumulation to raise the maturity, he should not do anything to force it.</p><p></p><p>For now, Li Che did not choose to forcibly boost the advancement. He looked forward to the next battle.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged in the courtyard, and the powerful vital energy evaporated all the snow in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, the [Painting Immortal] clones were still diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was quiet.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in meditation, beginning to tally the gains from this expedition.</p><p></p><p>He had killed all the evil people who had joined the Corpse Deity Cult in the Heart Monkey Temple, sending a wooden crow to each one who had received the seal.</p><p></p><p>In total, he had harvested 97 divine chess pieces and 862 divine essence.</p><p></p><p>The potential of the Avalokitesvara Lotus he could create had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense tore open Xuanli's Qiankun Jade and began to count the spoils within.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Xuanli, as the new Abbot of the Heart Monkey Temple, was indeed not lacking in foundation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Seven-Element Corpse Deity Envoy that Li Che had ambushed and killed, Xuanli's harvest was much more abundant! Two Seven-Element Divine Essence Crystals, ten Eight-Extremes Divine Essence Crystals, and thirty-two Nine-Yang Divine Essence Crystals!</p><p></p><p>Too abundant!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was dazzled.</p><p></p><p>The main thing... was that there were two Seven-Element Divine Essence Crystals! Li Che guessed that the foundation of the Heart Monkey Temple must also have been collected by Xuanli, but with the addition of the Heart Monkey Temple's foundation, it was still understandable.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine weapons, there was nothing of a high level, which did not surprise Li Che, as it was a declining force, and high-level divine weapons could not be kept.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had now accumulated many Nine-Yang and Ten-Capital divine weapons. It would be a good opportunity to go to the black market and sell them, exchanging them for divine essence crystals, which would be the most substantial.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the divine technique manuals and the like were also the same logic.</p><p></p><p>Li Che flipped through the collection of Xuanli and the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>With a grab of his fingers, a book written on beast-skin paper fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>The book emanated an extremely dense aura of level.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster Martial Art "Chaotic Heavenly Cudgel"! Boom! Within the entire courtyard, Li Che's inner fire seemed to ignite, instantly evaporating all the slowly falling snowflakes in the sky, with hissing sounds and surging air currents!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, it gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were shining, like two burning flames! Whew-</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster Martial Art?"</p><p></p><p>There was even a hint of surprise in Li Che's voice.</p><p></p><p>Grandmaster, in the Qi and Blood Martial Dao, was the realm above Great Master. That was the true pinnacle of the Qi and Blood Martial Dao, worthy of being called a Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Qitian Temple?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up, but he quickly restrained his emotions, sensing something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Because if the Heart Monkey Temple truly had the inheritance of the Qitian Temple, it would not have been able to hold on!</p><p></p><p>This Grandmaster Martial Art must have some problem.</p><p></p><p>Li Che quietly and carefully flipped through the beast-skin book.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he closed the book.</p><p></p><p>"A flawed Grandmaster Martial Art..."</p><p></p><p>"Only one-third of it, a bit like the incomplete Heavenly Face of Qitian, both are only one-third."</p><p></p><p>This Grandmaster Martial Art was divided into three parts, and only a portion of it was extracted.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Heart Monkey Temple could still hold on.</p><p></p><p>Because this incomplete Grandmaster Martial Art was too difficult to cultivate, and there was even the risk of cultivating oneself to ruin! The martial art was of the highest rank, but after being incomplete, the entry was difficult, and the advancement was even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of entry was not just talk, in the hundreds of years that the Heart Monkey Temple had possessed this Heavenly Cudgel, the number of cultivators was countless, and even many prominent families in the Golden Light Prefecture had learned it.</p><p></p><p>But the true entrants were no more than five fingers, and they could only enter the door at most.</p><p></p><p>The rest could not even enter the door.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of entry was evident, and this was also the reason why this incomplete Grandmaster Martial Art could remain in the hands of the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>It was like a piece of latrine stone, both stinky and hard.</p><p></p><p>Although it bore the name of a Grandmaster Martial Art,</p><p></p><p>A martial art that no one could learn was no different from trash.</p><p></p><p>"Incomplete..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, it will all be integrated into my Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant. Whether it's incomplete or not, it's still good."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>His Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant could accommodate all martial arts, even if they were incomplete martial arts, they could still be integrated.</p><p></p><p>Difficult to enter? He, Li Che, had the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao Fruit, and even if it was difficult to enter, he could still force his way in! Li Che couldn't help but admire this, which was his biggest harvest so far! Even if it was incomplete, a Grandmaster Martial Art was still precious.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate it to the level of a Great Master, according to the recorded power of this martial art, it would be comparable to a Great Master Martial Art!</p><p></p><p>Great Master...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart sank slightly. Even if he opened the Tower Ascension, he might not be able to withstand a Great Master.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if opening the Golden Heavenly King Tower Ascension state could withstand a Great Master?</p><p></p><p>But the Golden Heavenly King Tower Ascension state also had its drawbacks, in that it was not sustainable.</p><p></p><p>And the divine energy chess pieces of the Heavenly King, he could not fully bear them now.</p><p></p><p>If he could fully bear a single Heavenly King chess piece, he would have the combat power of a Great Master.</p><p></p><p>But for now, at most he could only bear half a Heavenly King chess piece per Tower Ascension.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, when I refine my five viscera and six bowels to the post-Grandmaster realm, and my physical strength increases, I will be able to bear a full Heavenly King divine energy chess piece."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>Estimating the gap between himself and the Great Masters, the anxiety and sense of crisis surged in his heart again.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't even bother to rest.</p><p></p><p>Right then and there, he began to cultivate the incomplete Grandmaster Martial Art "Chaotic Heavenly Cudgel"!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Heart Monkey Temple's great calamity, being wiped out by the Ox Demon, spread like a spring breeze throughout the Golden Light Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Ox Demon, Horse-Face, and... Cat-Face.</p><p></p><p>This news was like throwing a large stone into the turbulent lake of the undercurrents, instantly stirring up a huge wave!</p><p></p><p>The name of the Underworld, it was the first time it had been heard in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Family, the Qin Family's Patriarch Qin Dihun emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the report from the subordinates, his expression became extremely grave: "The Underworld force... I've never heard of it, but it seems to have</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These two individuals, the Ox Demon and Horse Face, possessed formidable techniques. "The Ox Demon appears and disappears mysteriously, with ruthless methods, while the Horse Face can summon souls from thousands of miles away... They are not easy opponents."</p><p></p><p>"Investigate, investigate thoroughly what this Underworld really is!"</p><p></p><p>It was not just the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>The Sea family, the Gong family, and the Gongyangfamily were all shaken and dispatched people to investigate the secrets of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the most severely shaken were the remaining four major sects of the Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Originally there were five major sects, but the Xin Monkey Temple was wiped out, leaving only four major sects.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Gate, the Bamboo Forest Academy, the Observation Tide Pavilion, and the Scorpion Forest - these four major sects were terrified.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xin Monkey Temple was not weaker than them, and even after learning that the Xin Monkey Temple had allied with the Corpse God Sect, its abbot Xuan Li had reached the level of the Silver Gale Curse Copper Corpse.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Xin Monkey Temple was even ahead of them.</p><p></p><p>After all, these aristocratic sects only had venerable ancestors at the Divine Appearance realm guarding them, and their Divine Appearance realm cultivators were few.</p><p></p><p>But the Silver Gale Curse Copper Corpse was considered a perfected Divine Appearance realm, and could contend with those at the Transcendent Spiritual Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert was actually killed by the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, the threat brought by the Ox Demon had already intimidated all the forces.</p><p></p><p>But it was only the local forces of the Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>While they were intimidated, they also felt a little relieved.</p><p></p><p>Because another stronghold of the Corpse God Sect had been uprooted, and the threat to them had diminished a little.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone knew that the Corpse God Sect should still have other strongholds, uprooting one was still one less, meaning that the Corpse God Sect's power in the Golden Light Mansion city had been weakened.</p><p></p><p>In the Mansion Lord's Residence.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince heard the report from his Black Armor subordinate and his brows immediately raised.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of this force before, compared to the likes of the Hunting God Pavilion, it's far inferior, it should just be a small local force, no need to pay too much attention."</p><p></p><p>"But this Ox Demon of the Underworld, specifically targeting the evil people of the Corpse God Sect and killing them, that's quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"A small local force, so the Ox Demon's methods are quite interesting, using traps to kill people?"</p><p></p><p>"Was it Wen Long Mountain who died at his hands?"</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince tapped his fingers lightly on the table.</p><p></p><p>Although only five years old, he had already gotten used to imitating Prince Pacifier Yimo's mannerisms, tapping the table with his fingers, exuding an aura of authority without anger.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Su Huai nodded slightly, his expression indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's death had always been a pain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was originally a complete anti-hunting plan, Wen Long Mountain was just bait, but this bait was swallowed...</p><p></p><p>That meant his anti-hunting plan had completely failed and become a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Su really wants to kill this Ox Demon?" The Young Prince looked at Su Huai's expression and couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai looked at the Young Prince and smiled: "Of course I want to kill him, but this Ox Demon is not easy to kill, his methods are strange, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, mastering a hand of relocation techniques, very mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"As for that Horse Face, he can even assassinate people tens of miles away, it's really hard to find his trace."</p><p></p><p>"He killed the Wen Long Mountain Colonel, I'm naturally resentful and want to eliminate him quickly."</p><p></p><p>"But Young Prince, your main goal in coming to the Golden Light Mansion city is to obtain the inheritance of the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince, don't branch out."</p><p></p><p>"Everything should focus on the matter of the temple deity's resonance!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince heard this and pursed his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's expression became much more gentle.</p><p></p><p>"What Ox Demon, what Horse Face and the like, they are not enough to distract the Young Prince's extra energy, everything will be resolved after the temple deity's inheritance is completed."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince Yihui nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turbulent waves subsided after five days, and the entire Golden Light Mansion city gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The hot air was rolling, the terrifying airflow seemed to roar and surge like a flood dragon.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire body, his muscles and bones were twisted together like steel bars, and the powerful strength burst out between the muscles and bones.</p><p></p><p>The wooden stick he gripped in his hand suddenly shook and exploded, with countless smoke dust bursting, and the fallen snowflakes were instantly shattered! Suddenly, countless stick shadows appeared and intertwined in his hands!</p><p></p><p>Crack...</p><p></p><p>The wooden stick broke and exploded, disintegrating into endless fragments.</p><p></p><p>Every pore of Li Che was exuding, as if "puffing" out scorching hot air.</p><p></p><p>The powerful furnace-like physique gave him an unparalleled advantage in cultivating this Mixed Origin Heavenly Stick.</p><p></p><p>"It really is an unparalleled martial art of the Martial Saints, even if it's incomplete, it's still a top-tier blood and qi martial art!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been practicing for five days, and I've finally mastered this Martial Saint's unparalleled stick art."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body was scorching hot, and the sweat was constantly evaporating, the high temperature distorting the air around his body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, his body cooled down, and he put on a black robe, his body like a steel-forged physique, full of explosive power.</p><p></p><p>"I've mastered it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, a strange light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This stick art is indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The power is extremely strong, and the cultivation is also unique, with a special release technique.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the power of the martial art, it is not much weaker than the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant's attack.</p><p></p><p>And this is just the initial mastery.</p><p></p><p>If it reaches the master level, perhaps it can truly unleash the power of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>After a simple clean-up, Li Che sat down in the courtyard, took out a seven-element spiritual crystal, and began to absorb and refine it.</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour of absorption and refinement, he finished his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Let the "Painting Immortal" clones continue to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He then changed into a clean black robe, braving the wind and snow, and left the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Cliff Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che brushed off a few snowflakes on his clothes and stepped into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong saw Li Che and hurriedly put on his shoes and rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Che Ge!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's face had a hint of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face had a warm smile: "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"They're here, the examiners for your Second-Class Disciple assessment from the Observation Pavilion have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong said.</p><p></p><p>"And not just the Observation Pavilion examiners from the city, but a Vice Supervisor from the Observation Pavilion of the Dragoncloud Province!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong finished speaking, and a strange light flashed in Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A Vice Supervisor from the provincial Observation Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>This is definitely a big shot, higher than Supervisor Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>After all, a provincial Vice Supervisor and a city Supervisor, it's like the difference between a province and a city.</p><p></p><p>"Why is a provincial Vice Supervisor coming to preside over the assessment? Isn't it just supposed to be the Observation Pavilion Supervisors from the city?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong, with his keen information, said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"Because... of the resonance of the deity in the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince?"</p><p></p><p>"The Observation Pavilion's Vice Supervisor also brought a prodigy child, and the Garrison Command also brought a prodigy child."</p><p></p><p>"This deity resonance in the Mysterious Temple is too important, the Grand Supervisor said there may be an inheritance, so the court naturally attaches great importance to it."</p><p></p><p>"So the Religious Sect has sent a prodigy child, and the court here naturally doesn't want to fall behind."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong sighed: "Xixia's competition pressure... is getting greater and greater."</p><p></p><p>"It's too intense, really too intense..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong thought about it and felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The prodigy child from the provincial court, plus Prince Pacifier Yimo's youngest son, and the prodigy child from the provincial Religious Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Xixia being a prodigy child in the Golden Light Mansion city this year, relying on a few top-notch and superior prodigy children... they would probably be completely crushed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Just in time to participate in the deity resonance, so the Vice Supervisor from the provincial Observation Pavilion has also taken over your assessment."</p><p></p><p>"This is not good news... the provincial Observation Pavilion's supervisor, naturally the assessment standards will be higher, and more strict as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just about to learn more details from Shangguan Qingong.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli and Gongyangliancheng had already come down from the upper floor, seeing Li Che, they waved their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li Che, you're just in time, we were just about to notify you, your Second-Class Disciple assessment is ready, prepare your mentality, it will start soon."</p><p></p><p>Gongyangliancheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli clenched her fists, nodding vigorously, her chest heaving up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Azhuo, do well!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't really care.</p><p></p><p>After all, with his current "Immortal Craftsman" talent at level 4, his wood carving skills have risen to a new level.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, the Second-Class Disciple assessment will test your mastery of the Thousand Hands Divine Sculpture Technique, at least reaching the Great Accomplishment level, the more proficient, the more advantageous for you to pass the assessment... this is very important," Gongyangliancheng suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at him and nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, follow us upstairs."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli pulled Li Che and went upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong picked up a small stool, prepared some fruits and snacks, and quietly followed up.</p><p></p><p>In the assessment room.</p><p></p><p>When Gong Yunli brought Li Che in, there were already people waiting inside.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor was unusually not playing the erhu, sitting in the grand chair, chatting and drinking tea with a figure in the white robe of the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Beside that white-robed figure, there was also a young boy standing quietly with his hands hanging.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che entered, his gaze was involuntarily attracted by that young boy.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Li Che raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Concealed crossbow in the sleeve, three coils of spider silk around the waist...</p><p></p><p>Li Che vaguely felt like he was looking at his younger self.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed figure sitting opposite the Supervisor also had his gaze fall on Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a scorching spiritual force sweeping towards him.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Landscape, Cloud State, Flashing Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>A heavy snowfall blanketed the dilapidated city in a silver coat, the frigid air biting to the bone.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy sky, the cold wind cutting like knives, whistling and slicing through the flesh.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tightened his thin cotton jacket, holding a frozen carp that he had painstakingly procured during this winter, all for the sake of nourishing his pregnant wife.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his stubbled chin, he exhaled a puff of misty warm breath into his palms. Braving the biting wind and trudging through the accumulated snow, Li Che hurried down the broad streets of Flashing Thunder City towards his home.</p><p></p><p>Nineteen years had passed since he crossed over to this world. From a newborn babe to an impoverished commoner struggling to survive, Li Che had long abandoned the fantasy of possessing a "golden touch".</p><p></p><p>The towering skyscrapers, the neon lights - they had become but a dream, a distant memory that could never be reclaimed.</p><p></p><p>This world resembled the ancient times, yet was far more perilous, with natural and man-made disasters, as well as evil spirits running rampant. Survival was an arduous endeavor for the common folk.</p><p></p><p>Resigned to his fate, Li Che simply wished to protect his wife and child, to live peacefully and see through his second life.</p><p></p><p>As per the family arrangement, he had married at the age of eighteen, consummating the union in a single night. Now, his wife was in her tenth month of pregnancy, about to give birth.</p><p></p><p>Flashing Thunder City was vast, divided into an inner and outer city. The inner city, it was said, was home to the aristocratic families and officials, with wider streets and a life of extravagance, as well as tighter security. Only those of status could enter the inner city.</p><p></p><p>As for the outer city, that was where the toiling masses resided.</p><p></p><p>Walking for several miles along the main street, Li Che turned into a small alley, greeted by a row of low-lying, thatched-roof mud houses.</p><p></p><p>His hurried footsteps crunched softly on the powdery snow.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Che! Oh, Brother Che, you're finally back from work!" </p><p></p><p>"Your wife is about to give birth, you'd better hurry home!"</p><p></p><p>"You're going to be a father now!"</p><p></p><p>Neighbors who recognized Li Che called out to him from the distance.</p><p></p><p>Hearing their words, Li Che's heart raced with anxiety. Quickening his pace, he dashed towards his humble abode, the pristine snow swirling in his wake.</p><p></p><p>As dusk settled, Li Che arrived at his doorstep. The old wooden door was ajar, and from within came the muffled cries of a woman in labor, as well as the midwife's urgent encouragement.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?" </p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard outside the mud house, seated on a rickety bench was Li Che's elder uncle, Li Liang, the old scholar, puffing on a long pipe, his worn scholar's robe layered over a cotton jacket.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been raised by his uncle since the age of eight, after his parents had passed away from illness. The uncle's family had provided much assistance in Li Che's marriage and the start of his own family.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Granny Lei is the best midwife for miles around. Your Xia will be fine, mother and child will be safe," the old scholar said, the pipe clamped between his teeth.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Che's first time becoming a father, so he naturally felt anxious. Clutching the frozen carp, he paced back and forth in front of the doorway.</p><p></p><p>Annoyed, the old scholar scolded, "You rascal, what are you fidgeting about? You're a father-to-be now, show some composure!"</p><p></p><p>"Can you at least put down that frozen fish of yours?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at him but did not respond, keeping the fish in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a clear, piercing wail erupted from within the house. Li Che's eyes narrowed, his heart seemingly gripped by a powerful hand.</p><p></p><p>The pipe-smoking scholar Li Liang also immediately rose, extinguishing his pipe, his gaze fixed intently on the house.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, a deep, rumbling thunder rolled across the gloomy sky, startling the old scholar, who muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Che instinctively looked up, glimpsing what seemed like the silhouette of a dragon undulating in the heavens, flashing in and out of sight.</p><p></p><p>A birth accompanied by an omen? This wasn't some fantasy novel. Li Che didn't dwell on such thoughts, hurrying into the house at the midwife's beckoning call.</p><p></p><p>Inside, the charcoal stove provided warmth, chasing away the bitter cold.</p><p></p><p>The midwife cradled a ruddy, newborn infant, turning to Li Che. "Congratulations, Master Li, it's a lovely baby girl."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face lit up with joy, though he momentarily didn't know what to do with the frozen carp in his hand, finally managing to stammer, "Thank you, thank you..."</p><p></p><p>After quickly thanking the midwife, he belatedly discarded the fish.</p><p></p><p>Carefully, his hands trembling, Li Che took the child, gazing at her intently. A sense of blood connection seemed to well up within him, and though the infant was still unfamiliar...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The newborn baby's skin was wrinkled, and it was hard to tell whether the baby was good-looking or not.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che felt that this baby was the most beautiful child in the world.</p><p></p><p>Because this was his, Li Che's, daughter!</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che was gazing at the little baby with great joy and delight.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the scene in front of his eyes blurred, as if there was an illusion appearing. It was as if on a vast and desolate land, the earth and stones were breaking apart, and a jade-green sprout forcefully grew up, soaring straight up.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it had grown into a towering, lush tree!</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Li Che was utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw that as the leaves on the towering tree trembled, they seemed to reflect a radiant light, forming the scene of him outside the earthen house, listening to his daughter's birth cries.</p><p></p><p>The scene flashed by, then swiftly contracted like a vortex, finally condensing into a crystal-clear, rainbow-colored fruit on a branch.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Joyfully obtained a daughter, bond established]</p><p>[Daughter's birth, the Dao tree bears fruit]</p><p>[Your daughter is safely born, you have obtained a Dao fruit]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly snapped back to reality, his daughter's "waa waa" cries still sounding.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, let me see the daughter..."</p><p></p><p>A weak voice came from the pale-faced, delicate young woman on the bed. Li Che hurriedly and carefully brought the baby over.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, quick, look at our baby!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but break into a radiant smile.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dao fruit and such, he had no mind to think about it for now. All he had in his heart was his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Wife Zhang Ya, Li Che's other half, was also the woman who was willing to entrust her life to him in this chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, the baby's nose really looks like yours, quite straight." Zhang Ya said weakly, but her heart was full of joy as she reached out her slender fingers to touch the baby's small nose.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at his wife tenderly: "Wife, does it hurt?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pursed her lips, which had little color, and lightly shook her head with a smile: "No, I'm happy."</p><p></p><p>"Husband, what shall we name our child?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya asked expectantly, but as if she thought of something, her gaze went past Li Che and unconsciously looked towards the doorway where the elder scholar was standing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the elder scholar, seeing that he had his brows furrowed, unusually not opening his mouth to compete for the right to name the daughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che knew what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't mind, grasping his wife's cold little hand and softly said, "These past few days, I've already thought of a name."</p><p></p><p>"This winter is extremely cold, I only hope our little baby can warmly get through it, so let's call her Li Nuan Xi..."</p><p></p><p>"Warm as the morning glow, dispelling disasters, pains and illnesses, may she grow up safely and happily."</p><p></p><p>Li Che spoke in a gentle voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya smiled happily, "Nuan Xi, that's a wonderful name..."</p><p></p><p>The little Nuan Xi in Zhang Ya's arms seemed to have heard her name, and stopped crying, revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment, she opened her mouth and started wailing again.</p><p></p><p>The midwife hurriedly came over: "The baby must be hungry, she needs to be fed..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the elder scholar then left the earthen house.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, fluffy snowflakes were falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The cold air rose, the depths of winter were biting.</p><p></p><p>But the smile on Li Che's face never disappeared. Being a father felt like this, a sense of responsibility to protect his wife and daughter welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, the elder scholar seemed a bit gloomy, picking up the tobacco pipe and starting to smoke again.</p><p></p><p>Smelling the smoke, Li Che furrowed his brows: "Uncle, quickly put that out, the child is here."</p><p></p><p>The elder scholar sighed, extinguishing the pipe, but still pursed his lips: "It's just a girl, why not a boy? Our Li family..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che couldn't help but smile: "What difference does it make, boy or girl?"</p><p></p><p>"Our Li family has an imperial throne to inherit, doesn't it?!"</p><p></p><p>The elder scholar, upon hearing this, couldn't easily give up his traditional preference for sons over daughters, but he muttered to himself and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, but didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the frozen-solid crucian carp and headed to the kitchen, planning to make a hot crucian carp and tofu soup for his wife.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of cooking the fish soup,</p><p></p><p>Li Che finally had the time to seriously study the Dao fruit that had appeared with the birth of his daughter.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spring rain was biting and icy, lashing against the face and unleashing a chill throughout. </p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's body was wrapped in arcing lightning, his eyes suddenly widening as he stared at the massive contraption Xixie had brought out - six metal barrels that resembled venomous snakes, causing the hair on his body to stand on end.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming sense of mortal danger enveloped him...</p><p></p><p>He was going to die!</p><p></p><p>Exceptional spirit children possessed extremely keen senses, their perceptive abilities far exceeding ordinary people. </p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's perception was naturally no exception. </p><p></p><p>His body stiffened, his tempered physique now feeling as heavy as quicksilver and lead.</p><p></p><p>"Fireworks?"</p><p></p><p>"What fireworks?!"</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether the moisture dripping from Shangguan Qinglei's forehead was sweat or silent raindrops.</p><p></p><p>He stared fixatedly at the wooden and metal mechanism in Xixie's hands! Watching the young girl draw out the device, he seemed to go mad, endlessly shouting about fireworks.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei felt an inexplicable fear welling up from within!</p><p></p><p>In the air...</p><p></p><p>At some unknown point, the scent of gunpowder had permeated.</p><p></p><p>"Time for fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie's eyes sparkled like the brightest of stars, radiating brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, she pulled the trigger! Boom boom boom - a terrifying explosion erupted on the arena, accompanied by dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>The sound waves tore through the gentle spring rain!</p><p></p><p>Immense gusts of air and shrill whistles suddenly burst forth from Xixie's "custom-made Namu Xian Gong Gatling gun".</p><p></p><p>The recoil force made Xixie's plump little body vibrate rapidly, her new clothes clinging tightly to her frame and outlining her little belly.</p><p></p><p>Shrill screams, brilliant fireworks, surging shockwaves -</p><p></p><p>The six rapidly spinning metal barrels glowed red-hot, emanating scorching heat, compressing and ejecting the "Wood Crow" within at explosive speeds.</p><p></p><p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!</p><p></p><p>Countless dazzling golden lightning bolts, like golden sword qi, slashed out in quick succession, ripping through the leisurely spring rain.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! Shangguan Qinglei's hair stood on end...</p><p></p><p>Fast! Too fast! What the hell is this?!</p><p></p><p>He cursed inwardly, but his body moved without hesitation, heavily stomping the arena and launching himself into the air, his blood and qi surging recklessly. The spot where he had stood was instantly engulfed by the explosion, the shockwave striking him violently. </p><p></p><p>Raging winds, soaring airflow, the shattered wooden arena sending splinters like needles, grazing Shangguan Qinglei's cheek...</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to have lost focus...</p><p></p><p>Because after only a few body lengths, he could no longer evade! The terrifying Wood Crows came sweeping in, kicking up a continuous fountain of dust on the arena.</p><p></p><p>The wooden black crows ejected from Xixie's mechanism flapped their wings, screeching shrilly...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was ultimately engulfed! Brilliant golden light burst in his pupils, the thick smoke of gunpowder submerging him.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an agonizing pain that surged over him like a tidal wave, nearly causing him to lose consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Couldn't dodge...</p><p></p><p>Couldn't dodge at all! At this moment, Shangguan Qinglei finally let out an anguished, uncontrollable scream from the depths of his throat: "Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Rat-tat-tat - </p><p></p><p>Countless Wood Crows slammed into Shangguan Qinglei's body, the acrid stench of burning spreading. Shangguan Qinglei's suspended form was pelted by the Wood Crows, unable to fall.</p><p></p><p>Like a painting in the spring rain.</p><p></p><p>Bursts of blood mist, intertwining with the golden hues in an artistically beautiful display of fireworks.</p><p></p><p>Thick black smoke, interspersed with fleeting golden explosions, filled with an artistic sensibility.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Only Xixie's excited shrieks and the continuous rat-tat-tat remained...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The arena below had descended into complete stillness.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared in stunned silence at Xixie, who had pulled out a massive weapon and unleashed a barrage on Shangguan Qinglei.</p><p></p><p>That frenzied, exhilarated expression, accompanied by her cries of "fireworks", made everyone feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>You call this... fireworks?! Death fireworks, more like! Not far away, Gong Yuanliang and Huang Sixiang had nearly simultaneously stopped their match.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the brutalized Shangguan Qinglei, Gong Yuanliang let out a long sigh. Indeed... this little girl is truly dangerous!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei... is going to get beaten to death, huh? Gong Yuanliang and Huang Sixiang shuddered almost simultaneously, then resumed their battle.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately... the first round is about to end, they won't have to face this crazy girl.</p><p></p><p>Huang Sixiang's body trembled slightly. This girl... is she really this fierce?</p><p></p><p>He recalled how he had once looked down on Xixie from the stands. Now he realized his eyes had been mistaken.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shangguan family area below the arena.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen, the Shangguan family patriarch who had been leisurely eating fruits and preparing to watch his son brutally humiliate the three-year-old girl, suddenly stood up, his hair and beard disheveled, his eyes fixed intently on the arena.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Xixie block Shangguan Qinglei's Thunderclap Body with her mastery of martial arts, he was quite surprised, thinking the little girl had remarkable talent and could potentially be a worthy match for Qinglei in the future.</p><p></p><p>But when Xixie pulled out the "custom-made Namu Xian Gong Gatling gun" and the Wood Crows it fired engulfed Shangguan Qinglei, his leisurely mood was shattered.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he appeared at the edge of the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The roar burst forth from the depths of Shangguan Zhenghen's throat.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, it was as if the heavens and earth had been sealed, a terrifying pressure like a towering mountain surging towards Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Illusory oppressive force, like a raging torrent.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to act, two figures appeared before him, one after the other.</p><p></p><p>The first was Zhang Qingzheng, dressed in Confucian robes, his sour-faced expression even more bitter, his dead fish eyes coldly glaring at the well-groomed Shangguan Zhenghen: "Shangguan Zhenghen, do you wish to die?"</p><p></p><p>Beside Zhang Qingzheng was Li Qingshan, in a blue robe, the sheep horn mallet sliding out from his sleeve as he coldly eyed Shangguan Zhenghen, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>"My son... is going to be beaten to death!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's face was cold, his disheveled hair and beard fluttering wildly, his luxurious golden silk robe billowing in the spring rain.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he lives or dies, old master as the overseer of the assessment, am I not more aware than you?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if he has but a single breath left, old master can still save him."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's hair fluttered lightly, his dead fish eyes calmly looking at Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Shangguan Qinglei's life and death, Zhang Qingzheng felt maintaining the order of the Shen Sect assessment was more important, even if Shangguan Zhenghen was a Void Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen was furious, this stubborn old scholar! It's not your son being beaten, of course you don't care!</p><p></p><p>However, Shangguan Zhenghen also sensed the tense atmosphere and did not forcefully intervene again.</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze to the arena.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was disappointed, wishing Xixie's fireworks display had been even more impressive... he couldn't help but feel the urge to take action.</p><p></p><p>If Shangguan Zhenghen had insisted on forcefully intervening, he would have reluctantly smashed his head.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Shangguan Zhenghen backed down.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng appeared on the arena, Xixie having already ceased her bombardment, the six scorching and slowly-stopping metal barrels pointing skyward, emitting dissipating smoke.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was panting heavily, her flushed little face beaming with excitement. </p><p></p><p>She had finally set off fireworks! How delightful! Xixie's little face smiled radiantly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's sour-faced expression looked at her, and Xixie quickly put away her "Namu Gatling gun", her two little hands clasped together behind her back, adopting a contrite expression.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's heart melted, but his sour-faced expression remained unchanged, betraying no joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, you asked old master beforehand, and old master said that divine weapons and mechanisms are not restricted, because old master is here, your lives will not be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng turned his gaze to the scorching smoky haze enveloping the fallen Shangguan Qinglei on the arena.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, divine energy like rain coalesced into clouds, hovering above Shangguan Qinglei's head and pouring down.</p><p></p><p>The smoke cleared, revealing Shangguan Qinglei's condition.</p><p></p><p>Hiss -</p><p></p><p>Gasps of shock came from the spectators around the arena.</p><p></p><p>Too brutal! Shangguan Qinglei's entire body was charred black, skin torn and flesh exposed, almost unrecognizable as human, the roasted scent permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>He lay on the ground, his eyes vacant and unfocused.</p><p></p><p>Only the rising and falling of his chest indicated he was still alive, clinging to that last breath.</p><p></p><p>As Zhang Qingzheng's divine rain poured down, like a long-awaited sweet rain, it pulled Shangguan Qinglei back from the brink of death, his flesh and blood stirring, the embedded wooden shards expelled by the pulsing flesh.</p><p></p><p>The injuries gradually healed, life force restored.</p><p></p><p>He didn't die, but the psychological scars left behind would likely exceed even those of Liu Qingqing's.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't die." Xixie stretched her neck to take a look, relieved.</p><p></p><p>Xixie didn't want to kill anyone, even though Shangguan Qinglei was a bit foul-mouthed and unpleasant. </p><p></p><p>After all, he was the younger brother of her good friend Qinghong, and Xixie didn't want to leave a bad impression with Qinghong.</p><p></p><p>Xixie sighed in relief, the thought of setting off fireworks having been a little beyond her control.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't die.</p><p></p><p>The divine rain nourished Shangguan Qinglei, his injuries mostly healed, the old skin sloughing off to reveal tender new flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Qinglei has failed in his challenge, Li Nuanxie has successfully defended the arena."</p><p></p><p>"In the first round, Shangguan Qinglei has received a 'B-' grade."</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxie has received an 'A+' grade!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's Confucian robe fluttered as he spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's face was cold, not saying a word, raising his hand to summon an invisible force that enveloped and pulled Shangguan Qinglei to his side.</p><p></p><p>Holding his son, although the injuries had healed, the lingering scars had not yet faded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen was deeply pained. This was his most beloved son. </p><p></p><p>Talented, resembling him in his youth, he had placed great hopes on him. He never expected him to be eliminated in the first round.</p><p></p><p>A 'B-' grade, placing him in the third tier among the exceptional spirit children.</p><p></p><p>An 'A+' grade could only be obtained by those who remained standing on the arena after the first round, the true disciples of the Shen Sect.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the five exceptional spirit children on the arena were essentially the Shen Sect's true inheritors. The second round's Divination Assessment would not have too great a gap between them.</p><p></p><p>"Father... it hurts, son..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei, embraced by Shangguan Zhenghen, his 1.7-meter frame feeling the pain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He lifted his head, appearing slightly comical.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Zhenghen was deeply concerned.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, baby son is fine... Dad won't let you suffer this in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's eyes flashed with a cold, icy killing intent. He, Shangguan Zhenghen... had never suffered such a loss before.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, at the position of the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong sneered as he watched this father-son affectionate scene, his eyes filled with disappointment and disgust.</p><p></p><p>In his impression, Shangguan Zhenghen had never been like this towards her, and even in her entire life, the number of times she had seen Shangguan Zhenghen could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xixie. His eyes couldn't help but well up with tenderness.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Xixie was angered because of Shangguan Qinglang's words of "bastard".</p><p></p><p>However, Shangguan Qinghong also never expected that Xixie would be so fierce...</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, that mechanism... it seems to be the mechanism mastered by Niu Mo, the 'Wood Dove Crow' that can spray explosives, an enhanced version of the Tang Clan's mechanism."</p><p></p><p>Liu He stood beside, squinting and observing, with a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful hidden weapon..."</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that Sister Xixie, the daughter of Li, is the inheritor of Niu Mo, and now it seems... indeed the case, Niu Mo is famous for his mastery of hidden weapons."</p><p></p><p>Sea Chuanying beside him took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but compare and simulate...</p><p></p><p>If it were his genius prodigy Sea Chao, facing Xixie wielding such a hidden weapon mechanism, could he win? The final result saddened him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't win, couldn't win at all...</p><p></p><p>Although Sea Chao had reached the Tempering Bone Perfection at the age of seven, but... judging from Shangguan Qinglang's performance, he could at most last for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>The final result would not be much better than Shangguan Qinglang's.</p><p></p><p>The explosive power of the "Wood Dove Crow", a single shot's power is enough to disrupt the blood circulation of a Tempering Bone cultivator, and that Xixie... had hundreds of them...</p><p></p><p>It's equivalent to hundreds of Tempering Bone cultivators attacking simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Tempering Bone Perfection... can't withstand it!</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary three-cycle blood refinement might not be able to endure it, unless one has forged a divine foundation, with powerful divine energy to resist.</p><p></p><p>"I admit... I was mistaken."</p><p></p><p>Sea Chuanying took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Three years old, is also an age not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the family seats.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's upturned mouth was harder to suppress than Xian Gong Barrett's, and a hint of satisfaction flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>No wonder she is Li Che's daughter, this fireworks display...</p><p></p><p>Has his touch! </p><p></p><p>Although the accuracy still lacks, many fireworks techniques are quite raw, and the stable control of the "Xian Gong Gatling" is also quite difficult, this is the weakened version of the Xian Gong Gatling, if it were the Niu Mo version, Xixie's body might just fall apart after a few shots.</p><p></p><p>Li Che has never stopped improving the "Southern Xian Gong Gatling" and the "Southern Xian Gong Barrett".</p><p></p><p>The main focus is on upgrading the "Wood Dove Crow", and the carrying mechanism naturally needs to be upgraded as well.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Zhang Ya clung to Li Che's arm, looking at her three-year-old daughter on the stage, wielding the mechanism, killing gods and Buddhas, feeling a bit bewildered, a bit doubtful about life.</p><p></p><p>Is this her daughter Zhang Ya's?</p><p></p><p>She turned her head to look at her husband, thinking of her husband Niu Mo's identity, her heart suddenly felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>However, she also had some worries in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... do you think Xixie is a bit too violent?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya looked at Li Che and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Violent? No way... Didn't she not even kill Shangguan Qinglang?"</p><p></p><p>"How can that be considered violent?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, girls should have some self-defense ability, so they won't be bullied in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>Where is it violent? Xixie is so gentle.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, Shangguan Qinglang would already be in pieces, the Qiankun Jade emptied out.</p><p></p><p>Compared to him, Xixie is too gentle.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya then closed her mouth, right, discussing violence with her husband... it's like preaching to the choir.</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted his wife's hand, his gaze falling on the appearance below the stage, Shangguan Zhenghen who wanted to use his pressure to intimidate Xixie, his gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the strong to bully the weak, the mighty virtual image expert... actually plans to use his own virtual image pressure to oppress a three-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>Are you still human?! </p><p></p><p>Vicious beast!</p><p></p><p>Li Che silently flipped out his little notebook, recording Shangguan Zhenghen's name.</p><p></p><p>This grudge, is recorded! Li Qingshan and Zhang Qingzheng stepping out to protect Xixie made him not take any further action.</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Qingzheng announced the conclusion of Xixie's first round with a Grade A evaluation, Li Qingnian carried Xixie back to where Li Che and the others were.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xixie came back, she immediately burrowed into Zhang Ya's arms, her head rubbing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is so scared, Xixie is so scared..."</p><p></p><p>Xixie whined.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya hurriedly flustered to soothe her: "Xixie darling, is there anything uncomfortable? Tell Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya examined Xixie, her face full of concern.</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, she had to compete on the stage with a group of children older than her, how hard it must be.</p><p></p><p>"That Shangguan Qinglang, so ugly and scary, Xixie is so scared, Xixie wants to eat braised pork, the big chunks kind, Mommy make it for me!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie continued to burrow in Zhang Ya's arms, timely putting forward her own conditions.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, when we get home, Mommy will make it for you."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya rubbed Xixie's head, saying tenderly.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy is the best, love Mommy." Xixie kept nuzzling Zhang Ya's long legs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che beside them was extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan first went to pay respects to Grandma Su, then came to Li Che's side, pulled over a grand chair and sat down, the two sitting side by side.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have a small doubt." Li Che looked at Li Qingshan seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead." Li Qingshan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"When you tested my divine talent in the past, you said I was also an exceptional prodigy... why don't I need to go on stage?" Li Che pursed his lips and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che with disdain: "Have some shame, with your cultivation in martial arts and divine power, do you dare to compete with these children?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to ruin these kids?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>"You're 22 years old, dare to compete with these kids?" Li Qingshan shook his head: "After Xixie enters the Divine Sect, I'll lead you to the 'Wood Carving Ridge', you'll be a member of the Divine Sect as well."</p><p></p><p>"Wood Carving Ridge is very suitable for you, there are vast spiritual woods there, you can mess around as you please."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled: "No, that's not what I mean..."</p><p></p><p>"The prodigies have the opportunity to enter the Three Prince's Mysterious Temple and undergo the temple god resonance test, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel I can also go resonate with the temple gods..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly understood, so this was Li Che's intention, wanting to closely observe the Mysterious Temple of the Four Guardians.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Mysterious Temple and resonate with the temple gods, this is the desire of every Wood Carving Master, a common human sentiment, understandable.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan was a bit uncertain: "This matter is not easy to say... I'll ask the Sect Master later."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, the temple god resonance... you can't go."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Although your divine power is young, just like the prodigies, but you are after all... too mature."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan carefully chose his words.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was speechless, you can just directly say he's too old? Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and hesitated, then said, "Can you imagine yourself with a Nezha braid, wearing a red belly band, standing in front of the Mysterious Temple, posing and flirting?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The temple god resonance... is it like this? "After all, it's the Furious Three Prince's Mysterious Temple, naturally it needs to be more image-conscious, easier to resonate with the temple gods..."</p><p></p><p>"Like Lv Chi, he's still wearing a Nezha braid to this day, just to maintain the temple god resonance, more easily accommodate the temple god's divine power..."</p><p></p><p>"If you can accept it... it's not impossible to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but grin.</p><p></p><p>Damn, although it's an eyesore, but what's the deal with that?</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't even dare to imagine that kind of scene, waving his hand: "Forget it, we'll talk about it later, later..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded, then his expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>A voice resounded in Li Che's ear, a high-level divine transmission technique.</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo, let's talk about cooperation."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow, the Fruit of the Untainted Heart slightly trembled, quickly deciphering Li Qingshan's technique, a special divine vibration technique.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please speak."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also tried to respond through divine transmission.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was stunned, amazed to see Li Che had already grasped the divine transmission technique.</p><p></p><p>"Today, many strong experts have gathered in the Jin Guang Prefecture City, the Five Great Families, the Five Great Sects, the Divine Guard Army, the Temple Guardians, the Qin Tian Observatory, and the Divine Sect branches... almost all the strong ones are here."</p><p></p><p>"This is a rare opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>"You can detect the Corpse Curse Marks, right? This is a great opportunity to detect them... see... how many demons and monsters are hiding!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan transmitted, extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, so Li Qingshan was waiting for such an opportunity, the Divine Sect's entry examination, even if it's the hidden experts of the Five Great Families and Five Great Sects, they will come out and show their faces.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the investigation would be the most comprehensive!</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought about it and did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>But he still said in advance.</p><p></p><p>"If the other party's is beyond the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Mark... I won't be able to judge it."</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Mark... no problem, when we activate the second round of purple qi detection, make a grand gesture, you can take the opportunity to detect the Corpse Curse Marks, record the list of names you find, I'll have Shangguan Qinghong come over, you can just ask her about the ones you don't recognize."</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan finished transmitting, he cut off the divine connection and stood up, patting his blue robe.</p><p></p><p>He walked back and forth a few times to Grandma Su, then with hands behind his back, stooping figure returned to the Divine Sect's high platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the chair, lightly tapping the armrest of the grand chair with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the high platform.</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan returned, Zhu Hongdou approached him, a scarlet robe swirling, she stared at Li Qingshan, causing Li Qingshan's expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhu, why are you staring at me like that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan felt a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>The thing he was going to do, he had not told Zhu Hongdou.</p><p></p><p>"Old Li, are you very familiar with Xixie's father?" Zhu Hongdou said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan heard this and his heart immediately relaxed: "Li Che? That kid is pretty good, gentle and humble, his talent is also quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"Then you tell him, Xixie entering my Red Cloud Peak is the most suitable."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou said seriously: "My Red Cloud Peak, all are female disciples, you tell Li Che to rest assured, no male disciples will dare to harass Xixie!"</p><p></p><p>In other words, Red Cloud Peak, no boys allowed!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly understood what Zhu Hongdou wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>She's getting fired up! The first round of the sect entry true cultivation test has just ended...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sect's branch elder Zhu Hongdou...</p><p></p><p>Is planning to snatch the person in advance?!</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets, recommendation tickets, and support for continued reading! During the naked run period, I can only rely on everyone's votes to sustain, Old Li thanks you!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pure white snow fluttered down, as the cranes withdrew. The crisp wind howled and entered the sleeves.</p><p></p><p>In the rain alley, there was no sound of rain, only the soft, misty sound of falling snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was intense, his heartbeat pounding like a drum.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and the faint white glow of the spiritual essence accumulated in the [Untainted Heart] began to emanate from his palm, distorting the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>"Joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, surprise - these are the seven emotional essences. The Dao of Spiritual Cultivation is born from these seven essences, branching out from the greater categories into specific veins, and thus forging the spiritual foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Then, how can I forge a spiritual foundation from the pure and untainted spiritual essence I've condensed with the [Untainted Heart]?"</p><p></p><p>"Pure and flawless, like a blank sheet of paper - is it possible to paint upon it, allowing the potential for any spiritual foundation to manifest? Or can I... forge not a single spiritual foundation, but multiple spiritual foundations?"</p><p></p><p>As the ideas surged forth, his ambition was like a raging fire, sweeping through in an instant!</p><p></p><p>But all of this... was merely Li Che's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Given his limited understanding of spiritual essences, he couldn't figure out the specifics of how to actually put it into practice.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't figure it out, Li Che decided to stop thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not yet formally studied the Dao of Spiritual Cultivation. Once he had the opportunity to delve into it, he could slowly analyze and try to devise a method to forge an untainted spiritual foundation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would be difficult, but even if it was hard... it would still be better than having no way to forge a spiritual foundation at all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Che's mood instantly lightened.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating with the [Untainted Heart] - that is what I need to focus my efforts on right now."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his qi and blood surging like a roaring dragon, melting the snow into billowing steam.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was sharp, his mind racing.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes... the [Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra] can absorb spiritual essence to accelerate its progress. Can I use the spiritual essence I've condensed with the [Untainted Heart] to supply the [Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra]?"</p><p></p><p>The mutual assistance between Dao Fruits - it was a good idea, but if he consumed the spiritual essence nurtured by the [Untainted Heart] to boost the [Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra], it would undoubtedly slow down the cultivation of his spiritual essence... a case of losing more than he gained.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I can lend it a hand during breakthroughs, but in daily cultivation, I should rely on the martial dao talents bestowed by the [Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra] and refine them gradually."</p><p></p><p>"If I can forge a spiritual foundation, then within the entire Fei Lei City, both the inner and outer cities, I will undoubtedly be among the top experts!"</p><p></p><p>Forging a spiritual foundation was extremely important... because Xu You had once told Li Che a phrase that he had etched into his heart.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual foundation is the beginning of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Stretching his limbs, his bones cracking, Li Che was in an excellent mood.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the courtyard, he strolled down the long street, planning to get some old yellow wine and braised meat to have with his dinner. Old Chen and Xu You came to mooch meals and drinks from him every day, so Li Che had to prepare some side dishes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>High in the vast sky, the snow and clouds drifted.</p><p></p><p>Outside Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>A simple horse-drawn carriage, bumping and swaying, broke through the wind and snow, entering the city.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, we've arrived at Fei Lei City."</p><p></p><p>The coachman stopped the carriage by the side of the road and rubbed his hands, calling out to the carriage interior.</p><p></p><p>The curtain was lifted, and two figures emerged.</p><p></p><p>An old man, his face covered in withered wrinkles like the bark of an ancient tree, wore a thick coat, his long eyebrows drooping.</p><p></p><p>Beside the old man was a child of five or six years old, mischievous and lively, with two Nezha-style braids.</p><p></p><p>The old man took out a few large Jing copper coins from his sleeve pocket and handed them to the coachman. The coachman weighed them, glanced at the child beside the old man, and warned, "Old man, you'd better take good care of this child. In Fei Lei City... it's easy to lose a child."</p><p></p><p>The old man chuckled and bowed in response. The coachman then drove the carriage away without further comment.</p><p></p><p>"Master, did we come to Fei Lei City a year early? Might we have disrupted the rules?"</p><p></p><p>The child looked up at the old man with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The old man stroked his beard and shook his head slightly. "Rules? The Great Jing is in decline, what rules are there left to speak of? Besides... on our journey here, I've observed that the aura of the strange temple deities in the outskirts of Fei Lei City has grown increasingly intense, and the demonic creatures are rampant. I fear that if we had come a year later, we might not even be able to enter the city."</p><p></p><p>The child was immediately alarmed. "Ah? Is it that serious?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Although Feilei City is a small city, there are many powerful families and Shengi cultivators within its walls... It fell in just one year? That's a bit exaggerated, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The elder glanced at the child. "Little Lü Chi, do you think your teacher would lie to you?"</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious temple outside the city, based on the 'Prospect Temperament Art' of our sect, should be the 'Ten Realms Mysterious Temple'. In another year, it will be promoted to the 'Nine Luminaries' level..."</p><p></p><p>"With the strength of the Shengi cultivators in Feilei City, they can still deal with the current Ten Realms level Mysterious Temple. But once it's promoted to the Nine Luminaries level, even Shengi cultivators and innate Tong Luo warriors may not be able to escape, except those at the Shengi level."</p><p></p><p>Little Lü Chi drew in a sharp breath. "Feilei City... has sparse spirituality and a small population. How can the Mysterious Temple be promoted to the Nine Luminaries level?"</p><p></p><p>The elder stroked his beard. "A temple can only be promoted through offerings and sacrifices."</p><p></p><p>"If someone offers their life, their temperament, their divinity... the Mysterious Temple will be promoted."</p><p></p><p>"We came early to find a spiritual child and bring them back to the sect, to avoid any trouble."</p><p></p><p>The elder advised the child.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher... are we really not going to save them?" Lü Chi tilted his head and asked. "At the very least, shouldn't we warn the powerful figures in the city?"</p><p></p><p>The elder affectionately rubbed Lü Chi's head. "This matter is not that simple..."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, although I came down the mountain on an order, I left most of my spiritual power up there to avoid the eyes of the Great View Town Temple Supervisor. Even if the Ten Realms Mysterious Temple erupts, I can still handle it. But once the temple deity of the Nine Luminaries level forms, this old body of mine won't be enough to fight it."</p><p></p><p>"If I get infected by the temple deity's spirituality... it will ruin my own spiritual path."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Great View doesn't even care, why should we?" </p><p></p><p>"The best we can do is to publicly reveal our identities before the disaster occurs, and guide the innocent civilians to evacuate the city."</p><p></p><p>The elder patted the young Lü Chi's head.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, be quiet now, let your teacher use the 'Prospect Temperament Art' to see... how much spiritual children are left in Feilei City."</p><p></p><p>The elder held Lü Chi's hand. </p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he lightly drew a line in front of his eyes with a snowflake.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes again, his pupils seemed to have golden wheels, stacking and circling.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky and saw four huge spiritual millstones hanging in the hazy space between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"'Angry Cry Ghost', 'Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light', 'Suspended Thought Flowing Sword', 'Furious Amitabha'... Feilei City has quite a few Shengi cultivators, and their Shengi styles are quite diverse."</p><p></p><p>The elder smiled faintly, carefully examining them.</p><p></p><p>These were ordinary Shengi, but for those who could forge Shengi, they already had great talent.</p><p></p><p>After all, many spiritual cultivators could cultivate a pool of spiritual power, but could never take that final step, or had their minds ravaged by the spiritual power and completely went insane, falling victim to the backlash of their own spirituality.</p><p></p><p>"Shengi cultivators are already not weak, don't think that they are just a step away from divinity. Sometimes, that last step can be an abyss!"</p><p></p><p>The golden wheels in the elder's eyes kept turning.</p><p></p><p>He nodded towards the inner city direction, "The aristocratic families have indeed accumulated quite a few spiritual children, but their spirituality seems to be lacking."</p><p></p><p>The golden wheels then rolled, and his gaze fell on the direction of Xu's Woodcarving Shop, revealing a hint of strangeness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Under his "Prospect Temperament Art", it seemed that there was a raging fire, burning fiercely and dyeing half the sky red.</p><p></p><p>"Such a fierce divine temperament..."</p><p></p><p>"How come the aristocratic families haven't recruited a spiritual child with such temperament? Strange..."</p><p></p><p>The elder was greatly surprised. He stroked his beard and did a quick calculation. "Oh, only two years old... that explains it."</p><p></p><p>"It seems... this trip down the mountain will yield a great harvest."</p><p></p><p>The elder smiled as he stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to disperse the golden wheels in his eyes and cancel the Prospect Temperament Art...</p><p></p><p>He paused.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the young man strolling down the long street, humming a little tune while carrying braised meat and a jar of wine.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The pure, dazzling divine radiance emanating from the young man's entire being!</p>

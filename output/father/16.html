        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Staring and guarding, in Li Che's view... it's better to just kill him.</p><p></p><p>The other party has joined the Ling Ying Sect, and the target is his daughter Xixia, which is like a time bomb, not knowing when they will make a move.</p><p></p><p>This is a foregone conclusion, so why wait for the other party to make a move... and not take the initiative to attack? Thinking about the angry Ling Ying statue placed outside the courtyard last night...</p><p></p><p>The other party's actions are undoubtedly a provocation to him as a father, as if glaring at him and shouting loudly: If you dare to block me, I will kill you! Is Sun Changbiao innocent?</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's heart, he is not innocent at all. When he set his sights on his daughter Xixia, joined the Ling Ying Sect, and wanted to take the life of someone else's child to seek a son for himself...</p><p></p><p>He has already stained his hands with blood.</p><p></p><p>Pressing down his hat, Li Che exhaled a breath of hot air from his throat.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, his figure rushed into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family's woodcarving workshop was very large, almost like a small town, with intersecting alleys and courtyards within the high walls.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slipped into an alley, took off his clothes, and put on a black hooded robe.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a wooden mask he had made, originally intended to play with and give to Xixia as a toy.</p><p></p><p>But now... he'll use it temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Since Xixia was born in the Year of the Ox, the mask Li Che carved was a cute ox-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the cute ox mask, Li Che felt that the whole world seemed to be separated from him, and his breathing became light and free.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Changbiao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che softly uttered this name.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his mind was stimulated by the Dao Fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor].</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Sounds like bones colliding echoed, popping like fried beans. The figure under Li Che's black hooded robe began to move, the muscles rippling, a numb sensation spreading throughout his body. Then his stature grew taller and more robust, the back muscles hardening like iron, rolling and dense like a coiled dragon! Blood and flesh of the dragon and elephant, indestructible golden armor, unparalleled in forging! This is the characteristic of the Dao Fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor]! After Li Che actively activated it, his physique underwent a complete transformation, the cultivated power and qi stored in the Dao Fruit surging out and returning to his physical body! And the physical body also actively changed, the strength and power greatly increased!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's original height of around 1.75 meters directly grew to around 1.9 meters after activating the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor. His blood and flesh also swelled up, becoming more solid and robust, exuding an extremely oppressive aura.</p><p></p><p>"Power..." The eyes behind the cute ox mask flashed, looking at his palms that contained terrifying power like fans. He clenched his fists tightly, vaguely causing a howling wind.</p><p>"It's as if it contains the power of the dragon and elephant..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's call this transformation the 'Golden Armor Change'," Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>He felt that at this moment, he was like a giant elephant in the jungle, possessing the terrifying might to trample fierce tigers and lions.</p><p></p><p>This is just the change in physical strength brought by the Dao Fruit alone...</p><p>Unparalleled in forging!</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Li Che's face, hidden behind the mask.</p><p></p><p>Then the towering figure stepped out, breaking through the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao's courtyard was located on the west side of the Xu family compound.</p><p></p><p>As the second son of the Sun family manager, Sun Changbiao's courtyard after splitting the family was naturally excellent, being a three-wing compound with a spacious and bright courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao held an umbrella and returned to the courtyard after work.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a sigh, his expression became somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Dabao has set his sights on me... so fast, he's come to find me so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Standing in the courtyard, Sun Changbiao's expression was unsettled. He had noticed that Old Chen was monitoring him, and even though he had tried to hide it, the fact that he had joined the Ling Ying Sect could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had personally gone to the Ling Ying Sect's altar to burn incense.</p><p></p><p>"Well, since he's monitoring me, if I don't make a move, Chen Dabao also won't dare to kill me... without evidence, he won't make a move."</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do is just pass on the information, wait for the opportunity... with a Ling Ying, once it is delivered to the altar, my son's wish will definitely be fulfilled!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao desperately wanted a son.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No, I should say that the two of them, the husband and wife, both wanted a son so much.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Sun Changbiao's thoughts, who was standing in the courtyard, were interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Father... Father, it's time to eat."</p><p></p><p>A timid voice came.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao looked over and saw his eldest daughter leading the three younger daughters, timidly carrying the dishes, obviously just coming out of the kitchen after cooking the meal.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Sun Changbiao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he folded the umbrella, shook off the snow grains on the umbrella, brushed off his long robe, and stepped into the warm inner room.</p><p></p><p>The four daughters placed the steaming dishes on the dining table, and the eldest daughter obediently led the three younger sisters, pursing her lips, leaving the warm inner room, and went to the kitchen to eat their own meal.</p><p></p><p>At the dining table, Sun Changbiao and his wife Liu started to eat heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, how's that matter going?"</p><p></p><p>"The Deputy Fragrance Master is pressing me urgently... The child from the Li family is a rare spiritual infant, if we can send him to the academy, the Dharma Master will surely give us a son!"</p><p></p><p>Liu stroked her slightly swollen abdomen, her eyes full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao frowned: "Don't rush me, I know what I'm doing..."</p><p></p><p>What does this woman know? Chen Dabao is not easy to offend, this guy's strength is powerful, and many of the upper echelons in the inner city are trying to curry favor with him!</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao saw Chen's deep love and fondness for Li Che's daughter, if he accidentally angered the old Chen, he was afraid of being beaten to death, or even lose his life if not handled properly.</p><p></p><p>"Eat."</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao picked up a chopstick of stir-fried meat, his brow immediately furrowed: "What the hell, why did that brat put so much salt? Trying to choke her father to death?!"</p><p></p><p>Outside.</p><p></p><p>The tall young girl who led her sisters out of the room, pursed her lips, seemingly hearing the scolding from inside, her face paling a bit, pulling her sisters, she hurriedly went to the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>It was too cold outside, in the kitchen there was the residual warmth of the firewood, it would be more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>And after the girls left.</p><p></p><p>A towering, mountain-like figure, wearing a straw hat and mask, appeared silently in the corridor, the wind and snow not touching his body at all.</p><p></p><p>Watching the girls enter the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the ox-face mask were ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Knock knock knock--"</p><p></p><p>After drinking a cup of warm sweet wine and picking up a piece of stir-fried meat, Sun Changbiao, his mouth full of oil, was very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he heard the sound of knocking on the door, his comfortable eyes suddenly frowned.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, didn't I tell you not to disturb me while I'm eating? Didn't you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing her husband frowning, the wife quickly slapped down the chopsticks and scolded.</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao raised his hand to stop his wife's anger: "You're pregnant, don't get angry, keep our son safe."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Sun Changbiao stood up, casually took down a rattan stick hanging on the wall of the inner room, picking the meat stuck between his teeth with one hand while swinging the rattan stick with the other.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he reached the door...</p><p></p><p>"Bang--"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion, accompanied by flying wood chips, the door was suddenly kicked open!</p><p></p><p>The cold wind and snow rushed in.</p><p></p><p>An extremely thick and long leg, like a divine whip, suddenly lashed out!</p><p></p><p>A kick landed on Sun Changbiao's abdomen, the terrifying force exploding like a cannonball, Sun Changbiao's eyeballs were almost popping out, his whole body curled up like a shrimp, and he was flung onto the dining table, smashing all the delicious dishes.</p><p></p><p>"Puff..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Changbiao spat out a mist of blood, the burning sensation in his abdomen felt like it had been kicked open, his whole body numb, he struggled to lift his head.</p><p></p><p>"Who... who... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>His first thought was that Chen Dabao had made a move.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the newcomer, that imposing figure like a towering mountain, it directly left Sun Changbiao dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Not Chen Dabao! How could the scrawny old man Chen Dabao be so mighty and powerful?!</p><p></p><p>Then... who could it be?!</p><p></p><p>Whom had he offended?!</p>

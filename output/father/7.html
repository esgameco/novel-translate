        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems there's something good!</p><p></p><p>This ancient text... might be of great help to the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao! Suppressing the excitement in his heart about the Dao, Li Che took a deep breath, his emotions in turmoil but not exploring them.</p><p></p><p>With the sound of the bronze bell being struck, everyone in the wood carving shop put down their things, and the atmosphere became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The door to the courtyard was opened, and the wind and snow rushed in, with several figures swarming in.</p><p></p><p>The two leading figures, wearing fox fur cloaks and bound headpieces, had sharp gazes and a strong aura, as if they could captivate one's soul just by being observed.</p><p></p><p>Their vital energy was powerful, and the wind and snow did not cling to them, as if they had walked out of the blizzard without a single snowflake touching them.</p><p></p><p>These two were the second and third shop managers of the Xu Family Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the outer city Xu Family Wood Carving Shop was managed by the third shop manager, Xu You, while the big shop manager, Xu Heli, and the second shop manager, Xu Beihu, resided in the inner city. Today, for the assessment, the second shop manager, Xu Beihu, had come in person.</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family Wood Carving Shop in the inner city was not weak at all, and could even be considered powerful, mainly due to these three shop managers, each of whom was a top-notch expert, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>After entering the shop, they removed their fox fur cloaks and sat down on the armchairs, casting a faint gaze over the gathered apprentices.</p><p></p><p>"The wood carving master assessment in our shop is held once a year, and three people are selected each time to become formal wood carving masters. After that, they can receive a fixed monthly salary of five taels of silver, and the shop will take 40% of the sales revenue of their carved products, the rest belonging to them."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, after becoming a wood carving master, with each annual assessment, if they advance one level, the shop's share will be reduced by one percent, and their monthly salary will increase."</p><p></p><p>The third shop manager, Xu You, sat upright, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. He had a clean-looking appearance and a gentle temperament.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the second shop manager, Xu Beihu, lived up to his name, with a majestic and imposing presence, sitting upright like a straight bamboo, his vital energy surging like a raging furnace.</p><p></p><p>After the third shop manager finished speaking, the second shop manager also spoke, his voice like a great bell, causing a wave of wind to rise in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming an official wood carving master in our shop gives you the qualification to practice martial arts and cultivate inner strength. If you want to go further and higher in the path of wood carving, inner strength is indispensable. Our Xu Family Wood Carving Shop has been passed down for two hundred years in Feilei City, and without some martial prowess, we wouldn't be able to safeguard this family business."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, by choosing to participate in the assessment, you are tacitly agreeing to join our Xu Family, and become one of us. If there is any betrayal, don't blame us for being merciless."</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Beihu, hate traitors the most!"</p><p></p><p>His rough words echoed like a tiger's roar, shaking the hearts and minds of every apprentice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Now, those who wish to continue the assessment, please come forward to register and receive the assessment wood materials."</p><p></p><p>After the intimidation of the second shop manager Xu Beihu, the gentle words of the third shop manager Xu You came like a spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Many apprentices hurriedly and orderly went forward to register their names and receive the wood materials.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, go on." Old Chen chuckled, taking a sip of wine and squinting his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his fists and also went to register.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che?" The third shop manager Xu You, who was responsible for the registration, saw that Li Che had indeed come to register, raising his eyebrows slightly, showing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, when Li Che had come to see him, he didn't take it seriously, as every year there were some workers who were envious of the high income of the wood carving masters and wanted to try their luck at the assessment, but most of them would give up after a few attempts at wood carving.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Li Che, who really came to register for the assessment, was still quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Was it because he lacked self-awareness, or did he truly have the skills and abilities?</p><p></p><p>"There have been precedents of workers becoming wood carving masters, I hope you can give me some surprises, do your best." Xu You, being a gentle person, encouraged him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded and, after selecting a piece of wood, went to stand at a workbench.</p><p></p><p>After all the assessment participants had selected their wood materials, the third shop manager Xu You stood with his hands behind his back, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, and said calmly, "The assessment topic for this wood carving is... the four-armed Bodhisattva holding a child."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the third shop manager removed the red cloth covering the wooden sculpture on the table, revealing its true form.</p><p></p><p>A four-armed Bodhisattva holding a child statue stood on the table, its four arms outstretched in different poses - one hand making a gesture, one holding a pure jade vase, one grasping a ruyi scepter, and the last arm embracing a smiling boy with a topknot.</p><p></p><p>"Sssâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Sounds of sharp intakes of breath.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of carving came from the mouths of many apprentices.</p><p></p><p>This year's exam question... is actually so difficult?! Even the surrounding master craftsmen who were watching couldn't help but express their surprise.</p><p></p><p>In previous years, it was just a regular Buddha statue, but this year there's an extra child... and it also requires four arms.</p><p></p><p>The more arms a wood carving has, the more difficult it is to grasp the overall composition, control the error rate, and test the carving skills.</p><p></p><p>Difficult, difficult, difficult! Master Chen smacked his lips: "Little Li's luck is really something... He's so unlucky, this exam question, even if he tries to fake it, he won't be able to."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared at the four-armed Buddha statue, and in his heart, he secretly felt relieved...</p><p></p><p>His luck is pretty good!</p><p></p><p>It's a type he's touched before! Stable!</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had previously carved a "Nine Children Holding Lotus" that earned him 150 taels, which Li Che had already familiarized himself with, allowing him to learn child carving. Furthermore, the six-eyed Buddha statue had also provided Li Che with Buddha carving techniques...</p><p></p><p>The only shortcoming is... the four arms part.</p><p></p><p>But with his level 2 Dao Fruit Immortal Craftsman skills, Li Che was confident he could carve it out! "The key is to put more effort into the connotation."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought to himself, making a plan for his upcoming assessment.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to hide his skills, but the connotation, that esoteric thing, could only be attributed to natural talent.</p><p></p><p>A mere porter, if he were to display craftsmanship no weaker than the master carvers in the workshop... it would be hard to explain.</p><p></p><p>"The assessment time is four hours, when the hour is up, all tools must be put down, violators will be disqualified, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper Xu Beihu stood up, issuing a warning with a strong sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>All the apprentices, including Li Che, responded.</p><p></p><p>"The wood carving apprentice assessment of the Xu Workshop in the outer city is now beginning!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu waved his big hand, and a powerful voice surged through the workshop.</p><p></p><p>Four hours to carve the "Four-Armed Buddha Holding a Child" statue, the time was tight and not very generous.</p><p></p><p>So the apprentices didn't dare to waste time, holding the wood materials, they started sketching, using ink lines to outline the shape.</p><p></p><p>These wood materials had already been dried, saving some steps.</p><p></p><p>Li Che placed the wood on the workbench, reached out to touch it, and in his mind, he outlined the outer and inner contours. After a moment, he started using a wolf-hair brush to draw lines on the wood.</p><p></p><p>On the workbench, there were axes, hammers, saws, files and other tools prepared for roughing out the initial form.</p><p></p><p>Roughing out is actually to summarize the design into simple geometric forms, and the overall concepts of layers, momentum, proportion, and center of gravity must be reflected in the roughing out.</p><p></p><p>Roughing out is very important, and it is also the most demanding of natural talent.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the apprentices who had finished outlining the lines began to clang and chisel...</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit shook, Li Che closed his eyes and opened them again, and his entire demeanor seemed to have undergone a earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was standing beside him, holding a wine gourd, and the moment Li Che picked up the carving knife, the moment his demeanor transformed, he was stunned, looking at Li Che, as if he was looking at... his younger self.</p><p></p><p>"This kid... his demeanor is quite impressive." Chen Dabao muttered.</p><p></p><p>However, as Li Che began to carve and outline the rough form, Chen Dabao narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The wood chips were falling off, the sharp blade penetrating into the wood, tearing apart the connections between the wood fibers, leaving traces.</p><p></p><p>The rough lines had already outlined the overall rough form.</p><p></p><p>Time slipped away like sand between the fingers, dripping away bit by bit amidst the rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The third shopkeeper Xu You walked slowly, not hurried or slow, passing by the workbench of each apprentice, checking their progress and level.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's footsteps stopped, he glanced at the seemingly statue-like standing Chen Dabao, slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>Following Chen Dabao's gaze, he saw the courageous porter Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Looking so engrossed?" </p><p></p><p>Xu You's heart was suddenly filled with curiosity, to be able to attract the attention of the veteran four-knife master Chen Dabao...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this porter really has some potential?</p><p></p><p>Xu You strolled, slowly approaching, his eyelids lowered, his gaze falling on the focused carving face of Li Che, then shifting.</p><p></p><p>Falling on the wood carving on the workbench...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

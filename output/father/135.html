        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Creak—</p><p></p><p>The heavy temple doors thunderously opened.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo, dressed in a white robe with flowing black hair, stepped out from the main hall. The ground seemed to shrink beneath his feet as he took each stride, covering several meters with each step.</p><p></p><p>Elder Yuan and the anxious Sang Guanyin, who were standing outside the main hall, both turned to look at the exiting Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>"Young master."</p><p></p><p>Elder Yuan cupped his fists and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo nodded, then looked at Sang Guanyin: "Describe the specific situation in detail."</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin hurriedly recounted in detail everything that had happened during the monthly assessment, not daring to omit anything.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo stood with his hands behind his back, listening quietly with a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>After carefully listening, his brow furrowed, and a hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly outrageous."</p><p></p><p>"To use a child as a weapon, this was truly unexpected... But it was also because Shangguan Qinglei had resentment in his heart, and thus could not withstand the temptation, becoming the blade of those from the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xixia alright?"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin nodded: "She's fine. Elder Zhang intervened in time, blocking the scheme of that Corpse God Sect villain, but that Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal somehow disappeared without a trace..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nan Liehuo's brow raised slightly: "It seems someone intervened secretly. Given Zhang Qingzheng's abilities, the Corpse Curse Seal could not have simply vanished into thin air. Based on his temperament, he most likely drew the Corpse Curse Seal into his own body."</p><p></p><p>"Are there still high-level experts within the Divine Sect that we are unaware of?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>On the Great Plateau of Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Another person came rushing over - it was Liu Yangyuan, accompanied by a disciple from the Healing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Sect Master, Shangguan Qinglei... has been killed."</p><p></p><p>"His five viscera and six organs, all turned to blood... The method was extremely cruel!"</p><p></p><p>The disciple from the Healing Pavilion reported solemnly with cupped fists.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the atmosphere in front of the temple became cold and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying pressure that distorted the space erupted from Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>"Good... good, what a vicious person!"</p><p></p><p>Killing to cover up, huh...</p><p></p><p>"Master, Instructor Zhu has gone to the Shangguan Clan and is currently fighting with the Ancestor Elder Shangguan Jie of the Shangguan Clan..."</p><p></p><p>The handsome and ominous face of the third disciple, Liu Yangyuan, wore a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Let her continue her rampage. She has been bottling up her anger anyway. Xixia was supposed to enter her Red Cloud Peak, but I intercepted her, and now she has a place to vent her anger. The Shangguan Clan has brought this upon themselves."</p><p></p><p>"With Shangguan Zhenghe in front and Shangguan Qinglei behind, the Shangguan Clan... has poor upbringing."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said indifferently, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they aren't killed, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo looked calm and gentle on the surface, but he was actually a protective person.</p><p></p><p>"Who needed Shangguan Qinglei silenced?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and check on Xixia's condition first. The Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal is no small matter... If there is any influence, it will affect her for life."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said softly.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Elder Yuan quietly retreated, disappearing into the darkness to continue guarding the temple.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan was dispatched to keep an eye on Zhu Hongdou's side, to prevent the situation from deteriorating further, lest Zhu Hongdou truly lose her temper, which would not be good.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangyuan's expression was stiff.</p><p></p><p>"Master, me? You're asking me to stop Instructor Zhu?"</p><p></p><p>That was the explosive Elder Zhu Hongdou, after all. Once her temper flared up, even the dogs passing by would get kicked...</p><p></p><p>The master actually asked him, Liu Yangyuan, to stop her, was he serious?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he want this disciple anymore? Liu Yangyuan was extremely unwilling, but seeing the retreating Nan Liehuo, he could only grit his teeth and head out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar that shook the soul reverberated.</p><p></p><p>On the celestial chessboard, all the pure-hearted chess pieces trembled and shook at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was in turmoil, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the divine essence extracted from the Golden Divine Temple would be...</p><p></p><p>So intolerant of evil!</p><p></p><p>Li Che hadn't even tried to use the divine essence chess piece yet, but it had already shot forth and suppressed the White Bone Palm.</p><p></p><p>Dissolving the death qi and corpse qi, it was overwhelmingly powerful, restoring the world to clarity. "The Heavenly King... truly worthy of being the Heavenly King, not tolerating even a speck of dust in his eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the shattered White Bone Palm.</p><p></p><p>The broken bones and the death qi and corpse qi disappeared, but after the white bones faded, it turned into a Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely similar to the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal, but its power was even more ominous and terrifying, like a black hole, floating on the chessboard, devouring all light and heat.</p><p></p><p>The Black Gold Heavenly King divine essence chess piece did not seem to have any further rejection or action towards the remaining Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Corpse Curse Seal floated on the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly mobilized the pure-hearted divine spirits to go and suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal was indeed more difficult to suppress and tame than the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>The surging and gushing black divine power shattered one pure-hearted divine spirit after another.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che continued to send the pure-hearted divine spirits to suppress and gradually refine it.</p><p></p><p>Although it was slow, there was still hope that he could eventually complete the full suppression and refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Once I have completely suppressed this Corpse Curse Seal, I should be able to detect other Corpse God Sect experts who have been bestowed Corpse Curse Seals, just like the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal..."</p><p></p><p>"The Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal can detect those who have been bestowed the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal. At that time... the Corpse God Sect expert hidden within the Divine Sect will definitely have nowhere to hide!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed. This was the leverage he had grasped against the other party. The hidden Corpse God Sect expert within the Divine Sect, if they did not make a move against Xixia, they would not expose their identity and be caught by him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wished he could immediately complete the suppression and refinement of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal, but ultimately, he was constrained by his own cultivation level and could not do so.</p><p></p><p>Although he was anxious, Li Che also knew that such matters could not be rushed.</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, Li Che opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sitting quietly in the room, he tapped the sandalwood table and chair with his fingers, then thought of something and took out Shangguan Qinglei's Spatial Jade.</p><p></p><p>His powerful divine sense directly tore through the barrier of the Spatial Jade.</p><p></p><p>He could then sense the contents inside.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many things, nor were there any valuable items, after all, it was just the Spatial Jade of a seven-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>After a simple scan, he checked if the mastermind had left any clues behind.</p><p></p><p>The other party's methods were very clean, and they had not left any traces.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up, Li Che stood up, and his bones and muscles crackled with vibration.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power seemed to have grown stronger than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... my divine sense seems to have grown stronger?"</p><p></p><p>"In the celestial chessboard, controlling the pure-hearted white chess pieces against the white bone palm formed by death qi and corpse qi, it seems to have strengthened my divine sense?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was surprised.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that the strength of one's divine sense was related to the cultivation of one's divine foundation. The stronger the divine foundation, the stronger the divine sense would be.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the divine foundation was accompanied by the tempering of the divine sense.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the divine sense was tempered, the easier it would be to break through to the Divine Manifestation realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Che had discovered a way to specifically temper his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"The process of refining and suppressing the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal will also strengthen my divine sense..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled. Well, this could be considered an unexpected gain from this operation.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not found the culprit, he had resolved the issue with Shangguan Qinglei and the threat of the White Bone Palm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood was slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Without continuing to seclude himself in the room, Li Che directly opened the door and left.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sat in the distance, observing the Divine Manifestation, his entire being exuding the powerful pressure of the Divine Manifestation realm. He was only a step away from breaking through to the Divine Manifestation realm.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing Li Che coming out of the room, his eyes opened and closed, and countless lightning bolts intertwined, the powerful Exorcism Qi in the form of invisible ripples thundered and expanded outward.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked over from afar, and Li Qingshan slowly restrained his aura, the Thunderous Divine Manifestation gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, with the roar of thunder surging.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was startling.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled as he walked towards Li Che: "Is it resolved?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, knowing that Li Qingshan was probably referring to the matter of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal. Li Che did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>Since he could suppress the Corpse Curse Seal and detect it, this was the foundation of their cooperation, and there was no need to hide it.</p><p></p><p>"However, it will still take some time to completely suppress it. The Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal is indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan naturally nodded: "The fact that you can suppress the Seven-Element Corpse Curse Seal is already beyond my expectations... Take it slow, remember to be stable, and don't let it infect you. If you get infected, the consequences will be severe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che also understood Li Qingshan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>Li Che responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked towards the distant Seven-Element Divine Statue, his gaze deep and his voice solemn: "Old Master, it's almost time."</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before I can break through to the Divine Manifestation..."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm afraid there are quite a few people in the Golden Light Prefecture, and even the entire Divine Sect, who don't want me to break through to the Divine Manifestation."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood with his hands behind his back, the mountain wind blowing his clothes, outlining his figure.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... they will try to stop you?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Deliberately come to disrupt the breakthrough?" </p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Qingshan suddenly say this, Li Che couldn't help but make a guess.</p><p></p><p>"It should be said that there will definitely be someone who will come to disrupt it..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's from within the sect or outside the sect, it's the same. In the city of Jingguan, I've beaten all five major sects, and the five major families are the same."</p><p></p><p>"They naturally don't want me to break through the Divine Appearance Realm the most..."</p><p></p><p>"Once I become a Divine Appearance, they won't have many good days left."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stretched lazily, quite carefree.</p><p></p><p>Then, he lazily looked at Li Che and smiled: "How about it? Are you interested... in lending me a hand?"</p><p></p><p>"Call Ma Mian... I need his sniping ability."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I become a Divine Appearance, I can give an Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal as a reward."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was very generous.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent, implying that if he failed and died halfway, the promise of the Divine Essence Crystal would be void.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qingshan had the suspicion of "catching a white wolf with bare hands", Li Che's eyes still flickered slightly. The Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal... would be enough for Ma Mian to take action once.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Eight Extremes Divine Appearance Realm is indeed a good thing, but it's not that easy to get. It's quite hot.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's assault on the Divine Appearance must not be anywhere else, but definitely on the ZhengLei Peak, which is within the scope of the Shengzong Mountain Gate.</p><p></p><p>And those who dare to attack the Shengzong Mountain Gate...</p><p></p><p>Basically, they won't be weak, at least they will be at the Void Appearance Realm, or even possibly a Divine Appearance Realm battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Che began to ponder whether or not to get involved in this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Please ask Ma Mian to snipe once, and no matter whether he succeeds or not, I will give the reward. After the one shot, he can stop and not bother with anything else."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Ma Mian's shot had pierced through the cursed bronze corpse of Shangguan Zhenghen, that terrifying penetrating power, even if Li Qingshan encountered it, he would be troubled.</p><p></p><p>After all, his body is not as hard as the cursed bronze corpse.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was also thinking from the other side. If it were him facing Ma Mian's explosive shot, such a terrifying killing machine...</p><p></p><p>Unless he was well prepared, he might not be able to block it suddenly.</p><p></p><p>He might not necessarily die, but once hit, he would definitely be seriously injured! So, having such a Ma Mian on his side would make him feel more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Although Ma Mian is Li Che's friend, for this kind of hidden sniping, if others offer a higher price, he can only be on the opposing side.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Qingshan wanted to talk to Li Che early on, so that he could reserve Ma Mian's schedule first.</p><p></p><p>"Your breakthrough must be within the Shengzong, with the Sect Master presiding, won't you have danger in breaking through the Divine Appearance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't expect Li Qingshan to be concerned about Ma Mian appearing on the other side.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and asked the doubt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Was Li Qingshan too pessimistic?</p><p></p><p>Within the Shengzong Mountain Gate, there are many experts, and there is even the existence of Nanlihuo at the Origin Appearance Realm. Li Qingshan's breakthrough to the Divine Appearance should be the safest, unless his own breakthrough fails.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che deeply: "Didn't Xixie also suffer an attack within the Shengzong?"</p><p></p><p>"What makes you think I will be safe in breaking through the Divine Appearance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even with Sect Master Nanlihuo presiding... why should it be safe? Li Qingshan took a deep breath, hands behind his back, looking at the myriad of lights in the city below.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>"What makes you sure that the Sect Master... is the most innocent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's words fell.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly shrank, as if a thunderbolt had fallen to the earth, deafening!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Li Qingshan and Li Che returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Ya promised to make her ten delicious dishes such as red-braised pork, sweet and sour fish, and mouth-watering chicken, Xixie finally shook off her dejected state and became lively.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, she pulled Lv Chi, hands on her hips, chest and belly sticking out, like a great emperor, looking down on her evil subjects.</p><p></p><p>"Little Lv Chi, come and fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is now strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie was full of fighting spirit. After fighting with Shangguan Qinglei, she seemed to have some unsatisfied, after all, that evil subject used underhanded tricks, making her very unhappy, not at all fulfilled! So she came to find Lv Chi.</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo and Zhang Ya were a little helpless, but when they saw the lively Xixie, they both felt relieved, knowing that Xixie was not affected by Shangguan Qinglei's Corpse Sect Seven Corpse Curse.</p><p></p><p>Lv Chi, with a big head, scratched his head, looking a bit conflicted and doting at Xixie.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie, how do you want to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"First of all, you can't use your mechanical cannon, and you can't use any divine weapons either, just compare our strength, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Although Lv Chi was only an inner disciple, he had entered the sect a few years earlier than Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Although his spiritual talent was average, he had caught up with the Temple God Resonance, and his Resonance Degree was not bad. Since he had joined Li Qingshan's sect early on, he had not changed.</p><p></p><p>Now Lv Chi is eight years old, and his martial cultivation has reached the level of Blood Transformation Three Stages, and his spiritual cultivation has even reached the level of Cultivating Nature Like a River, and is about to launch an assault on the Divine Foundation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lv Chi didn't expect that the three-year-old Xixie... could catch up with his pace so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Three years old...</p><p></p><p>Xixie is only three years old!</p><p></p><p>Lv Chi recalled what his cultivation was like when he was three years old? Hmm...</p><p></p><p>Still unable to freely control urination and defecation!</p><p></p><p>"Come on, evil subject Lv Chi!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie's eyes seemed to have flames burning, full of fighting spirit, Xixie the Great Emperor must use her strength to conquer all evil subjects, not by beauty!</p><p></p><p>Since Xixie had a dream of becoming Xixie the Great Emperor and making her father an evil subject, at her young age, she already had the goal of becoming an emperor.</p><p></p><p>A butterfly landed on Xixie's shoulder, getting nervous, its wings opening and closing, like a puppy baring its teeth at a stranger.</p><p></p><p>However, Xixie and Lv Chi's peak battle never erupted.</p><p></p><p>Because Nanlihuo in white robes came floating, with Sangguanyin following him.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nanlihuo, Xixie immediately put down her fists, with a bit of docile and ridiculous cupping her hands and saluting.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie, come, let your teacher take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Your teacher was in seclusion before, and did not expect such an event, it is the fault of your teacher."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said gently.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, shrank the distance in an instant, and appeared beside Xixie.</p><p></p><p>His two fingers were pinched into a sword finger, and he pointed at Xixie's forehead, his powerful divine sense wandering around, and then withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, she has not been infected by the Corpse Curse, good news."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Sangguanyin, who was standing beside him, also had a nervous look on her pretty face, but finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Since the teacher said there was no problem, then there must be no problem. After all, the teacher's cultivation was at the Origin Appearance Realm, standing at the pinnacle of the Divine Appearance, his divine sense was so strong that she could not imagine it.</p><p></p><p>He was on the same level as the Zhenmiao Supervisor, the Qintian Monitor, and the Jingguan Prefecture Lord!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Li Che and Li Qingshan came together.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Nanlihuo, Li Che's footsteps suddenly paused, thinking of Li Qingshan's guess, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly adjusted his mood, and a gentle expression appeared on his face, just like Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's footsteps paused again, and he subconsciously touched his own face.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was an old actor, quite calm in front of Nanlihuo, even though he had suspected Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo glanced at Li Qingshan and Li Che, but didn't pay much attention, Li Che was brought back from Feilei City by Li Qingshan, so their good relationship could be understood.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, this time it was my negligence. I was in seclusion and did not expect that the people of the Corpse Sect would be so ruthless as to use a child for assassination, which I really did not expect."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said gently, his voice giving people a sense of spring breeze and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che felt very uncomfortable. Although he always smiled gently, once he put on the Ox Demon Mask, he would become reckless, arrogant, crazy, and malicious...</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master Nanlihuo... won't he be the same kind of person?</p><p></p><p>The gentleness... is it all just a disguise?</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master was in seclusion? This matter is not the Sect Master's fault, it is just that the evil people of the Corpse Sect are truly hateful! That Shangguan Qinglei was bewitched by the Corpse Sect within the Shengzong... Your Excellency the Sect Master, this matter must be taken seriously."</p><p></p><p>"The safety of Xixie is what we parents are concerned about."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo nodded: "Don't worry, this time the Sect Master will thoroughly investigate."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan snorted disdainfully beside him: "Thoroughly investigate... How can it be that easy to investigate?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan immediately piled up a smile and approached the Sect Master: "Your Excellency the Sect Master, how about leaving this matter to me?"</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Qingshan's words fell.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying and majestic Divine Appearance aura rolled in from outside the Zhenglei Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, do you want to snatch the case from my Liujian Peak Enforcement Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"But have you asked if my Liujian Peak agrees?"</p><p></p><p>A faint voice, with a touch of coldness.</p><p></p><p>With black hair flying, carrying a suppressed divine sword, the elder of the Liujian Peak Enforcement Hall, Xu Jiuqing, in white robes, floated over.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the sword qi flowed with light, like chains hanging down, binding a middle-aged man, as if escorting a prisoner.</p><p></p><p>I'm stuck here, this chapter has been rewritten and edited for a long time, this chapter is only 5,000 words, being naked all the time really tests the enthusiasm for writing books. I rely on monthly tickets, recommendation tickets, and the growth of readers to maintain enthusiasm every day... Old Li asks for your support, thank you all!

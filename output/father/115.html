        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous roar echoed across the heavens, and the flashing lightning illuminated the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>A cute bovine mask, dotted with raindrops, had a gaze that pierced through like observing a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng's hairs stood on end, and in that moment, he felt as if his very blood had frozen over.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon? </p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon!!!</p><p></p><p>No, how dare he?!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng's eyes narrowed, the malice within them spreading like ink. A strong resentment and murderous intent erupted from him. The absurd and ridiculous emotions welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Had he, Liu Jinsheng, fallen so low? A mighty Xiu Xiang cultivator, and this Ox Demon dares to come hunt him alone? The audacious creature! Liu Jinsheng's killing intent towards the Ox Demon was stronger than ever before. If not for this Ox Demon, how could he have ended up in such a state?</p><p></p><p>Every time he tried to capture the Ox Demon, the creature would escape using its unique teleportation art. Cunning and vicious, it was also incredibly slippery.</p><p></p><p>Mastering the teleportation technique made it an extremely troublesome foe. </p><p></p><p>However, the Ox Demon had never dared to directly clash and fight with Liu Jinsheng, for its strength was not truly formidable, only capable of killing the subordinates of the Fishing Clan.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Ox Demon actually dares to take advantage of his weakened state? How utterly...</p><p></p><p>Ignorant of its own demise! Boom! A roar of outrage erupted from Liu Jinsheng's mouth, the powerful true qi of a Grandmaster gushing forth, accelerating the generation of new blood within him.</p><p></p><p>The illusory divine form that had previously been shattered by Li Qingshan's strike now struggled to coalesce, covered in cracks and greatly diminished in power.</p><p></p><p>But it was still an illusion! Countless airflows surged, the rainwater shattered and dispersed into a mist of droplets by the divine energies.</p><p></p><p>The obscure divine energies, as if awakening from slumber, slowly coalesced within the blurring airflows.</p><p></p><p>He, Liu Jinsheng, could not defeat Li Qingshan, and now he cannot defeat this Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>A cowardly and evasive scoundrel! Boom! The ground instantly shattered, the countless fragments crushed into fine powder by the terrifying illusory pressure, the dust billowing up violently.</p><p></p><p>Though wounded, Liu Jinsheng was not the least bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>So be it. It has come to meet its demise!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng had never feared the Ox Demon. Compared to Li Qingshan, the Ox Demon excelled in cunning and slipperiness, its teleportation art the most vexing. </p><p></p><p>But in a direct confrontation, ten Ox Demons would not pose as great a threat as one Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng's eyes narrowed as he saw the Ox Demon's burly figure lunge forward.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, six black, crow-like objects fell to the ground, accompanied by six thunderous explosions.</p><p></p><p>Countless fine powder from the ground, ground from divine crystals, flew up and enveloped Liu Jinsheng.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." </p><p></p><p>Powder from ground divine crystals?! Liu Jinsheng's eyes narrowed as he recognized the substance swirling around him, his heart sinking with a sense of dread! He stomped down hard, the terrifying true qi gushing out from his body, and slammed a palm towards the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The surging, rumbling airflows scattered the rainwater, attempting to knock down all the powder. "The powder of the Eight Extremes Divine Crystals... my divine energies... I can't move them!"</p><p></p><p>His heart plummeted.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng felt his fragmented divine form, forged from his pent-up fury, become blurred and distorted, severing the connection to the divine energies in his Nirvana Palace.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the already weakened illusion completely collapsed!</p><p></p><p>What a clever Ox Demon! Knowing the divine energies were too difficult to contend with, it had obtained the Eight Extremes Divine Crystals, ground them into powder, and detonated them to create an area restricting the use of divine energies!</p><p></p><p>It intends to bring the two of them to the same level, to clash with just martial qi and blood? How clever!</p><p></p><p>In a contest of divine energies, the Ox Demon would certainly be no match for him. The Ox Demon could not possibly have cultivated a Six Saintly Divine Foundation like Li Qingshan, and even Li Qingshan's Six Saintly Divine Foundation was not as powerful as the divine energies of the Xiu Xiang.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's strength lay not only in his Six Saintly Divine Foundation, but also in his Grandmaster physique, having mastered the divine sect's supreme skill, the "Eight Serpents Overturning the River Technique." That was the true source of Li Qingshan's power.</p><p></p><p>So, what does the Ox Demon have? Even without his divine energies, he was still a Qi Martial Arts Grandmaster! The Ox Demon showed no fluctuations of true qi, clearly not a Qi Martial Arts Grandmaster, how could it possibly contend with him?</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his fingers, he grabbed a long saber from the Qiankun Jade and swung it fiercely towards the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Massive true qi converged into this single strike, dazzling like the brilliant sun, instantly slicing through the air, the wailing and tearing of the airflows echoing as it was shattered!</p><p></p><p>The brilliant saber light, wrapped in rolling true qi, seemed to cleave open the void left by the divine crystal powder!</p><p></p><p>A Grandmaster's strike, the Ox Demon shall die! Poof! Liu Jinsheng's lips curled up in a smile, the single strike slicing into the Ox Demon's body, the Ox Demon mask shattering into pieces as it was split in two from the shoulder down.</p><p></p><p>So easily accomplished, the strike like chopping vegetables...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, nothing more! However, Liu Jinsheng soon realized something was amiss, for... there was no blood!</p><p></p><p>No scent of blood!</p><p></p><p>The strike that had cleaved the Ox Demon had not spilled a single drop of blood! Liu Jinsheng's eyes narrowed, a sense of foreboding welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Ox Demon he had struck explode, a shower of colorful powder bursting forth from the "Ox Demon's" shattered body!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng, with the physique of a Grandmaster, was taking in the world with each breath, like a whale swallowing and expelling.</p><p></p><p>One mouthful of the airflow mixed with the powder entered his mouth, and Liu Jinsheng's face immediately turned pale with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Lime? No... lime mixed with divine crystal powder and poison!"</p><p></p><p>"Deadly poison!"</p><p></p><p>"How despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng roared, quickly sealing his mouth and nose to expel the poison he had just inhaled.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng stomped down hard, letting out a furious howl.</p><p></p><p>The long saber in his hand whirled, the blade light enveloping the area, the rushing airflows exploding the surrounding air, preventing the poisonous divine crystal powder from approaching!</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a pressure that made Liu Jinsheng's scalp tingle and his hairs stand on end erupted from behind him. "Boom" The sound of a body breaking free of its shackles, swelling and expanding with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng turned back and saw a towering figure he could never forget.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant golden light burst forth from his eyes, the wisps of golden smoke seeping out from his pupils. </p><p></p><p>Countless thick, vigorous black strands of hair fell to his waist, like a heavy black cloak billowing in the fierce winds! Thick, serpentine veins pulsed beneath his nearly crimson skin, the body of an Indestructible, Perfectly Tempered Iron-like Physique, the embryonic form of a Divine Ability, the Dragon-Elephant Golden Warrior - Ascending the Tower!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon stomped down hard, crushing a black temple chess piece.</p><p></p><p>The exploding black mist instantly shot up, rushing into the Ox Demon's mask-covered nostrils! His inner qi seemed to have taken on a reddish hue, like it was boiling and burning.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon unleashed a White Tiger Raging Winds strike! After reaching the Divine Vein Realm, Li Che had once again activated the Ascending the Tower, and the explosive power of his expanded physique had undergone a qualitative transformation!</p><p></p><p>He had truly manifested the power of the Dragon and Elephant! Channeling the fruit of his cultivation, one strike like the ancient giant elephant swinging its trunk, amid the trembling and stagnation of Liu Jinsheng's entire body, bones, and blood, with an irresistible and mighty presence, it crashed down upon Liu Jinsheng's chest!</p><p></p><p>Seemingly slow, yet its speed was at the pinnacle, crushing the airflows, slamming ruthlessly into Liu Jinsheng's chest!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant...</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng's Grandmaster physique clearly felt the immense power.</p><p></p><p>A force like the fusion of a dragon and a primordial giant elephant, infused into the inner qi that had struck his body, trampling and whipping through his physique.</p><p></p><p>This was... inner qi?!</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng glared with bulging eyes, his skin flushed red, but powerless to resist as the inner qi that had flooded into him shattered his Grandmaster true qi, his serpentine sinews, tiger bones, and his entire meridian network! A large cloud of exploding blood mist lingered at the site, while Liu Jinsheng himself had been sent flying over thirty meters, his body crashing heavily to the ground, like a ton of weight, the earth sinking, a ring of billowing dust like a rehearsed fireworks display! Liu Jinsheng lay on the ground, his eyes somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>How could he be so strong? How could the Ox Demon be so powerful? The inner qi had torn apart his true qi, sinews, bones, and meridian network!</p><p></p><p>This is... breaking through the meridians? This was Liu Jinsheng's final thought.</p><p></p><p>For after the Ox Demon had struck with that punch, shattering his defenses, it approached like a dark, abyssal mountain.</p><p></p><p>A crimson and dazzling long spear, emanating divine pressure, its trembling tips flashing, like a peacock unfurling its tail, countless spear shadows piercing and falling upon his body.</p><p></p><p>Extinguishing his last breath of life!</p><p></p><p>When the dust had settled,</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the ruins, the towering, mountain-like Li Che, his black, vigorous hair flowing like a cloak in the howling winds, his eyes exuding golden smoke, appeared exceptionally mystical amidst the roaring clouds.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the mangled corpse of Liu Jinsheng in the crater,</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Ox Demon mask dimly glowed, his palm slowly rising, fingers hooking inward.</p><p></p><p>Above Liu Jinsheng's corpse, countless wispy divine energies rose, intertwining and coalescing into a human form.</p><p></p><p>"Binding the divine..."</p><p></p><p>"Bow to me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops were torn apart as figures shot forth like cannonballs, the air trembling and forming rippling waves! Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—</p><p></p><p>Several figures descended, rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Divine energies twisted behind them, forming a blurred divine form.</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure, extremely voluptuous, with the lower body obscured from view, Gongxian Qili furrowed her brow, her Xiu Xiang robe fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>"We're too late."</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Gongsun Liancheng's expression also darkened, stroking his beard.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the edge of the crater, they saw the rotting flesh in the ruins, the corner of his eye twitching involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes, his fingers grasping, and instantly a ball of airflow gathered in his palm.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense spread out, sensing the materials and aura within the airflow ball, his expression becoming rather strange.</p><p></p><p>"Arsenic, indigo, aconite, lime... and divine crystal powder, a vicious method, and this lingering divine presence..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine nature of the [Three-Eyed Furious True Lord] between the earth...</p><p></p><p>"The one who struck must be the Ox Demon, without a doubt," analyzed Gongyang Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>Palace Guard Gong Yunli was greatly surprised, covering his mouth in astonishment. "The Ox Demon? That Ox Demon... actually dared to kill a Void Appearance Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"A critically injured Void Appearance Realm cultivator," Gongyang Liancheng solemnly supplemented.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan struck down, shattering Liu Jinsheng's Void Appearance. The divine power could only exert less than 30%, and the Patriarch's physical body was also beaten by Li Qingshan until he coughed up blood.</p><p></p><p>In all aspects, it was not as good as his peak condition, so calling it critically injured would not be an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>"But for the Ox Demon to be able to do this, it's also quite impressive! Daring to launch a sneak attack when the Fishermen's Gang's experts had laid a heavenly net to capture him, that's really something," Gong Yunli praised.</p><p></p><p>A stream of air shot out, and Li Qingshan floated over with his hands behind his back, wearing a cat-faced mask, and a ram's horn hammer hidden in his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dead state of Liu Jinsheng in the pit, the expression on Li Qingshan's masked face was almost shockingly distorted.</p><p></p><p>That kid... does his courage reach such an extent?</p><p></p><p>Daring to even kill a Void Appearance Realm cultivator? What if, he's not afraid that the Void Appearance might just counterattack him?!</p><p></p><p>That is an existence just a step away from truly possessing the divine appearance realm! After a long while, Li Qingshan exhaled a turbid breath with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>He could only sigh like this.</p><p></p><p>Others may not know who the Ox Demon is, but he can't not know?</p><p></p><p>A year ago, that Ox Demon was just an ordinary blood-changing warrior.</p><p></p><p>Even before arriving at the prefecture city, he had just barely stepped into the Qi Vein Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, he has actually killed a Void Appearance Realm cultivator, even if it was a critically injured one...</p><p></p><p>But a Void Appearance Realm cultivator, even if critically injured, has much thicker blood than a Qi Vein Realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Impressive..." </p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly laughed, feeling that he might have misjudged a bit.</p><p></p><p>This Li Che, perhaps his potential is no weaker than his own daughter, an exceptional spirit child.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan now has an urge to immediately go see a certain someone...</p><p></p><p>However, the events of tonight are not yet over, the storm has just begun, so Li Qingshan can only suppress the anticipation and curiosity in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, he died cleanly, leaving nothing for this old man."</p><p></p><p>"What's there to see in a completely mangled corpse?"</p><p></p><p>"The Fishermen's Gang is done, go settle the accounts, all the misdeeds they've done over the years, now they must pay with their lives."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"The prefecture city... has welcomed someone more resentful of evil than this old man."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the study, the candle light flickered softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly opened his eyes, the chess pieces returning to the Dao Fruit in the board.</p><p></p><p>Removing the wide-brimmed hat, putting away the mask and black robe, Li Che retrieved the [Suspended Willow Wood Body] Sanlian Divine General back into the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, sitting in the armchair, staring blankly at the flickering flames, the smile at the corner of his lips could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinsheng was truly a Void Appearance Realm cultivator, exerting tremendous pressure on Li Che, even though he had already been beaten to a critical state by Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>But he was still no ordinary person, the oppressive feeling brought by the Void Appearance Realm aura was extremely great, although not as powerful as the true Divine Appearance Realm aura, it was still enough to weaken Li Che's combat power by two to three tenths.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che immediately used the powder of the eight-extreme divine essence crystal he had drained, only such a powder could restrict the divine power of the Void Appearance Realm.</p><p></p><p>And it was done in two stages, first using the raven hand grenade to open up the smoke screen, then using the poison and lime mixed with divine essence crystal, ensuring that Liu Jinsheng could not mobilize his divine power.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he could then activate the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Divine Vein, the amplification of the Ascending Tower state was enormous, even awakening the power of one dragon and one elephant! Exerting his full strength, he ruthlessly crushed Liu Jinsheng's bones and sinews, and then unleashed his frenzied bombardment to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"If Liu Jinsheng was not injured, I'm afraid it would still be a bitter battle..."</p><p></p><p>"But a sneak attack is the most cost-effective."</p><p></p><p>"So people, don't get injured easily... otherwise you'll be too easy to attack, it's best to attack others, rather than being attacked by others."</p><p></p><p>Reflecting, summarizing, and innovating, absorbing the lesson of the enemy being beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>Li Che conducted a post-battle review.</p><p></p><p>After the review, adjusting his breathing, exhaling a turbid breath, and calming the turbulence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his eyelids and began to dispose of the evidence, counting the gains.</p><p></p><p>The harvest from a Void Appearance Realm cultivator was enough to make Li Che's heart flutter with excitement and anticipation! Although he was only the deputy leader of the Fishermen's Gang, he was still a Void Appearance Realm expert! Looking around the prefecture city, Void Appearance Realm was already a top-tier expert!</p><p></p><p>His personal collection and treasures must not be mediocre.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for an expert of the Void Appearance Realm level, the treasures and valuables they carry with them are definitely kept on their person for the utmost safety, not left somewhere else.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che was quite looking forward to this harvest.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Li Che focused on was the divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>There were two nine-star divine essence crystals, and then twenty ten-star divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>The harvest was not small! Li Che was still quite excited and thrilled, the feeling of becoming rich always made him linger and indulge.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Li Che a little regretful was that in Liu Jinsheng's collection, there were no eight-extreme divine essence crystals.</p><p></p><p>Well, the eight-extreme divine essence crystals were rare and precious, even if he had any, Liu Jinsheng would have used them for cultivation right away.</p><p></p><p>How could he let Li Che benefit? After confirming the divine essence crystals, Li Che suppressed his excited emotions and began to continue counting the gains.</p><p></p><p>There was one divine weapon, a nine-star superior long sword, worth a considerable amount.</p><p></p><p>As for the elixirs, Li Che was surprised to find three bottles of the Corpse God Sect's ninth-grade superior martial elixir, the Corpse God Ten Thousand Ghost Death Qi Condensed Martial Elixir, each bottle containing nine pills.</p><p></p><p>"This Liu Jinsheng has completely allied with the Corpse God Sect, gaining great benefits, planning to cultivate the Corpse Summoning Body!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flashed, understanding the reason why Liu Jinsheng had so many death qi martial elixirs.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation techniques, Li Che did not have much harvest.</p><p></p><p>The divine power cultivated by Liu Jinsheng was the sorrow divine power of the Seven Emotions, which belonged to the same source as Li Che's [Wail of the Demon-Quelling Ghost].</p><p></p><p>Li Che wanted to establish the Seven Emotions Divine Foundation, still lacking the divine power of fear and worry.</p><p></p><p>The same source divine power technique was not of much use to him.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity... as one of the five major families and sects of the prefecture city, the Fishermen's Gang's treasury must have been so magnificent... I didn't get the chance to see it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt quite heartbroken, pounding his chest and stomping his feet a bit.</p><p></p><p>"They didn't give me time, they should have waited for me, waited for me to become stronger."</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a sigh, Li Che put away the harvest.</p><p></p><p>He began to feel the transformation and improvement within himself from this battle.</p><p></p><p>The flashes of light flickered past his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv3, 20%), Untainted Heart (Lv3, 5%), Chess Saint (Lv2, 68%)]</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit had a significant improvement, killing a critically injured Void Appearance Realm cultivator, a reversal and counterattack, the pressure was not small, and the combat experience was converted into the maturity of the Dao Fruit, which was indeed very impressive.</p><p></p><p>But even more impressive was the advancement of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had absorbed Liu Jinsheng's entire divine power... directly increasing the maturity of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit by 20%!</p><p></p><p>If he could absorb a few more Void Appearance Realm cultivators, he could directly advance to Lv3!</p><p></p><p>In addition to that.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine sense circulated, feeling a slight pain in his flesh, which was the slight strain caused by the activation of the Dragon Elephant power after opening the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Elephant power... one dragon, one elephant, is it because I've opened the Divine Vein?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes slightly, recalling the feeling of the Dragon Elephant power bursting forth in the Ascending Tower state.</p><p></p><p>He took out a Furious Mysterious Serpent Blood Martial Elixir, the powerful stomach lining crushed the elixir shell, and the surging medicinal power diffused throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>In the study, Li Che slowly practiced the White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the roar of the dragon and the cry of the elephant were echoing and resounding amidst the trembling of his sinews and bones!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly opening his eyes, the candle flame flickered, his eyes seemingly glowing, as brilliant as the rising sun! "The Dragon Elephant power... is it a cultivation method derived from the Dao Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit, has it spawned such a cultivation method?</p><p></p><p>Feeling the pressure of the battle, he couldn't help but form this initial impression of such a method.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, with his exceptional martial arts talent, gradually outlined a not-yet-perfected martial art in his mind that was derived from the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Fruit spawns techniques, but the technique is not complete, not perfect, it needs to be gradually written and refined over time."</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing the Dao Fruit to create techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, radiating brilliance, his heart stirring.</p><p></p><p>"In this way... let's call it the [Dragon Elephant True Strength]. By nourishing this strength with qi, blood, inner energy, and spirit, it can continuously improve the explosion limit of the Dragon Elephant Strength."</p><p></p><p>"People nurture the strength, and the strength nurtures the people!"</p><p></p><p>"Now it is one dragon, one elephant, in the future, can it reach ten dragons, ten elephants, a hundred dragons, a hundred elephants, a thousand dragons, a thousand elephants?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was burning with intensity.</p><p></p><p>Although the [Dragon Elephant True Strength] is not yet perfect, Li Che feels that its starting point is already extraordinary, now it is already comparable to the level of supreme martial arts.</p><p></p><p>And the upper limit is extremely high!</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that to break through to the Patriarch Realm, one needs to master a true meaning supreme martial art, this supreme martial art that spawns from the Dao Fruit, isn't it the opportunity for my future Patriarch Realm path?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch Realm technique, he has it!</p><p></p><p>The path to the Patriarch Realm, it's right in front of him! It's just that right now it's only the initial creation of the technique, not very complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Che still needs to continuously innovate, compare it to normal Patriarch Realm techniques, and if he can obtain a few supreme martial arts, extract their essence and integrate them into the [Dragon Elephant True Strength], that would be excellent.</p><p></p><p>That way, he can ensure that in the future, he can charge towards the Patriarch Realm with the [Dragon Elephant True Strength] without any accidents.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme-level martial arts are extremely rare, even if there are any, they are the treasured secrets of various forces... the [Eight Serpents Overturning the River] that Old Li displayed tonight, seems to be the supreme martial art of the Divine Sect, if I were to..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly, unable to help but set his sights on Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon dismissed this idea.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, no need to hurry."</p><p></p><p>"They will all come."</p><p></p><p>Seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes, seeking continued support! Damn, the subscriptions and follows have become numb, Old Li begs!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The rich aroma of alcohol permeated the air without cease.</p><p></p><p>The sound of strings and bamboo flutes was deafening, the enchanting atmosphere eroding one's senses. The graceful movements of the courtesan's waist, undulating like a water snake, were simply mesmerizing, making it impossible to look away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli sipped his fine wine while staring intently at the courtesan's alluring figure, a burning sensation igniting within his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu rubbed his nose, seemingly sensing the unsettling atmosphere as well.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and said in a muffled voice, "Big brother, I'm going out to get some fresh air."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli heard this, smiled approvingly, and gave a slight nod, quite satisfied with Xu Behu's keen perception.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Behu stepped out of the private room, the courtesan's long, pale legs suddenly buckled, and she collapsed into Xu Heli's embrace, her eyes beginning to glaze over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu, with his imposing stature, strode out of the room, letting out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the rain poured down like columns, the howling wind lashing at his face, the moist air enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Behu suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>He stared in astonishment at the distance...</p><p></p><p>There, even in the midst of the raging storm, thick black smoke was billowing up, like a furious black dragon roaring into the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"That's... in the direction of the Yang family!" Xu Behu's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Yang family is in trouble? Didn't they go to the Xu family's Shenxiu Temple to capture the spirit child? Why is there smoke coming from the Yang family's residence? As if realizing something, Xu Behu's eyes constricted... </p><p></p><p>A disaster has occurred!</p><p></p><p>He rushed towards the door of the private room, not even thinking as he burst through it.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, something has happened!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, the screams of women and men immediately erupted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the rain exploded.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure in a wide-brimmed hat, a saber hanging at his waist, his powerful and majestic aura causing the rainwater to part around him as he strode down the street, his dark hair whipping about like writhing snakes, his physique like a mighty python.</p><p></p><p>Following behind him was the anxious-looking Divine Constable Zhang Xiangyang.</p><p></p><p>The two moved in silence, arriving at the Yang family's residence, where the doors had been blown open. </p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of burning wafted out from within.</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, and Zhang Xiangyang's hair stood on end. "It must be the Black Raven that the Ox Demon can make explode and burn!"</p><p></p><p>The young lord Cao Qingsuan's expression darkened as his divine power began to circulate, causing the air to press down on Zhang Xiangyang, making it difficult for him to even breathe. Even as a cultivator at the peak of Nourishing Nature, he was powerless against a Divine Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon?" Cao Qingsuan murmured solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang described the situation, and a ripple of emotion passed through Cao Qingsuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"So the attempt to capture the spirit child at the Xu family's Shenxiu Temple failed? And you say Li Xue, Li Che's daughter, was sitting on the Ox Demon's shoulders, unafraid of him?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan's eyes gleamed with a hint of light. Skilled in mechanical devices and possessing the strange exploding black raven, this Ox Demon... clearly had impressive woodcarving skills as well.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>"Li Che... is that you?!"</p><p></p><p>"Is Li Che the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingsuan's gaze grew pensive as he recalled the composed young man he had seen in the independent workshop, dressed in plain clothes, exuding a calm and scholarly demeanor. That man, now seeming to have a reckless and ruthless side as the Ox Demon, a murderer without conscience.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he is or not..."</p><p></p><p>"A single guess is enough."</p><p></p><p>Rainwater dripped from the edge of Cao Qingsuan's hat, casting his cold eyes in a shrouded light as he pondered for a while before stepping into the Yang family's residence. </p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang dared not utter a word, silently following behind.</p><p></p><p>When the two saw the state of the Yang family's residence, they couldn't help but be horrified.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... how ruthless! "The Yang family..."</p><p></p><p>"Wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi returned to the Xu family's Shenxiu Temple with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat bewildered. He had expected a fierce battle today, but instead... following behind Xixia and the Ox Demon, he had witnessed a grand fireworks display.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the small paper umbrella Xixia was happily clutching, the adorable little girl setting off the fireworks with such excitement, he was truly afraid she might get carried away and start firing at him as well.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Lü Chi, my Ox Demon teacher is so amazing! The fireworks were so much fun!" Xixia was overjoyed, on the verge of ecstasy.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It turns out that setting off fireworks is such a joyful thing.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi couldn't help but feel envious, just like how he had envied Xixia's scooter before, he also wanted to set off fireworks now.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Shenxiu Monastery, Mu Popo hurried over, leaning on her python-headed cane.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, are you alright? Were you injured?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo embraced Xixia, examining her with concern.</p><p></p><p>"That Ox Demon... did he hurt you?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, Ox Ox Shifu is fine, he won't hurt Xixia!" Xixia said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo's expression changed abruptly: "Ox Ox Shifu? You've taken that Ox Demon as your master?"</p><p></p><p>Silly girl! That Ox Demon... plays with poisons, traps, and hidden weapons, his mind is extremely petty, and he even likes to twist off heads, he's definitely not a good person! A true demonic head! Ai, how could this girl take a demonic head as her master? This is truly a sin! Just as Mu Popo was about to say more...</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Li Che, having removed the Ox Demon mask and changed into a clean black outfit, was quickly approaching, holding a paper umbrella and emerging from the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>He had resumed the identity of a loving father...</p><p></p><p>Arriving on time to pick up his daughter from school.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rain soaked the cold, charred bodies.</p><p></p><p>One corpse after another was carried out from the Yang family mansion, the constables from the city lord's yamen solemnly and silently busy with transporting the bodies.</p><p></p><p>So tragic, so terrible!</p><p></p><p>Excluding the family members without cultivation who were sent out of the city, and the old master of the Yang family who had reached the Divine Foundation realm and was missing...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Yang family, one of the three great Lightning Thunder families, had all perished! The Si family at least still had surviving cultivators, clinging to life and continuing the family lineage.</p><p></p><p>But the Yang family...</p><p></p><p>Only the old madam of the Yang family was left, a lone commander.</p><p></p><p>However, for the Yang family, the fact that they still had one Divine Foundation cultivator could be considered good news, as having a Divine Foundation cultivator meant their roots were still there.</p><p></p><p>It's just that... the old madam of the Yang family, although a Divine Foundation cultivator, seemed to be nearly two hundred years old, it's unknown whether her vigor is still there?</p><p></p><p>Whether she can still bear children?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Yang family will ultimately have no successors, and will slowly crumble.</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down from the dark, snaking clouds.</p><p></p><p>As if roaring at the mortal world, silent yet deafening.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, in the luxurious carriage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli and Xu Beihu, the two brothers, blankly watched the charred corpses being carried out, a chill surging from their bodies at the near-extermination of the Yang family.</p><p></p><p>"Coincidental... too coincidental..."</p><p></p><p>In the absolute silence, only the steady boiling of the furnace, Xu Heli suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu looked at him blankly.</p><p></p><p>"It's Li Nuanxi again..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli gazed out at the endless wind and rain, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Whenever there is something involving Li Che or Li Nuanxi, the Ox Demon is sure to appear! Without exception, from the initial incident at the shop with Sun Changbiao, to Lei Chunlian, and then the later deceased Zhao Chuanxiong and others..."</p><p></p><p>"All of them had harbored ill intentions towards the spiritual child Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>"I had speculated about it before, but then denied it, but now... I can no longer be certain, my mind is in a mess..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli lowered his eyelids, covering his face.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his body suddenly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Too late..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I had guessed it, what could I do? It's too late now..."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon has become more and more unscrupulous, it seems... he no longer worries about his identity being exposed."</p><p></p><p>"Killing Zhao Xuanhai, killing Zhou Ruoguan, killing Yang Kaihe... wiping out the Yang family..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli raised his head, his eyes revealing horror.</p><p></p><p>"He has shown his true strength..."</p><p></p><p>Even if he had guessed the Ox Demon's identity... what could he, Xu Heli, do now? He was no match for the Ox Demon anymore. So, should he just go and get himself killed? Listening to the raging wind and rain outside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli took a few deep breaths, his gaze flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since I can guess it, other perceptive people should also be able to discover the Ox Demon's true identity... he won't be able to hide it for long."</p><p></p><p>"Traps, deadly poisons, hidden weapons, ambushes, disguises... how could such a refined and cultured person be so malicious and cruel? Who could have imagined it?"</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, he shouldn't have wiped out the Yang family... the Yang family... still has an old madam at the Divine Foundation realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's expression changed, clenching his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Can your strength shake a Divine Foundation cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you, Ox Demon, can kill Zhao Xuanhai, Zhou Ruoguan, and other divine captains... facing a Divine Foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"You're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>Please keep reading!

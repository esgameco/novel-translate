        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Dabao and Li Che had a good relationship, as a laborer who transported wood materials and finished sculptures every day, Li Che had no hope of passing the master's assessment. </p><p></p><p>At least from Chen Dabao's perspective, he couldn't see any hope for Li Che to become a formal wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Che picked up the waste wood materials from the shop to practice carving after work.</p><p></p><p>But how easy is it to learn wood carving? </p><p></p><p>Based on Li Che's situation, one can only say that he is interested in wood carving, but has not received formal training.</p><p></p><p>And to challenge others' professions and livelihoods with just interest... that's a bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't explain himself or argue anything.</p><p></p><p>What was his basis? In his eyes, there was a gleam of light, and the Xian Gong (Immortal Craft) in his heart was slightly palpitating, as if radiating heat, reflecting his clear future path.</p><p></p><p>He had his own way...</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, if I were you, this year... I would try to learn some farming skills, although I don't have the strength, at least when I need to protect the child, I can stand up and swing my fists."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao stood up, patted Li Che's shoulder, and then went back into the workshop to continue carving the wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered for a moment and felt that Chen Dabao's words made a lot of sense...</p><p></p><p>"Farming skills... if I want to learn, I need to have the channels. I have the Xian Gong, perhaps... I can design some mechanisms to serve a preventive purpose."</p><p></p><p>"Although they say that Lao A-po only targets babies a year after birth, what if...?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, his mind made up.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, he continued his work, transporting wood materials and sculptures.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps knowing that Li Che was also going to participate in the wood carving assessment, many apprentices looked at him with strangeness and vigilance, and even many apprentice workers refused to let Li Che transport the carved wood sculptures.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Che became idle in the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few old masters and regular customers who still sought him out, others basically didn't look for him, and Li Che was happy to be free, starting to ponder the matter of the mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering for a while, he had no clue.</p><p></p><p>Felt like he still needed to go find Old Chen, Old Chen should have a way.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanisms? You little guy want to set up some mechanisms to protect your baby, have some ideas... it's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>"But setting up mechanisms is also an art, I don't understand the profound mechanism masters, but there is a volume of ancient books related to mechanisms in my home library."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen heard Li Che's question, put down the carving in his hand, and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed his hands, his eyes slightly brightened.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Master Chen had a library at home was known to many people in the shop, and it was said to contain many precious ancient books.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen glanced at Li Che and raised a finger: "You can borrow the ancient books, but I, Old Chen, have never done any losing business. These ancient books are extremely rare and precious... one tael of silver per day for you to read."</p><p></p><p>One tael of silver per day? Li Che took a deep breath, and had to say, it was really not cheap.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was still very decisive and nodded, agreeing.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so decisive, also a good father, willing to go all out for the safety of his daughter... if you bargain with me, it won't be just one tael of silver per day."</p><p></p><p>"Just for this fatherly love, no need for one tael, fifty big landscape cast copper coins per day will do for this old man."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che was overjoyed and quickly thanked Chen Dabao, who wouldn't want more money saved.</p><p></p><p>"Bring it tomorrow, remember to bring enough money."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao said a sentence and then buried his head in carving again.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the sky gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che received his day's wages, only fifteen copper coins, nearly a third less than usual.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't mind, after receiving the money, he carefully wrapped the wood material waste he had selected today, and carried it out of the shop.</p><p></p><p>Now, bringing some waste materials home every day to carve and accumulate Xian Gong experience has become a habit for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Today he has carved a new wood sculpture, which should be able to increase some experience.</p><p></p><p>Because of the matter of Lao A-po killing the newborn babies, it is always pressing on his mind like a lingering shadow, so it gives Li Che a sense of urgency to quickly improve himself.</p><p></p><p>Hurrying back home, he saw his wife Zhang Ya sitting on the bed with Xiao Xi, playing with the various small toys carved by Li Che from wood materials, and his tense heart finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Xi, have you missed your old dad?" Li Che's heart settled, and he opened his arms with a radiant smile towards the bed where Xiao Xi was.</p><p></p><p>The one-month-old Xiao Xi was as delicate as jade, fair and lovely, full of milky fragrance, lying on the bed, calling "Ya Ya" and waving her hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and picked up the little girl.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He started strolling around the narrow room, making the little girl giggle uncontrollably. After playing with Xixi for a while, Zhang Ya also prepared the dinner.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Li Che took out the waste wood materials under the oil lamp and began to work on today's wood carving.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the variety of wood carving shops was quite limited, and as Li Che touched each one, it seemed that he might only be able to find a new craft of the wood carving master every few days.</p><p></p><p>Because the Immortal Craft Fruit had already been upgraded to level 2, now he could carve a wood sculpture much faster.</p><p></p><p>[Immortal Craft Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv2, 9%)]</p><p></p><p>His experience had also increased a little.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up, and then his gaze focused as he planned to try making a mechanism.</p><p></p><p>However, he had little concept of mechanisms, but he thought of the extremely powerful crossbow, and began to sketch and design on paper.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The first light of dawn appeared, and the east turned into a fish belly white.</p><p></p><p>Outside the hazy mountains, the clouds surged, and large patches of snow swayed and fell, wrapping the entire Flying Thunder City in a white robe.</p><p></p><p>Li Che got up early, washed up, and began to prepare breakfast. Zhang Ya got up to help, but Li Che pushed her back.</p><p></p><p>"The girl cried and fussed all night, you need to coax her to sleep. Wife, you should rest a bit more, and get up to eat later."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently patted the disheveled black hair of the drowsy Zhang Ya, and she nodded and lay down to sleep again.</p><p></p><p>After finishing everything, Li Che placed the breakfast in the still warm pot to keep it warm.</p><p></p><p>Then he left the earthen house, stepping on the thick snow, and headed towards the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Stepping onto the long street paved with blue flagstones, the howling wind and snow could not cover the ringing sounds - gongs, trumpets, playing and sounding...</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Spirit teaches, to wash away the dust, the reincarnation without worry method, requires the highest wisdom to succeed without being taught..."</p><p></p><p>The chanting voice drifted from the long street, accompanied by the endless footsteps trampling the snow on the blue stones.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, standing by the roadside, lowering his hat brim, and glanced at the long procession of worshippers carrying the vermilion sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>In the sedan chair was a strange three-headed, six-armed child statue, lifelike and shining, obviously the work of a great master.</p><p></p><p>Watching the procession, followed by a group of white-robed believers, both men and women, old and young, their faces gaunt and frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"The Infant Soul Cult..." Li Che took a deep breath, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>No matter who the Infant Soul Patriarch was, his daughter Xixi was his treasure, his everything, his warm family, and what he wanted to protect.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to touch Xixi, it would be the destruction of his family, and even if he had to die, he would bite off a piece of them.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, Li Che braved the wind and snow and headed straight for the Xu Family Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Che's desire to become an official wood carving master at the shop became extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because becoming a wood carving master would allow him to get a house and receive the shop's protection, but also because he would be qualified to learn the shop's internal energy techniques and martial arts...</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craft] Fruit, although it had brought Li Che considerable help, ultimately only enhanced his talent in craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>In terms of personal combat strength, the help was not great.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the shop, the atmosphere was tense, and many of the apprentices had not started working, all conserving their energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately understood that the wood carving assessment was likely to be held today.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was sitting on a bench in the distance, sipping the old yellow wine from a gourd, humming happily with his legs crossed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, come here."</p><p></p><p>When Old Chen saw Li Che, he waved him over. Li Che's eyes lit up, the gloom from seeing the Infant Soul procession dissipated, and he hurried over. Old Chen took out a yellowed leather-bound book from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Compendium of Tang Dynasty Mechanisms' is one of my treasured ancient texts. I haven't really studied it much, but there are many secret mechanism techniques inside, which require quite delicate hand skills, and some even need internal energy and martial arts to assist. Of course, you can try the simpler mechanisms, as long as you're not an internal energy martial artist, you should be able to handle them."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Old Chen." Li Che's face was filled with excitement as he took out fifty copper coins and handed them to Old Chen, then took the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>And the moment his fingertips touched the ancient book, the Immortal Craft Fruit in his chest...</p><p></p><p>Pounded violently!</p>

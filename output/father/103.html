        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light chill after the rain has not yet dissipated, with two parts of spring, the pavilion is newly bright.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain gradually subsides.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qintianjian Treasure Pavilion's second floor.</p><p></p><p>In the examination room, it is as quiet as usual, making the faint sound of the blade tearing through the wooden structure very clear.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is focusing intently on carving the wooden sculpture. Continuing the carving of the wooden sculpture is not too difficult for him, who possesses the nascent divine skill of a thousand analyses.</p><p></p><p>He can almost perfectly inherit the techniques of the previous wood carving master, and even replicate the state of mind of the other party when carving the wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>And replication is just the most basic ability of the "Immortal Craftsman".</p><p></p><p>On this basis, integrating one's own techniques, insights and understanding, and even innovating, is the talent brought by the Immortal Craftsman's Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is that the artistic talent brought by the Immortal Craftsman's Dao fruit is not limited to wood carving alone.</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that he should also be able to master elixirs, divine weapons and the like through the unparalleled artistic talent of the Immortal Craftsman's Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Sasha sasha...</p><p></p><p>Li Che sits upright in the chair, his spine straight, his blood and qi intertwined, vaguely merging with the divine nature permeating between heaven and earth into the "Four-armed Angry Third Prince" wooden sculpture in front of him, which has been completely formed.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sculpture is lifelike, with the wrinkles and grooves of the fingers clearly visible. </p><p></p><p>The angle of the knife falling, the depth of the carving, the changes and size of the openings in the wood structure torn by the sharp knife, are all unfolded in his mind like a scroll.</p><p></p><p>His ten fingers are extremely flexible, the tools constantly changing, carving, engraving, chiseling, gouging, and perforating... various skilled techniques blooming at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closes his eyes, as if carving with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>But with his eyes closed, he can see and feel even more.</p><p></p><p>He even merges his own feelings.</p><p></p><p>In the memories of his previous life, the image of the child deity stepping on the wind and fire golden wheel, holding the red silk and stirring the four seas, gradually appears...</p><p></p><p>Boom! A sound like the bursting of fireworks resounds from outside the treasure pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Thick water vapor surges into the sky, as if the spring rain scattered all over the sky at this moment, forming a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong sitting in the corner is slightly moved, she approaches the carved wooden window and looks out, seeing white waves crashing.</p><p></p><p>"The waves are rising!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong says softly.</p><p></p><p>The voice is not loud, but in the examination room at this moment, it is like a thunderclap, and the two junior supervisors come over and look out through the wooden window.</p><p></p><p>The treasure pavilion is built by the riverside, with a cliff base, and the waves crashing against it cause the water vapor to surge into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Because the waves in the Nine Dragon River tributary in the city are usually very calm, and now a wave has risen, which is very obvious, and the bursting of the waves contains a divine nature.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this guy really has something..." Gongyangliancheng strokes his beard, somewhat amazed.</p><p></p><p>He has really triggered the divine nature contained in the Nine Dragon River tributary, causing the waves, although the waves are not big, but Li Che is only a wood carving master at the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the talent is indeed good, continuing the carving technique and ideas left on the original wood carving... Unfortunately, he should not have learned any 'divine carving techniques'." Madam Gong Yunli also praised.</p><p></p><p>"Purely relying on talent."</p><p></p><p>The two of them naturally have vision, the craftsmanship Li Che has displayed belongs to the mastery of the techniques that ordinary wood carvers possess, almost reaching the realm of transformation, reaching the level of a tenth-level wood carving master, but he has not mastered any divine carving technique inheritance.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the lack of spiritual cultivation and divine nature, he can only reach the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>If he had divine cultivation and inherited divine carving techniques, Li Che would easily become a ninth-level wood carving master.</p><p></p><p>And to obtain the qualification for the second-class guest official examination of the Qintianjian, one must reach the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is an elixir master, a divine painting master, a divine weapon master, or a divine carving master, they are all divided in this way, with the guest official rank as the high and low distinction.</p><p></p><p>Gongyangliancheng and Gong Yunli have basically recognized Li Che's level, and the third-class guest official position is now fixed.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che has not stopped carving, so they have not interrupted.</p><p></p><p>How far can Li Che carve the wood sculpture? And how high can he make the waves in the Nine Dragon River containing the divine nature of the temple god splash?</p><p></p><p>They also want to see.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shua--</p><p></p><p>Li Che's posture with his eyes closed suddenly changes, and when the last stroke cuts through the wooden sculpture, completing the last outline.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sculpture placed on the workbench suddenly comes alive, with angry roars in heaven and earth, and even the sound of waves being stirred.</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that the divine wooden sculpture is constantly absorbing his blood and qi, even greedily trying to draw out the hidden primal energy in his dragon-elephant-vajra dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Elephant-Vajra dao fruit in his chest trembles, like a great sword, cutting off the other party's stealthy attempt.</p><p></p><p>All the blood and qi Li Che has displayed are completely drained.</p><p></p><p>The tranquil divine nature is also completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly retreats a few steps, activating the sweat in his body, appearing very laborious, with extreme consumption of physical strength.</p><p></p><p>For a wood carving master to carve a divine sculpture, it not only consumes physical strength, but also consumes divine nature, exhausting both body and mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, carving a divine wooden sculpture is no longer ordinary woodworking.</p><p></p><p>It's as if illusory flames are burning, that is the divine nature floating in the heaven and earth, the temple god's divine nature in the Nine Dragon River being evaporated and rising, forming a strange phenomenon after being drawn in.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>In the room, Gongyangliancheng and Gong Yunli's eyes suddenly brighten, the two of them instantly appear by the carved wooden window, their gaze falling and looking at the now calm Nine Dragon River outside.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain is drizzling, the river surface is calm, without any waves.</p><p></p><p>The two are stunned: "No waves?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong also sticks out her head: "Shouldn't it be?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's eyes narrowed, she looked towards the end of the Nine Dragon River, there...</p><p></p><p>A white snake rolling across the river surface, a line of river tide separating heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"It's coming..." Gong Yunli took a deep breath, her whole body trembling, with a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>This momentum...</p><p></p><p>Is this the wave that a tenth-level wood carving master can trigger?! The wave rolls from the end of the river, the river water surges, and suddenly a few meters deep.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha--</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a roar-like sound, as if thousands of soldiers and horses were rolling in!</p><p></p><p>The spring rain in the heaven and earth suddenly becomes unruly, the large raindrops mixed with the river water vapor, falling to the ground, splashing on the earth.</p><p></p><p>Even faintly, one can hear the roar, whimper, and sorrow under the river tide.</p><p></p><p>As if an awakening deity, standing on the vast boundless sea, looking around in bewilderment, howling towards the sky and weeping! Unknown how many tears of the gods, turning into a thousand years of angry waves!</p><p></p><p>Bang! The big waves hit the cliff at the base of the Qintianjian Treasure Pavilion by the Nine Dragon River.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! The three standing in front of the carved wooden window see the white waves rise high, actually leaping over the height of the wooden window, pouring down in front of them like a waterfall curtain!</p><p></p><p>Quiet, silent.</p><p></p><p>Also, a bit shocking! The intense divine nature, accompanied by the overturning river waves, permeates the heaven and earth, the concentration is almost five or six times higher than before!</p><p></p><p>Gongyangliancheng is the first to react, his expression slightly changing, his spiritual sense fluctuating, a divine cultivation appearing behind him, the light flowing, vaguely revealing a blurred divine image about to manifest!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the dense divine nature that had enveloped the entire treasure pavilion was all pushed away, but the divine nature in the waves kept coming, as if being evaporated by scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli also joined in the suppression.</p><p></p><p>The two junior supervisors of the Qintianjian joined forces to barely suppress this boiling divine nature.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that the temple god's divine nature is too high in rank...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's beautiful white face is flushed red from the impact.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is panting, his face slightly pale, appearing to have consumed too much, retreating two steps.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a long breath.</p><p></p><p>That is... the temple god's divine nature merged in the river water? The divine nature of the "Eight-armed Angry Third Prince" temple? The tug-of-war lasted for a moment, the waves subsided, and the divine nature also returned to the river current, everything returning to calm.</p><p></p><p>Gongyangliancheng and Gong Yunli both let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>Almost... caused an accident in the examination.</p><p></p><p>They return to the wooden sculpture, their eyes revealing a strange color.</p><p></p><p>"How complete?"</p><p></p><p>"Seventy percent? Certainly not just that... Ninety percent? To be able to trigger such a big wave and provoke the temple god's divine nature in the river to boil like this... even the question setter himself might not be able to carve it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Gong Yunli couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze falls on the wooden sculpture carved by Li Che, but they don't see anything special.</p><p></p><p>But why can it trigger such a wave?</p><p></p><p>A tenth-level divine wooden sculpture, how can it have such divine nature resonance? The two fall into contemplation, but soon they don't think about it too much.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, congratulations, you have passed the third-class guest official examination."</p><p></p><p>Madam Gong Yunli looks at Li Che, her long eyelashes fluttering, her gaze a bit eager.</p><p></p><p>"Give me your identity token, I will activate the divine nature in it, and then you can infuse your own divine nature or blood qi, and it will serve as the credential for your identity as a third-class guest official."</p><p></p><p>Li Che takes out the token and hands it to Gong Yunli.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli takes it and then...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine essence flickered and vanished from her palm, and she then handed the token back to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that the small temple pattern on the token became more lifelike. "Alright, Mr. Li, starting from today, you will be a member of our Qin Tian Observatory's guest officials, enjoying the treatment of an executive. You can use the guest official token to purchase resources within the Qin Tian Observatory and enjoy a 20% discount."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, you are a third-rank guest official of the Divine Sculpture Master, and you can receive a copy of the 'Great Scenery Qin Tian Seven Element Thousand Hand Divine Sculpture Art (Volume 1)'. You must not disclose or spread it externally. You can also take on the task of making divine essence wood sculptures from the Qin Tian Observatory, and the Observatory will only take 20% of the task remuneration."</p><p></p><p>"As for other benefits and treatments, let Senior Official Qin Tian Cheng explain the details to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"We'll take this wood sculpture then, Mr. Li. We look forward to the day when you become a second-rank guest official."</p><p></p><p>The beautiful Madam Gong Yunli smiled gently at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Then, she and Gongyang Liancheng left with the wood sculpture carved by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's small face was flushed, and the redness on her delicate skin refused to subside.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gave her a strange look, observing the flushed face... </p><p></p><p>Miss Shangguan, you are quite something.</p><p></p><p>Making you look like you're having an allergic reaction to the divine essence.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Mr. Li, from now on, you and I will be colleagues." Shangguan Qinghong said with a red face like General Guan.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong led Li Che out of the second-floor assessment room.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, she explained to Li Che the treatments and benefits he could enjoy as a third-rank guest official.</p><p></p><p>When they returned to the first floor, two people were already waiting - Liu He and Hai Chuanying. Evidently, they knew about Li Che's assessment today and were waiting for the result.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the token at Li Che's waist, the two couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Li, on becoming a guest official of the Qin Tian Observatory. From now on, we'll take good care of you."</p><p></p><p>The two saluted, and Li Che returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! With Senior Qingshan's recommendation, how could you not become a guest official? Brother Li, let's go to Yunfang Pavilion tonight! To celebrate your achievement!"</p><p></p><p>Liu He was very enthusiastic. Visiting brothels and listening to music were his specialties. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a guest official of the Qin Tian Observatory, this was a basic professional skill.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong kicked Liu He: "Don't corrupt Brother Li! He's a married man!"</p><p></p><p>"I was just joking, just joking... Oh, I have some good news to tell Brother Li." Liu He laughed and then looked at Li Che, saying, "On my way here, I heard an explosive news."</p><p></p><p>"That Qin Yuqing from the Qin family, the Jade-faced Demonic Rakshasi... offended the wrong person and was shot to death in the Qin mansion! Her death was extremely tragic!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Jade-faced Demonic Rakshasi dead, Brother Li can finally sleep well. That woman was extremely malicious and was about to vent her anger on all the people from Feilei City. Now that she's dead, Brother Li has also gotten rid of a major threat."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know which powerful expert... it's said that he killed her from dozens of miles away! Absolutely terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Liu He shook his head, full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Killing a master from dozens of miles away... even if it was a weakened master, that was still extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Li Che showed an expression of surprise, but in his heart, he felt a great relief, letting out a long sigh, as if a huge stone had fallen to the ground.</p><p></p><p>After all, he only had one chance to use the "Immortal Gunshot Barrett". Whether Qin Yuqing lived or died after that, it was up to her fate.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that Qin Yuqing's fate was not good, and she died a painful death.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was also just hearing the news, and she was instantly surprised: "The Qin family has a venerable Divination Elder guarding them. How could they not stop it?"</p><p></p><p>"They couldn't stop it. I heard that the Divination Elder of the Qin family was furious, and the method of killing used by the other party was a secret technique of mechanisms, so the Divination Elder of the Qin family contacted the Temple Administration, wanting to thoroughly investigate the various forces. After all, Qin Yuqing was the legitimate heir of the Qin family, and she was brutally shot to death within the Qin mansion... The Divination Elder's face was swollen from anger."</p><p></p><p>Liu He spoke in a more serious tone, as he did not dare to laugh too loudly when the Divination Elder was involved.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying, who had been relatively quiet, couldn't help but give Li Che a strange look.</p><p></p><p>They had just told Li Che about the threat posed by Qin Yuqing the day before, and the next day... Qin Yuqing was shot to death in her own mansion.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying naturally did not think that Li Che had killed Qin Yuqing. What cultivation did Li Che have, and what cultivation did Qin Yuqing have? The gap between them was simply too huge.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Che had become a third-rank guest official of the Qin Tian Observatory, his identity was still incomparable to Qin Yuqing's.</p><p></p><p>He just felt that Li Che's luck was really good.</p><p></p><p>"With Qin Yuqing's death, the Jinguang Prefecture City is likely to become chaotic. Before the Divine Sect's disciple assessment, the major forces in the prefecture city were already a bit unruly. The Qin family will probably take this opportunity to make demands from the other major families, and a few markets and gangs are likely to change hands."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Qin Yuqing was the mistress of the Grand Elder of the Jinlie Gate, Gold Xuan, a Divination Realm cultivator who has lived for two hundred years and was very fond of Qin Yuqing, even going so far as to promote her to the core inner disciple, pouring resources into cultivating her."</p><p></p><p>"Now that she's dead like this, this Divination Realm cultivator, I'm afraid he will be even angrier than the Qin family, and will investigate this to the end."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying's words made Li Che's heart tighten slightly, but he did not take them too seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, by killing Qin Yuqing and offending the Qin family, and even adding the Jinlie Gate...</p><p></p><p>It's not like it's that much.</p><p></p><p>Debts don't weigh you down.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are all existences that the current him cannot afford to offend.</p><p></p><p>The group chatted a bit more, and Shangguan Qinghong went to get Li Che's guest official robe and the benefits he was entitled to.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Che received the benefits he gained after becoming a guest official.</p><p></p><p>A guest official robe, a ninth-grade Wu Dan, and a copy of the 'Great Scenery Qin Tian Seven Element Thousand Hand Divine Sculpture Art (Volume 1)'.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Qin Tian Angry Xuanjiang Wu Dan' of the ninth grade, refined with the true blood of the Angry Xuanjiang, its potency is higher than the ninth-grade lower grade. Due to its strong potency, Mr. Li, you should grind it into one-third when taking it... It can be used to accelerate blood replacement."</p><p></p><p>"About three pills should be enough for you to complete the nine-step blood replacement. It will take about two months."</p><p></p><p>"After that, Mr. Li can come and get the Great Thoroughfare Meridian Art. These are all free gifts for becoming a guest official."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong handed the items one by one to Li Che, introducing them.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up a black amber-like crystal stone.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Ten Realms Divine Essence Crystal. Third-rank guest officials receive a monthly salary of ten Ten Realms Divine Essence Crystals. Mr. Li is still in the cultivation stage, right? Refining one Divine Essence Crystal can accelerate your cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Divine Essence Crystals?</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath... This is truly a valuable resource! It's something that can only be accessed in major cities, and in Feilei City, he had never even heard of it before. Cao Guang, as the lord of a city, didn't even have Divine Essence Crystals in his assets.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps he once had them, but they were all refined by him.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Essence Crystals are mostly produced in the mysterious temples of the Bizarre Pavilion... So only the Nine Luminaries Bizarre Temple can produce Divine Essence Crystals," Shangguan Qinghong seemed to know what Li Che was thinking and explained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held the Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>He tried to secretly sense it with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his eyes couldn't help but narrow.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>The divine essence contained in this Divine Essence Crystal...</p><p></p><p>was as pure as the divine essence in the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli and Gongyang Liancheng, the two junior supervisors, carried the "Furious Prince with Four Arms" sculpture carved by Li Che and headed up to the upper floors of the Qin Tian Observatory's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the seventh floor, the two stopped, circling the corridor and arriving in front of a tea room.</p><p></p><p>A faint tea fragrance wafted out from the tea room.</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Supervisor, you will set the topic for the assessment today. The work of the third-rank guest official recommended by Senior Qingshan has been brought, please re-evaluate it."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng carried the wood sculpture, slightly bowing his head respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a faint voice came from the tea room.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli and Gongyang Liancheng stepped into the tea room.</p><p></p><p>They saw a figure in a simple white robe sitting quietly at a yellow pear wood tea table, skillfully brewing tea.</p><p></p><p>"Just place it on the table by the door, don't disturb my tea brewing."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Gongyang Liancheng placed the wood sculpture on the small table by the door.</p><p></p><p>The figure brewing tea took a sip of the tea after it was brewed, but then poured it all out.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they use a cloth to wipe their hands.</p><p></p><p>Slowly opening their eyes and raising their gaze, it fell on the wood sculpture placed by the door.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, the figure in white robes' eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Bring it closer, place it on the tea table."</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Liancheng hesitated for a moment, then picked up the wood sculpture and placed it on the tea table.</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Supervisor carefully examined it, and a trace of a strange color flashed in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This person has been to that Four Guardians Bizarre Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"Observed the temple's deity?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Sun Changbiao's death, his four daughters were taken away by the steward Sun. As for Liu, the one who had led Sun Changbiao to join the Lingying Sect, she was so frightened that she even lost her unborn child. Furthermore, she was driven out of the Xu family compound by the second manager Xu Beihu for joining the sect.</p><p></p><p>The steward Sun then found a courtyard for Liu to stay and recover during her confinement.</p><p></p><p>Since Sun Changbiao's four daughters did not join the Lingying Sect, Li Che did not kill them. However, Sun Changbiao's wife was different...</p><p></p><p>She actively joined the sect and even led Sun Changbiao to attempt harming Li Che's daughter, making her the main culprit.</p><p></p><p>Initially, a witness was needed to provide testimony, so her life was spared...</p><p></p><p>Li Che was worried that this woman would continue to incite the Lingying Sect followers to threaten Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>It was time to clean this up thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Donning his gear, Li Che's figure plunged into the wind and snow, and soon he arrived at the south of Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Within a dilapidated courtyard, the snow was piled up thick and soft.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a stove was burning, and boiling water was "bubbling" and steaming, warming the room.</p><p></p><p>Li Che covered his face with a mask and wore a wide-brimmed hat, dressed in black clothes. He floated silently along the wall and entered the courtyard, stepping on the snow without a sound, until he reached the front of the house.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, incense sticks were lit, and gray smoke lingered endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che poked a hole in the paper window and peered in, seeing a thin figure kneeling before a "three-headed, six-armed, fierce-eyed Lingying statue", constantly kowtowing and rubbing her hands.</p><p></p><p>"The holy teachings cleanse the mundane, the reincarnation without worry method, requires the wise to succeed without being taught..."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme deity above, this humble woman will ensure that the Li family's Lingying is restored, please bless my child's reincarnation..."</p><p></p><p>Liu was reciting ceaselessly, worshipping devoutly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fierce-eyed Lingying statue, Li Che's face under the ox-faced mask twitched, and a glint of murderous intent slowly emerged in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>Raising his arm, the sleeve crossbow shot out a swift arrow!</p><p></p><p>Bang! It directly pierced through the head of the fierce-eyed Lingying statue, pinning it to the wall.</p><p></p><p>This commotion immediately caught Liu's attention in the room, and she became terrified. Li Che couldn't be bothered to waste time, and the sleeve crossbow shot another arrow, piercing through Liu's throat.</p><p></p><p>Liu's eyes widened, but she turned around and stared fixatedly at the direction the crossbow bolt had come from. There was no fear of death on her face, only a crazed smile as blood gurgled from her throat.</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Sect Leader... please..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained calm. There was a trick, but it was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He stomped the ground heavily, causing the earth to tremble, and countless white snowflakes exploded into the air. Li Che's towering figure shot out of the courtyard like a cannon shell.</p><p></p><p>"You thieving scoundrel, where are you running to!"</p><p></p><p>A shrill scream, both crying and laughing, suddenly came from outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's pupils under the mask glanced in that direction and saw a figure leap out, dressed in a gray robe, with a knife at the waist and wearing a crying child's mask, their eyes burning like fire.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was a burly figure crouching on the courtyard wall, wearing a girl's mask and carrying an eight-trigram staff, their eyes seeming to smile and not smile.</p><p></p><p>Powerful aura surged forth, causing the flying snow to melt, and the killing intent intertwined, the howling wind sounding like a ghost's wail!</p><p></p><p>"So, you deliberately attacked my Lingying Sect disciple... Who are you exactly?" </p><p></p><p>The icy voice came from the person with the knife.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared at the knife-wielding person, vaguely feeling a sense of familiarity. He lowered his voice hoarsely, with a probing tone, echoing in the courtyard: "Zhao Chuanxiong?"</p><p></p><p>The courtyard fell silent for a long time, then a deep laugh sounded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, the blade light flashed, and the sharp blade energy whirled in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's foot stomped the ground forcefully, like a divine dragon's roar, an elephant's bellow! The thick snow beneath his feet exploded, and the scattered snow flew like hidden projectiles in all directions! The blade energy swept in, and in front of him was a thick pile of snow.</p><p></p><p>Huh? One slash cut through the snow, but the blade force had already weakened by half. The next moment, he only felt a low hissing in the air, as if something sharp was cutting through rapidly! A glance from under the mask, and he immediately narrowed his eyes!</p><p></p><p>A line! A silver thread! Extremely fine, extremely sharp!</p><p></p><p>The long saber was held horizontally, and he felt a slight force brushing against the blade, sparking a shower of sparks.</p><p></p><p>Then came a series of breaking sounds accompanied by "whoosh whoosh whoosh" - three consecutive arrows whistling through the air!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fuck! He's tall and burly, but his methods are so vicious and ruthless! The deputy sect leader in the child mask, with a long saber in hand, the blade glimmering, stepping back in the snow, deflecting three consecutive crossbow bolts.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't even have a chance to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>Beneath Li Che's cute ox-faced mask, his eyes seemed to blaze with fire, his arm raised, the big sinews taut, like a powerful bow drawn and released! His body shot out like a military crossbow, his towering nearly two-meter frame exuding an immense sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>The punch flew out, like a cannonball, exploding into the hazy, snowy sky! It was not a martial art, just a simple yet pure punch.</p><p></p><p>In a fleeting moment of opportunity, he had closed in on the deputy sect leader.</p><p></p><p>The blade swept out viciously, grazing Li Che's punch, the sword qi rampant, forcefully resisting Li Che's punch, but the two thousand pounds of force exploded out, the torn airflow and gale slamming down with a boom!</p><p></p><p>Crashing into the deputy sect leader's child mask, shattering it into pieces, his disheveled hair revealing a face Li Che was all too familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Chuanxiong..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked coldly at that face, confirming the identity of this deputy sect leader, who was indeed the county magistrate's constable.</p><p></p><p>Killing the Liu family, confirming Zhao Chuanxiong's identity... </p><p>Today's objectives, all accomplished.</p><p></p><p>"Attack! Don't just watch! Let's kill this vicious and cunning evil villain ox-demon!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's expression was extremely gloomy, glaring fixatedly at that cute ox mask, feeling as if it were a demonic head.</p><p></p><p>It was a genuine thousand-pound ox-demon!</p><p></p><p>The figures on the courtyard walls also stood up, slowly drawing the bagua staves from their backs, the powerful qi and blood intertwining.</p><p></p><p>"This ox-demon must be a martial artist who has refined his bones, on par with us, not to be underestimated," Zhao Chuanxiong said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, can't even use martial arts... what's there to underestimate?" </p><p></p><p>The figure on the high wall, wearing a child mask, sneered and suddenly leaped down, holding a staff in one hand, charging towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, feeling a bit of pressure.</p><p></p><p>Looks like he'll have to pull out the big guns.</p><p></p><p>His toes touched the ground, Li Che's body sprang back, but the sleeves of his robe suddenly billowed up.</p><p></p><p>"Ox-demon, take my Bagua Staff!"</p><p></p><p>A staff strike that shook the heavens, countless staff shadows intertwining and overlapping, dazzling the vision! Mighty and grand, the gale was swept aside, the flying snow rushing to the sides!</p><p></p><p>Martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the pressure, in all his martial arts training, he had not yet mastered any techniques...</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was not flustered, his five fingers grasping and pulling, instantly, thousands of spider silk threads densely spread out, wildly swirling within the entire courtyard!</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit had reached level 2, nearing level 3, Li Che was not only skilled in making mechanisms, but had also reached a refined level in deploying them! Countless silver spider threads entangled the powerful Bagua Staff.</p><p></p><p>Using Immortal Craftsman to withstand martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand and immediately unleashed the sleeve crossbow, bang bang bang.</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive arrows pinned down the Bagua Staff wielder, stomping his foot, he leaped up onto the courtyard wall.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape? Where do you think you're going?!"</p><p></p><p>"Raging Blood Saber!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong had now regained his composure, drawing his saber and shooting it out, the blade light swirling, humming brilliantly, the surging blood qi, also a martial art technique, slashing towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gave him a cold glance.</p><p></p><p>His hand trembled, and a large "Avalokitesvara Blood Lotus" suddenly appeared in his broad palm, this was the last of his three hidden mechanisms.</p><p>Also the most powerful one! Crushing the kind-eyed, benevolent wooden Avalokitesvara carving, leaving only the lotus pedestal, which Li Che lightly flicked out.</p><p></p><p>"This vicious ox-demon... also has hidden weapons?!"</p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's heart jumped, but the slashing long saber, the martial art technique already unstoppable, he could only grit his teeth and continue the strike.</p><p></p><p>However, that blood-red lotus pedestal seemed to defy gravity, suspending in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Explode."</p><p></p><p>Then accompanied by a fiery blast, it began to rapidly rotate.</p><p></p><p>Amid the whooshing and rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, as fine as cow hair, wooden needles, like Avalokitesvara's tears, a heavenly downpour.</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of them shot out.</p>

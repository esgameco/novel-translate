        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, dark clouds gathered, lightning snakes tore through the air, and winter thunder boomed.</p><p></p><p>The pouring wind and snow, the drizzling rain, pattered down upon the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The rain drops fell in a string along the edge of the broken straw hat, only to be quickly evaporated by the surging vital energy!</p><p></p><p>Cao He only felt the divinity within him, unable to even circulate it. This was a suppression at the level of divine foundation! This divine foundation was far superior to his own! Ninth Brilliance level, or even Eighth Extreme level?!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Cao He felt his brain buzz with an explosion.</p><p></p><p>When the Ox Demon appeared before him, Cao He was surprised, but not at all worried, even feeling that the Ox Demon was courting death.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was very different from Yang Jing, whose divine foundation had been devoured by divine power, leaving him without any combat awareness, and thus falling prey to the Ox Demon's ambush and being killed by the hidden weapon.</p><p></p><p>Cao He's mind was clear, his divine power abundant. Although he had been slightly injured by Li Qingshan, his vital energy cultivation had slipped a bit, but his divine power was still formidable! A mere Ox Demon, as long as he could evade the Ox Demon's hidden weapons, what other tricks could it have?</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Ox Demon's aura so close by.</p><p></p><p>That scorching heat, like raging flames, made the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power within him unable to surge forth!</p><p></p><p>"Divine...divine foundation?!"</p><p></p><p>Staring wide-eyed at the Ox Demon beside him, the expression on Cao He's face behind the horse-faced mask was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>How could the Ox Demon have a divine foundation?</p><p></p><p>How could it be a divine cultivator?!</p><p></p><p>Hadn't it always been a vital energy warrior?!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the powerful, oppressive divine power emanating from the back of the Ox Demon's head, Cao He faintly seemed to hear countless furious roars.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense seemed to have sensed a majestic existence sitting high above, with a vertical eye blooming between its brows, filled with utmost wrath!</p><p></p><p>"Your divine power...the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord]?!"</p><p></p><p>"No...no! This is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Cao He cried out in near madness! The Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord...</p><p></p><p>In the entire Flying Thunder City, wasn't it only Cao Guang who had successfully cultivated it? Cao Guang had repeatedly performed the mysterious rituals outside the city to obtain the divine foundation technique, and only then had he forged the top-grade Ninth Brilliance Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord divine foundation! How could the Ox Demon before him possess such a divine foundation? In this moment, Cao He's mind was frantically racing, even considering the possibility that the Ox Demon might be Cao Guang in disguise.</p><p></p><p>But this ridiculous idea was soon dismissed by him.</p><p></p><p>Icy killing intent radiated out from the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Cao He's thoughts snapped back, his hairs standing on end, and he quickly bit down on his tongue, the pain from his tongue blooming allowing him to instantly regain his senses.</p><p></p><p>With a shrill cry, the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power gathered and wove on his body, forming the [Amitabha Golden Robe]! The Ox Demon's gripped Shocking Spear then ruthlessly struck!</p><p></p><p>A loud crack! Terrifying force rippled out, the air swirling.</p><p></p><p>The divine art-forged defensive [Amitabha Golden Robe] was pierced through in an instant, the divine weapon Shocking Spear dripping with blood stabbing deep into Cao He's body, tearing his shoulder to shreds!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Cao He's heart pounded wildly!</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain nearly made him lose his mind, the surging vital energy and divine power gushing out from the bloody spear.</p><p></p><p>He commanded his divine sense to mobilize his divine power, and in a flash, the spears behind him whistled as they shot towards the Ox Demon! Although the Ox Demon's divine foundation exerted a positional level of suppression over his divine foundation, it was not the kind of pure boundary level suppression of divine foundation cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So Cao He could still resist a bit! But also...</p><p></p><p>Only a bit.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes flickered, and the next moment, the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] reaching Lv3, he activated the second stage Wrathful Golden Vajra state for the first time! Instantly, Li Yue's body shuddered, a thunderous metallic clanging resounding from his bones and sinews, like exploding thunder!</p><p></p><p>His originally burly frame further swelled, expanding by over a full circle! His eyes shone brilliantly, like the brightest stars in the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The exposed skin seemed cast in molten iron, a network of thick sinews like writhing dragons rippling, the five fingers curving like hooks as they gripped the Shocking Spear that had grown thicker with his body. Perfectly tempered, an ultimate physique! Wrathful Golden Vajra!</p><p></p><p>Matching the [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation, even more so!</p><p></p><p>Wrathful gaze paired with wrathful intent! Like the eruption of a long-suppressed volcanic roar!</p><p></p><p>Boomâ€”! Waves of force rolled out, the Shocking Spear that had pierced through Cao He's body trembling violently, unleashing tremendous power! Surging, turbulent airflow, mixed with the pungent stench of torn flesh and blood!</p><p></p><p>Cao He let out a muffled groan, the spear force exploding within him.</p><p></p><p>Eight Shattering Bone Spear! A supreme martial art!</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Perfected Realm!</p><p></p><p>The eight consecutive vital energy explosions within his body, even with Cao He's profound meridian and vital energy cultivation, made him feel as if his insides had been churned into a muddy mess! His viscera, muscles, and bones, all were smashed to pulp! Unstoppable...</p><p></p><p>Utterly unstoppable! This was the Ox Demon?! Immense fear, killing intent, and unwillingness all burst open in Cao He's heart!</p><p></p><p>Pushing his divine power to the limit, it coiled around the long spears shooting towards the Ox Demon like venomous snakes.</p><p></p><p>But they were easily flicked away by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the spear.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping down with a crash!</p><p></p><p>In a single tremor, it was as if a peacock was unfurling its tail feathers, countless spear shadows engulfing Cao He.</p><p></p><p>Cao He let out a roar, but utterly powerless to resist, he was ruthlessly smashed down onto the roof, plummeting rapidly towards the blue stone ground.</p><p></p><p>Midair, his entire body of sinews and bones had already turned to rotten flesh.</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>A cloud of blood mist exploded! When Cao He's body hit the ground, he was already dead, the divine power in his divine foundation losing its suppression, frantically devouring Cao He's flesh and blood, causing the smashed meat on the ground to twitch strangely.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A spear beam struck down, shattering the divine foundation into pieces.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only fragments of the divine foundation remained, and the twitching rotten flesh also ceased moving.</p><p></p><p>A crisp snap.</p><p></p><p>The blood-stained, naked wooden carving of the Desire Guanyin, fell to the ground, sliding far away.</p><p></p><p>The cold snow, mixed with biting rain, fell to the ground, pitter-pattering as it soaked the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue floated down, his eyes behind the mask sweeping over the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, the wooden carving shot towards him, landing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>His palm suddenly turned jade-colored, jade-like mist swirling.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Slivers Palm activated!...</p><p></p><p>[Wooden Carving (Ninth Brilliance Grade): Desire Compared to Corpse Flesh Guanyin]</p><p></p><p>[Craftsmanship: Carved from Tenth-Grade Spirit Wood "Spirit Flower Willow", infused with Six Desires divine power, the power of desire, containing the power of a corpse curse, can imprint a corpse curse mark, sleep with it to increase lust]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Six Desires divine power? Corpse curse mark?</p><p></p><p>This horse-faced divine foundation cultivator [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power should be from the City Lord's Mansion. At this juncture, he was peering out from the building.</p><p></p><p>Apparently planning to leave this corpse flesh Guanyin wooden carving, very clearly intending to use the corpse curse power within it.</p><p></p><p>"A corpse curse mark, a kind of imprint? Looks like he planned to mark Xixiu with this corpse curse!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes were filled with surging killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this must be City Lord Cao Guang's scheme.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue closed his eyes, the [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit trembling slightly, making his thoughts exceptionally clear, gradually analyzing the cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>"Cao Guang is unwilling, unwilling for an exceptional spirit child to slip away from under his nose, but because of Li Qingshan's presence in the city, he dares not make a big move."</p><p></p><p>"So he's made this wooden carving, to mark Xixiu..."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like selling a favor, so it must be a favor he's selling to the people in the Mansion? Corpse curse power, this is the method of the Corpse God Sect, which means there are also Corpse God Sect experts in the Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue took a deep breath, his fingers clenching tightly, and in an instant, the wooden carving shattered into countless wooden shards.</p><p></p><p>A black mist, like a venomous snake, spewed forth from the wooden carving, coiling around Li Yue's Thousand Slivers Palm arm, which was tinged with jade.</p><p></p><p>Coldly gazing at this wisp of corpse curse power.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's expression was completely calm. When he had killed Cao He, this wisp of corpse curse power had already infiltrated his body.</p><p></p><p>Unlike divine power, it exuded a sinister, eerie aura.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant...</p><p></p><p>This wisp of corpse curse power was drawn into the chess board by the Chess Sage Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Placed among the black Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord spirit baby temple deity divine power chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>The corpse curse power... trembled fearfully, not daring to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the temple deity's level...was above it.</p><p></p><p>After suppressing this wisp of corpse curse power, Li Yue dispersed the Wrathful Golden Vajra transformation and walked to Cao He's corpse, beginning to skillfully absorb the divine power chess pieces, and then searched the body.</p><p></p><p>The [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power had condensed a total of nine divine power chess pieces, all at the divine foundation initial level.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord] divine foundation did not hesitate, directly trembling and beginning to devour the divine power chess pieces, accelerating its refinement.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also a mid-grade Qiankun Jade, with an internal space as vast as the one possessed by the Yang family elder, which Li Yue unhesitatingly collected.</p><p></p><p>The four long spears that Cao He had previously counterattacked with were also unapologetically collected by Li Yue. Under the perception of Thousand Slivers Palm, although they were not divine weapons, their special materials allowed them to conduct divine power, and they were quite precious.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze fell on the horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? It didn't break?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue was surprised. Just now, with the Wrathful Golden Vajra transformation and the divine weapon Shocking Spear, he had unleashed the Eight Shattering Bone Spear art, whose power was so great that it had reduced Cao He's physical body, a profound meridian warrior, to rotten flesh.</p><p></p><p>Yet this mask... had not broken? Li Yue grabbed the mask.</p><p></p><p>Activating Thousand Slivers Palm, information flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Top Tenth Grade): Wrathful Horse Mask]</p><p></p><p>[Craftsmanship: Forged from Tenth-Grade Spirit Wood "Horse-Face Pine", imbued with...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Carved by the hands of a master, it can slightly enhance the divine nature of Wrath, alter one's own aura, and has an extremely high hardness, which can preserve one's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Wielding: The Dao of the Divine Nature of Wrath, cultivating one's nature like a river and above.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another divine weapon? Although it is only a Tenth-Rank Divine Weapon, it is still a divine weapon after all, and to be called a divine weapon means it is extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite reluctant to let it go, a divine mask weapon... how rare.</p><p></p><p>Removing the Meng Niu mask and putting on the Wrath Horse mask, Li Che indeed felt the divine nature operating more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>It was quite miraculous, but Qian Xi soon analyzed the craftsmanship of the mask.</p><p></p><p>With Li Che's skills, he could easily replicate it.</p><p></p><p>"I can also upgrade my Meng Niu mask."</p><p></p><p>Li Che chuckled lightly, then turned his head to glance in the direction of the Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>He pointed his sword in front of him, slicing through the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a porcelain bottle fell into his hand, sprinkling powder on the corpse of the dead Cao He. Slowly, the corpse dissolved into a pool of blood, washed away by the rain.</p><p></p><p>This was the "Corpse Dissolving Powder" that Li Che had personally concocted using his Immortal Craftsmanship techniques. Now, the effect was quite good.</p><p></p><p>Level 3 Immortal Craftsmanship, his skills were indeed excellent.</p><p></p><p>With a light tap of his toes, his figure suddenly shattered the wind and rain and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were fierce, and lightning snakes surged wildly.</p><p></p><p>The bright light flickered intermittently, interweaving the darkness and light inside the dark tower.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on a cushion.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, there was a bowl of blood and a wooden statue of the Furious True Lord with Three Eyes.</p><p></p><p>He clapped his hands, and his body was enveloped in swirling smoke.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the blood in the bowl was slowly drained, as if it had been drunk dry by the wooden statue.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the blood in the bowl was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>A vertical eye seemed to appear between Cao Guang's eyebrows, suddenly opening, and a hidden black light burst forth, entering the wooden statue.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, the wooden statue shattered into pieces, and a dense divine nature burst out from the shattered statue, accompanied by shrieks and fury, and was devoured by Cao Guang's divine foundation!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's face flushed slightly, and he licked his tongue, finally returning to calmness.</p><p></p><p>"Infant blood... it is indeed nourishing."</p><p></p><p>"The absorbed divine nature is quite grand, it tastes so good."</p><p></p><p>"If it's a top-grade infant, it must be even more delicious!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang opened his eyes, a trace of regret flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this top-grade infant could only be given to those people in the Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's expression changed slightly, and his figure instantly shot out, tearing through the wind and rain, standing on the roof.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were firmly fixed on the direction of Li Che's room.</p><p></p><p>His breathing was heavy and labored.</p><p></p><p>A mixture of grief and anger surged from his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle..."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Banquet is about to begin... you old man... didn't make it in time..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang took a long sigh, suppressing the fluctuating divine nature.</p><p></p><p>To be able to silently and invisibly kill his Second Uncle Cao He, a cultivator at the Divine Foundation Realm, in the vast Fei Lei City, apart from Li Qingshan and himself, Cao Guang, there was no one else! Cao Guang had clearly obtained the intelligence that Li Qingshan had gone to meet his old lover on the eve of his departure from Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>So, he dared to let Cao He take action.</p><p></p><p>It was just a small matter, but Cao He was still killed by Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Divine Sect are still as domineering as ever! Clenching his fists, letting the cold winter rain pour down on him.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Achoo!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xu Ji Immortal Cultivation Institute.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was hugging Grandma Shu, who was sleeping. Suddenly, he sneezed loudly.</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes: "Two surges of angry divine foundation auras... they appeared and disappeared just like that, what are they up to?"</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"To hold the Thousand Buddha Banquet, shouldn't they wait until I've left Fei Lei City?"</p><p></p><p>"Do it, do it... I've already felt, the divine nature from the mountain that's rushing towards me... is getting closer and closer."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>The rain and snow had not stopped.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard where Li Che's family lived had become much livelier.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother's family had moved their luggage, piling up big and small packages on a pushcart, arriving early at Li Che's door.</p><p></p><p>The merchant caravan that Li Che had already contacted was also parked outside the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, do we really not need to bring these?" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was very reluctant to part with many things in the courtyard, even wanting to pack up the pots and pans.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to buy them again in the Marquis' Mansion, it's not convenient to bring them on the road."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Zhang Ya's head.</p><p></p><p>"From the outer city to the inner city, and then from the inner city to the Marquis' Mansion... I thought our life would get better and better, but I never imagined it would be so good... it's like a dream, I'm afraid I'll wake up and everything will be fake."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya snuggled up to Li Che's arm, and the husband and wife stood in the empty courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yes, even he never thought...</p><p></p><p>Because of the birth of his daughter, everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, can I bring the scooter?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie was also packing her things, the little girl was a bit reluctant.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>Xixie immediately became happy.</p><p></p><p>Since they had packed up a few days ago, today they just needed to load the things onto the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The caravan's escort, the Qian Biaotou, quickly walked over and cupped his fists respectfully towards Li Che: "Master Li, the things are all packed, we're about ready to depart?"</p><p></p><p>This caravan was not a local caravan from Fei Lei City, but the headquarters was in the Jinguang Marquis' Mansion. The journey to the Marquis' Mansion was not short, and they would pass through many cities and even enter the wilderness. With the caravan, it would be safer.</p><p></p><p>If Li Che traveled alone, he would just walk away, but after all, he was moving with his family.</p><p></p><p>"Qian Biaotou, thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned the gesture, handing him a red envelope and smiling.</p><p></p><p>This Qian Biaotou of the caravan was a Qi Vein martial artist, with quite impressive strength. He was from the Marquis' Mansion and was only responsible for escorting the caravan to Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, you're too polite, it's only natural to do business." Qian Biaotou was quite respectful towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>A master woodcarver, even in the Marquis' Mansion, his status was not low.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held an oiled paper umbrella and saw Xixie, Zhang Ya, and the big-headed Lu Chi onto a carriage. The carriage had a charcoal stove burning inside, dispelling the bitter cold, and the soft materials were laid out, making it very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che himself took another carriage, the interior of which was piled with wood materials, saying that he could carve wood sculptures on the way to the Marquis' Mansion and sell them for profit when they arrived.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just an excuse for Li Che, he wanted this carriage for the convenience of his actions.</p><p></p><p>However, now that Li Che had inherited the Yan family's wealth, he was not short of money at all, so renting an extra carriage was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen and the elder brother's family were in the carriage behind.</p><p></p><p>The wheels rolled, crushing the rippling blue stone ground.</p><p></p><p>Lifting the curtain, Zhang Ya pressed her red lips, looking a bit reluctant at the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Depart!"</p><p></p><p>After everyone got on the carriage, Qian Biaotou, the escort, rode a spirited horse, a saber hanging at his waist, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and waved his big hand.</p><p></p><p>The caravan slowly moved, gradually moving along the blue stone street.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps knowing that Li Che was about to leave Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>So many woodcarvers from the Xu family woodcarving shop came to see him off.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Li Che also saw Zhao Xuan and Wang Zhengpin, who had once practiced martial arts with him.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had also stepped into the Inner City.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, why didn't Uncle Xu You come?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie leaned out of the carriage window, disappointed not to see the person she wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>"Your Uncle Xu You might have been busy with something, he will come to the Marquis' Mansion to see you later, you must cultivate well, and then surprise him quietly."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stroked Xixie's head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xixie thought about that scene... and felt energized, her little head nodding vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, however, looked at the rain curtain on the long street, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Xu You... why didn't he come?</p><p></p><p>Reluctant to part, or was there something else hidden?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the city gate.</p><p></p><p>A carriage also slowly drove out, the hooded coachman whipping the reins hard.</p><p></p><p>The horse picked up its pace and galloped quickly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the swaying carriage, Li Qingshan was leaning comfortably against the cushion.</p><p></p><p>Next to him was Xu family's Grandma Shu.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Shu seemed to know something, looking at the old lover beside her, she frowned and said, "Li Qingshan, are you really going to leave like this?"</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Banquet that Marquis Cao Guang is organizing, it's obvious there's a catch... it might be related to the disappearance of those infants, aren't you going to stop it?"</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you the one who used to hate evil the most, Li Qingshan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took Grandma Shu's hand: "Don't be anxious."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Shu struggled a bit, but couldn't break free, and just let him touch her.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked out the window at the hazy blue mountains and green waters, and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not leaving, how dare he Cao Guang start the ritual?"</p><p></p><p>"If he starts the ritual, then I'll have an excuse..."</p><p></p><p>"To beat him to death."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Shu heard this and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes shone with a different light.</p><p></p><p>Well, this was her brother Li Qingshan who hated evil.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going alone?"</p><p></p><p>Grandma Shu seemed to have thought of something and asked with some concern.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Probably..."</p><p></p><p>"There's also a... hero."</p><p></p><p>PS: A thousand-word update, please vote for monthly tickets, recommend tickets, and support the reading!

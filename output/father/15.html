        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A Lingying statue?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were ice-cold. So it was true...</p><p></p><p>Even after moving into Xu's woodcarving shop and under Xu's protection, they still could not completely avoid the Lingying Sect's coveting of Xixia! The Lingying Sect had emerged right after Xixia's first birthday celebration!</p><p></p><p>"They just won't leave us alone..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fist, his eyes brimming with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>However, when he recalled the disappearing figure just now, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"This Lingying statue has not appeared since we moved into the Xu family estate. But it showed up today... The only outsiders who had access were the workers and cooks summoned from Spring Wind Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"But those workers and cooks were all arranged by Manager Sun to be sent out of the Xu family estate, not allowed to linger. So they can be ruled out. There are many skilled masters in the courtyard, their powers strong and senses acute... Yet the other party was able to sneak the Lingying statue into my courtyard without them noticing..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, feeling the winds and snow around him grow even colder.</p><p></p><p>His deep, dark pupils reflected a chilling glint.</p><p></p><p>"Which means... this Lingying Sect disciple... is most likely an insider at Xu's woodcarving shop!"</p><p></p><p>There was a member of the Lingying Sect within Xu's woodcarving shop! A chill ran down his spine, seeping into his body through his pores.</p><p></p><p>"This possibility... is very high, very high indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been a bit too careless... Is there really any place that is absolutely safe?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, glaring at the glaring Lingying wooden statue on the ground, his expression ice-cold: "Who among the woodcarving shop could be a Lingying Sect member?"</p><p></p><p>Faces flashed through Li Che's mind, but he still could not pinpoint the culprit.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Che grabbed the wooden statue glaring up at him. His surging blood caused his fingers to suddenly glow with a golden light, and with a "crack", the wooden statue was crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"I will find you..."</p><p></p><p>"Do not underestimate the determination of a protective father."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A Lingying statue... appeared outside your courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>The next day, the well-rested Chen Dabao, upon hearing Li Che's words, suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You suspect there may be a Lingying Sect believer within the woodcarving shop?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao squinted, speaking in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, but he could not guess who it might be.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed very possible. For it to appear outside the Xu family estate, even in the outer city, is no easy feat..."</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect's believers have already spread throughout Feilei City. If there is someone in the shop who has become a believer, it is indeed hard to say for sure."</p><p></p><p>"No, I should say it is certain to happen. The Lingying Sect... wants to shake the rule of the major powerful families in Feilei City, so they must plant their people. And faith infiltration is indeed the most effective method."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen said solemnly, "Don't worry, I'll go investigate. This is not too difficult to find out. Becoming a Lingying Sect believer is not easy to hide. If I find out, I'll tell you right away. You should also be on the lookout, be more vigilant in your daily life."</p><p></p><p>"Third Master has been dispatched out of the city to eradicate the mysterious temple evils, so during this period... the shop doesn't have a main decision-maker, which is the best time for them to make their move."</p><p></p><p>"But even if we know who it is, I can't act directly before they make a move on little Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen frowned as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Che expressed his understanding.</p><p></p><p>While the Lingying Sect has spread in Feilei City, and people may detest becoming their believers, they would not go out of their way to actively eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>After all, before they cause trouble, it is just freedom of faith.</p><p></p><p>"But at least knowing who it is will give me some peace of mind, and I can be more vigilant."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, hearing this, also felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's investigation took three days.</p><p></p><p>During these three days, Li Che increased his cultivation time, as the feedback from the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor" Dao fruit had ignited his cultivation fervor.</p><p></p><p>Three days of arduous cultivation had brought the maturity of the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor" to 5%. In a state of fully unleashing the Dao fruit's power, it was more formidable than the perfected Skin Refinement, with strength reaching a thousand jin.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still just perfected Skin Refinement.</p><p></p><p>In the training field, Li Che was drenched in sweat, his skin flushed with a reddish glow, the air hazy with heat waves.</p><p></p><p>He put down the stone lock, his eyelids lowering.</p><p></p><p>"Now I want to break through to Meridian Opening, but I need the Meridian Opening cultivation method... Yet I cannot go to Xu Beifeng, since the cultivation I've shown him is only perfected Skin Refinement."</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, Xu Beifeng had come to inspect his cultivation, and Li Che had only displayed his perfected Skin Refinement.</p><p></p><p>He had not fully revealed his perfected Skin Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Xu Beifeng was already greatly astonished - in just one year's time...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having reached the peak of skin refinement, Xu Beihu was somewhat surprised by Licheng's talent.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xu Beihu said that in order to cultivate the opening of meridians and the inner strength techniques, Licheng would need to fully complete the skin refinement first. Licheng did not want to reveal his true strength in skin refinement, as being able to complete it in a year could be explained as extraordinary talent, which was the level Xu Beihu was at initially.</p><p></p><p>But if he completed the skin refinement in a year, that would be too exaggerated...</p><p></p><p>"So, I'll have to find the techniques for opening meridians and inner strength cultivation on my own."</p><p></p><p>Licheng changed into a clean set of clothes, his eyes flickering as he pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I now have some savings, so I can go to the markets outside the city. Perhaps they will have cultivation techniques for sale there, but I'll need to conceal my identity when I go."</p><p></p><p>After finishing his cultivation, Licheng returned to the workshop of the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had taken on a wood carving job - to carve a "Maitreya Buddha with Eight Treasures" statue. The client wanted it to be filled with profound meaning, and offered a payment of a gold leaf, which was equivalent to a hundred taels!</p><p></p><p>This was the highest-priced wood carving job Licheng had taken on so far!</p><p></p><p>Gripping the carving knife, he gently entered the wood, tearing open the wood fibers as wood shavings fell like fluttering flowers.</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit pulsed slightly, and Licheng's gaze was focused, as if everything around him had disappeared in that moment, and all the carving techniques for the Maitreya statue surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, with a flask of rice wine hanging from his waist, solemnly pushed open the carved wooden door of Licheng's workshop.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen?"</p><p></p><p>Licheng, holding a file, was carving on the wood and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"I found out." Old Chen found a chair, sat down, uncorked the flask, took a sip of wine, and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" Licheng's gaze turned cold, and the movement of the file on the wood also abruptly paused.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family Wood Carving Shop in the Outer City, this past year, there have indeed been quite a few wood carving masters and their families who believe in the Lingying Sect." Old Chen shook his head, a hint of horror flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But on the day of Xiao Cui's first birthday celebration, the only one who secretly believed in the Lingying Sect was..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sighed, "孙长标, the second son of the manager孙. He has been married for four years but has no son, and his wife was deceived by the Lingying Sect, saying that worshiping the Lingying Sect could give him a son. So孙长标also started to believe in it."</p><p></p><p>Licheng was stunned, remembering the smiling manager孙 who had once taken them to see the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>孙长标, his second son, was also a wood carving master at the Xu Family Wood Carving Shop, a skilled three-knife wood carver. He had always seemed gentle and amiable, but who would have thought he had joined the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>And he had set his sights on Cui Cui.</p><p></p><p>Licheng took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"What is孙长标's cultivation level?" Licheng asked expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen raised an eyebrow: "His talent is average, he has been refining his skin for three years, and in the past two years he has just completed the opening of his meridians and cultivated inner strength techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Old Chen, I understand now." Licheng suddenly broke into a smile and thanked Chen Dabao.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be reckless, you've just reached the peak of skin refinement, you can't beat孙长标... And you don't have any evidence, if you act rashly, it will only bring trouble. As for the Xu family... it won't look good either."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao reminded Licheng, then took another sip of wine: "Now that we know who it is... we'll just keep an eye on him and watch him closely."</p><p></p><p>"Cui Cui has me to look after her, so孙长标won't have any chance." Licheng nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao didn't say anything more, got up, humming a little tune, and left to go play with Cui Cui in Licheng's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Little stinky Cui, your Uncle Chen is here!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Licheng continued to carve the Eight Treasures Maitreya Buddha statue step by step.</p><p></p><p>After completing the day's work,</p><p></p><p>Licheng got up, put on a wide-brimmed hat, and took a black hooded robe, glancing at the snow flakes drifting in the courtyard sky.</p><p></p><p>"I said... never underestimate the determination of a father protecting his daughter."</p><p></p><p>"Just because he didn't have a son, he wants to use my daughter to get a son? How unreasonable."</p><p></p><p>Extending his hand, he plucked a snowflake.</p><p></p><p>Licheng's expression gradually became cold, as Old Chen said... to watch and be vigilant is enough.</p><p></p><p>But in Licheng's eyes...</p><p></p><p>Watching, being vigilant, is not as good as...</p><p></p><p>Killing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

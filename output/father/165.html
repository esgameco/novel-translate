        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Peak of Golden Light Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind howled, and snowflakes danced in the air! Prince Jisehui of the Yao Clan stood with his hands behind his back on the vast blue stone platform atop the mountain, his purple eyes shining brilliantly under the refracted light, like the deep, mysterious eyes of a dragon lurking in a dark pool.</p><p></p><p>His calm voice echoed and reverberated across the platform, seeming to stir the swirling snowflakes descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In front of the divine hall, many children heard Prince Jisehui's domineering call of Xixia's name, and each of them underwent a change.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu clenched their fists, their eyes almost spewing tangible fury.</p><p></p><p>This is too much bullying! Does he think that just because he is the Prince, he can do as he pleases? Even if his cultivation has been suppressed to the level of replacing blood five times, his realm will not change! Moreover, as the Prince, he must have abundant inner resources and possess all kinds of divine weapons and tools bestowed by the Pacifying King - how is this fair?</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, don't agree to him! This is not fair at all, he is being unreasonable! Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang clenched his fists, looking at Xixia, his face flushed with anger.</p><p></p><p>Gongyangxiu nodded repeatedly: "Liang is right!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't accept the challenge, look at him, if you win, he'll just apologize, but if you lose, you'll have to be his maid... How shameless of him! Don't agree, let's not fight him!" Gong Yuanliang was indignant.</p><p></p><p>Gongyangxiu's nodding became faster and faster: "Liang is right!"</p><p></p><p>Hailaosheng stood by, looking at these two fledgling dragons with some disdain.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Xixia wanted to fight, but these two kids didn't know what Xixia liked? Only he, Hailaosheng, understood Xixia's pursuit!</p><p></p><p>Xixia's pursuit was fighting, becoming stronger through fighting, and the joyful feeling when the fireworks burst!</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally.</p><p></p><p>He, Hailaosheng, was also such a person!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Xixia! Don't fall for it, he is the Prince, with the bloodline of the Pacifying King Yao Moli, I've heard that the offspring of the Martial Saint have some extraordinary bloodline talents, extremely powerful! Even if suppressed to the same realm, he still has the invincible power of the same realm... We won't fight him!"</p><p></p><p>Hailaosheng clenched his fists and rushed in front of Xixia, speaking very seriously.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty was constantly stuffing buns into his mouth, watching the performances and persuasions of Gong Yuanliang, Gongyangxiu, and Hailaosheng, and couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>They were like three dogs!</p><p></p><p>It was so embarrassing! However, the little fatty also felt that Xixia shouldn't take the stage, there was no need.</p><p></p><p>This Prince... he looked like he had impure intentions, and his origins were not right.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he came, he fixed his gaze on Xixia and... his sister Yunye! He was completely rotten!</p><p></p><p>And the little fatty had a vague intuition that this Prince Jisehui not only had his sights set on Xixia, but also on his sister Yunye, and even on him, Zhou Peng...</p><p></p><p>A thorough scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>Yunye did not speak, but she approached Xixia's side, holding Xixia's hand and shaking her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Her gentle voice rang out softly: "Sister Xixia, don't compete with him."</p><p></p><p>Yunye's beautiful brow was slightly furrowed, and there was a hint of surprise in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The monster within her seemed to be restless under the Prince Jisehui's highly invasive gaze! This Prince... was not right!</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo also looked at Xixia, his gaze gentle: "Xixia, do you want to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight, there's no need for that kind of bet, you can cancel the bet and fight him again."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo raised his hand and ruffled Xixia's head.</p><p></p><p>He really liked this junior disciple more and more.</p><p></p><p>She was really like his former senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked up, her eyes shining brightly: "Sect Master, I will definitely make that stinky boy apologize to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Father said that when I have power, I must protect the people around me and not let them get hurt! He insulted Sect Master, so Xixia must teach him a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's chubby little face actually showed a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>She clenched her chubby little fists, her eyes full of fighting spirit! Nanlihuo was stunned, and the light in his eyes became even more gentle.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he never dreamed that one day, his mere four-year-old junior disciple would defend him so.</p><p></p><p>But still, this feeling...really warmed his cold heart a little.</p><p></p><p>Like walking alone in the endless dark winter.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a little child in front holding a torch, dispelling the bitter cold and illuminating the faint light ahead.</p><p></p><p>This feeling...</p><p></p><p>It made Nanlihuo's eyes redden slightly.</p><p></p><p>He ruffled Xixia's head.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Daoist Wang Yuyu: "Elder Brother... you must protect this disciple of mine!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His white hair flew in the cold wind, and his solemn and earnest expression made Wang Yuyu slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that when he held Nanlihuo's hand and led him step by step up the mountain gate, step by step, to enter the teacher's door.</p><p></p><p>But unknowingly, Nanlihuo had changed from a four-year-old little boy to an old man with white hair now.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuyu's heart was bitter, he knew that Nanlihuo had gone through a lot of hardship over the years.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much he could do for this junior brother.</p><p></p><p>He nodded: "Don't worry, this matter... I promise you, elder brother."</p><p></p><p>Waving the fly whisk, his hair and beard flew, and there was also a hint of cold in Wang Yuyu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Temple God Resonance Assembly is about to begin, this little Prince will not dare to be too excessive...</p><p></p><p>After all, our Sect is the main force in the opening of the Temple God Resonance Assembly, and that [Infernal Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel] is still in our hands."</p><p></p><p>"If the little Prince is too excessive, our Sect can refuse to open the Temple God Resonance Assembly."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuyu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This was the Sect's confidence.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo fell silent, shaking his head: "What I want is not this guarantee..."</p><p></p><p>"I want a definite guarantee."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuyu was annoyed, waving his hand: "Okay, okay, I'll even fight that Xue Dufei to protect your little disciple, I've already said I don't like to fight, really!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo finally showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Xixia walked out. She was having a hard time suppressing the little gun in her arm.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia was still very calm, because her father had taught her that when faced with a situation, she should not panic, take it slowly, and the mentality was the most important, judge the gains and losses before taking action.</p><p></p><p>Niuqin Master had also taught her that when faced with an urgent matter, she should calm down and see if there was an opportunity to ambush.</p><p></p><p>Xixia remembered this in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Just as Liang said, if I lose, I have to be your maid, but if you lose, you only have to apologize, this bet is not fair!"</p><p></p><p>"Change the bet!"</p><p></p><p>"If you lose, you have to be Xixia's servant!"</p><p></p><p>"Fair!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's childish voice echoed across the platform.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words were spoken.</p><p></p><p>On the platform.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufei's eyes suddenly widened, and his powerful martial will suddenly burst forth, taking a step forward, shaking the entire platform.</p><p></p><p>A pressure as heavy as a mountain pressed towards Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"How can the Prince be your servant?! You presumptuous girl, you're asking for a beating!"</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>As soon as his martial will stirred, it was completely blocked by the spiritual wall formed by Wang Yuyu's palm pushing forward.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to beat? Vulgar martial artist, all you know is beating!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Can't afford the bet, then don't bet, just leave, the bet stakes should be equal, you can't just make it unfair because he's the Prince, suppressing his cultivation to the level of replacing blood five times for what? Since it's unfair anyway, it's just ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuyu said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>The sudden eruption of the aura of the Grand Master was so terrifying, like the collapse of a mountain, shaking the heart.</p><p></p><p>Even Xixia had a momentary pale face, being frightened for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of meters away from Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's spiritual fluctuations, carrying Li Yue and Xiao Tanren, looked at this scene indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Li Yue and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Li, your daughter... really has a lot of guts."</p><p></p><p>"To actually want to make the son of Yao Moli become a servant..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's expression slightly darkened.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about was not this, but staring at Xue Dufei, this Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>Daring to yell at Xixia?</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the heart to yell at his precious daughter.</p><p></p><p>This Xue Dufei actually dared to yell at her!</p><p></p><p>Li Yue couldn't help but have a murderous intent in his heart, this Grand Master... had a way to die.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue was also calculating in his heart how to kill this Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's words made Li Yue's expression slightly calm: "This is not guts, just asking for fairness."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's calm words made Lu Yao stunned, a strange color flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, like father, like daughter, Mr. Li looks gentle and peaceful, but he should also be a domineering person with great courage, not afraid of anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p><p></p><p>Let the son of the Pacifying King Yao Moli become a servant? This...</p><p></p><p>How dare he say such a thing! However, the gaze of many children towards Xixia had already flashed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>This is Xixia, the number one big sister of our Golden Light Manor! Prince Jisehui was stunned, his purple eyes flashing with a demonic brilliance, as if reflecting the flowing light like a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Let him... become a servant?</p><p></p><p>What a bold statement, he hadn't heard such words in a long time.</p><p></p><p>It's so arrogant...</p><p></p><p>But do you have the arrogance to do so? Jisehui's gaze was deep, his blood and qi surging, he had absolute confidence in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of his father, King Yao Moli, the Martial Saint, he was confident that he would not be weaker than this insignificant little girl.</p><p></p><p>The strong self-confidence made Jisehui's fighting spirit boil at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He increasingly wanted to personally suppress this little girl, see her crying and whimpering, and then have his dragon god purple eyes devour her spiritual nature...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it...</p><p></p><p>It made his whole body tremble, excited to the point of being unable to control.</p><p></p><p>"Good..."</p><p></p><p>"I agree."</p><p></p><p>Jisehui spoke, and the next moment, he grabbed with five fingers, and a domineering silver-white long spear immediately fell into his hand. He pulled it back sharply, creating a suppressive sound that tore through the airflow.</p><p></p><p>The spearhead pointed to the ground, the fierce wind whirled, sweeping up the accumulated snow and tearing it apart.</p><p></p><p>The surging blood qi burst from his body membrane, as if turning into red flames burning around him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With one step, the backwind tore apart, unleashing a powerful propulsive force that pushed his figure to the center of the platform.</p><p></p><p>"Come on."</p><p></p><p>"If you beat me, I'll be your servant."</p><p></p><p>Prince Jisehui said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the long spear lightly swept, his footsteps heavily stomped down, and the blue stone ground suddenly burst open with radial web-like cracks!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, I'm going!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go and make him cry, and when he becomes my servant, I'll press his head and make him apologize to the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia said a sentence.</p><p></p><p>Then she rushed out like the wind.</p><p></p><p>She also landed on the platform, her chubby five fingers grabbing, and the seven-element divine weapon around her neck, the Qianyuan Golden Armor Ring, slid into her hand.</p><p></p><p>The golden ring spun, and Xixia aimed it at the Prince from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's chubby little face was trembling.</p><p></p><p>That was excitement, and the little gun in her arm was also excited, she just didn't know how to activate it...</p><p></p><p>Although the Prince was only five years old, he was a head taller than Xixia, gripping the divine silver spear, which was a six-divine-weapon.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not unleash the divine power of the six-divine-weapon, the pressure and quality of the divine weapon alone was enough to give him a great advantage.</p><p></p><p>The spearhead scraping the blue stone ground, the Prince stepped forward, suddenly increasing his speed the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The spearhead tore through, cutting open the blue stones along the way, leaving a trail of sparks!</p><p></p><p>The domineering and powerful aura suddenly surged from him.</p><p></p><p>Like the raging current of a river god, the terrifying sense of oppression spread, that was the oppression of the realm of divine power!</p><p></p><p>Fifth-level divine power! </p><p></p><p>It spread out, and the snowflakes on the ground instantly exploded into snow powder.</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked at the Prince charging towards her with a majestic and domineering aura.</p><p></p><p>The pressure suddenly arose, this was the strongest opponent she had encountered so far! Her big eyes blinked without blinking, and her brain was thinking about how to win! With a light shout, Xixia's divine power pressure also burst forth, like a flowing river, the Extreme Sorrow Wind Fire Subduing Dragon Three Great Princes! And also...</p><p></p><p>Golden Prison Fire Lotus Body! Xixia seemed to have a faint golden flame bursting forth around her body.</p><p></p><p>She started to take steps, her speed extremely fast, and as her speed increased, Xixia became very nimble and agile! The two almost flew towards each other in front of everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Yue couldn't help but hold his breath at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this Prince was definitely the strongest opponent Xixia had encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not counting the previous encounter with the Golden Three Great Princes in the Golden Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>And with the explosive bet between the two, so this battle really captivated everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo, Li Qingshan, Zhu Hongdou, Zhang Qingzheng and other high-level figures of the Golden Light Sect watched with unwavering eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though the battle between the two in their eyes was weak and simple, they dared not relax at all.</p><p></p><p>Even more tense than their own divine battle! Boom! Prince Jisehui's reckless charging figure, when Xixia approached him within three zhang, immediately stopped, and the divine silver spear in his hand suddenly swept out!</p><p></p><p>Like a thunderous explosion, it fiercely struck towards Xixia! Xixia did not retreat, the Qianyuan Golden Armor Ring in her hand also fell out, striking towards that long spear! The first strike, a head-on collision! Clang—</p><p></p><p>The clear sound waves spread, accompanied by the continuous bursting and sparkling of small sparks.</p><p></p><p>Xixia continuously struck out the Golden Armor Ring dozens of times, all of which were blocked by the Prince's long spear.</p><p></p><p>In terms of technique, the Prince was also impeccable.</p><p></p><p>He clearly mastered a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The master-level superior spear technique, and he has also mastered the supreme martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the descendant of the Martial Saint, his martial arts talent is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the friction sound of clashing metal, after blocking Xixing's Golden Vajra Ring again, Jie Haihui's purple eyes flashed with an eerie glow.</p><p></p><p>In the indifferent purple eyes, a trace of fanaticism and excitement flickered.</p><p></p><p>With a heavy swing of his arm, the air was shattered with the impact, stirring up fierce winds, like a venomous dragon, drilling towards Xixing's chest!</p><p></p><p>Xixing's Golden Vajra Ring caught the long spear, and with a sudden twist and press, the long spear was bent into an exaggerated arc.</p><p></p><p>The power erupting from the small body made Jie Haihui's eyes flash with an unusual color! But...</p><p></p><p>Who is not born with divine strength? But when it comes to strength...</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyin long spear suddenly turned, instantly spinning at high speed, accompanied by a hum, countless spear beams burst out from it!</p><p></p><p>Like countless dragons wriggling and brandishing their claws, they flew out!</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint's supreme art... Myriad Dragons Subjugate the Divine!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Jie Haihui stepped forward, bending his knees, tightly gripping the long spear in his hand, and countless angry dragon spear shadows rushed towards Xixing! The Qianyuan Golden Vajra Ring was suddenly knocked away.</p><p></p><p>Xixing's body quickly retreated, the ground constantly exploding, as if pierced by the long spear, forming dense large holes! However, Xixing felt a slight chill in her body, and her chubby little face showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>The spear dragons that had pierced the ground suddenly burst out from under her feet, instantly enveloping her like a cage!</p><p></p><p>Following her retreating figure, they closely pursued!</p><p></p><p>So strong!</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint's supreme art...</p><p></p><p>Although Prince Jie Haihui had only learned the superficial aspects, and had not even reached the entry level, the power was already extremely terrifying! The pressure was so great that it made Xixing somewhat breathless! The Golden Inferno Jade Body greatly increased Xixing's speed, and with a wave of her fingers, a sword light flashed brightly! The Xuanlei Golden Light Annihilation Sword!</p><p></p><p>The sword light scattered, rushing towards the spear dragons, and the sound of explosions kept resounding.</p><p></p><p>Xixing quickly leaped out from the smoke and dust, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Her face was also slightly stained with dust, making her look a bit disheveled.</p><p></p><p>The prince's upright figure, his spine trembling like a roaring dragon, his blood surging, his fighting spirit boiling even more!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Come on! Fight me!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The long spear swept, as if there were countless angry dragons covering the sky, wherever the dragons passed, they considered Xixing's escape position, strength, and speed, forcing her to take the full impact head-on!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of meters away.</p><p></p><p>Utterly quiet, the white snow fell silently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked at the spear technique displayed by Jie Haihui, and a flash of surprise and solemnity appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Dragons Subjugate the Divine, one of the four supreme martial arts of the Pacification King Jie Molie!"</p><p></p><p>"Known as the supreme martial art that dominates the world, fierce and unparalleled, the Myriad Dragons Subjugate the Divine, can be used in swordsmanship, spearmanship, swordsmanship, and mace techniques... without any restrictions!"</p><p></p><p>"Jie Molie passed this supreme art on to his eldest son, but unexpectedly, Prince Jie Haihui also knows it."</p><p></p><p>"Although he has not even reached the entry level, but judging from the power of a single move, he is not far from the entry level. Once the Martial Saint's supreme art is mastered, its power will not be inferior to any master-level sect's supreme art!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>He focused on cultivating the divine nature, and although he also practiced the blood and qi martial dao, it was far inferior to his own divine nature cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But he still had good eyesight.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint's supreme art?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes darkened.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, compared to Xixing and Jie Haihui, who are descendants of the Martial Saints, the foundation is the biggest gap.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine nature, Xixing has the fifth-order Nourishing Nature Art obtained from the Golden Divine Palace, which is not much different from Jie Haihui.</p><p></p><p>But in the martial arts realm... the gap is too large.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the other party has a Martial Saint father..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Che couldn't help but feel self-reproachful.</p><p></p><p>The father is not strong enough!</p><p></p><p>Not strong enough to be your arrogant pillar!</p><p></p><p>Relying on the father... the father has dragged you down.</p><p></p><p>Sooner or later, he, Li Che, must also research the Martial Saint's supreme art, so that Xixing will not be at a disadvantage in her foundation!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar shattered, countless spear beams turned into dragon shadows, following closely!</p><p></p><p>Xixing, with the Golden Inferno Jade Body, fled quickly, but felt it was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Xixing was also determined, clenching her five fingers, the Xuanlei Golden Light Annihilation Sword she held was swung out fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Thunderous sounds! The Xuanlei exploded! One sword, slashing horizontally!</p><p></p><p>After slashing through several spear beam dragon shadows, Xixing threw the golden light annihilation sword in her hand, putting some distance between them.</p><p></p><p>She knew that in terms of martial arts, she was no match for this little prince.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too big! The Martial Saint's supreme art in terms of exquisiteness and oppressive power was too, too great!</p><p></p><p>Xixing could only...</p><p></p><p>Light up the fireworks!</p><p></p><p>Who says mechanisms can't be used? Mechanisms... what's the difference from divine weapons? Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Inferno Jade Body on the big platform pulled out trails of fire shadows.</p><p></p><p>Then, countless spiritual wood crows took to the air, and Xixing shouldered the Immortal Crafted Gatling Gun! Directly activated to the maximum!</p><p></p><p>It's different now, the state is different!</p><p></p><p>Xixing's eyes widened, her excitement spreading like ink stains, instantly expanding her pupils.</p><p></p><p>Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! The tongues of fire spewed out, countless golden lights tore through the air, shooting out!</p><p></p><p>The spear shadows that rushed towards her were instantly pierced by the golden light! Directly exploding into blooming golden fireworks in midair!</p><p></p><p>Billowing smoke and shockwaves spread!</p><p></p><p>Prince Jie Haihui's eyes narrowed: "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The long spear was retracted, and his figure began to move quickly!</p><p></p><p>However, he only managed to dodge a few of the black crows flapping their wings, and then could no longer dodge! After all, he could only display the power of the Blood Transformation Five Steps, and trying to dodge the firing speed of these wooden crows was still a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>The long spear suddenly swept out, swirling wildly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! The exploding fireworks instantly enveloped Prince Jie Haihui!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, haha! Lighting up the fireworks!" </p><p></p><p>Xixing's eyes shone brilliantly, constantly stepping forward, with the accelerating Golden Inferno Jade Body, almost forming a ring to surround and bombard Jie Haihui!</p><p></p><p>You have the Martial Saint's supreme art passed down by your father!</p><p></p><p>Xixing has the mechanisms - cannons! ! !</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in the situation on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Made Xue Dufu's eyes narrow, and the six black-armored soldiers beside him also revealed a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chao clenched his fists tightly, Gong Yuanli and Gongyang Xiuxing hugged each other excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chihong's eyes were stunned, Xixing had become so strong without him knowing.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty chewed on the buns, exclaiming in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful young Cloud E, with her delicate appearance, frowned, not relaxing at all! "She hasn't won yet."</p><p></p><p>They all knew that Xixing had this mechanical skill.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The power of this machine gun cannon is very strong, but doesn't Prince Jie Haihui know? Xixing has already made a name for herself many times with these machine guns and cannons, and since Jie Haihui came to pay respects to the mountain, he must have heard about it.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't be unprepared! But Xixing doesn't care if you're prepared or not, the fireworks just won't stop!</p><p></p><p>The entire platform was shrouded in thick billowing black smoke, the exploding shockwaves and sound waves formed howling gusts of wind that kept swirling and spreading.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked a bit dazed, not expecting the battle scene to suddenly change.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Tang Ren's excited body couldn't stop trembling.</p><p></p><p>"The wooden crows... these are wooden crows! But they've been improved, the power is completely different! Much stronger, and the mechanism that launches the wooden crows is also different..."</p><p></p><p>"This improved version is simply a genius!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Ren was so excited that his voice was trembling, seeing his family's mechanisms shine, he was even a little moved and wanted to cry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked at the constantly bombarding Xixing with affection in his eyes!  They had a common hobby! Li Che was the first to smell the scent of the yellow-haired man.</p><p></p><p>He glanced sideways at Tang Ren, narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this mechanical skill is not bad, but... it's useless, it's still a little lacking, Mr. Li, your daughter may lose."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao had his hands behind his back, floating in the air, and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow suddenly furrowed as he looked towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixing's fireworks just wouldn't stop!</p><p></p><p>The explosions thundered, one swelling wooden crow after another exploded, with flying debris full of destructive power!</p><p></p><p>Xixing's laughter also echoed amidst the exploding fireworks, appearing somewhat eerie!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A powerful gust of wind suddenly swept out from the center of the explosion! "Damn it! ! !"</p><p></p><p>"You've completely angered me, girl!"</p><p></p><p>A purple light burst forth, then like endless spear beams, tearing through the billowing smoke.</p><p></p><p>Xixing did not stop firing the fireworks.</p><p></p><p>But the endless purple light actually reflected in her eyes, and she saw a huge purple dragon, domineering and majestic!</p><p></p><p>This purple dragon had no dragon scales, only a dense and intricate divine pattern woven on its body!</p><p></p><p>As the purple dragon opened its eyes, those eerie purple pupils also emanated an invisible wave of energy! Within the purple dragon, Prince Jie Haihui's appearance was a bit disheveled, his luxurious clothes in disarray, and one piece of armor was shining brightly, blocking the bombardment of the wooden crows.</p><p></p><p>But this disheveled state was something Jie Haihui could not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the silver spear, the purple dragon shadow hovering around him, his purple eyes shining brilliantly, almost occupying all the light on the entire platform!  In front of the Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuoand Wang Kuyu were horrified.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a bloodline talent?!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu even frowned and made a gesture, ready to intervene at any time.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuoface was as gloomy as water, clenching and unclenching his fingers...</p><p></p><p>A hundred meters away.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline talent?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao also murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't have time to introduce it to Li Che, because the situation in the arena had changed again.</p><p></p><p>The purple dragon illusory image woven around, like the divine image of a cultivator, blocked all the explosive power and impact of the wooden crows! And the little prince's eyes were eerie, his whole body had undergone a transformation, his stature vaguely growing taller, his flesh and blood solidifying like steel rods, emanating an eerie purple glow.</p><p></p><p>With one step, the blue bricks instantly exploded and sank into a deep pit.</p><p></p><p>And the huge purple dragon accompanied the little prince's furious dive, its speed almost catching up to a true master! Fast! Too fast! Xixing's eyes shone brilliantly, but she had no fear at all!</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>After a childish shout.</p><p></p><p>Xixing kept firing the spiritual wood crows! The six metal barrels of the Immortal Crafted Gatling Gun kept spinning, the golden light flames rapidly spewing out.</p><p></p><p>Exploding one flower after another on the platform! That purple dragon shadow, moving at an extremely fast speed towards Xixing, even if it stubbornly resisted the bombardment, it only staggered slightly before rushing over again!</p><p></p><p>The distance kept closing in!</p><p></p><p>Closing in!</p><p></p><p>As it continued to approach Xixing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart couldn't help but tighten, his fingers slightly spreading open, ready to appear next to Xixing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed something...</p><p></p><p>A flash of strangeness passed through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The fingers that were about to clench tightly unconsciously loosened.</p><p></p><p>Watching the prince Jie Haihui, who had transformed into a purple eerie dragon, like a monster, rushing towards Xixing at high speed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gradually became strange.</p><p></p><p>Oh, right...</p><p></p><p>This is a dragon?</p><p></p><p>Although it's a bit ugly...</p><p></p><p>But it seems to be a real dragon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It's over! At this moment, Jie Haihui's heart was extremely restless, wanting to tear the little girl in front of him to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Every time he used his bloodline talent, he would feel a terrifying devouring power, wanting to devour his will.</p><p></p><p>Let him completely turn into a raging mad dragon!</p><p></p><p>His father said that this was because he had not yet learned to properly control the power of the Dragon God's Purple Eyes, but was instead controlled by the Purple Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihui at this moment... didn't care anymore! Didn't care about anything!</p><p></p><p>He wants to win! He just wants to win!</p><p></p><p>He wants to devour the purple aura of divinity on Li Nuanxi's body! It was an extremely strong greed, transmitted by the Dragon God's Purple Eyes, a powerful will impact!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The long spear was suddenly thrown out by him.</p><p></p><p>Xixing, carrying the Immortal Crafted Gatling Gun, the Golden Inferno Jade Body flashed, dodging this attack.</p><p></p><p>The long spear pierced the ground, creating a deep pit, the long spear stuck in it, trembling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>But this throwing of the spear made Xixing dodge, and she also didn't have a chance to dodge Jie Haihui's next attack!</p><p></p><p>Jie Haihui, with the purple dragon shadow enveloping his body, landed in front of Xixing.</p><p></p><p>The eerie purple eyes burst with dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>"It's over..."</p><p></p><p>"I've caught you!"</p><p></p><p>However, what made the eerie purple-eyed Jie Haihui slightly stunned was...</p><p></p><p>Facing the activated bloodline talent, the dragon god-possessed him, Xixing did not have the slightest fear.</p><p></p><p>In her pupils, there was even excitement blooming!  She stared at Jie Haihui.</p><p></p><p>"I can't control it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Immortal Crafted Gatling Gun in Xixing's hand fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>And Xixing's arms became extremely hot, a strand of purple fire instantly wrapped around Xixing's chubby, lotus-like arms! Like a purple fire python, flicking its tongue!</p><p></p><p>Like an ancient divine weapon awakening from its millennia-old slumber, releasing a bit of divine power, fusing with Xixing's arm bones.</p><p></p><p>Xixing's eyes also ignited with purple flames.</p><p></p><p>A purple flame snake spear divine pattern formed on her brow.</p><p></p><p>Her small figure, at this moment, seemed to have risen high</p>

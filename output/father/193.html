        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds and heavy rains, howling in the sky above, spraying down like bullets.</p><p></p><p>But they are blocked by the hazy mist, stirring up ripples of mist! A faint ringing sound, accompanied by the raindrops tearing through the mist, comes a mournful cry, like an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, none of the people on the Angry Cliff have the mood to listen to this angry sound.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is looking at the end of the parting mist, the only figure that has squeezed into the strange temple, sitting on the steps, shrouded by the black lotus platform.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be her?"</p><p></p><p>"The prodigy of our Jin Guang Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha! It's the prodigy of our Jin Guang Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Exclamations resounded endlessly, and even many cultivators of Jin Guang Mansion couldn't help but suppress their laughter and burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>For many cultivators, the sense of regional honor is actually very important.</p><p></p><p>The Three Prince's Strange Temple is located in Jin Guang Mansion, and although it is not private property, the cultivators of Jin Guang Mansion will subconsciously think of it as belonging to Jin Guang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when other mansions, other states, the Dao City, or even the Divine Capital send prodigies and geniuses to compete, it will inevitably arouse the hidden sense of honor in the hearts of many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It's just like in many competitive sports, where people will subconsciously support the players from their hometown.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when Xixie was just about to start the Temple Spirit Resonance, she had not even taken a step forward, and was even considered to have no Temple Spirit Resonance in this Temple Spirit Resonance competition, and might end up with nothing.</p><p></p><p>But now, the situation has far exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, she is the prodigy of our Jin Guang Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, what are the prodigies of the Divine Capital and the Dao City?"</p><p></p><p>"They are nothing special!"</p><p></p><p>Excitement surged incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Xixie became the only child among all the children who crossed the three hundred meters and stepped into the strange temple area.</p><p></p><p>The Temple Spirit Resonance degree... exceeded 90%! On the cliff!</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo let out a long sigh, and the smile on the corner of his lips could no longer be suppressed. "Haha, good girl, good girl!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's white hair flew, his sleeves billowed wildly behind him.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Envoy Immortal and the six Black Armor Blood Guards beside him had eyes full of killing intent, cold and angry, Nan Liehuo still laughed.</p><p></p><p>Aren't you little prince dead? Aren't I allowed to celebrate for my disciple?</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's face was extremely cold, staring at Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head again, looking at the situation on the raging river, and his heart was chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>The little prince Jie Haijun has died...</p><p></p><p>And Nan Liehuo's little girl disciple has become the one with the highest Temple Spirit Resonance degree! She is about to obtain the inheritance of the temple god! Painful, frustrated, angry! Su Huai clenched his fists, looking at the self-satisfied Nan Liehuo, the killing intent could no longer be suppressed and was revealed.</p><p></p><p>But he held back.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his hand with a cold expression, hiding the killing intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai also knew very well.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haijun died here, and he had an indelible connection, and he had probably completely ruined his image in the teacher's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai closed his eyes, his future... was likely over.</p><p></p><p>He had to find a way to make up for it from other places.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya screamed excitedly, sweeping away the gloom brought by Lü Qi's bloodstained body! "Ah, my husband! Is that Xixie? Is that my daughter Xixie?"</p><p></p><p>"How powerful is my daughter!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is the one with the highest Temple Spirit Resonance degree, she succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand what the temple god's inheritance was, she only knew that her daughter had won the first place in this competition among many prodigies and geniuses.</p><p></p><p>She was so happy that she couldn't contain her smile. "Xixie is great, mom will make you red-braised pork, sweet and sour fish, and red-braised pigs' trotters when I go back!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was so happy that she couldn't suppress her smile.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong beside her also sighed with relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Che leaned against the carriage pole, the corner of his mouth curving into a warm arc. Although he had expected it earlier, the sense of contentment and excitement still surged in his heart when the final result appeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his daughter in the spotlight, Li Che was in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>As a father, don't you just hope that your children can make a name for themselves and achieve good results?</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, girl."</p><p></p><p>Li Che chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Now, the only thing Li Che was curious about was what kind of temple god inheritance Xixie would obtain.</p><p></p><p>In this Temple Spirit Resonance, Xixie had already obtained two divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>One is the other round Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, and the other divine weapon... is the golden brick that had beaten Jie Haijun into submission.</p><p></p><p>What that golden brick is, Li Che has not yet investigated.</p><p></p><p>It looks like it's made of pure gold... it's just... very expensive.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che cannot predict whether the Three Prince Temple God will give Xixie another divine weapon in the final result of the Temple Spirit Resonance.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>Xixie is still far from completing the Three Prince's divine weapon set. Although Xixie has the Purple Flame Snake Spear, the Fire Tip Spear, a Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, and a golden brick.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Che's memory, there are still the Mixed Heaven Binding, the Qiankun Circle, the Yin Yang Sword, the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield, the Subduing Demon Mace, the Demon Slaying Knife, and the Embroidered Ball...</p><p></p><p>Well, it's a bit mixed, but it's based on Li Che's understanding from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether the temple god in this world also has these divine weapons, Li Che has no way of knowing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che can't simply guess based on the ideas of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>But it's still worth looking forward to.</p><p></p><p>On the Angry Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was constantly changing, some were happy, some were worried, some were open-hearted, and some were angry.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao stroked his beard, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't have much hope for the genius Tang Ren brought by his family.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected Li Che's daughter Li Nuanxi to be so remarkable.</p><p></p><p>As a local genius from the humble Jin Guang Mansion, she actually surpassed the prodigies from the Dao City, the Divine Capital, and even the son of the Pacifying King.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked at Lü Qi, vaguely guessing something.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu stroked his beard and laughed heartily, his mood delighted.</p><p></p><p>The bet he made with Nan Liehuo, now he can go and fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>The Three Prince Temple God's Resonance degree reaching 90%, such a genius, recommending to the Sect Master, should be without any problems at all.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! However.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone's attitudes were eager.</p><p></p><p>A towering wave of anger swept through.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal was shrouded in black qi, the powerful spiritual energy like a collapsing mountain, instantly plunging the entire cliff into silence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao, Wang Daoren, and Zhu Chaoyang frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Prince's Martial Saint will?"</p><p></p><p>The cold and unbelievable voice came from the Envoy Immortal.</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal had been waiting for the Prince's Martial Saint will, and the Grand Master-level aura that had clashed and exploded in the mist earlier had indeed burst out the Martial Saint will.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal, the Black Armor Blood Guards, and Su Huai, who had been waiting for the Prince's Martial Saint will, had not appeared! What's going on?! That was the Martial Saint bloodline will of the late Prince, containing the power of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>How could it have disappeared? Was it suppressed by the temple god? Killed by the murderer who killed Jie Haijun?</p><p></p><p>Outrageous! Presumptuous!</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the Envoy Immortal was furious beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>And Su Huai was also angry at first, but slowly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>At least, he didn't have to face the teacher's wrath immediately.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint will... was extinguished by someone?</p><p></p><p>This news suddenly made many people stunned.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao, Wang Kuyu, Zhu Chaoyang, and other Spiritual Immortal and Grand Master-level experts, their eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the terrifying nature of this.</p><p></p><p>Any one of the three of them, if they were to face the Martial Saint will of the Pacifying King Jie Mogli, would not be able to disperse it!</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them were horrified.</p><p></p><p>Among these people...</p><p></p><p>Is there still such a powerful expert hidden?</p><p></p><p>Able to disperse the Martial Saint will, at least also in the Spiritual Immortal realm, having their divine soul molted and transformed to the later realm, or having refined at least twenty-five divine roars of a Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Elder Jiao?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he spoke, the sharp and keen gaze of that coachman Grand Master immediately swept over, and the terrifying blood qi roared like a fierce lion.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's impossible..."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiao needs to wield the Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel, he couldn't have divided his mind to fight the Martial Saint will."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu immediately denied it.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the atmosphere became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal did not speak again.</p><p></p><p>He also realized the seriousness of the matter, in the Temple Spirit Resonance... something must have happened that they did not know about.</p><p></p><p>Because, Jie Haijun died, his Martial Saint bloodline and Dragon God bloodline would be activated...</p><p></p><p>The Dragon God bloodline may not be as strong as the Martial Saint bloodline due to the Dragon Queen Consort, but it should at least be at the half-step Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Even the Martial Saint will was extinguished! Who was it?! The Envoy Immortal first excluded Jiao Shaoqun, but if it was not Jiao Shaoqun... could it be one of the participating child prodigies and geniuses?</p><p></p><p>After all, the only ones who could step into the opened Strange Pavilion were the child prodigies and geniuses with innate divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Other people stepping in would trigger the Strange Pavilion's upheaval and be dragged into the Strange Pavilion, facing the Pavilion's guardian cursed corpses and terrifying monsters.</p><p></p><p>The guardian cursed corpses and monsters of the Four Mysterious Strange Temples, even if a Martial Saint fell into them, they would probably be in a mess.</p><p></p><p>"After we retrieve the Prince's body... we will leave Jin Guang Mansion City immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal looked at the six Black Armor Blood Guards and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The one who killed the Prince must be related to these child prodigies and geniuses..."</p><p></p><p>The Envoy Immortal's eyes in the black mist were cold and sharp, sweeping over those children's figures.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the first echelon of Tie Shancai, Qin Huofire, Lü Qi, and... Xixie.</p><p></p><p>At least these four children are not unrelated!</p><p></p><p>This news...</p><p></p><p>Must be brought back.</p><p></p><p>As for how to solve it, the Prince will send experts good at investigation.</p><p></p><p>They don't need to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the carriage pole, Li Che looked at them calmly, his eyes unruffled and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>He naturally heard the Envoy Immortal's words.</p><p></p><p>This Spiritual Immortal obviously also knew the seriousness of the matter.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master Xue Dumu died in Jin Guang Mansion City, and the little prince also died here, this matter... is no longer something they can handle.</p><p></p><p>By saying this, it is actually his last stubborn defiance and deterrence.</p><p></p><p>Take away the little prince's body... and return safely?</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's heart slightly stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Return..."</p><p></p><p>"How can I let you return safely?"</p><p></p><p>"The ruthless and violent Corpse Deity Sect, and the Hunting God Pavilion... will not let you go."</p><p></p><p>If the water is to be muddied, it might as well be muddier.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled slightly.</p><p></p><p>His fingers tapped lightly on the carriage pole.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flowed bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>The heated atmosphere gradually became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The result of the Temple Spirit Resonance has been completely revealed, and there will be no more changes.</p><p></p><p>Now what they are waiting for is the conclusion of the Temple Spirit Resonance, and what these children have gained in the Temple Spirit Resonance competition.</p><p></p><p>For example, whether they can truly obtain the inheritance of the temple god, and the so-called divine weapon set of the Three Prince! After all, this is the Four Mysterious Strange Temples.</p><p></p><p>The highest inheritance can even reach the Four Mysterious level!</p><p></p><p>In the mist.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun sat cross-legged, his withered face like rotten wood, with beads of sweat rolling down.</p><p></p><p>He had exhausted all his strength just to maintain this Temple Spirit Resonance competition.</p><p></p><p>And during this Temple Spirit Resonance, something must have happened that forced Jiao Shaoqun to spend more energy to maintain it, almost unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun couldn't care about that much, he could only strive to host this competition well.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>The majestic temple god spirituality was surging.</p><p></p><p>The children who had produced the Temple Spirit Resonance were obtaining the temple god's blessings and inheritance.</p><p></p><p>After persisting for a while, Jiao Shaoqun finally slowly stood up from the cross-legged position, his ancient clothes fluttering, and a look of relief appeared on his haggard face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally had the energy to look at the final result.</p><p></p><p>The result of the Temple Spirit Resonance competition was somewhat beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>But it did not surprise him too much.</p><p></p><p>His turbid and profound gaze rested on three figures.</p><p></p><p>Xixie, Lü Qi, and Qin Huofire.</p><p></p><p>Among them, he lingered the longest on Qin Huofire, and even his gaze was deep and thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie and Lü Qi, old man had some expectations... what about this Qin Huofire?"</p><p></p><p>The old man frowned.</p><p></p><p>However, although he was puzzled, he did not dwell on it too much at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! In the sky above, countless fiery lights burst and scattered, the golden wheels spinning at high speed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an ancient Buddhist bell had been struck, the waves of the bell sound bursting open.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was awakened from their immersion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the crowd slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>Xixi sat on the lotus platform, her long, curled eyelashes fluttering as she opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She scratched her back and shifted her buttocks a bit. </p><p></p><p>This lotus platform was a bit uncomfortable to sit on.</p><p></p><p>Many voices were resounding in her mind, the blessings and inheritances bestowed by the temple deities.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Suddenly, the lotus platform exploded into black flames, transforming into a black lotus of fire, like a black lotus blooming from the depths of hell, the flames surging to lift Xixi's form.</p><p></p><p>Xixi giggled "haha haha", her eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>The flames slowly sank into her flesh and blood, gradually settling, reflecting a black lotus divine mark on the spot between her eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>This added an air of divinity to Xixi.</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi and Qin Fenghuо's bodies were also enveloped in black flames at the same time.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Xixi, the amount of black flames around them was much less, eventually converging on the spot between their eyebrows, forming a hellish lotus divine mark.</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо had a sinister smile on his lips, his eyes opening and closing.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and touched the scorching hellish lotus divine mark.</p><p></p><p>The hellish lotus divine mark was a symbol of the temple deity's divinity. Although the temple deity's divinity was diminished... but he had still completed his task, successfully absorbing the temple deity's divinity into his body.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I couldn't step into the Mysterious Temple... Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>His sight fell on the little girl scratching herself on the steps of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Impossible! How could this girl have stepped into the Mysterious Temple? This was the Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple, the level of temple deity resonance... needed to be able to step into the Mysterious Temple area!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he saw the hellish lotus divine mark on Xixi's forehead, his whole body trembled, feeling the overwhelming black flames suddenly pressing down.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the temple deity's divinity he had absorbed... it was far too much, too much! No wonder the temple deity's divinity he had absorbed was much less than he had imagined...</p><p></p><p>The mystery was solved, it turned out that this girl had single-handedly absorbed most of the temple deity's divinity!</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi also opened his eyes, his body covered in blood, but his eyes were very calm and clear.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and looked at Xixi with a faint gaze.</p><p></p><p>Xixi also saw Lu Chi and came running down from the Mysterious Temple, pitter-pattering.</p><p></p><p>"Chichi! What happened to you? Why is there so much blood on you?"</p><p></p><p>"Who bullied you? Tell Big Empress Xixi, Big Empress Xixi will beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi clenched her chubby arms, raising them up.</p><p></p><p>She hopped and skipped to Lu Chi's side, raising her face, her baby-fat cheeks with two shining big eyes, blinking.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Chi just looked at Xixi indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xixi was now incredibly adorable in his heart, as dazzling as the sun, as splendid as blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Chi's heart was as calm as a dead pool.</p><p></p><p>There was even a sense of detachment in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if he wanted to isolate himself from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of the way."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Dazed.</p><p></p><p>Big Head Lu... what are you saying?!</p><p></p><p>Xixi was a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Chi's eyes were unmoved, not even looking at Xixi, walking past her.</p><p></p><p>In the moment they brushed shoulders, they were as cold and indifferent as passersby on the street, like the icy gale in the depths of winter.</p><p></p><p>Xixi clenched her fists, her mouth puffing up in anger, stomping as she turned around: "Lu Chi!"</p><p></p><p>But Lu Chi continued to walk away indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xixi felt a bit aggrieved!</p><p></p><p>But she was even angrier! Was this still her good friend Lu Chi?!</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi! You better not come play with my scooter again!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not allowed to come to Xixi's house anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi's body paused, his figure trembling slightly, a flash of pain and struggle in his eyes, but ultimately this pain and struggle turned into coldness.</p><p></p><p>He wiped the blood-stained face, completely cold and cruel.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi replied indifferently and continued on.</p><p></p><p>Xixi clenched her little fists, wildly swinging them in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Stupid Lu Chi, smelly Lu Chi! How dare you talk to Big Empress Xixi like that!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm so angry!"</p><p></p><p>"We're not friends anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"That's what Big Empress Xixi says!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi also had a temper!</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Chi did not look back, but his voice drifted over again, faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Friends? If not, then not..."</p><p></p><p>"Scooter? What a childish and ridiculous thing."</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо beside them had a flickering gaze, staring at Lu Chi, with a hint of horror in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lunatic!</p><p></p><p>To choose temple deity resonance in such a way!</p><p></p><p>Truly carving out the flesh and bones?</p><p></p><p>Severing the seven emotions and six desires?</p><p></p><p>He could endure such torment and suffering?</p><p></p><p>This big-headed guy... what a ruthless character?! This kid took away even more temple deity divinity than him, Qin Fenghuо really wasn't jealous at all...</p><p></p><p>He deserves it.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity resonance was over.</p><p></p><p>The hellish lotus wind fire golden light wheel opened the path of departure, the children one by one left, some disappointed, some happy, some regretful, returning to the top of the Hear Anger Cliff from the path carved out in the Mysterious Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu gestured to control the golden light wheel, walking to Xixi's side, ruffling the angry Xixi's head.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, little girl."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu said gently.</p><p></p><p>However, as his palm just landed on Xixi's head, his eyes couldn't help but ripple slightly: "Xixi... you obtained the second round of the hellish lotus wind fire golden light wheel?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi was still angry at Lu Chi, feeling a sense of loss of her good friend in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lu Chi had been her good friend from Flying Thunder City all the way to Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>To say they were no longer friends just like that, she was very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>But Xixi also felt proud, since Lu Chi didn't care about her, she wouldn't care about Lu Chi either!</p><p></p><p>Her mood gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>She forced a smile on her face, raising her chubby little feet, wiggling her toes.</p><p></p><p>"Elder grandpa, you guessed right!"</p><p></p><p>"But Xixi can't seem to make the little wheel fly out."</p><p></p><p>Xixi said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu paused for a moment, then stroked his beard and burst into laughter, his whole body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha haha... good, good, good!"</p><p></p><p>The second round of the golden light wheel has also appeared! The hellish lotus wind fire golden light wheel, this divine weapon, has finally been fully assembled! This is a great thing, a huge blessing!</p><p></p><p>A talent like Xixi, it would be a waste of talent to keep her in Golden Light Prefecture, she must be sent to the Qian Yuan Immortal Sect!</p><p></p><p>A genius who can control the second round of the golden light wheel...</p><p></p><p>Only the orthodox Immortal Sect can teach Xixi to master this Four Sovereign Divine Weapon! Even use the power of the divine weapon to grow stronger!</p><p></p><p>To have such a divine child...</p><p></p><p>It is truly a blessing for the Qian Yuan Immortal Sect!</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu was very happy, as an old cultivator who had dedicated his life to the Immortal Sect, his sense of belonging to the Immortal Sect was naturally extremely high. To see the Immortal Sect gain such a profound divine child, he was extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>Taking Xixi's hand, Jiao Shaoqiu led the little girl along the path.</p><p></p><p>The golden light wheel spun happily, sparking, like a proud sun guiding the way.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the corpse of Ji Haihui, Jiao Shaoqiu's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"Corpse Deity Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu immediately saw the death qi and corpse qi entangled in Ji Haihui's body, as well as a powerful and terrifying silver aura!</p><p></p><p>Corpse Deity Sect... Cursed Silver Corpse! Jiao Shaoqiu immediately thought of the aura he had collided with before.</p><p></p><p>So... </p><p></p><p>It was an evil person from the Corpse Deity Sect who struck down Ji Haihui, awakening his bloodline's Martial Saint will.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>This evil person from the Corpse Deity Sect had extremely high methods, actually suppressing and shattering the Martial Saint will.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was the Martial Saint will, the evil person from the Corpse Deity Sect shattered the Martial Saint will, probably also suffering heavy injuries, so they could not continue to attack the children participating in the temple deity resonance and fled...</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu just with a glance, his mind quickly deduced and supplemented the course of the event.</p><p></p><p>"It can only be said... that the young prince saved the children participating in the temple deity resonance this time."</p><p></p><p>"Great, no need for more words."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>The death of someone is not light as a feather.</p><p></p><p>Xixi pursed her lips, very obediently, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was very smart, and also understood that Ji Haihui's death as a little slave would definitely bring great trouble.</p><p></p><p>So, no one can know that it was Xixi who killed her.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would bring great trouble to her father and mother! Jiao Shaoqiu's divine energy surged, lifting Ji Haihui's half-human, half-dragon corpse, feeling a bit headachy, although the reason for the matter was known.</p><p></p><p>But it still would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>However, it is something that must be faced.</p><p></p><p>Holding Xixi's hand, Jiao Shaoqiu used his divine energy to lift Ji Haihui's corpse, leaving the swirling mist of the Mysterious Abyss with the children.</p><p></p><p>As they left, the mist shrouded and covered the place again!</p><p></p><p>When they returned to the top of the Hear Anger Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chao Sheng, Gong Yuan Liang, Gong Yang Xiu and other children immediately couldn't hold back, running excitedly towards Xixi.</p><p></p><p>A group of children shouted excitedly, extremely excited, praising Big Empress Xixi.</p><p></p><p>Xixi put her hands on her hips, puffing out her little belly, very satisfied with their attitude.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi, hmph!</p><p></p><p>A dog doesn't care!</p><p></p><p>The mist swirled, the Mysterious Abyss rumbled, the waters of the Nine Dragon River roared and surged, spraying thousands of feet high!</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Abyss gradually became semi-transparent, as if with the disappearance of the mist, it was about to start disappearing from this world.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts had their eyes flashing like lightning, sweeping over.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, it seemed that they saw terrifying figures crossing back and forth in the Mysterious Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Abyss..."</p><p></p><p>"The City of the Dao side is proposing to organize powerful experts to attack this Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple... Otherwise, this Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple is likely to become a hidden danger."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Corpse Deity Sect, the Hunting God Pavilion have set their sights on this Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple, and are about to take action..."</p><p></p><p>"So the court here plans to no longer let this Mysterious Temple continue to exist, wanting to conquer it and then control this Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>His words echoed endlessly on the Hear Anger Cliff.</p><p></p><p>He did not hide his words.</p><p></p><p>But as his words fell, on the Cliff, many cultivators of the small and large families of Golden Light Prefecture turned pale.</p><p></p><p>This is definitely a major event that can affect the situation of the entire prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Li Che got off the carriage, hearing these words, his heart slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>But he thought of the situation he had seen in the mist with the Plucking Star Eyes, and couldn't help but shake his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Assault this Mysterious Temple? It might not be that easy...</p><p></p><p>Li Che always felt that this Four Sovereign Mysterious Temple was a bit different from other Four Sovereign Mysterious Temples.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's also possible that he has never seen other Four Sovereign Mysterious Temples.</p><p></p><p>But his instinct told Li Che...</p><p></p><p>If they really want to move this Mysterious Temple, the court and various forces, they might have to pay a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Holding Zhang Ya's hand as she got off the carriage, Zhang Ya lifted her skirt and hurriedly ran towards Xixi's direction, and Li Che was also pulled along, involuntarily jogging.</p><p></p><p>On the Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard True Person, the six Black Armor Blood Guards, and Su Huai took away Ji Haihui's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Corpse Deity Sect - !!!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard True Person's eyes were filled with killing intent! This dense death qi and corpse qi, as well as the cursed silver corpse's silver aura, were the hallmarks of a powerful expert from the Corpse Deity Sect! But... was it really the Corpse Deity Sect's doing?</p><p></p><p>Why did the Corpse Deity Sect only kill Ji Haihui? And not attack the other children? Although Jiao Shaoqiu had given a guess and explanation... but the Shadow Guard True Person did not think it was so.</p><p></p><p>The truth...</p><p></p><p>It must be found! The Shadow Guard True Person, the Black Armor Blood Guards, and Su Huai, with heavy hearts, took Ji Haihui's corpse and left.</p><p></p><p>For some, this temple deity resonance was a carnival.</p><p></p><p>But for the City Lord's Mansion, it was only endless sorrow! Nan Li Huo was all smiles, laughing merrily.</p><p></p><p>He came alongside Wang Dao Ren.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, Zhang Ya and the others also came over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xixi was the biggest focus of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by her little friends.</p><p></p><p>And the little ones were also excitedly discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Xixi! This time I made a slight mistake, I didn't do as well as Gong Yuan Liang, but I also obtained the temple deity's blessing, a low-grade divine law of the Six Divisions! I can soon become stronger! Xixi, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Chao Sheng came up to Xixi, excitedly saying! He knew that Xixi needed a powerful friend, and he, Hai Chao Sheng, would definitely become stronger! "Xixi, I also obtained the temple deity's blessing, a divine law of the middle-grade Six Divisions! Better than Hai Chao Sheng! Xixi, what about you? What blessing did you obtain from the temple deity?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuan Liang pushed away Hai Chao Sheng, curiously asking.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty Zhou Peng, Yun E, Gong Yang Yu and other children also looked over curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xixi put her hands on her hips, her little face twitching, like a child who had obtained a fun toy, boasting.</p><p></p><p>"Only Six Divisions!"</p><p></p><p>"Liang Liang, you're a little spicy chicken!"</p><p></p><p>"Big Empress Xixi also obtained a divine law, called the [Eight-Armed Three-Faced Hellish Lotus Indestructible Divine Embryo Law]!"</p><p></p><p>"It's at the Three Clear level!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The snow drifted, icy and bone-chilling. </p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's inner heart was filled with immense warmth and excitement.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the fourth Dao fruit could be simply understood as a form of monitoring, a guarantee of his daughter's safety. </p><p></p><p>As long as the concentrated spiritual chess piece remained by Xixia's side, if she ever encountered any danger, it could instantly appear beside her.</p><p></p><p>For an old father, such a Dao fruit... would be the greatest comfort to his heart.</p><p></p><p>In Feilei City, the threat posed by the Lingying Sect had not yet dissipated. </p><p></p><p>In fact, it was even escalating, and Li Che was well aware that the Lingying Sect was deeply entangled with the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect..." </p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused, as he held the white chess piece condensed from spiritual energy in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He wondered when he would be able to deal with this calamity...</p><p></p><p>"Senior Li, are you currently investigating the headquarters of the Lingying Sect? Have you made any progress?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Lingying Sect could be eliminated, it would naturally be a great boon for Feilei City. Parents with children would be able to sleep more soundly at night."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>In his workshop, he continued to research the "Chess Saint" Dao fruit. </p><p></p><p>After condensing three white spiritual chess pieces, he was unable to condense any more, which meant that three pieces were his current limit.</p><p></p><p>"Only three pieces... One for Xixia, one for my wife, that should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"As the maturity of the Chess Saint Dao fruit increases, the number of chess pieces that can be condensed will correspondingly increase."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered this thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and a luminous display appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Name: Li Che]</p><p>[Bonds: Li Nuan Xixia (daughter)]</p><p>[Dao Fruits: Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 10%), Dragon-Elephant Vajra (Lv2, 49%), Unsullied Heart (Lv1, 20%), Chess Saint (Lv1, 1%)]</p><p>[Nascent Divine Abilities: Immortal Craftsman - Thousand Slivers of the Hand]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the overall improvement on the panel, Li Che couldn't help but raise the corner of his lips in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Once I break through to the Penetrating Meridians realm, I should be able to bring the maturity of the Dragon-Elephant Vajra Dao fruit to 50%. Unfortunately, compared to the 'Immortal Craftsman', reaching Lv3 for the 'Dragon-Elephant Vajra' is much more difficult."</p><p></p><p>Stretching his arms, Li Che grew increasingly hopeful about the future.</p><p></p><p>"What I'm currently lacking the most is spiritual cultivation techniques. That is the primary means for spiritual cultivators to fight. The spiritual martial arts I previously obtained from Guo Zhan are barely sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The work was almost complete.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the sky, Li Che returned to the workshop courtyard and took out the birthday gift he had prepared for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>The "twist car" that Li Che had handmade was not at all difficult for him now, but it would bring great joy to Xixia, which was very nice. He secretly played with the twist car in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was three years old, and Li Che had also become a 22-year-old spiritual child...</p><p></p><p>As a 22-year-old spiritual child, was there any problem with him playing the twist car? After playing enough, Li Che picked up the twist car and left the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>He first went to Jinhuang Pavilion, ordered a table of good wine and good dishes, and had the staff at Jinhuang Pavilion pack and send them to the courtyard in the inner city where his family lived.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's family had completely moved into the inner city, and the financially powerful Li Che had purchased a two-story courtyard in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had also moved in to live together.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Old Chen lived in the outer city to seek peace and quiet, but now that Xixia had moved to the inner city, he could not bear to part with her and came along.</p><p></p><p>After ordering Xixia's birthday banquet, Li Che then went to Xu Ji Shen Xiu Academy to pick up Xixia from school.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, what is this?" </p><p></p><p>Xixia, being carried by Li Che, had one hand around Li Che's neck, and her big eyes curiously looked at the "twist car" that Li Che was holding with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"It's a birthday gift that Daddy made for Xixia, come and play with it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly taught Xixia how to use it.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, the big-headed Lu Chi stared with wide eyes, stretching his neck to watch Xixia happily twisting on the twist car, unable to help but feel envious and eager to try it.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Lu Chi, do you want to try it?" Xixia said with a bright smile, dimples showing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Chi felt that Xixia was simply a fairy from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, feeling Li Che's deep gaze like the hell ox, Lu Chi could only feel his scalp tingling: "I'm a big kid now, I won't play with such childish toys!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Chi turned his head, struggling not to let tears of envy fall.</p><p></p><p>Xu You, wearing a scholarly white robe, followed behind them with a gentle expression, but there were many worries between his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Ache, after celebrating Xixia's birthday, I'm afraid I'll be busy. There has been another uprising in the mysterious temple outside the city, with evil creatures rampaging, and many villages have been in chaos. The Xu family, An family, and Yang family in the inner city have formed a cleaning squad, and I've been assigned an out-of-city cleaning task again."</p><p></p><p>Xu You said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che frowned: "You are the direct descendant, how can they let you go on such a dangerous task? The other Yang and An families are all sending their collateral descendants to lead the team, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You shook his head helplessly: "I'm used to it..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just as well, it can be considered a trial for you." </p><p></p><p>Xu You's temperament was just like that, too soft, not fighting or competing.</p><p></p><p>"You should fight for what you deserve. As the direct descendant, the rights you should have should be in your own hands." Li Che advised.</p><p></p><p>Xu You nodded with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't say more, raised his hand and patted Xu You's shoulder, and the "chess piece" of the [Untainted Heart] divine nature silently entered Xu You's body.</p><p></p><p>Xu You didn't even notice the anomaly and continued to chat and laugh with Xixia.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was cool.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sent the drunken Old Chen, who was loudly claiming he wasn't drunk, and bid farewell to the elder cousin who had been invited to celebrate Xixia's third birthday, then sat down under the eaves with Xu You.</p><p></p><p>The hot stove boiled water, and the green tea leaves rolled in the boiling water.</p><p></p><p>A bowl of tea after drinking, happier than the immortals.</p><p></p><p>Holding the simple and rough green tea brewed by Li Che, Xu You chatted with Li Che about the safety issues of Xixia going to the Shen Xiu Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I've asked Aunt Shu, she will personally come to the door to escort Xixia into the academy. Aunt Shu is an elder of the Shen Xiu Academy, she is trustworthy. When you come to pick up Xixia, she will also see Xixia and Lu Chi out of the Shen Xiu Academy..."</p><p></p><p>With the threat of the infant demon not yet dissipated, Xu You was naturally very careful, worrying about Xixia's safety.</p><p></p><p>Li Che drank the hot tea and nodded with a smile, getting up and pretending to go to the inner room, then coming out again with a half-meter-high statue in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu."</p><p></p><p>"Take this 'Three Immortals Riding a Cow Suspending Thought Sword Statue'."</p><p></p><p>Xu You was startled.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively putting down the tea bowl in his hand, he took the wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he touched the wooden sculpture, he felt the [Suspending Thought Flowing Sword] divine nature within him slightly boiling.</p><p></p><p>This wooden sculpture... possessed such a strong divine nature! Xu You looked at Li Che with surprise and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Old Li, have you become a master of wood carving?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Reflect on myself every day, and seek to continue reading! The backend pseudo-tracking is approaching 3,000 today, maintaining it, there is still hope for next week! Everyone must continue reading, don't let the book rest, seek monthly tickets and recommendation tickets, Li Che thanks you!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is normal for young children to like to show off when they get good things. Although Xixia is much more mature than her peers, she is still just a four-year-old girl.</p><p></p><p>So her voice spread, causing the nearby Nanlihuо, Wang Kuyu, and others to change their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Eight-Armed Three-Faced Hell Lotus Indestructible Divine Embryo Technique'?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuо's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a thunderbolt had fallen by his ear!</p><p></p><p>Divine Embryo Technique! And it was a Sanqing-level technique that could reach the Divine Embryo realm in one breath!</p><p></p><p>Since Xixia said it was a Sanqing-level technique, she must not be exaggerating, after all, this kind of thing is not easy to exaggerate, the authenticity can be seen at a glance.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>This strange temple is only at the Siyue level, how could it have a Sanqing-level divine technique?!</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuо and Wang Kuyu were both shaken.</p><p></p><p>They didn't care about the boastful tone in Xixia's words, whether it would attract the attention of other interested parties.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was truly a Sanqing-level divine technique, it was a gift from the temple deity, and one needed to have an extremely high resonance with this strange temple's deity to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Others could basically not cultivate it at all, it was a divine technique exclusive to Xixia! So even if Xixia's divine technique was Sanqing-level, basically no one would specifically covet it.</p><p></p><p>But what was really concerning was that Xixia actually obtained a Sanqing-level divine technique from a Siyue strange temple!</p><p></p><p>Li Che also noticed the expressions of Nanlihuо and Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, Senior Wang, is there something strange?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but ask on Xixia's behalf.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu stroked his beard and said softly, "Of course there are strange points, but Xixia is fine, obtaining such a technique is a great opportunity for this girl..."</p><p></p><p>"We are strange, because we are strange that Xixia could actually obtain a Sanqing technique..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this 'Eight-Armed Hell Lotus Angry Third Prince' strange temple is only at the Siyue level, not the Sanqing level."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuо's expression also changed as he looked at the strange temple that was surging with great waves, like a hell lotus blooming in the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"If Xixia really obtained a Sanqing technique..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu glanced at Li Che, then his gaze fell on Xixia again.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and exhaled, his voice slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"It means..."</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit of this Third Prince strange temple..."</p><p></p><p>"May be at the Sanqing level! Not Siyue!"</p><p></p><p>Boom--! It was as if a thunderbolt was rolling and exploding in the sky above the river!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows raised slightly, and a hint of surprise flashed in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the strange scenes he had seen with his Plucking Star Eyes and Returning to the True, his heart also trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Sanqing... strange temple?</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's just a possibility... It can even be understood that this Third Prince strange temple may be upgraded to a Sanqing strange temple."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuо shook his head and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>No matter how it was said, this was not good news.</p><p></p><p>Xixia and her little companions around her did not know the worries of the adults.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they were extremely amazed and praised Xixia as the Great Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Especially Hai Chao Sheng, Gong Yang Xiu, Gong Yuan Liang and others, they were extremely familiar in their pursuit of Xixia, making Xixia a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>After all, these little companions really spoke well.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai found Zhu Chaoyang, his face full of resentment and displeasure.</p><p></p><p>He was not satisfied with his performance in this temple deity resonance, and was actually surpassed by the three divine children and spiritual children from Jinguang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>What frustrated Tie Shanцai the most was that he didn't even see a glimpse of the "Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear".</p><p></p><p>This shouldn't be!</p><p></p><p>His mother had personally asked the Great Monitor, and the Great Monitor's calculation, how could it be wrong?</p><p></p><p>The Great Monitor said that the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear would appear in this strange temple.</p><p></p><p>So he came from afar to participate in this temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>The result, he got nothing!</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai's temper was about to explode now, he crossed his arms angrily, his face looked very unpleasant and unhappy.</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear is very compatible with my Sanmai Fire, if it really exists, it must be attracted by me, but there is nothing... There are only two possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"The first is that the Great Monitor's calculation was wrong, and the Fire Tip Spear is not in this strange temple, and the second is that the Great Monitor's calculation was not wrong, the Fire Tip Spear is here, but... someone has already obtained it."</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai analyzed logically.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang looked at Tie Shanцai with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"Then what?"</p><p></p><p>What do you want to do?</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai shook his small radish-like head: "I tend towards the second situation, so I will stay in the prefecture city for a while."</p><p></p><p>"I have to find that Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear!"</p><p></p><p>"I must find it!"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai's words made Zhu Chaoyang's brows furrow: "It's too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"And it's just your guess that the Fire Tip Spear has really been obtained by someone, even if you find the one who obtained the Fire Tip Spear, are you going to directly snatch it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang asked.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shanцai tilted his head and looked at this Grand Master Zhu Chaoyang.</p><p></p><p>"Can't I?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>Gale and rain, lightning and thunder, the sky and earth were dark.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity resonance event has completely drawn the curtain.</p><p></p><p>Many caravan teams are starting to return to the city of Jinguang Prefecture from the banks of the Nine Dragon River.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was carried by Li Che and sat in the carriage, chattering endlessly, talking about how powerful she was in the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy! That temple deity is so bad, it actually wanted Xixia to cut off her flesh and remove her bones! It's so bad, it actually wanted Xixia to give up Daddy and Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia clenched her little fists, and she was still very angry when she thought about it!</p><p></p><p>Xixia couldn't imagine how terrible and painful the days would be without Daddy and Mommy!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya heard this and immediately hugged Xixia with a heartbroken expression, her cheek rubbing against Xixia's chubby face, constantly caressing her.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy's precious Xixia, truly Mommy's darling!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was heartbroken, at such a young age, she had to experience such a test of human nature in the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhang Ya also felt sorry for that Third Prince, unable to imagine how terrible his fate was.</p><p></p><p>Xixia snuggled into Zhang Ya's embrace, reaching out to hug her mother, complaining about Lü Qi.</p><p></p><p>She said that from today on, she would break up with Lü Qi and never be friends with her again.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, from now on, don't make delicious food for Lü Qi anymore! Don't let Lü Qi come to our house to eat delicious food!" Xixia said seriously.</p><p></p><p>At a young age, her mind was also not very big.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che reached out and rubbed Xixia's head: "Okay, Daddy promises you."</p><p></p><p>One less yellow-haired one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was naturally happy.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi doesn't play with Xixia? His daughter doesn't even want her!</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally stood on his daughter's side unconditionally, although Li Che knew that Lü Qi should have chosen to remove the flesh and bone for the sake of higher temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>What does that have to do with Xixia? How dare you coldly ignore Li Che's daughter? Li Che didn't directly smash Lü Qi's head, which was already very merciful, it was just for the sake of Li Qingshan's face.</p><p></p><p>The spirited horses neighed, and the carriage brought by Shangguan Qingfeng was speeding towards the city of Jinguang Prefecture in the heavy rain.</p><p></p><p>Xixia hung on Li Che like a koala bear: "Daddy... Little Fatty Zhou Peng said that Xixia's performance in this temple deity resonance was so good, she's going to go to the Dao City with Grandpa Elder soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused for a moment, rubbing Xixia's head gently: "Xixia has become very powerful now, with so many things hidden in her body... She needs to go to Dao City to cultivate and become very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Xixia's long eyelashes fluttered, and her mouth pouted: "Will Daddy and Mommy go with Xixia?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Fatty Zhou Peng said that Daddy and Mommy can't accompany Xixia to the true Shengsong, and Sister Yun'e also said the same, saying that Xixia can't bring Daddy and Mommy when she goes to the Shengsong Mountain, because Daddy and Mommy can't enter the Shengsong Mountain gate."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean Xixia has to go to that far away place all alone?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia said pitifully.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart melted, hugging Xixia in his arms: "Don't worry, wherever Xixia goes, Daddy and Mommy will be with you. Xixia is still young, how could Daddy and Mommy let Xixia go alone?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her eyes and became happy again.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at her mother: "Really, Mommy?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya smiled: "Really, really, Mommy doesn't want to be separated from Xixia either."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya felt that her husband must be able to solve this problem, she had unconditional trust in him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded gently and warmly: "Daddy and Mommy will pinky promise with Xixia, and won't lie to you!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia stretched out the two little fingers of both hands, hooking one each.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, Mommy, and Xixia."</p><p></p><p>"Pinky promise, won't change in a hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sky was gloomy, and a thunderclap echoed from behind the clouds! The carriage carrying the family of three was speeding into the rain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Xixia must go to Dao City to cultivate in the true Shengsong Sect, that is most suitable for her."</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Jinguang Branch Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went to find Nanlihuо and asked this question.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuо had been away from the Shengsong Sect for too long, and could not give Li Che a definite answer.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun heard this, and a trace of helplessness appeared on his withered and old wooden-like face: "Xixia has obtained the second round of Hell Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel..."</p><p></p><p>"It's too dangerous for Xixia to stay in the city of Jinguang Prefecture, not to mention, she has obtained a Sanqing-level divine technique, even if others cannot cultivate it, it is still a Sanqing technique and will inevitably attract the attention of interested parties."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly... Xixia's temple deity resonance degree reached 90%, and she has refined the Hell Lotus divine pattern, obtaining extremely huge temple deity divine power, these temple deity divine power will assist Xixia's divine cultivation, and can help Xixia quickly cultivate that 'Eight-Armed Three-Faced Hell Lotus Indestructible Divine Embryo Technique'..."</p><p></p><p>"These temple deity divine power have dual attributes, they can bring benefits but also harm, if these temple deity divine power go berserk... they may invade Xixia's consciousness."</p><p></p><p>"So, entering the true Shengsong Sect of the Qianyuan Sect is the only way to better monitor and suppress these temple deity divine power, and ensure safety."</p><p></p><p>"The current Xixia is equivalent to a small temple deity."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun even joked rarely, laughing and saying.</p><p></p><p>Small temple deity Xixia? Li Che's expression did indeed become more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, the Corpse God Cult and the Hunting God Pavilion have been hunting the temple deities of various strange temples, and absorbing the power of the temple deities..."</p><p></p><p>"Like Xixia, this small temple deity, will become the focus of their attention... They may even set their sights on Xixia, coveting the temple deity divine power contained in Xixia's body."</p><p></p><p>"So, for the safety of Xixia, I suggest it's best to set out for Dao City and the Qianyuan Shengsong Sect gate as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"As for you and your wife, according to the rules of the Qianyuan Sect, you will be provided with a residence in Dao City, but you are not allowed to enter the sect gate."</p><p></p><p>"This has always been the rule of the Sect, the disciples' relatives are not allowed to enter the mountain gate, they can live in Dao City, and there will be an opportunity to meet once a month."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows furrowed: "Is there no exception?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is only four years old, we don't want to let her be separated from us."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun was silent.</p><p></p><p>Xixia is indeed very young, but... the Sect selects divine children, many three or four-year-old divine children are also sent to the Sect early on.</p><p></p><p>Separated from their families, closed off to study and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there is a solution."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren on the side waved his fly whisk and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked over and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's father is a wood carving master, and it is said that he is now even a second-class guest official in the Astronomical Bureau."</p><p></p><p>"So, as long as Li Che can pass the wood carving master examination of the Sect's Shengsculpture Ridge, he can become a member of the Sect, and naturally he can stay within the mountain gate." Wang Kuyu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqun immediately rolled his eyes: "It's not that easy? Our Shengsculpture Ridge of the Sect has gathered the top wood carving masters in the entire Lingnan Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che wants to become a wood carving master of the Shengsculpture Ridge... The difficulty is no less than entering the outer gate of the Sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a disciple of the true transmission is so easy!"</p><p></p><p>"The level of a second-rank guest official of the Qin Observatory... is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun looked at Li Che and found that Li Che seemed a bit tempted, but he didn't pour cold water on him again.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was indeed a method, although the difficulty was too great and there was basically no hope.</p><p></p><p>But if Li Che tried and failed on his own... he wouldn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>In Jiao Shaochun's view, it was very normal for a child prodigy to leave his parents and become a disciple of a divine sect.</p><p></p><p>Children can only grow up and become independent by separating from their parents...</p><p></p><p>"If Master Li Che wants to try, I'll recommend a quota for you at that time."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his fists in gratitude upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater fell from thousands of feet above, hitting the scarlet membrane, and was immediately evaporated into steam!</p><p></p><p>"Phew—!" "Inhale—!"</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard of the independent workshop in Luohua Alley, Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body was like a red-hot iron, with every piece of flesh and blood gently trembling. He clenched his five fingers, and with a snap, the air burst open, and the airflow in the entire courtyard was stirred up by him!</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless dragon-like creatures were coiling around his body!</p><p></p><p>The bones and muscles were violently rubbing and trembling, the big tendons under the skin were tightening like dragons, and with each snap, there was an explosive sound! The furnace-like blood and qi roared unceasingly, like huge waves crashing!</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth chessboard enveloped the entire courtyard, isolating and sealing off all perception and exploration.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation that allowed Li Che to freely and without worry cultivate the flow of blood and qi!</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao fruit was pounding rapidly, and with each jump, it seemed to have electric currents intertwining and running through his whole body! Li Che was as if divinely assisted, entering a state of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Dao fruit that had been enhanced after breaking through the Martial Saint's will was now crazily feeding back!</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly cultivated the "Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine", and his powerful martial talent allowed him to cultivate it at an extremely fast speed!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he clenched his five fingers and pushed out a punch.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana inner landscape trembled and roared, the seven chakra divine foundations simultaneously extracted divine nature and fused it into Li Che's fist. With the snapping, the seven emotional divine natures were integrated into the Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine technique, instantly forming a dense dragon-like aura that covered the entire courtyard!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom—</p><p></p><p>The floor tiles could not bear the weight and cracked, the air kept booming without rest, and the whirlwind of surging airflow kept swirling.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine... has reached perfection!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's arms fell, and his pores all opened, and the scorching hot air gushed out like the flow from a high-pressure cooker, surging unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>"In three days, I have thoroughly grasped the Dao fruit brought by the Dragon Elephant Vajra, and this Martial Saint's supreme skill has officially reached perfection..."</p><p></p><p>Time flies like water, three days have passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, Jie Mo Li has nothing on my understanding of the Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He went into the courtyard house.</p><p></p><p>The house was very lively.</p><p></p><p>The [Painting Immortal] clones were all enthusiastically cultivating and nourishing their divine natures.</p><p></p><p>They were all striving to break through to the Divine Appearance realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to this, Li Che also began to cultivate the Six Desires Divine Natures.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had killed so many Corpse Deity Sect's Corpse Deity Envoys and had collected two volumes of the Six Desires Divine Natures techniques.</p><p></p><p>Respectively, the "Bodily Touch White Bone Bodhisattva Killing Divine Nature" and the "Intention Desire Corpse Flesh Guanyin Divine Nature"...</p><p></p><p>These were the bodily touch and intention desire among the Six Desires Divine Natures...</p><p></p><p>As for the other four desires, they were still missing.</p><p></p><p>"Still lacking the divine natures of eye sight, ear hearing, nose fragrance, and mouth taste..." Li Che's gaze fell on the two clones in the corner cultivating the Six Desires Divine Natures.</p><p></p><p>Their efficiency was not low, and in three days, they had successfully cultivated to the level of "Nourishing Nature like a Stream".</p><p></p><p>"After the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Divine Natures are gathered, the Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine, this Martial Saint's supreme skill, will be able to step into the Master Realm..."</p><p></p><p>In fact, for Li Che, the Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine was too compatible, and it was basically a matter of smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>Because the key point was the gathering of the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Divine Natures required for cultivating the Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Che, this was not a difficult point.</p><p></p><p>After sweeping a glance around.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the diligently cultivating Painting Immortal clones, Li Che smiled in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>Flickering light appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Painting Immortal (lv2, 70%)]</p><p></p><p>"The Painting Immortal Dao Fruit has not been around for long, and now it's almost at level 3, it seems that pressuring the clones and giving them more tasks can indeed speed up their advancement."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the chair.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, his mind stirred, and the next moment, every inch of flesh and blood in his physical body seemed to come alive, pulsing and trembling at a rate of hundreds of times per second.</p><p></p><p>Emitting dragon roars and elephant shrieks!</p><p></p><p>This was Li Che integrating the "Myriad Dragons Subdue the Divine" Martial Saint's supreme skill into the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant.</p><p></p><p>In the process of integration, Li Che's mind sank into the heaven and earth chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Connecting with the deployed [Painting Immortal] clones and scouts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>This was the place where Li Che's one-third blood clone of [Painting Immortal] was specifically keeping watch.</p><p></p><p>In three days, the City Lord's Mansion was completely silent.</p><p></p><p>The doors were tightly closed, with white mourning banners hanging.</p><p></p><p>They did not receive any visitors, and the various factions of Golden Light Mansion also did not dare to provoke them at this time.</p><p></p><p>Inside the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>White mourning banners were draped.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was in white clothes, his complexion a little pale.</p><p></p><p>Guardian True Person and six Black Armored Blood Guards all had white mourning bands on their arms.</p><p></p><p>In front of them was Prince Jie Hai's coffin.</p><p></p><p>They said they wanted to bring Jie Hai's body back to see the Prince and Princess, but of course they couldn't just carry the corpse back.</p><p></p><p>In these three days, Su Huai had found a master wood carver in the city to make a coffin with spiritual wood. </p><p></p><p>He also found the best embalmer in the city to prepare Prince Jie Hai's body.</p><p></p><p>Only the bloody hole in his forehead, filled with the aura of death and intertwined with the silver qi, remained ghastly and could not be smoothed over.</p><p></p><p>But at least, Prince Jie Hai's body had been properly laid to rest.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be the Corpse Deity Sect... within the scope of Golden Light Mansion, the strong figures of the Corpse Deity Sect have almost all been eliminated by the Ox Demon and Horse-Face of the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>"The only one who might have acted is Yuan Jingang."</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It's not Yuan Jingang." Su Huai shook his head firmly.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person's gaze in the shadow swept over.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so certain?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I know Yuan Jingang."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, he had not yet entered the Treacherous Pass."</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Who killed the Prince has almost become a mystery.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they guessed, they could not figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai suddenly spoke, mentioning a name.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld indeed has the motive, the Ox Demon, Horse-Face, and Monkey King, they killed Xue Daofu, and it is not impossible that they also killed the Prince."</p><p></p><p>"But the aura of death and the silver qi... how to explain that?"</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect... cannot be absolved of involvement, the Underworld also has problems, everything... when we return, we will report to the Prince, let the Prince take action to avenge the Prince."</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect evildoers within the scope of Golden Light Mansion, the Underworld, and the Hunting God Pavilion... they all have to die!"</p><p></p><p>"And... that little girl on Golden Light Peak!"</p><p></p><p>"A rural little girl, actually daring to call the Prince 'little slave girl'... audacious! She cannot be spared either!"</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person was really at his wit's end, almost going crazy.</p><p></p><p>The Prince died, and he had an inescapable responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Although the crime was not on him, after all, he couldn't keep up with the temple god's resonance.</p><p></p><p>So this Divine Element True Person felt very depressed and helpless.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he only had one thought left.</p><p></p><p>Destroy everything, he was too tired.</p><p></p><p>"The preparations are complete... then we shall depart, carrying the Prince back... to see the Prince and Princess."</p><p></p><p>"Bring the Prince..."</p><p></p><p>"Home."</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armored Blood Guards had sorrowful expressions, and the next moment, the six of them hoisted the Prince's coffin.</p><p></p><p>Preparing to carry the coffin all the way back to see the Prince.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai retreated a step, his expression mournful, clasping his fists in a bow.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian True Person led the way.</p><p></p><p>The six Black Armored Blood Guards, carrying the exquisite coffin carved from spiritual wood, silently followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter...</p><p></p><p>White paper money was scattered.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, it was as if a mournful wind and rain were howling and rolling.</p><p></p><p>The sorrow was almost tangible.</p><p></p><p>Creak...</p><p></p><p>The gates of the City Lord's Mansion opened.</p><p></p><p>The funeral procession slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai had the soldiers of the Divine Guard all wear white mourning bands to see the Prince off from Golden Light Mansion City.</p><p></p><p>At least, the grand scale was fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's [Painting Immortal] clone was sitting quietly in the tavern across the street.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, dressed in black.</p><p></p><p>Holding a wine cup, he glanced indifferently at the grand scene as the City Lord's Mansion gates opened.</p><p></p><p>Gently placing down the cup, pressing down the storm-tossed hat, his expression was neither happy nor sad.</p><p></p><p>"A rural little girl?"</p><p></p><p>"It was actually Jie Hai who was unwilling to admit defeat... and now it's become my daughter's fault?"</p><p></p><p>"Little slave girl, did she call wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his face.</p><p></p><p>"Scolding my daughter Li Che... and still wants to leave?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>Howling winds.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, Li Che suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"They even arranged a grand funeral procession, the momentum is so great, when entering the city the commotion and scale were large, when sending off the mountain the grand master opened the way, the scale was also large, and now... even in death, they want a grand scale?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled.</p><p></p><p>Inside the City Lord's Mansion, Su Huai's conversation was heard clearly by Li Che through the heaven and earth chessboard perception.</p><p></p><p>"Su Huai knows Yuan Jingang?"</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental... I know him too."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also guessed who Yuan Jingang was, or where Yuan Jingang was hiding.</p><p></p><p>One of Li Che's clones was keeping an eye on him.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow, those who threaten my daughter, come one by one..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his bones and muscles crackling and booming.</p><p></p><p>With one step, he appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, his entire blood and qi roared, dripping down distorted air currents.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant... has reached the Master Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his five fingers, and the air was distorted in his palm.</p><p></p><p>That was... the true meaning of the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant! After the Martial Saint's supreme skill reached the Master Realm, it could refine divine might!</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Among the five Martial Saint's supreme skills, which organ should the first one be tempered in?"</p><p></p><p>"Heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys... the five organs correspond to the five Martial Saint's supreme skills."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant is my self-created supreme skill, the embodiment of my own heart, so I shall temper my heart!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Dragon Elephant true meaning, temper the heart, and all laws will be at my command!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he clenched his five fingers fiercely, and the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant true meaning floating and sinking in his palm instantly seemed to be crushed into pieces.</p><p></p><p>It surged into his sturdy physique, converging at his heart. The powerful impact made Li Che's formidable furnace-like body a little unstable, retreating three steps in a row! When the last step was heavily stomped down!</p><p></p><p>His heart seemed to have become a vortex, dragon roars and elephant shrieks, dragon and elephant illusory figures appeared behind Li Che! The surging blood and qi in his entire body seemed to have been ignited by a fire!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Invisible shockwaves instantly rippled and rolled in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Scorching, majestic, ardent, turbulent! The surging airflow rose up, forming a blooming blood mushroom cloud! Boom, boom, boom—</p><p></p><p>With each violent heartbeat, it was like thunderclaps falling!</p><p></p><p>So powerful and majestic beyond imagination! The closed eyes suddenly opened, the dazzling brilliance instantly illuminated the entire courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the mushroom cloud.</p><p></p><p>His black robe billowing, his black hair flying.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and between his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The first divine might burst forth!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the first thunder had fallen to the mortal realm!</p>

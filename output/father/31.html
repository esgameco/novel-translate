        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elderly man in front of him, exhausted and with red eyes brimming with tears, Li Che's heart softened, and he quickly pulled the elder Li Liang into the warm workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che poured a cup of hot tea for Elder Li, his expression turning serious.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Elder, please take your time and tell me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked solemnly. The elder's family had raised him, never deceiving him, and the kindness of their upbringing was not something easily repaid.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything Li Che could do to help, he would not stand idly by.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar was trembling all over, the snow particles clinging to him gradually melting in the warmth of the workshop. His frozen, reddened hands held the cup of hot tea, and his expression seemed to relax a little.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar let out a breath and looked at Li Che, his eyes full of bloodshot veins. After a moment of thought, he shakily pulled out a palm-sized wooden sculpture from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Che saw the wooden sculpture, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"A wooden figurine of a spirit infant?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was naturally familiar with this wooden sculpture! Before he had moved into the woodcarving shop, this wooden figurine of a spirit infant had appeared in his family's courtyard, causing Li Che to feel tense and forcing him to move his family into Xu's woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took the wooden sculpture from the old scholar's hand, and it was slightly different from the one that had been placed at the entrance of his home.</p><p></p><p>It was not a three-headed, six-armed spirit infant sculpture, but a normal one-headed, two-armed spirit infant figurine, with its eyes opening and closing. However, there was no denying that this was also a spirit infant sculpture.</p><p></p><p>As a woodcarver, Li Che was extremely sensitive to the expressions of wooden sculptures.</p><p></p><p>"A distinction in priority?" Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, hasn't Shuang'er also just turned one year old?" Li Che asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>The elder nodded repeatedly: "Yes... In three days, it will be the scheduled first birthday celebration. I had wanted to hold a simple one, but now... Alas, I dare not, I dare not at all."</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, your cousin has not even dared to go to work, staying at home the whole time, holding a chopping knife, afraid that..."</p><p></p><p>The elder sighed heavily.</p><p></p><p>The elder was well aware that if the Spiritual Infant Cult really set their sights on his grandson Li Chengzhou, with their ordinary strength, how could they resist? These past few days, fear and anxiety had completely enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of those children who had died tragically, the old scholar had nightmares every night.</p><p></p><p>"Your cousin and his wife have not dared to sleep for three consecutive nights... afraid that if they fall asleep, the Spiritual Infant Cult followers will target Shuang'er."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the wooden spirit infant sculpture, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"So, Elder, you want to see if your daughter-in-law can bring Shuang'er to stay at your place for a while... Xu's shop still has some deterrent power, right?"</p><p></p><p>The old scholar, like a drowning man grasping at a straw, looked at Li Che with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Elder, letting Shuang'er stay at my home is no problem. My home will be much safer."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no reason to refuse. The appearance of the spirit infant sculpture had brought an overwhelming sense of oppression and anxiety, and Li Che, having experienced it himself, could feel the elder's current terror and despair.</p><p></p><p>It was a sense of... powerlessness as death drew closer to his grandson.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people facing the Spiritual Infant Cult were indeed powerless, like lambs awaiting slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, Ah Che... Thank you, Elder is grateful to you..."</p><p></p><p>The old scholar was extremely excited, his expression much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and make the arrangements, and have Zhengran and Chun'meng send Chengzhou to your place..." The old scholar, holding the teacup, was about to walk out of the shop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che quickly called out to him: "Elder, please don't. Have your cousin and his wife stay at home to protect him, don't go out, to prevent any accidents on the way. I'll go pick them up myself. I've been practicing martial arts recently, so it'll be safer."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay..." Elder Li Liang hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go tell the shopkeeper I'm taking a leave, and then I'll come to you. You go back and stay with your cousin and his wife to protect Shuang'er."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy finally appeared on the elder's face, and he belatedly put down the teacup and hurriedly left, rushing into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the chair, holding the palm-sized wooden spirit infant sculpture in his hand, a pensive look flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Infant Cult..."</p><p></p><p>"What a scourge."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>However, the Spiritual Infant Cult was a formidable force to him, and it was also entangled with the powerful families of Feilei City...</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, even the government officials are related to the Spiritual Infant Cult, and that constable Zhao Chuanxiong is a member of the Spiritual Infant Cult..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not go to ask for leave. As a master woodcarver, he had the right to freely enter and exit the woodcarving shop, as long as he could deliver the goods on time.</p><p></p><p>Changing into a set of sturdy clothes, Li Che picked up a thin wooden board, put on a hat, and walked out of the woodcarving shop, plunging into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Having grown up in the elder's family, Li Che naturally knew the way to the elder's home.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not immediately head there, but chose to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Spiritual Infant Cult has set a trap? Deliberately luring me to go there?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If I were to be harmed, without my identity as a wood carver, the Xu family manor might not be able to accommodate us, and Xiao Ya and Xixia would have to move out..."</p><p></p><p>"After leaving the Xu family manor, the Lingying Sect would be able to easily target Xixia."</p><p></p><p>"The orphan and widowed mother would be left to be slaughtered!"</p><p></p><p>Pressing down his hat, Li Che pondered, this possibility might not be unfounded. But it might not necessarily be the case either, after all, he had been leaving the Xu family manor frequently these days, and if the other party wanted to make a move, they could have done so already... </p><p></p><p>There's no need to go the extra mile and set a trap for him.</p><p></p><p>"However, I can't let my guard down..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Che was deep in thought, he walked through the long street. The wanted poster had been updated, and he paused his steps to see his "Ox Demon" identity prominently displayed, with a bounty of five hundred taels...</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred taels... that's about the price of five golden leaves!"</p><p></p><p>"Just the cost of carving a nine-headed Guanyin statue."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, these five hundred taels... would be enough to tempt many to take the risk.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to keep a low profile for a while."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, pulled down his hat, and braved the howling wind and snow to first go to the rented courtyard he had outside.</p><p></p><p>He took out a black robe that had been soaking in a vat, and with an internal surge of energy, shook it, causing the steam to dissipate and the garment to dry.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely elastic robe, specially crafted by his own skilled hands. The enhancement from the Immortal Dao Fruit had not only improved his wood carving skills, but any craft he undertook.</p><p></p><p>With this robe, he no longer needed to worry about his clothes bursting when he activated the Golden Ape Transformation.</p><p></p><p>After the familiar change of clothes, he put on the cute ox mask and, wearing a hat, dashed out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Feilei City, on An'ping Alley.</p><p></p><p>A mud-walled courtyard, the gates tightly shut.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house.</p><p></p><p>Old Scholar Li Liang puffed on a dry tobacco pipe, the sound of his drags echoing.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran gripped a firewood ax, his eyes bloodshot, pacing back and forth, listening intently to the sounds outside.</p><p></p><p>Liuchun Ming hugged her son Li Chengzhou, her hair a bit disheveled, unkempt, clearly not having focused on grooming herself.</p><p></p><p>"Father, has Ahe not come yet?"</p><p></p><p>"What if he... just came back to trick you?"</p><p></p><p>Liuchun Ming, holding the baby, with the elder aunt next to her, her eyes reddened, her voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>A woman's household, under the constant threat of losing their child, had already reached the brink of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"No, Ahe wouldn't intentionally trick me, if he said he can, he definitely can... He's now a master craftsman, a respectable identity, he's just helping us a little, letting us hide in his courtyard to avoid the disaster, he wouldn't lie."</p><p></p><p>The old scholar puffed on his dry tobacco, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>He believed in Ahe, and could also see the nature of his own nephew.</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, Ahe will come!"</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran also spoke up in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The house fell into a deathly silence, only the heavy breathing echoing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rustling sound came from outside.</p><p></p><p>The three people in the house immediately tensed up.</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran gripped the firewood ax, beads of sweat on his forehead, he walked to the door and peered through the crack, seeing the figure outside.</p><p></p><p>Outside.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow were raging, the sky gloomy.</p><p></p><p>A tall figure, carrying an Bagua staff on his back, wearing a girl's mask, crouched on the ground, holding a wooden Lingying figurine, placing it on the ground, swaying it left and right, positioning it directly in front of the tightly shut door of the house.</p><p></p><p>The wailing wind blew, like a ghostly wail.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to know that Li Zhengran was peering through the crack, the figure suddenly raised its face, the girl's mask seemingly both crying and laughing, the eyes full of mockery.</p><p></p><p>Again, this nightmare-like face!</p><p></p><p>Li Zhengran's whole body trembled uncontrollably, the hand gripping the firewood ax shaking...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Through the crack, Li Zhengran's pupils suddenly contracted, and he froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>Behind the figure wearing the girl's mask, crouching in the snow...</p><p></p><p>A towering, mountain-like figure emerged from the wind and snow almost instantly, like a ghost, the black clothes clinging to the body, perfectly outlining the muscular contours carved like a knife.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a hat, covering a cute ox mask, the eyes gleaming with sharp light.</p><p></p><p>Raising a palm.</p><p></p><p>With a bang...</p><p></p><p>The figure with the Bagua staff and girl's mask had just reacted, leaping up, when it was smashed away by a palm strike as powerful as a fan...</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a spray of blood.</p><p></p><p>PS: Good news, the PK has advanced to the second round, bad news, the second round will be more brutal, please don't stop reading and continue to support!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

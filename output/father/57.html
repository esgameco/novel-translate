        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pure and unsullied divine nature burst forth, tearing open a rift in the void before Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Behind the rift... was an entire space! A mustard seed containing the Mount Sumeru! Li Che's heart was stirred, and based on the feedback from the [Unsullied Heart], the jade pendant he had obtained from Si Mu-bai was a "divine object" imbued with divine nature and possessing incredible properties.</p><p></p><p>For example, the jade pendant had a spatial storage function, similar to a storage space.</p><p></p><p>And the [Unsullied Heart] had consumed this divine jade pendant, acquiring this ability, or rather, fusing the jade pendant into itself.</p><p></p><p>His mind and spirit connected with the rift, and the contents within it began to appear in Li Che's consciousness, as if he had a pair of eyes meticulously observing the interior of the space.</p><p></p><p>"I said that Si Mu-bai, the young master of a prominent family, wouldn't have brought anything with him when he was fleeing for his life. At the very least, he should have had some silver notes or gold leaves on him. So it turns out... he had hidden everything inside this Heavenly and Earthly Jade!"</p><p></p><p>"The jade contains the heavens and earth, able to store all kinds of things..."</p><p></p><p>This was none other than the legendary storage equipment! The rain continued to pour, the dark clouds rolling and roaring over the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, however, stood under the eaves, happily counting his spoils from this trip.</p><p></p><p>Si Mu-bai, the one whom the Si family had placed great hopes in, had indeed taken away a great many valuable items - gold, silver, jewels, and all sorts of exquisitely carved wooden sculptures, many of which emanated faint divine ripples, clearly the work of master craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at them briefly before shifting his gaze, as he was not particularly interested in wooden sculptures, since he could carve such things himself, and they were not particularly precious to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che had already started calculating how much money these wooden sculptures could fetch, as they were undoubtedly valuable, being the work of master carvers.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the wooden sculptures, the most captivating item to Li Che was a fist-sized shard that emanated a hazy glow and an overwhelming divine aura.</p><p></p><p>"A fragment of the Divine Foundation!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breath caught in his throat.</p><p></p><p>Even without recognizing it, just a single glance was enough for Li Che to know that this was undoubtedly a fragment of the Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>The divine aura emanating from it almost made Li Che want to break down and cry, as a mysterious resentment swirled in his mind, and his eyes slightly reddened.</p><p></p><p>"Such pure and wrathful divine nature, far surpassing even Si Mu-bai's divine power..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't be able to withstand such divine assault... my mind won't be able to resist it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression grew grave and alarmed. This was just a fragment, and if a Divine Foundation cultivator were to personally intervene, Li Che feared that his consciousness would be instantly shattered and his will completely overwhelmed by the divine power.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with a Divine Foundation cultivator... I can only rely on the 'Namo Gatling Wood Crow' from a distance, and even that would barely be a threat to them."</p><p></p><p>"But ultimately, my strength is not enough, my firepower... is far too lacking."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath. Just catching a glimpse of the fragment had revealed to him the terrifying power of the Divine Foundation cultivators. However, this Divine Foundation fragment had now fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>And he was a Li!</p><p></p><p>Without removing the Divine Foundation fragment, Li Che was currently reluctant to touch it, as he was worried that if the uncontrolled divine power were to be unleashed, it would expose his location, which would be more trouble than it was worth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, within the space of the Unsullied Heart, Li Che noticed that the Unsullied Heart seemed to be slowly refining the Divine Foundation fragment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel anticipation for the outcome once the refinement was complete.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted to the other spoils.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Divine Foundation fragment, the greatest harvest... was the scriptures! "The Si Family's Excellent Blood Replacement Technique, the 'Si Tai-chong Nine-step Blood Replacement Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened, and his spirit stirred as he retrieved a booklet from the spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>This was the Nine-step Blood Replacement Technique, the core blood replacement art of the Si family!</p><p></p><p>It was also the blood replacement technique that Li Che most needed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>With this Nine-step Blood Replacement Technique, Li Che would be able to complete the nine-step blood replacement and achieve perfect blood replacement.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Si Family's Excellent Internal Strength Technique, the 'Prison Lotus Subduing Ghost Internal Strength Classic', which can be cultivated to the sixth realm of internal strength, reaching the pinnacle of meridian cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Truly, the treasures amassed by this century-old aristocratic family were bountiful.</p><p></p><p>But the thing that excited Li Che the most was the divine technique!</p><p></p><p>The divine technique he had been yearning for... had finally fallen into his hands! "The 'Nine Luminaries Wrathful Cry Subduing Ghost Cultivation Record', the Si Family's divine technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but let a smile spread across his lips, barely restraining the urge to burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, killing, arson, and wearing a golden belt... becoming wealthy is just this simple and direct.</p><p></p><p>What he had been searching for in vain, he had now obtained.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine techniques that cost a fortune and were impossible to obtain were now in his hands.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not choose to cultivate them immediately. He was in no hurry now.</p><p></p><p>After checking the items, Li Che confirmed that he had accidentally become extremely wealthy. He stood up, patted the "Namo Gatling", and with a thought, this big guy was stored into the space of the "Immaculate Heart".</p><p></p><p>With another thought, the Namo Gatling appeared in his hand out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Holding this big guy, going in and out, playing with it, made Li Che's eyes shine brightly.</p><p></p><p>He stored away the "Thousand Spider Silk", "Guanyin Blood Lotus" and other hidden weapons.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that he now had no flaws at all.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this a natural 'arsenal'?"</p><p></p><p>"If I get more Wooden Crows and make a hundred 'Namo Gatlings' like this, when I encounter Shen Qi cultivators, I can rely on the endless firepower to suppress them!"</p><p></p><p>"Si Mu Bai... is really a good person."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed deeply, this harvest was completely beyond his expectations and imagination.</p><p></p><p>The greatest harvest was the transformation after the Immaculate Heart devoured the Qiankun Jade!</p><p></p><p>The strategic significance was too great.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked to the eaves, watching the heavy rain pouring down without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the gradually disappearing divine aura of the Shen Qi cultivator battle...</p><p></p><p>He slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the affairs of the Si family had probably come to an end.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>"I should go pick up my daughter from school."</p><p></p><p>Li Che changed into clean clothes, opened an oiled paper umbrella, and walked into the gradually drizzling rain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurried towards the direction of the Xu Family's Shen Xiu Academy.</p><p></p><p>Although the Si family had been destroyed and Si Mu Bai had died, Li Che's sense of crisis had not completely subsided, after all, Xixia had not truly achieved safety.</p><p></p><p>The entire Flying Thunder City was still shrouded in the oppression and confinement brought by the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>As a spiritual child, Xixia had already been on the Lingying Sect's list, and as the Lingying Sect grew stronger, they would definitely bare their fangs and attack Xixia...</p><p></p><p>So Li Che still had a sense of worry.</p><p></p><p>The clamor in the city had subsided, the powerful pressure of the Shen Qi cultivators had retreated, and the entire city seemed to have become more vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Shen Xiu Academy, Li Che saw that the academy gates were tightly closed, knowing it was because of the Shen Qi battle.</p><p></p><p>The sound of orderly footsteps echoed.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Xu Beihu with a saber at his waist, his burly figure breaking through the wind and rain, followed by a squad of Xu Family members. Seeing Li Che, Xu Beihu was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Li, it's been a while."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's expression had a touch of complexity as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Second Manager," Li Che greeted him politely.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu was the one who taught and guided Li Che in the martial arts, so Li Che naturally had some respect and gratitude for him.</p><p></p><p>"Outsiders are not allowed to enter the Shen Xiu Academy, let me go call someone for you," Xu Beihu said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu had once wanted to recruit Li Che into his faction, at least to have him on his side, but unfortunately, Li Che had a good relationship with Xu You, so Xu Beihu saw no hope of persuading him and gave up.</p><p></p><p>Later, as Li Che's talents were revealed, Xu Beihu couldn't help but regret it.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Shen Xiu Academy's Elder Shu's assessment, Li Che's daughter was an upper-grade spiritual child with extremely rich spiritual qualities!</p><p></p><p>An upper-grade spiritual child, as long as she develops properly without premature death, the possibility of her becoming a Shen Qi cultivator in the future is as high as 80%! Xu Beihu's eyes flashed, thinking of the spiritual talent of Li Che's daughter...</p><p></p><p>He had a thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was wrong about Li Che, but he couldn't miss Li Che's daughter...</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Li, I have an eight-year-old son whose spiritual root is excellent, praised by the old patriarch. Xixia's spiritual talent is also very good, she's cute and lively. My son and her would be a perfect match... I wonder if Teacher Li is interested in becoming in-laws?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on Li Che's face gradually disappeared.</p>

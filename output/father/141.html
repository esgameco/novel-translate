        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Yangtze River, the water raging and roaring.</p><p></p><p>Roaring and crashing against the rocks, bursting into white waves like piles of snow.</p><p></p><p>Although it was snowing heavily and the world was cold, the surface of the Yangtze River showed no signs of freezing.</p><p></p><p>The water flow was extremely warm.</p><p></p><p>As if there was a furnace burning at the bottom of the river, constantly boiling the entire river.</p><p></p><p>On the riverbank,</p><p></p><p>several figures stood, some tall, some small.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the leading figure was a man dressed in black and white robes, tall and handsome, with a long beard. He crouched by the riverbank, his palms plunged into the raging river.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the terrifying and roaring divine nature within the river...</p><p></p><p>The figure opened his eyes, and a vertical line flashed across his brow, revealing a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"What a strange and furious temple of the Third Prince with eight arms, truly a top-tier Four Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest praised softly.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, aside from a few young men and women, there were also several small children, all around six or seven years old.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let's hurry and enter the Golden Light Prefecture City. We've been traveling for a long time and are a bit tired. We want to eat something hot."</p><p></p><p>A chubby little boy wearing a fur hat, panting to dispel the biting cold, called out to the Taoist priest playing in the water.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest stood up and shook the water off his hands: "Eat, eat, eat, that's all you know. I shouldn't have brought you, you glutton!"</p><p></p><p>"This temple deity resonance is not even seventy percent, let's see if I'll forbid you from eating!"</p><p></p><p>A vertical divine mark flashed across the Taoist priest's brow, and he glared sternly at the chubby boy.</p><p></p><p>"We've come all the way from the Dao City just for this temple deity resonance. The mysteries of the Four Mysterious Temple are about to open, and we have a chance to obtain the Four Mysterious Divine Weapons!"</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the many divine weapons of this Third Prince Temple are a set! A complete set!"</p><p></p><p>"In the face of such an opportunity... you all better be focused!"</p><p></p><p>"This year, the Golden Light Prefecture City has also recruited a divine child, not weaker than you all!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest stood with his hands behind his back, speaking calmly.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy miraculously took out a boiled corn on the cob, putting it in his mouth and chewing: "What does the divine child of the Golden Light Prefecture City have to do with us? We are the authentic divine children of the Dao City!"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven blesses me, the gods favor me. The little prefecture city's divine child, how can they compare to us?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want a bite, Master?"</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy felt the Taoist priest's sharp gaze, as if it could peel off all his fat, and immediately shivered, quickly handing over the half-eaten corn on the cob.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't want it!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too confident. This Li Nuanxi of the Golden Light Prefecture is ranked 21st on the Lingnan Dao City divine child list!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm 18th!" </p><p></p><p>The chubby boy said unconcernedly, waving his chubby hand: "Moreover, according to the introduction, that little girl mainly relied on her young age to squeeze into the 21st place. </p><p></p><p>"She's not a threat at all, not a real competitor."</p><p></p><p>"I've set my sights on the inheritance of the Third Prince."</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy finished the corn, thoughtfully cleaned up the trash, and then took out a bowl of strawberries, starting to stuff them into his mouth one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the other spiritual children and divine children he had brought from the Dao City, all with the same attitude.</p><p></p><p>They were full of confidence in their own talents, with the Dao City cultivators' bias against the local prefecture cities, not taking the spiritual children and divine children of the Golden Light Prefecture City seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>This attitude would lead to a big loss.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the majestic temple standing in the middle of the river.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, he couldn't help but feel a sense of oppression and horror in his heart, as if there was a child bound by countless chains, wrapped in black flames, roaring in fury under the great river!</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the top-tier Four Mysterious Temple suppressed by the Orthodox Dao Sect, this Four Mysterious Third Prince Temple located in the Golden Light Prefecture City was indeed restless, on the verge of eruption.</p><p></p><p>In addition to bringing the Orthodox Sect disciples, he also had the task of monitoring the turbulence of this Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>If it exceeded the control of the Golden Light Prefecture City, he would need to report to the Orthodox Sect and have the Divine Element True Man come to stabilize it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, enter the Golden Light Prefecture City."</p><p></p><p>"The branch sects of other states should also have sent cultivators with spiritual children... perform well, you are the disciples of the Orthodox Dao Sect, don't let the branch sect disciples surpass you."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest said, leading the children into the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The wheels turned, crushing the snow and wind, slowly heading towards the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have roast chicken here, do you want some?"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! Don't eat anymore! Are you a pig?!"</p><p></p><p>In the swaying carriage, a child's eager voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then came the Taoist priest's angry scolding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The entire Great Snow Flat suddenly shook, and countless flying snow were stirred up, swirling and fluttering.</p><p></p><p>As if it had suddenly sunken and collapsed, the roaring airflow ravaged and tore at the flying snow.</p><p></p><p>The black robe fluttered, the ox-faced mask dimly glowing.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the dense aura of death and decay bursting forth from the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>That was the resonance of the Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal!</p><p></p><p>On the celestial chessboard,</p><p></p><p>the suppressed Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal was trembling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's spiritual consciousness hovered, snapping his fingers repeatedly, releasing the pure spiritual nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual nature chess pieces exploding like an avalanche, the spiritual power they released, impacting the Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Causing a series of black energy waves to strike the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Causing the black flames burning like beacons in the mountain peak, amidst the vast white snow, in Li Yue's pupils, to be so conspicuous, so dazzling!</p><p></p><p>"It's you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue pressed down his hat, the black robe fluttering ceaselessly, behind the ox-faced mask, a look of surprise and astonishment flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because he had not expected that the one hiding in the shadows, bewitching Shangguan Qinglei, and even bringing out the Seven Element Divine Weapons, trying to harm Xixia...</p><p></p><p>would be him! The mountain peak rose up like an engraved sword of light, with a rampant and domineering sword intent. Standing before Li Yue was one of the four Elder Peaks... the Flowing Sword Peak!</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Sword Peak! The location of the Enforcement Hall of the Golden Light Sect! Li Yue took a deep breath, the surrounding airflow raging, obviously he was also somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing...</p><p></p><p>It was actually him!</p><p></p><p>The celestial chessboard reflected, in an instant, expanding from the position where Li Yue stood as the star position, gradually encompassing, enveloping the Flowing Sword Peak.</p><p></p><p>Within the Flowing Sword Peak, Li Yue saw Xu Jiuqing sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Black corpse qi flames were surging out from Xu Jiuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue had originally thought that perhaps there was someone else on the Flowing Sword Peak.</p><p></p><p>But no! After several detections, he finally confirmed...</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Enforcement Hall Elder of the Golden Light Sect, actually turned out to be... an evil person of the Corpse God Cult! This undercover work he had done... actually reached such a high position!</p><p></p><p>Simply, it surprised Li Yue too much.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Yue had guessed that the one possessing the Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal must have reached the Divine Sage realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the Divine Sages of the Golden Sect, only the four Elders and the Sect Master Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>Since Sect Master Nanlihuo was excluded from suspicion, then the remaining four Elders were the suspects.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang Qingzheng of the Twin Sleeves Peak, Elder Zhu Hongdou of the Red Cloud Peak, Elder Xu Jiuqing of the Flowing Sword Peak, and Elder Weng Wuyu of the South Mountain Peak! Li Yue initially targeted Elder Weng Wuyu of the South Mountain Peak.</p><p></p><p>But guesses were just guesses, the other three peaks could not be ignored either.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Yue expanded the celestial chessboard, constantly striking the Corpse Curse Seal with the bursting pure spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>Like a divine being inspecting the mountains.</p><p></p><p>He had investigated the Twin Sleeves Peak, and Zhang Qingzheng had the lowest suspicion, but he did not let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Twin Sleeves Peak had no response of the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the Red Cloud Peak, the Flowing Sword Peak, and finally the South Mountain Peak.</p><p></p><p>But Li Yue never thought...</p><p></p><p>Just as he reached the Flowing Sword Peak, he would find the hidden Corpse God Cult rat.</p><p></p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the ox-faced mask, Li Yue let out a slight laugh.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of that day when Xu Jiuqing brought the inner sect executive Zhao Jianming floating along.</p><p></p><p>Now, thinking about it...</p><p></p><p>The other party was simply coming to probe, to see if he had exposed himself because of the lost Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>And a righteous and upright sword cultivator, who should have been like Li Qingshan, unyielding and persevering, actually turned out to be an evil person of the Corpse God Cult.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he could hide so long within the Golden Sect.</p><p></p><p>This thief shouting "catch the thief" over the past year, simply...</p><p></p><p>So shameless! You're so shameless!</p><p></p><p>The killing intent in Li Yue's eyes surged.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Xu Jiuqing, the real culprit who wanted to harm his daughter, had been fluttering around in front of him all this time, with a hypocritical appearance.</p><p></p><p>Putting on an air of righteousness, swearing to find the evil person of the Corpse God Cult...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's killing intent became more intense than ever before! "A sword cultivator full of righteousness, how could he be an evil person of the Corpse God Cult... When Xu Jiuqing said this, he must have been delighted in his heart."</p><p></p><p>"A sense of manipulating everyone in the palm of his hand?"</p><p></p><p>The killing intent in Li Yue's eyes could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to kill Xu Jiuqing now!</p><p></p><p>His killing intent was so strong, completely unable to be concealed, and he didn't need to conceal it either! What about the big picture.</p><p></p><p>What about not wanting to startle the snake...</p><p></p><p>Did he care? Wanting to harm his daughter...</p><p></p><p>Just kill you! Li Yue's eyes were filled with icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>The snow flakes on the entire flat suddenly swirled, his toes pointed, his body shot and disappeared, reappearing on the branches of an old tree.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, his fingers gathered, tearing open the space in front of him, and then took out the "Namo Immortal Gunsmith Barrett"! And changed the ox-demon mask to a horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>The entire person's aura underwent a earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>If the previous ox-demon's killing intent was rampant and undisguised, with various kinds of frenzied emotions flowing, causing the many swirling snowflakes to explode into snow powder.</p><p></p><p>Then the current horse-faced, the only thing left was calmness, an extremely icy composure.</p><p></p><p>An excellent sniper needs an unperturbed emotion, and the ultimate calmness! "Xu Jiuqing... Divine Sage realm, can I kill him?"</p><p></p><p>"I may not be able to kill him, but..."</p><p></p><p>"To kill you, I don't necessarily need to do it with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Golden Sect... if you are exposed, how can you live?"</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced mask's eyes were gloomy, extremely black, like two black holes hanging in the air, attracting all the light and heat around.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue closed his eyes, pondering the next battle plan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing...</p><p></p><p>Not weak, even can be said to be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Divine Sage realm, an extremely terrifying sword cultivator, and also a high-level expert of the Corpse God Cult, possessing the Seven Element Corpse Curse Seal, must have cultivated the Curse Bronze Corpse...</p><p></p><p>This is the strongest opponent Li Yue has encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to kill such an existence, is very difficult, extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But, just because it's difficult, doesn't mean he won't try.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue first mentally simulated the retreat routes, sensing the Flying Thunder chess pieces well, if the assassination failed, he would immediately retreat! He did not notify Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had just left in a hurry, with an impatient look, three days later he would break through to the Divine Sage realm, if he took action at this critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Then that Divine Sage breakthrough would not happen.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Li Yue inexplicably felt that if Li Qingshan came...</p><p></p><p>To deal with Xu Jiuqing, he would not only not be of any help, but might even be a drag.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Qingshan cannot freely teleport like him, Li Yue, with the Flying Thunder chess pieces, wanting to kill or wanting to leave, at his own will!</p><p></p><p>So... </p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan is not needed!</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, tapping on his brow's Nirvana, instantly the spiritual nature was extracted, the blood and qi roaring, weaving into divine ink in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Then with a flick of his fingers, the pure spiritual nature turned into spotless white paper.</p><p></p><p>Opening his five fingers, he swept them in front of him, and instantly five sheets of pure paper appeared.</p><p></p><p>Dao Fruit [Immortal in Painting]! The ink color spread, like fireworks exploding on the flawless paper!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the five sheets of paper each produced a "Dragon Tooth Bodhi".</p><p></p><p>The five Dragon Tooth Bodhi floated out from the paper, hovering in front of the horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Grasping one Dragon Tooth Bodhi, he loaded it into the "Immortal Gunsmith Barrett".</p><p></p><p>The other four remained hovering in front of the horse-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Slowly raising the Immortal Gunsmith Barrett.</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly changed, and in an instant, the intersecting chessboard spread out from the whites of his eyes...</p><p></p><p>Celestial chessboard, I am the star position!</p><p></p><p>Envelop!</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>the entire Flowing Sword Peak was enveloped within Li Yue's celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's essence, qi, and spirit were concentrated to the extreme, locking...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The seated Xu Jiuqing was stabilized! "It's time... to set off."</p><p></p><p>In an instant!</p><p></p><p>A dazzlingly brilliant golden light erupted, like the roar of a dragon.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon stretched across, tearing through the air, distorting space, and the surging shockwaves instantly shattered and evaporated all the flying snow in its path!</p><p></p><p>This was a snipe! The snipe of a god!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The moment the sound exploded, the entire Shenzong Monastery seemed to echo with it.</p><p></p><p>Liujian Peak.</p><p></p><p>Seated within the palace, Xu Jiuqing, who was bearing a sword that suppressed the sword qi, closed his eyes to cultivate the sword.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tremor passed through his heart! It was a tremor... of death!</p><p></p><p>He abruptly opened his eyes, and countless sword qi erupted from his pupils, like roaring and ferocious bursting out!  Then, Xu Jiuqing saw!</p><p></p><p>He saw an extremely obscure flash of light, like a bloody color, like a furious dragon opening its mouth full of sharp fangs! It came silently and invisibly!</p><p></p><p>The straight beam of light that pierced through everything arrived with terrifying speed, flashing past, and only then did the successive explosive sounds rise up!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>It was very dangerous, very terrifying, giving Xu Jiuqing a sense of hair-raising horror! After all, he was a powerful expert at the Divine Manifestation Realm, and in the entire Golden Light Prefecture City, he was an exceptionally formidable figure.</p><p></p><p>"An ambush!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone wants to ambush and assassinate me?!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's mind instantly churned through a great many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, all his thoughts converged into a palm that slammed down in front of him, and countless sword qi erupted from the treasure sword he was bearing.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi gathered and intertwined into a vague sword qi armor.</p><p></p><p>The flashing light arrived in silence!</p><p></p><p>Because it was too fast, the thunderous sound wave that tore through the air had not even caught up.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Like a huge stone thrown into a lake, it stirred up terrifying waves and ripples! The horrifying sound wave suddenly exploded at that moment, spreading out in concentric circular ripples, the shockwaves surging and shooting, instantly covering the entire room floor with intersecting cracks!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing sat cross-legged on the ground, he couldn't even stand up in time, and could only stack the sword qi in front of him! He pushed his palm forward, his eyes brilliant, and the surging airflow ruffled his neat and tidy hair!</p><p></p><p>However, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He saw...</p><p></p><p>In the center of the sword qi armor, accompanied by the sound of countless clanging explosions! The terrifying penetrating power erupted from the flashing light that had shot from afar!</p><p></p><p>Countless sword qi were clanging and shattering! Then, a blood-red, ferociously patterned, dragon-tooth-like strange mechanism appeared!</p><p></p><p>"A mechanism?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing could only have this thought.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sword qi armor was distorted, revealing a void! The dragon-tooth bullet tore through his sword qi armor! It was too fast! Xu Jiuqing only saw his palm raised in front of him, activating the sword qi armor, suddenly burst into a cloud of blood, with a hole punched through the palm. However, the power of the dragon-tooth was also greatly weakened, piercing into his shoulder and raising a plume of blood.</p><p></p><p>But the truly terrifying thing...</p><p></p><p>was the explosive power of the dragon-tooth after it entered his shoulder!</p><p></p><p>The dragon-tooth instantly disintegrated, as if turning into countless rays of light, rapidly circulating through his meridians to his four limbs and all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Creak creak...</p><p></p><p>The disintegrating dragon-tooth Bodhi threads suddenly curled up, wanting to carve out his flesh and blood, carving out blood-like tear drops of flesh and blood! "How vicious!"</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing immediately thought of it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The hidden sniper who had previously killed the patriarch of the Su family, Su Zhenghen!</p><p></p><p>Ma Mian!</p><p></p><p>A Ox Demon, a Horse Demon...</p><p></p><p>Now the two great mysterious existences in the Golden Light Prefecture City! They were greatly feared.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had chosen a fishing gang.</p><p></p><p>And Ma Mian had almost killed the patriarch of the Su family, Su Zhenghen, who had allied with the Corpse God Sect!</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Ma Mian actually wanted to kill him! Xu Jiuqing felt the Bodhi threads drilling into his four limbs and all over his body, wanting to carve out his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed with coldness.</p><p></p><p>His powerful divine sense instantly covered his entire body, and his flesh... faintly emitted an extremely rich bronze luster! Perfected... Curse Bronze Corpse!</p><p></p><p>Creak creak...</p><p></p><p>Those Bodhi threads drilling into his body could not curl up at this moment, as they were firmly fixed in his flesh and blood by Xu Jiuqing's extremely powerful flesh! Xu Jiuqing stood up, and the pierced palm, with its bronze-colored flesh, was recovering to its original state amidst the countless growing flesh buds!</p><p></p><p>"Is this all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>"Daring to try to assassinate a Divine Manifestation Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's expression was extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his heart was pounding, inexplicably feeling a chill and his hair standing on end!</p><p></p><p>Why? Why did Ma Mian come to snipe him? Why him, and not someone else? Has he... been exposed?!</p><p></p><p>Ma Mian was acting together with Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu, and now that Ma Mian has made a move, does it mean that Li Qingshan also knows?</p><p></p><p>His well-hidden identity...</p><p></p><p>Has it been exposed?! Just as Xu Jiuqing's mind was rapidly spinning and thinking...</p><p></p><p>Just when he thought that Ma Mian's first attack had failed, and that he would retreat, he was planning to conceal the power of the Curse Bronze Corpse, but...</p><p></p><p>The second swift and swift flash of light silently and invisibly shot towards him again.</p><p></p><p>With a "pu" sound, it pierced into his chest, and then a roaring sound rolled in!</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming terrifying shockwaves fiercely impacted his body! "Another one?!"</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>The explosive sound, the extremely powerful impact force, and the terrifying penetrating power! Deeply embedded in Xu Jiuqing's perfected Curse Bronze Corpse body.</p><p></p><p>The chest caved in, as if a whole piece of flesh and blood had been carved out, revealing a gaping bloody hole! His body staggered, retreating a step, heavily stomping down.</p><p></p><p>The floor of the entire room violently shook, instantly shattering countless bricks and stones, flying up and down, and countless hot air seemed to erupt from the densely cracked fissures like a spider web!</p><p></p><p>His hair flew wildly, Xu Jiuqing's eyes gradually turned ferocious! It was so frustrating, so frustrating! He hadn't even seen the person, and from a distance, he had been hit by two hidden weapons!</p><p></p><p>Defenseless!</p><p></p><p>He was a Divine Manifestation Realm expert, but he couldn't even react in time to defend!</p><p></p><p>The dense corpse qi and death qi actually erupted from the sunken flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>That dragon-tooth was embedded in his Curse Bronze Corpse body!</p><p></p><p>It did not penetrate his flesh and blood! Boom boom—boom—!!!!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before he could stabilize his stance, there were three more sound explosions like surging waves, the terrifying overlapping bursts echoing! And the sunken chest of Xu Jiuqing had already been pierced through by three spirally rotating dragon-tooth bullets! Xu Jiuqing stepped back, step by step, each step crushing the ground to pieces! The cultivation of the Patriarch Realm had tempered his internal organs to be extremely tough.</p><p></p><p>And the powerful strength brought by the Curse Bronze Corpse.</p><p></p><p>But it still could not withstand...</p><p></p><p>Ma Mian's sniper shots that locked onto the target with the precision of a celestial chessboard! Consecutive shots at the same point could even pierce through thick buildings!</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful physique enhanced by the Curse Bronze Corpse was pierced through at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The bursting and gushing blood mist instantly spread throughout the room with the surging airflow.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing gripped the treasure sword he had nurtured, his eyes filled with murderous intent, his chest pierced and bleeding.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the four dragon-tooth Bodhi bullets that had drilled into his body began to vibrate violently.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept over, only to find that the dragon-tooth Bodhi bullets had transformed into countless Bodhi threads and spread out, and then what appeared were five chess pieces that were emitting intense divine power.</p><p></p><p>Four black and one white! Five chess pieces!</p><p></p><p>That divine power... Virtual Appearance Realm! "Su Zhenghen?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing was dumbfounded, but the next moment, the chess pieces seemed to be hidden bombs, exploding simultaneously within his body!</p><p></p><p>Four consecutive explosions!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing only felt that his tempered internal organs were about to crack! The external defense of the perfected Curse Bronze Corpse was invincible, but the internal... was only the tempering of the Patriarch Realm internal organs!</p><p></p><p>Unless his Curse Bronze Corpse reached the Master Realm, only then could his internal organs also become tough.</p><p></p><p>If it reached the Transformation Realm, both inside and out would be flawless and indestructible!</p><p></p><p>But now, he had not reached such a level.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power like an avalanche erupted and exploded from within, causing Xu Jiuqing to involuntarily let out a mouthful of blood!</p><p></p><p>His eyes were about to pop out, full of madness!</p><p></p><p>The powerful Divine Manifestation Realm aura pressure swept out in all directions, wanting to suppress everything. </p><p></p><p>All the dust was firmly pressed to the ground, and the broken bricks on the ground were trembling incessantly! Ma Mian!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing was furious beyond measure, but he didn't have a chance to find Ma Mian and kill this hidden sniper in the dark!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to release the power of the Curse Bronze Corpse.</p><p></p><p>For fear that another dragon-tooth bullet would come flying from the darkness, unprepared! But he couldn't maintain the Curse Bronze Corpse power forever...</p><p></p><p>If it went on for too long...</p><p></p><p>it would be exposed! </p><p></p><p>He had to hide his identity, and the aura he had leaked... had been a bit too long!  Xu Jiuqing's expression kept changing! He couldn't be sure if Li Qingshan had already discovered his identity.</p><p></p><p>But since Ma Mian had discovered it, it meant that Li Qingshan was not far from discovering it as well!</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hide.</p><p></p><p>Damn it...</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing was extremely annoyed: "Why was I exposed? Why did Ma Mian come after me?"</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why?!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an electric current shot through Xu Jiuqing's brain.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that... the Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint!"</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to leave!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing unhesitatingly grabbed the nurtured sword weapon and was about to flee. However, just as he was about to move...</p><p></p><p>Somehow.</p><p></p><p>The white divine chess piece that came with the dragon-tooth bullet had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the surging dust and howling winds, a figure silently and invisibly appeared behind him!

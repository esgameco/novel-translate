        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>You aim to shoot and kill Li Qingshan! Then I'll snipe you! It's that simple! Li Che's thoughts were simple and pure.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see, after all, whether the arrow from Wenglong Mountain was faster, or his own Barrett sniper rifle's bullet... would arrive faster! The roaring Longya Bodhi bullet, like a streak of light, sliced through the night sky in an instant, and the brilliant glow gradually faded, as if hidden in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Longya came first, followed by the shockwave! The rapidly rotating Longya Bodhi, tens of miles away, shattered one raindrop after another from the sky, stirring up a hazy mist of exploding water.</p><p></p><p>Too fast! The thunderous roar had not yet reached the ears of Wenglong Mountain, who had his bow drawn...</p><p></p><p>That bullet, like an evil dragon opening its bloody jaws, exposing its fangs, had already reached the hundred-foot range around him! So fast!</p><p></p><p>Wenglong Mountain's heart skipped a beat! It had come from an extremely distant place...</p><p></p><p>Yet faster than his arrow...</p><p></p><p>But! Wenglong Mountain's eyes flashed with a flowing light, distorting the airflow in front of him, as if he had become the keen-eyed eagle overlooking everything from high above.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine secret technique, and he had cultivated it to the level of a master.</p><p></p><p>It was a divine secret technique that a divine archer must cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It could greatly enhance the accuracy and precision of a divine archer.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the crisis on his scalp, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up one by one.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Wenglong Mountain turned the arrow he had drawn back and released the bowstring in a silent direction.</p><p></p><p>The arrow, shrouded in a layer of scarlet light, roared and shot out!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! Shrill - ! The sharp sound wave suddenly burst! The arrow shrouded in scarlet light, like a meteor, tore through the night sky, tore through the rain, and split the air!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sound waves, like thunderous roars, rolled and exploded!</p><p></p><p>This arrow was at the ultimate speed! The archery of a divine archer!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The arrow was fast, but the sniper Longya Bodhi... was even faster! The arrow had barely shot out for about a hundred meters before it exploded with a boom!</p><p></p><p>Colliding with the Longya Bodhi bullet! The arrow and the Longya Bodhi bullet...</p><p></p><p>Collided!</p><p></p><p>Like two divine archers, taking their positions, facing each other head-on! The powerful divine power and vital energy were instantly torn apart, the sturdy material of the arrow shattered into pieces, and the arrowhead crumbled.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a dazzling golden firework had suddenly burst open in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai sat quietly under the eaves, the fire in the stove burning, boiling the melted snow water in the pot, constantly bubbling.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the exploding fireworks, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the cup, he took a sip of hot tea.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh - ! The golden firework flowers were suddenly twisted and torn open!</p><p></p><p>Another Longya bullet, the sound wave not yet arrived, the killing intent came first! Tearing open the just-exploded fireworks, it shot towards Wenglong Mountain's forehead at high speed!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to pierce through his forehead.</p><p></p><p>A single shot to the head, a powerful elimination!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack - ! A thunderous roar, lightning and thunder, like countless ferocious spiders spread across the sky, suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the night like daylight! Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>On the middle slope, the courtyard where Li Che's family was located, the gate was tightly closed, and the pea-sized raindrops kept falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Splashing on the ground, bursting and scattering, exploding into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Xixi stayed overnight at Jingang Peak tonight, and was not brought back, because Nanlihuo also knew that Zheng Lei Peak would be more dangerous tonight.</p><p></p><p>He had arranged for Xixi to stay at Jingang Peak with his senior sister Sanguan Yin to protect her.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was with Lü Chi, staying in the room where Shu Popo was sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi stood at the window, his hands clasped behind his back, with a maturity that did not match his age, his eyes grave and deep.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya looked curiously at Lü Chi, as if seeing this big-headed boy who often came to their house for meals for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Little Chi, are you worried about your master?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi turned his head, the furrowed brows smoothed out, revealing an expression that did not fit his age.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Ya, Master is today attempting to break through to the divine appearance... it is extremely dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is within the sect's mountain gate, but... Master was reckless when he was young, he used excessive force, and hurt too many people, and offended too many people..."</p><p></p><p>"Many people don't want him to be able to step into the divine appearance, and they are waiting for this opportunity to harm him and make his breakthrough fail."</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya looked at the mature Lü Chi and shook her head: "Don't worry... my husband should have gone to help, if you don't believe in your master, do you not even believe in my husband?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi paused.</p><p></p><p>This is a romantic.</p><p></p><p>However, with Niu Mo's help, it does make one feel much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya also looked out the window, and a worried look naturally welled up in her eyes as well.</p><p></p><p>Believing is one thing, but worrying... is also true.</p><p></p><p>When the wife is at home, she will inevitably worry about the husband who is fighting outside.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On top of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The electric snakes roamed, the rain curtain that had been evaporated and condensed by the scorching electric current poured down to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Numerous thick thunder clouds rolled and covered the sky, the momentum was truly too grand.</p><p></p><p>Many people had already sensed the difference.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that Li Qingshan was not just trying to condense the seven-element divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>This was trying to condense the six-lord divine appearance!</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan... arrogant! Still wanting to condense the six-lord divine appearance? Dreaming too big!"</p><p></p><p>"If he succeeds, then in the future, we in the Jinguang Prefecture City will have to live in fear, afraid that a ram's horn hammer will come crashing down on our heads at any time!"</p><p></p><p>"We must stop him! We absolutely cannot let Li Qingshan succeed in his breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The voices intertwined in the night sky were echoing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine consciousness transmitted to each other, even the roaring and venting of the rainstorm could not block their clear transmission.</p><p></p><p>Crack - </p><p></p><p>The electric snakes roamed, illuminating the sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one could vaguely see one divine appearance cultivator after another, wearing black night clothes and various masks, riding the airflow and hovering in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Divine appearance cultivators can achieve aerial flight, this is the exclusive mark of the divine appearance realm.</p><p></p><p>Illusory appearance cultivators can only hover briefly, completely different from the divine appearance cultivators who can walk on the sky as if it were land.</p><p></p><p>They stood far away, staring at Zheng Lei Peak, looking at the divine temple on the mountain top, as if absorbing the thunder and lightning of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The momentum was grand and terrifying! Thunder and lightning to destroy evil!</p><p></p><p>Thunder and lightning are the most righteous, and once the evil spirits and demons approach, they will dissipate.</p><p></p><p>And the thunder and lightning of heaven and earth are even more magnificent!</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the divine appearance, the first thing to do is to match the temperament of the divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>Thunder and lightning to destroy evil, although it is one of the seven emotions' divine nature, but thunder and lightning to destroy evil is the temperament of the divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>If the temperament is not matched, the failure rate of condensing the divine appearance will be very high.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan has been walking the path of hating evil like a sworn enemy and being upright and unyielding all these years in order to match the divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>With his one-handed ram's horn breaking the sky hammer, how many evil-doers has he killed, how many evils has he exterminated?</p><p></p><p>This is Li Qingshan's cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>The temperament he needs to match with the divine appearance! Rumbling - </p><p></p><p>Many masked experts did not immediately take action, their powerful divine consciousness swept out, their forms floating in the air, approaching the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>If Li Qingshan chose to condense the seven-element divine appearance, they would have acted at the very beginning of Li Qingshan's choice.</p><p></p><p>Because, Li Qingshan's condensation of the seven-element divine appearance will definitely not fail, and they do not need to interfere.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan chose to condense the six-lord divine appearance, it's different.</p><p></p><p>Don't look at it as just one level higher, the gap is actually terrifyingly huge.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jinguang Prefecture City, the ones who can truly condense the six-lord divine appearance are probably only those few who stand at the Yuanxiang Appearance Realm.</p><p></p><p>And those few, all have impressive backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>For example, Nanlihuo, has an elder from the Qianxuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Miao Supervisor Xie Jing, backed by the Zhen Miao Supervisor of the court, has abundant resources, not to mention the Qin Tian Monitor's Supervisor.</p><p></p><p>Even the one from Shenniao Ridge, also comes from a good background, and has a precious divine object that can enhance the physical body.</p><p></p><p>So, they can forge the six-lord divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>What do you, Li Qingshan, have? A heart full of righteous qi to destroy evil? This thing cannot help you enhance your physical body, resist the terrifying force impact of the six-lord divine appearance entering your body! Li Qingshan's martial dao cultivation, is at the peak of the Sect Master realm, still lacking a bit to reach perfection, in the eyes of these divine appearance cultivators, the failure rate is extremely high.</p><p></p><p>If Li Qingshan's own attempt to break through to the six-lord divine appearance fails, then they won't need to intervene.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The thunder and lightning kept falling, raging around, igniting one firework after another of lightning and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Countless roaring energy waves, rolling and surging, sweeping the rain away.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Qingshan, sitting cross-legged on the cushion in blue robes, was fluttering wildly.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged, his hands forming the Pagoda Seal.</p><p></p><p>The third eye on his forehead faintly glowed.</p><p></p><p>The thunder and lightning intertwined to the extreme in the heaven and earth, Li Qingshan suddenly opened his eyes, stood up from his spot, facing the [Suspended Thought Thunder Destroy Evil Golden Vajra Statue] built in the divine temple! The statue's armor clanged, the wings like a crane behind it suddenly spread open, exuding a sense of oppressive pressure!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling - ! The terrifying thunder sound rolled.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Countless lightning, gathered and intertwined above the divine temple, as if there was a lightning rod, absorbing and gathering all the thunder and lightning in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the thunder and lightning into the form of a divine being! Rumbling! The divine being flashing with lightning, descended from the sky, emitting the ultimate brilliant light, attracting the gaze of countless people.</p><p></p><p>As if a divine being slowly tore open the barrier of the sky, and walked out of the celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>A face the size of a house, lightning flashing, beard and hair moving, slowly descending from behind the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Howling winds, raging rain.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was extremely grand.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sat cross-legged, constantly forming the Pagoda Seal, his blue robe flying back rapidly, tightly clinging to his body.</p><p></p><p>His hair was frantically swinging and dancing, the ram's horn breaking the sky hammer that had accompanied him through countless battles, stained with countless blood, was placed aside by him.</p><p></p><p>It also kept attracting the lightning, being tempered and baptized by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>From the divine foundation to the divine appearance, it is a leap in a great realm, the improvement is very obvious.</p><p></p><p>It is a kind of qualitative change, as if truly summoning the divine into one's own body.</p><p></p><p>The divine appearance realm is somewhat similar to carving.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation is like the wood carver's wood, the evolving divine consciousness is the carving knife, slowly carving out the divine statue model that is visualized.</p><p></p><p>Through the attraction of the same nature, absorbing and ingesting the unique divinity of the divine being.</p><p></p><p>The illusory appearance is just carving out the rough draft, only temporarily having the appearance of the divine being, but not clear, not the true completion of the wood carving.</p><p></p><p>The true divine appearance, is the completion of the carving.</p><p></p><p>And the subsequent cultivation of the divine appearance realm, is the gradual polishing of the completed divine foundation wood carving.</p><p></p><p>In the polishing process, it is also the cultivation of temperament.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the cultivation of divine nature has never been separated from the word "temperament" from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling - </p><p></p><p>When Li Qingshan led down what seemed to be the true form of the thunder god, suddenly the entire Zheng Lei Peak was filled with exploding lightning arcs.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly opened his eyes and stood up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Under the terrifying divine being's level pressure, his waist was pressed down and unable to straighten.</p><p></p><p>But he opened his mouth and let out a long howl, gradually bearing the pressure and straightening his back!</p><p></p><p>The divine being descended by the six-lord divine appearance is also truly at the six-lord level, like the gods of the six-lord temple, extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan struggled to straighten his back, his eyes flashing with lightning.</p><p></p><p>His bones and muscles were creaking and popping.</p><p></p><p>His divine consciousness was growing stronger, his divine consciousness flashing like a carving knife.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head, looking at the [Suspended Thought Thunder Destroy Evil Golden Vajra Statue], the six-lord pressure spreading like vast waves!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was extremely excited, opening his mouth and laughing "Ha ha ha".</p><p></p><p>"Seven-element divine appearance?"</p><p></p><p>"I, Li Qingshan, gave up the illusory appearance, cultivated the divine foundation for years, just for the seven-element divine appearance?"</p><p></p><p>"If that were the case, how would I, Li Qingshan, be different from the mediocre?"</p><p></p><p>"In my life, I have devoted all my efforts, just to condense one seven-element divine appearance, wouldn't that be..."</p><p></p><p>"Futile!"</p><p></p><p>Boom - </p><p></p><p>There was an angry sound in Li Qingshan's voice, the next moment his arms suddenly spread open, and the inner landscape of his third eye seemed to reflect reality.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a magnificent divine foundation intertwined with countless lightning, like a divine wheel, appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling brilliance, lightning snakes like dragons!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan opened and closed his five fingers, the ram's horn breaking the sky hammer started to vibrate, whooshing out, and was grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>With a snap, the lightning snakes surged, spreading from the hammer all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Tilting his head, he let out a long howl.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thunderous Divine Being was enraged, and raised a massive hammer composed of countless arcing lightning bolts in the heavens above.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan also simultaneously raised a great hammer!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! A hammer fell.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation trembled and quickly shook off fragments, as if the primitive structure of wood had been torn apart by a carving knife, with wooden shards and scattered debris falling off.</p><p></p><p>The divine appearance—</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It has begun."</p><p></p><p>On the Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo rolled up his sleeves, carrying them behind his back, and walked up the stairs of the divine temple, feeling the sudden great wind surge that had risen across the entire Divine Sect Mountain Gate, with his white hair flying.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the direction of the Thunderous Peak.</p><p></p><p>He could see that colossal Thunderous Divine Being, as if a true god had descended, lowering its divine grace towards the mortal who wished to guide it.</p><p></p><p>"The Six司 Divine Appearances... Indeed, it is truly difficult, but if I don't give it a try, I will feel very unsatisfied."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, you really are not a calm person."</p><p></p><p>"Old me, I support you."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo smiled.</p><p></p><p>He tapped his toes on the temple, and his figure suddenly soared into the air, floating and flying towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>As if defying gravity and riding the wind, he ascended to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his five fingers, and a sword flowing with golden light fell into his hand, a sword that seemed to be entirely forged from gold, with ancient and profound divine scriptures engraved upon it.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle, golden lightning, intertwined with a faint aura of killing, covered it.</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme secret art, the "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Killing Sword"! And compared to Xixia's just-learned Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Killing Sword, Nan Lihuo's sword techniques had already reached the level of a master, refining the true essence, almost touching the realm of supreme secret art, forming the level of a supreme secret art domain!</p><p></p><p>"You petty scoundrels, do not try to pry. If you have the ability... come at me directly."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo smiled.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, and golden flames suddenly ignited all over him!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Prison Jade Fire Body! This was the supreme divine secret art he had taught to Xixia! Boom—! In an instant, Nan Lihuo became a ball of golden flames, rapidly rushing out!</p><p></p><p>Those many hidden in the darkness, wearing night robes and masked divine appearance cultivators, were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not too worried.</p><p></p><p>As expected, as soon as Nan Lihuo made a move, an extremely dense aura of death and corpse qi surged. A figure shrouded in a silvery-bronze glow rapidly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It collided with Nan Lihuo! "The Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissary, I wonder... which force within the Capital City have you allied with?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo stared at this Corpse Divine Emissary who had appeared by using the spatial-time corpse art.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Corpse Divine Emissary did not surprise Nan Lihuo.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Qingshan's Goat Horn Heavenly Shattering Hammer had killed how many Corpse Sect experts?</p><p></p><p>And he had even joined forces with the mysterious organization's Ox Demon and Horse Face, almost destroying the Corpse Sect's layout in the Capital City of Golden Light.</p><p></p><p>How could the Corpse Sect not hate them? If Li Qingshan was allowed to mold the Six司 Divine Appearances, possessing the divine appearance realm's battle prowess...</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Sect would be extremely troubled.</p><p></p><p>Dispatching the Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissaries to disrupt Li Qingshan's breakthrough was understandable.</p><p></p><p>"Nan Lihuo... guess who I am?" the Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissary shrouded in white robes said faintly.</p><p></p><p>The voice was obviously altered, and the true voice could not be heard.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissary who had emerged from the black vortex, his powerful Corpse Refining aura was almost visible.</p><p></p><p>Behind this figure, there were two more vortices swirling, and slowly, two more Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissaries emerged!</p><p></p><p>Three Seven Element Corpse Divine Emissaries! The importance and scale they placed on Li Qingshan could be said to be at the maximum!</p><p></p><p>The golden flames of Nan Lihuo's Golden Prison Jade Fire Body burned brightly.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were rolling with golden flames.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The sound of a two-stringed instrument being played mournfully rang out.</p><p></p><p>The street performer, Zheng Zheng, had come to join the commotion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Two Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing's Confucian robe fluttered, and he suddenly grabbed towards the sky, and a divine being shrouded in vast white light, with a majestic aura, descended.</p><p></p><p>Observing the divine appearance, it was Wen Qu! Taking a step forward, Zhang Qing floated as if entering the interior of the divine being's law image.</p><p></p><p>A three-foot long ruler fell into his hand, and he swung it up.</p><p></p><p>Crack—! It exploded with a thunderous sound! "You scoundrels, scram!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing's hair and beard flew, and on his stern and angry face, a furious expression erupted, as he fiercely brought the ruler down towards the hidden darkness.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, those divine appearance cultivators hiding in the darkness manifested their forms! They had planned to wait for the right moment to see if Li Qingshan could complete his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Qing did not give them the opportunity to observe! Boom—! "You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>A long spear like a scorching hot iron, was suddenly hurled, like a fiery giant dragon, undulating and whipping through the sky!</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical and ferocious, whoever came would die!</p><p></p><p>Countless red flames surged, and a divine appearance figure clad in flaming red armor, towering and burning with flames, appeared! Zhu Hongdou, the Fire Attribute Crimson Emperor Divine Appearance! "You all, are courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Her fiery red hair hung upside down, like a raging flame.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou glared with wide eyes, like a true fire god had descended, her fighting spirit soaring! Killing intent surging!</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>A young figure wearing a half-peacock mask, stood tall with hands behind his back, in the void.</p><p></p><p>Although wearing a mask, everyone knew this was Lin Xiu, the Deputy Monitor of the Qin Tian Monitoring Agency!</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu not only came himself, but also brought another Deputy Monitor of the Qin Tian Monitoring Agency.</p><p></p><p>A tall figure wearing a goat-faced mask, completely wrapped up, not revealing any identity.</p><p></p><p>But following beside Lin Xiu, everyone already knew his origins.</p><p></p><p>This night...</p><p></p><p>The divine appearances of the Capital City of Golden Light had almost all gathered around the Thunderous Peak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's heart burned with fury!</p><p></p><p>A sharp howl! Wen Long Mountain's eyes distorted the air, and in his eyes, that Dragon Tooth Bodhi Bullet that tore through the fireworks and roared afterwards, seemed to have countless miniaturized serpents twisting and undulating.</p><p></p><p>Once it pierced into the body, the countless serpents would scatter and bite down countless chunks of his flesh! Wen Long Mountain's toes fiercely stepped on the roof, the black tiles on the pavilion top exploded, continuously shooting and flying.</p><p></p><p>As his figure retreated after the rebound, his powerful blood qi suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>Bending the bow to the fullest, he shot an arrow! </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had completed the action of drawing the bow and shooting the arrow! Eighty meters away!</p><p></p><p>The arrow imbued with divine nature and blood qi collided with the Dragon Tooth Bodhi, and another dazzling firework bloomed in the night sky!</p><p></p><p>After shooting one arrow, Wen Long Mountain's agile figure leaped into the air, quickly darting from the pavilion top.</p><p></p><p>Jumping onto the tiled roofs of the adjoining buildings, he ran lightly on the beams.</p><p></p><p>Running while shooting arrows! Shrill—</p><p></p><p>Shrill—shrill—</p><p></p><p>Each of his arrows was grand in momentum!</p><p></p><p>But those Dragon Tooth Bodhi bullets were silent and invisible, like a venomous snake hiding in the darkness, occasionally striking out with its poison-filled fangs! Boom boom boom! Arrow after arrow, Wen Long Mountain felt an unprecedented pressure!</p><p></p><p>His mind was extremely tense, his divine sense pushed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>His divine secret art Eagle Eye was also intently observing any movement in the darkness! Even the slightest air flow fluctuation, he would worry that a bullet might explode towards him!</p><p></p><p>He became serious, continuously running, changing his position, not standing still like a stationary target for the other party to shoot at.</p><p></p><p>But those Dragon Tooth Bodhi bullets, their accuracy was terrifyingly high, no matter where he was, the other party could lock onto his position! Beads of sweat unknowingly appeared on Wen Long Mountain's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Drawing the bow and shooting arrows, drawing the bow and shooting arrows...</p><p></p><p>The numbness in his arms didn't matter to him at all!</p><p></p><p>The other party was like a chess player sitting outside the board, overlooking from high above.</p><p></p><p>Every Dragon Tooth Bodhi was like a chess piece the other party held between their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Ruthlessly dropping the pieces from the high heavens! Clack, falling onto the board!</p><p></p><p>It was time to take his life! His Eagle Eye divine art...</p><p></p><p>Was completely suppressed!</p><p></p><p>As if he and the other party were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>He was on the first level, while the other party... had already reached the celestial atmosphere!  "Ma Mian!"</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian—!!!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain's heart was pounding violently, as a state capital divine guard army's Seven Element Divine Archer.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had felt such immense pressure!</p><p></p><p>The pressure of a pure archery confrontation!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Another firework exploded!</p><p></p><p>And this time, under Wen Long Mountain's distorted air flow vision,</p><p></p><p>That Dragon Tooth Bodhi, was only ten meters away from him!</p><p></p><p>Wen Long Mountain let out a roar, the last three feathered arrows in his quiver fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Bending the bow to the fullest, a faint blood-red color flickered in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I am... a divine archer after all!"</p><p></p><p>"I've found your position!"</p><p></p><p>The veins on his neck bulged and throbbed like dragons, the terrifying blood qi erupting from his body!</p><p></p><p>The three arrow shafts whistled through the air, three streams of scarlet light, breaking the sound barrier, accompanied by thunderous explosive sounds, shot forth!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Another firework exploded, scorching hot and searing, accompanied by the clanging of metal and blood, the deafening sound of the Dragon Tooth Bodhi and the arrow heads violently colliding and grinding!</p><p></p><p>This firework.</p><p></p><p>Was only three meters away from Wen Long Mountain! The scorching flames seared his flesh and skin! But Wen Long Mountain paid no heed.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly shifted in the span of an inhalation and exhalation.</p><p></p><p>But still too slow! The silent and invisible Dragon Tooth Bodhi bullet, from the smoke of the firework just three meters away, twisted and pierced through, striking his left chest!

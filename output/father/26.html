        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes falling on the black tiles of the long corridor made a faint rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>The winter wind that had picked up was gently swaying the white curtains that hung like they were suspended in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stopped in his tracks, his expression frozen for a moment like the biting cold of winter. His eyes, sharp like unsheathed swords, pierced through the biting chill and landed on the old woman standing humbly beside the man in white.</p><p></p><p>"Lei Chunlan!"</p><p></p><p>A low voice rumbled from the depths of Li Che's throat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu noticed Li Che's movement and change in emotion, and was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Xu Beihu asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's emotions were in turmoil. That face, he could never forget it. </p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan, the midwife who had helped deliver Xixia, was also the evil woman who had caused the deaths of many children she had delivered.</p><p></p><p>And now, she was here, in a place Li Che never would have imagined.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Che's heart sank to the deepest depths.</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan... what is her relationship with the young master of the Si family? Rumor has it that Lei Chunlan is involved with the Lingying Sect, could it be that the Lingying Sect is also connected to the Si family? Lei Chunlan's background seems to be stronger than he had imagined, no wonder the bounty posted on her in the outer city was quickly withdrawn, while his own "Ox Demon" bounty notice still hangs high on the bulletin board.</p><p></p><p>"I've encountered an acquaintance," Li Che said calmly, suppressing his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Beihu had a burly appearance, his heart was quite sensitive, and he noticed the unusual way Li Che looked at that old woman.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever grievances you have, figure out the situation first before making any plans," Xu Beihu said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, and the two of them then stepped into the pavilion suite.</p><p></p><p>The servant of the Jinhuang Pavilion carefully placed the black cloth-covered wooden sculpture on the table that had been prepared in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Mubai, the master wood carver from my Xu family has brought it, take a look at his craftsmanship," Xu Beihu said loudly as he stepped into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes sitting in the rosewood armchair shifted his gaze, and Li Che was able to see the man's face clearly.</p><p></p><p>It was a handsome and captivating countenance, with a touch of ethereal beauty. His eyes were filled with a melancholic hue, with a teardrop mole at the corner, his expression bordering on the verge of tears. A lock of hair fell across his cheek, swaying gently in the breeze.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Beihu, you've truly done me a great favor," Si Mubai said, his voice almost sounding like he was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>He bumped fists with Xu Beihu, then his gaze fell upon Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"So you must be Master Li? Although you have not entered the inner city, many of your wood carving works have caused a sensation there. Pieces with such profound artistic conception, it is truly rare to find under a master wood carver."</p><p></p><p>Si Mubai smiled, but his smile was more akin to crying.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly, but his gaze was still fixed on Lei Chunlan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lei Chunlan also recognized Li Che, and a benevolent smile spread across her deeply wrinkled face as she looked at Li Che, not avoiding or hiding from him at all.</p><p></p><p>Si Mubai noticed Li Che's gaze and continued with his unsightly smile, "A servant in the manor, helping out with some tasks. If he has offended Master Li in any way, please forgive him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu narrowed his eyes, and Li Che also understood the implication in Si Mubai's words.</p><p></p><p>This Lei Chunlan is his person, any conflicts, just endure it...</p><p></p><p>The subtext in his words showed that Si Mubai was clearly aware of what Lei Chunlan was up to, but he was forcefully shielding her, or perhaps Li Che's identity simply wasn't important enough for Si Mubai to care about.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan's smile grew even more radiant, like a withered old chrysanthemum stubbornly blooming.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the pavilion seemed to have turned icy cold in an instant, with the howling wind rushing in.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a faint smile appeared on Li Che's stern face. "Perhaps I was mistaken, I thought she was the midwife who helped deliver my beloved daughter, and had entanglements with the Lingying Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That midwife was an evil person who caused the deaths of many newborns, wanted by the authorities. How could she possibly be here in Master Si's manor? I must have been seeing things."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che's words carried a hint of yin and yang, Si Mubai also heard the conciliation in Li Che's attitude. His lips curled into an even more unsightly smile as he waved his hand, and Lei Chunlan lowered her head and retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li is too kind to Si, please take a look at the craftsmanship."</p><p></p><p>Si Mubai spoke lightly, brushing aside the topic in a way that brooked no further discussion.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Xu Beihu remained silent, his expression slightly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sinking, his heart was somewhat disappointed in Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Although even if Li Che were to make a move, he would not be able to harm Lei Chunlian, but with him here now, he could still lend support to Li Che and regain some face. Yet Li Che had chosen to swallow his humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Steady and stable, but lacking in reckless abandon, Xu Beihu was not entirely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But he could also understand, after all... the one they were facing was the司 family.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Li Che's temperament was similar to his third brother Xu You, too gloomy and too able to endure, which he disliked.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Che had taken the initiative to submit, Xu Beihu couldn't be bothered to say much more.</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái then walked up to the wood carving, pulled away the black curtain, and the "Nine-Headed Avalokiteśvara Weeping to Subdue Ghosts" statue was revealed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái's breathing suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed a look of joyful surprise, staring at it blankly, and slowly, two streams of hot tears slid down his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwu... so good, so good, though without divinity, but the connotation is rich, the nine heads of Avalokiteśvara, each with a different expression, yet all containing compassion and suffering, a single furrowed brow gesture has the mercy of empathy for all beings, the connotation in the weeping is so rich..."</p><p></p><p>"Good, so good."</p><p></p><p>Sī Mùbái cried and laughed, clapping his hands in praise.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Sī Mùbái's palms slammed down on the wood carving, and he opened his mouth and wailed loudly, and from the wood carving, faint wisps of white energy began to rise.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, such a strange sight made his mood suddenly tense.</p><p></p><p>The entire pavilion was instantly shrouded in a unique and bizarre atmosphere, as if there were ghosts crying, women wailing, and old men tearing their hearts out in agonizing cries...</p><p></p><p>Li Che even had a stuffy nose and couldn't help but feel like he was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu took a step in front of Li Che, lightly patting him on the shoulder, and in an instant, Li Che's desire to cry dissipated like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step back, Li Che's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Sī Mùbái is cultivating his spiritual nature, you were infected by the spiritual energy he emitted, I suppressed it for you, you're fine now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not entirely satisfied with Li Che's temperament, Li Che's talent was undeniable, and he was still worth cultivating a relationship with.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his fists in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation is only at the initial stage of refinement, if you were affected by the wrathful spiritual energy for too long, it might harm your mind..."</p><p></p><p>"Take the gold leaves and leave, the carriage is outside, you can go back on your own. If you want to wander around the inner city, that's also fine, just leave before dark."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>Li Che collected the five gold leaves, put them away, and bowed in retreat.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep look at Sī Mùbái, who was still hugging the wood carving and frantically absorbing it, seeing the wood carving being sucked dry, withered and no longer resembling Avalokiteśvara...</p><p></p><p>Li Che licked his lips.</p><p></p><p>His hands... seemed a little itchy.</p><p></p><p>He resisted the urge to use his nascent "Thousand Slicing Palms" technique to absorb the spiritual energy from Sī Mùbái.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exited the Golden Leaf Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Back in the carriage, Li Che sat upright in the luxurious cabin, lightly and rhythmically tapping the tea table in the carriage, his gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Old master, stop the carriage for a moment, it's rare for me to come to the inner city, I plan to buy some osmanthus cakes for my wife, and bring some delicious food back, please wait for me here, old master."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The coachman, though from the Xu family carriage service, was quite polite to Li Che, smiling as he responded.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, please go, this old man will wait here for you, as long as you leave the inner city before dark, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Che bowed politely.</p><p></p><p>The inner city was prosperous, with a large population, and the bustling streets were no less lively than the outer city.</p><p></p><p>After moving out of the coachman's sight, Li Che's face instantly turned extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>He first went to a silk shop and bought some black cloth, simply making a loose black robe, and also bought a wide-brimmed hat. From his pocket, he took out a carving knife he always carried with him, as well as a thin piece of wood, and with his current skills, in a few breaths he had made a cute ox mask.</p><p></p><p>He found a deserted alley.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the wide-brimmed hat, he first took off his clothes and hid them, then put on the black robe and the ox mask.</p><p></p><p>Instantly!</p><p></p><p>The shadow cast on the alley wall began to twist, writhe, and rise violently! It seemed as if a dragon was rumbling and an elephant was trumpeting! Restrained? Steady? Submissive?</p><p></p><p>I'm just changing my posture... I'll kill you!</p><p></p><p>"Lei Chunlian..."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon King is here!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

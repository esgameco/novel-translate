        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spirited horse neighed and galloped on the official road, kicking up dust.</p><p></p><p>The blue stone path stretched all the way to the foot of the mountain gate of Shenzong, where a huge white jade archway stood.</p><p></p><p>Shenzong had dedicated guards, and Li Che and Zhang Ya were already familiar with the cultivator guarding the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, are you going up the mountain to find your daughter again?"</p><p></p><p>The mountain guard was an old man, at the initial stage of spiritual foundation cultivation, not weak but with limited talent, his path of advancement already blocked.</p><p></p><p>So he stood guard at the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qian, here, this is the red braised pork my wife made, try it, it's no worse than the chefs at Yunfang Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled as he took a plate of pre-prepared red braised pork from the lunch box and skillfully handed it over to the figure in the small building next to the white jade archway.</p><p></p><p>The stooped figure took the plate of red braised pork, took a deep breath, and burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carried the red lacquered lunch box, holding Zhang Ya's hand, got off the carriage, stepped on the blue stone stairs, and went up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Like a couple strolling on the mountain path, bathing in the mountain wind and shade.</p><p></p><p>They soon arrived at the large platform inside Shenzong.</p><p></p><p>The platform was bustling, with disciples from various peaks of Shenzong gathered. Shenzong held a grand assembly every month, gathering all disciples to assess their monthly cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Similar to a monthly exam, it would assess the ranking of disciples of the same period, even the true disciples would participate in the ranking along with the inner disciples.</p><p></p><p>For example, there were five true disciples in a generation, and each monthly assessment, they had to rank at least in the top six, if they fell below the top six for more than three times, the true disciple position would become unstable and be replaced by the top inner disciple.</p><p></p><p>Of course, failing once or twice in the monthly assessment would not have much impact, but once it exceeded three times without entering the top six, it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>During the annual assessment, if they were defeated, they might even lose their true disciple position.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, during the monthly assessment, the inner disciples all had a chance to challenge the true disciples.</p><p></p><p>If they succeeded in the challenge for three consecutive months, they could replace the position of that true disciple, without even waiting for the annual assessment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the same logic applied to the inner disciples, so the monthly assessment was also an opportunity for many outer disciples to enter the inner sect. Every year, there were quite a few diligent outer disciples who replaced the inner disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, it was rare for a true disciple to be replaced.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya arrived at the platform, and in the center, Elder Zhang Qing, dressed in Confucian robes, stood on the stage with a stern expression that everyone feared.</p><p></p><p>Holding a roster, he called out a name, and a young disciple of Shenzong stepped up.</p><p></p><p>After respectfully saluting Zhang Qing, he began to perform martial arts techniques, unleashing his qi and blood to demonstrate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A set of fist techniques was completed in just a dozen breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Inner disciple, Liu Yue, seven years old, small success in tendon refinement, temperament like a mirror, that's enough, you may go down."</p><p></p><p>"Next, inner disciple, Zhang Kai."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing nodded and then frowned as he called out.</p><p></p><p>The disciple obediently stepped down from the stage, with excellent discipline, no one daring to defy the will of Elder Zhang Qing.</p><p></p><p>On the observation platform, not only Li Che and Zhang Ya, but also many other parents of the young disciples were sitting, watching their children participate in Shenzong's monthly assessment.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, quickly look, there's Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes widened as she searched the crowd, and soon spotted Xixia, surrounded by a group of little boys. Pulling Li Che's hand, she exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already noticed Xixia's location, his perception far exceeding the past now that he had advanced to level 3 of the Chess Saint's Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because around Xixia were a group of boys - Gong Yuan Liang from the Gong family, Gongyang Xiu from the Gongyang family, and many other boys from aristocratic families in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression darkened as he sat on the high platform, coldly watching. These scions of prominent families, their intentions were obvious.</p><p></p><p>Surely they were acting on the orders of their elders, to make good contact with Xixia now that they were in the sect.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was, after all, the true disciple of the Golden Light Peak, her status far exceeding ordinary true disciples. And most importantly, she was a girl.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these aristocratic families, a girl would ultimately have to marry, even if she was a true disciple of the sect. If they could marry into her family, it would be like bringing a dowry with great resources, and the background power of a sect master's true disciple could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Che not see through the intentions of these boys?</p><p></p><p>Normally, Xixia cultivated on the Golden Light Peak, with her senior sister Sang Guanyin and senior brother Liu Yangyuan watching over her, these boys had no chance to approach her.</p><p></p><p>But the monthly sect assessment was the best opportunity for them to get close to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"These boys have impure intentions," Li Che exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya could only smile wryly: "Husband, they are just children after all."</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is only three years old."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Zhang Ya's head and said, "Of course I know they are just children, but... children will eventually grow up! They are laying the groundwork for the future, we cannot be careless!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya smiled wryly, her husband was always prepared for the long term, thinking far ahead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixia sat on the chair, her mood very joyful. She grabbed a handful of melon seeds from her sleeve pocket and began to nibble on them, these melon seeds were brought to her by Shangguan Qinghu a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's nibbling of melon seeds was very fitting for her aura as the Empress Xixia, nibbling while looking down on her many subjects, utterly cool.</p><p></p><p>As for the strange inner disciples surrounding her, her senior sister Yinyin said she didn't need to pay attention to them, just treat them as buzzing flies.</p><p></p><p>Yinyin senior sister had a lot of experience!</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, are those your father and mother?!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia was bored, when suddenly she heard Gongyang Xiu's childish voice.</p><p></p><p>The five-year-old Gongyang Xiu was only two years older than Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's ears perked up at the words: "Where? Where?"</p><p></p><p>She immediately became energetic, her gaze sweeping left and right.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she saw her joyful mother Zhang Ya waving at her from the high platform, and her stern-faced father.</p><p></p><p>Xixia immediately clapped her hands excitedly and jumped down from the chair.</p><p></p><p>Holding Gongyang Xiu's hand, she pushed through the crowd and ran excitedly towards her parents.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>On the stage, the frowning Zhang Qing coldly commanded.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that it was Xixia, a trace of tenderness flashed in his eyes, though it was barely perceptible.</p><p></p><p>"Go on."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing said.</p><p></p><p>It was Xixia, so it was fine. If it were anyone else, he would have been iron-faced and impartial.</p><p></p><p>Xixia pulled Gongyang Xiu and ran to the observation platform.</p><p></p><p>"Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Excited, she leaped towards Zhang Ya, but was caught by the neck by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>What strength did Xixia have now? If she crashed into them like that, was she planning to matricide and attain enlightenment?</p><p></p><p>Xixia, caught by the back of her neck, began to flail her limbs like a swimming fish.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you're so mean!"</p><p></p><p>Her chubby little face flushed red, she was so angry, the image of Empress Xixia was completely ruined!</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't charge at your mother like that! Only I, your father, can do that."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pinched Xixia's little face and admonished her seriously, then put her down.</p><p></p><p>Xixia snorted, burrowed into Zhang Ya's embrace, and complained pitifully, "Mother, Father bullied me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya quickly comforted and coaxed Xixia.</p><p></p><p>She also took out the lunch box and took out the red braised pork that Xixia loved the most, and Xixia's unhappiness was gone as she happily started eating.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu stood there a bit awkwardly, he had been dragged over by Xixia, and was not quite clear about the situation.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he felt that Xixia's father's gaze was as sharp as an unsheathed sword.</p><p></p><p>Adults are so scary...</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Xixia was eating the red braised pork.</p><p></p><p>"From the Gongyang family?"</p><p></p><p>"Your hair seems a bit yellow."</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at Gongyang Xiu and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu hurriedly defended himself, "Uncle, let me explain... this is because of my cultivation of the Soil Spiritual Martial Arts of my family..."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Martial Arts of the Five Elements combined with the Seven Emotions, forming a special type of Spiritual Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>The power would be a bit stronger than ordinary Spiritual Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>The five major sects each specialized in the Spiritual Martial Arts of one of the Five Elements, combined with the Shen Xiang technique.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Jin Lie Gate cultivated the Metal element, focusing on killing.</p><p>The Bamboo Forest Academy cultivated the Wood element, the Guanchao Pavilion cultivated the Water element, the Heart Monkey Temple cultivated the Fire element, and the Scorpion Forest cultivated the Soil element.</p><p></p><p>Like in Shenzong, they also taught the Spiritual Martial Arts of the Five Elements, and the ones at the same level, if combined with the Five Elements, would be a bit more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, but did not say anything, making Gongyang Xiu feel even more pressured, his little face covered in beads of sweat, his back drenched.</p><p></p><p>So scary...</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Xixia was still eating the red braised pork.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu almost cried, bearing a burden that a child his age should not have to bear.</p><p></p><p>"Xiu Xiu, do you want a piece of the red braised pork? My mother's red braised pork is the best in the world!" Xixia, her mouth full of oil, looked at Gongyang Xiu and kindly offered.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu hurriedly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the assessment of the true disciples finally began, Zhang Qing called out Gongyang Xiu's name, and he fled with relief, as if escaping.</p><p></p><p>After the assessment of the inner disciples, it was the turn of the true disciples.</p><p></p><p>The four true disciples this generation were Hai Chaosheng, Gong Yuan Liang, Gongyang Xiu, and Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Xiu went up the stage, saluted Elder Zhang Qing, and then began his performance.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Gongyang Xiu, five years old, small success in bone refining, temperament like a stream."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing frowned, though his words were approving, his attitude gave an unsatisfied impression.</p><p></p><p>"Next, Gong Yuan Liang."</p><p></p><p>The assessment of the four true disciples did not take long.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just a monthly assessment, not too formal, Zhang Qing just simply recorded their performance.</p><p></p><p>Basically, the ranking could be determined based on their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In one month's time, everyone had made considerable progress in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The seven-year-old Hai Chaosheng seemed to have been stimulated by Xixia's genius talent, and after a month of arduous cultivation, he had actually broken through to the great success of bone refining and stepped into blood transformation. This news truly shocked many people, a seven-year-old reaching blood transformation was indeed rare.</p><p></p><p>"Next, Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing called out.</p><p></p><p>Xixia stuffed the last piece of red braised pork into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Father, mother, it's my turn!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia said, then ran towards the stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Zhang Ya's gaze also fell on the stage, curious about the level of Xixia's cultivation in Shenzong for the past month.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Xixia moved, a resounding sword cry erupted, countless golden lights flashing from her arms, like a myriad of brilliant rays rising together!</p><p></p><p>There was also the sound of thundering, echoing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>On the stage, many inner disciples who were eager to challenge Xixia felt a sense of oppression, their eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire from the Qin family had long boasted that he would challenge Xixia, but at this moment, his heart seemed to be gripped by a huge hand.</p><p></p><p>"Blood... transformation?! How is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire's face looked extremely unsightly, his eyes wide with disbelief as he felt the scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>His expression gradually became ashen.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the great success of bone refining, confident that he could challenge Xixia, but now... the idea of challenging had long vanished.</p><p></p><p>In one month, although he had reached the great success of bone refining and stepped into bone refining perfection, Xixia had directly stepped into blood transformation, the gap... was quite large! This was the difference between him and the prodigy? Qin Huofire's body trembled, a hint of fear flashing in his eyes, and he fell silent, his heart sinking.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qin Feng couldn't help but feel a sense of defeat.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling of defeat quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qin Feng's eyes still held hope: "Yes, one year later... when the temple deity resonates, I still have a chance..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as my temple deity resonance is sufficient, I still have a chance to become a true disciple and receive the sect's cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>The Qin family had prepared a lot for his temple deity resonance assessment, and had high hopes for him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Feng also became more confident.</p><p></p><p>He was only seven years old, his future had just begun, so what did this temporary lag matter? Time was still abundant, he must definitely catch up to Xixia!</p><p></p><p>On the arena, Xixia displayed the entry-level supreme technique "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Killing Sword Art" of the Golden Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling and awe-inspiring, the sword qi burst out from her body, intertwining and surging.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just the entry-level, it had already amazed many people.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Qingzheng stroked his beard in surprise, his eyes flashing with an unusual light.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the elder Zhu Hongdou who was observing the assessment was very unhappy, Xixia was originally supposed to enter her Red Cloud Peak and become her disciple.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was snatched away by the old scoundrel sect master.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi, three years old, one blood exchange, cultivating temperament like a river!" Zhang Qingzheng announced Xixia's results.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the first round of testing was completely over, and then came the challenges.</p><p></p><p>Inner sect disciples challenging the true disciples, as well as outer sect disciples challenging the inner sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>The previously boastful Qin Feng who wanted to challenge Xixia, ultimately strategically gave up.</p><p></p><p>After all, the blood-exchanged Xixia, even if Xixia didn't use any hidden weapons, Qin Feng had no confidence in defeating her.</p><p></p><p>"I want to challenge!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, everyone was attracted, and they saw the gloomy-faced Shangguan Qinglei step by step from the corner.</p><p></p><p>All the disciples quickly moved away from him.</p><p></p><p>As if he was a plague god, they were unwilling to get close to him, unwilling to have any connection with him.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's face was gloomy, at the age of seven, he seemed to have experienced too much of human affairs, already understanding the ugliness of human nature.</p><p></p><p>He stepped up to the arena, his gaze falling on Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"I challenge you!"</p><p></p><p>Since Shangguan Zhenghen was killed by Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan, Shangguan Qinglei's status in the Divine Sect had plummeted, and some disciples who knew the inside story even mocked him as the son of the evil Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei had suffered a lot of grievances, but his anger had nowhere to vent.</p><p></p><p>He transferred all his anger to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's family was on good terms with Li Qingshan...</p><p></p><p>And Li Qingshan was the murderer of his father! The more Shangguan Qinglei thought about it, the more intense the repressed anger and murderous intent in his heart became.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng frowned, coldly looking at this little brat, as if he could see the anger and murderous intent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng knew why Shangguan Qinglei had such anger and murderous intent, but he just shook his head and looked at Xixia: "Will you accept?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia did not refuse, her bright eyes gleaming as she leapt onto the arena, fighting... she loved it the most! Xixia's muscles were already trembling with excitement!</p><p></p><p>In the stands.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue stared at Shangguan Qinglei, able to feel the intense fury and terrible murderous intent he was directing towards Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei...</p><p></p><p>The son of Shangguan Zhenghen?</p><p></p><p>Almost missed that.</p><p></p><p>To eliminate the root, one must cut the weeds.</p><p></p><p>This child...</p><p></p><p>Cannot be left alone!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Chen puffed on his pipe, humming a little tune as he walked along the bustling streets of the capital city.</p><p></p><p>The prosperity of the capital city was truly captivating, Old Chen had never imagined in his life that he would come to live in the capital.</p><p></p><p>However, after eating at Li Yue's family for so many days, he should go out and find a job to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi had gone to the Divine Sect to cultivate, Li Yue went to work at the Astronomical Observatory during the day, and Zhang Ya occasionally stayed at home, but usually went to Li Qingshan's Zhenglie Peak to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He was truly bored being alone.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, a figure in shabby clothes quickly approached in the distance, holding a bamboo stick.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took a puff of his pipe, this was his fellow villager, who had joined one of the three major gangs in the capital, the Beggar's Gang, after arriving in the capital.</p><p></p><p>They had met in the capital recently and recognized each other again.</p><p></p><p>"Big Bao!"</p><p></p><p>"Er Dai."</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and smiled, feeling the familiarity of meeting an old friend in a strange land.</p><p></p><p>They were both old now, just young martial arts students in the village back then, and now they were both getting on in years.</p><p></p><p>They found a tea stall and sat down to drink tea and talk.</p><p></p><p>"I found you a job in the gang, knowing your blood exchange cultivation, I talked to the executive and got you a job as a guard."</p><p></p><p>"The monthly salary is not low, twenty taels a month."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen narrowed his eyes, took a puff of his old pipe, and exhaled the smoke, saying, "What am I guarding?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't immediately agree, the waters in the capital were deep.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a good job! Do you know about the Yunfang Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>The old beggar Er Dai had a mischievous smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Beggar's Gang also has territory around the Yunfang Pavilion... The Yunfang Pavilion also hires people from our Beggar's Gang to do some things, mainly to guard some goods."</p><p></p><p>"If you're lucky, you might even get to see the beauties in the Yunfang Pavilion, I heard the courtesan there is as white as snow!"</p><p></p><p>Er Dai rubbed his hands together.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen chuckled helplessly: "We're both old now, do you really think you can still get lucky?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop thinking about those things."</p><p></p><p>However, the job Er Dai mentioned did fit Old Chen's intentions.</p><p></p><p>The Yunfang Pavilion was not too far from Li Yue's little courtyard, and its reputation, Old Chen had already heard of.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a place of debauchery, as long as he worked honestly to earn money, that money would not be dirty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Old Chen agree, Er Dai then led Old Chen to the Beggar's Gang's base near the Yunfang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>For a blood-exchanged martial artist to find a job in the capital was not too difficult.</p><p></p><p>The well-dressed executive of the Beggar's Gang did not look like a beggar at all, more like a wealthy and prosperous businessman.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, blood-exchanged martial artist, your qi and blood may be a bit weak, but you'll do for guarding goods."</p><p></p><p>"I'll have someone lead you there, remember, don't look or ask too much, just do your own job well."</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen puffed on his pipe and smiled, indicating he understood, he was an old hand at this, how could he not understand? The wealthy and prosperous executive was very satisfied with Old Chen's attitude, he liked this kind of old and experienced old hand who was discreet and sensible.</p><p></p><p>After that, someone came to lead Old Chen to the workplace.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Old Chen leave, the executive's oily smile suddenly disappeared, and he cupped his hands towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"This person has a close relationship with the Divine Sect's divine child Li Nuanxi, and has subtly planted a Corpse Curse Mark in his body. The sect master's true disciple will come down the mountain once every half a year..."</p><p></p><p>"When half a year later, Li Nuanxi and this person come into contact, the Corpse Curse Mark can be transferred to the divine child's body!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice drifted out from the house.</p><p></p><p>"A divine child... is worth us taking a risk."</p><p></p><p>"The entire Jiezhou has become a plaything of our Corpse God Sect, this little Jinguang Prefecture... how can it resist?"</p><p></p><p>"People all have desires, as long as there are desires, they cannot resist the temptation of our Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"A divine child, ah..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Divine Sect, Inner Sect Great Platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue sat on the high platform, watching the gloomy Shangguan Qinglei step by step, the hidden murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though Shangguan Qinglei was just a child...</p><p></p><p>But the threat a child brings is not small.</p><p></p><p>If he really ends up harming Xixia, he would regret it for the rest of his life!</p><p></p><p>However, this was the arena competition, with Zhang Qingzheng, the Divination Cultivator, presiding, Xixia's safety did not need to be worried about.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Shangguan Qinglei's cultivation, he could not possibly pose a threat to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>So at the moment, Li Yue had no intention of interfering.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the high platform, he calmly watched this challenge, but in his heart he had already started calculating how to eliminate this child.</p><p></p><p>After the improvement of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit, his perception of murderous intent was extremely keen.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's heart stirred slightly, and the chess board with intertwined and crisscrossing chess pieces appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>One chess piece suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>That was the flying thunder chess piece he had hidden in Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, it seemed to have sensed some dangerous aura, and the chess piece sent back feedback.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's brow furrowed slightly, his mind moved, and that chess piece suddenly burst forth with a hazy glow, the glow gathering on the chess board, weaving into an image.</p><p></p><p>After just a while, Li Yue's face became completely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Corpse God Sect! Because of the feedback through the chess piece, he sensed the gradually increasing Corpse Curse power on Old Chen, although the power was not much or strong, it would take several accumulations to form a Corpse Curse Mark, hidden to the point of being undetectable.</p><p></p><p>But Li Yue...</p><p></p><p>Because the Corpse Curse Mark of the Eight Extremes was suppressed in the Chess Saint Dao Fruit, he was extremely sensitive to the Corpse Curse Mark, even the slightest trace was like the brilliant sun in his eyes, impossible to hide.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect is truly ubiquitous, Old Chen went to find a job, and ended up contaminated with the Corpse Curse power? Such a subtle and insidious method, truly unpreventable."</p><p></p><p>When the Corpse Curse power accumulates to a certain extent, it will erupt, and condense into a Corpse Curse Mark in an irresistible way.</p><p></p><p>Unless the one being marked resolutely resists, abandons their cultivation, or even commits suicide, they can withstand the erosion of the Corpse Curse Mark.</p><p></p><p>But how many people can face death calmly?</p><p></p><p>Not wanting to die, and with the temptation of being able to improve their cultivation, they would give up their beliefs and join the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue closed his eyes, then slowly opened them again.</p><p></p><p>He began to ponder what their purpose was.</p><p></p><p>The first time he met Old Chen, they had already started to secretly accumulate Corpse Curse power in Old Chen's body, targeting a blood-exchanged martial artist whose qi and blood were beginning to decline, they must have a targeted purpose.</p><p></p><p>To convert Old Chen into the Corpse God Sect?</p><p></p><p>In the capital, a blood-exchanged martial artist is not much, especially Old Chen who is a declining blood-exchanged martial artist, why would they bother to design this?</p><p></p><p>Li Yue felt that their target was most likely Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know much about Old Chen's relationship with his family...</p><p></p><p>But if the residents of Flower Lane knew, they would all know that Old Chen had an extremely good relationship with their family.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect must want to, like that Six Desire Wooden Sculpture before, use Old Chen to infect Xixia's body with the Corpse Curse Mark! "The Corpse God Sect... they really deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes suddenly became extremely sharp and cold.</p><p></p><p>They killed like this, and they're not afraid?

        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The huge waves suddenly surged up, crashing violently against the cliffs, splashing up towering white waves dozens of feet high.</p><p></p><p>The originally calm Jiulong River in the winter suddenly became turbulent.</p><p></p><p>It even whipped up huge waves that lashed against the reefs.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change naturally caught the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>The divine energy permeating the air suddenly began to boil, the divine energy contained in the bursting Jiulong River water, spreading and growing from the mysterious temple of the four-armed, eight-armed prison lotus, the angry Third Prince! "The waves are rising! How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong and Gong Yunli both hurried to the carved wooden window, looking out to see the river water roaring in anger! It was as if a huge beast was lurking beneath the river flow, violently colliding with the cliffs and reefs, causing the entire precious tower to tremble! Layer after layer, even more terrifying than the great waves Li Che had carved the statue of the Third Prince before. The falling snow in the sky seemed to melt in an instant, turning into a patter of raindrops.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops exploded on the river surface, emitting a series of explosive sounds! The entire inner city Jiulong River tributary surface suddenly collapsed by dozens of feet!</p><p></p><p>It was as if from the other end of the river, a huge beast had suddenly sucked in a mouthful of river water, swallowing the entire half-river tide, and then spitting it out!</p><p></p><p>"This shouldn't be happening! The statue Li Che is carving now... is not the statue of the Third Prince either?!" Gong Yunli was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>If it's not the statue of the Third Prince, why can it stimulate the outburst of the divine energy of the Third Prince in the Jiulong River? This is unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>Her brain couldn't quite process the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong didn't understand either.</p><p></p><p>The river flow violently collided with the cliffs and reefs, and the suddenly rising huge waves were even higher than the height of the precious tower.</p><p></p><p>Like an endless water curtain, constantly washing! The intense divine energy was constantly spreading and interweaving within the examination room!</p><p></p><p>Too dense!</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director narrowed his eyes, his waist two-stringed instrument trembling, the strings like being pulled and plucked by an invisible force, emitting a slight sound.</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Monitoring Director of the Capital City, Lu Yao, had a grave gaze, his sight falling on the wooden sculpture carved by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that the wooden sculpture carved by Li Che was the cause of the outburst of the angry Third Prince's divine energy in the Jiulong River! Not only that, the three temple deity statues set up by Li Che had also been activated with divine energy! Vaguely, there were three illusory figures, emanating suppressed temple deity-level divine energy, hovering behind the three carved statues.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director stood up, stroking his beard, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just an outline, he seemed to... remember something.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not affected at all.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife in his hand was still constantly swinging, he sat in the chair, his spirit and energy highly concentrated, integrating the skills of the Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Art, perfectly demonstrating them in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Art at the master level not only manifests in killing, but also in the display of artistic skills.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife tore open the spiritual wood organization, the scattered fragments were blown away by the surging blood energy, his ten fingers, the carving knife flipping, the transformation of the tools, exquisitely crafted, dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, in his mind, the extremely renowned image from his previous life emerged, the image that could never be erased from everyone's childhood hearts!</p><p></p><p>Every strand of the monkey hair was vividly detailed, the golden hoops on the Ruyi Jingu Bang were carved out.</p><p></p><p>The cape fluttering, the lotus steps, stepping on the clouds, as if about to shatter the outer shell of the statue, vividly emerging!</p><p></p><p>When the last stroke fell.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth seemed to have become quiet at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The dense divine energy surged out from the statue, as if turning into formless ripples spreading out.</p><p></p><p>The diffused divine energy of the "Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Angry Third Prince" temple deity, seemed to condense into substance at this moment, gathering on the wooden sculpture carved by Li Che, sweeping and spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack—</p><p></p><p>Three bursting sounds!</p><p></p><p>The three temple deity statues taken out by Lu Yao, the illusory figures they had activated, seemed to have been hit by a muffled blow one by one.</p><p></p><p>They shattered and dissipated into divine energy mist.</p><p></p><p>The three statues also cracked and completely fell silent.</p><p></p><p>For a moment.</p><p></p><p>The entire examination room became very quiet.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the little descendant of the Tang clan, Tang Ren, opened his mouth wide, staring with eyes wide, his heart extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>So fierce, so powerful! It even has mechanism techniques! It's simply the model for us!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao stared blankly at the three shattered deity statues, which he had carved himself, although it was just done casually, the quality was not bad.</p><p></p><p>It also had about six or seven parts of the temple deity style...</p><p></p><p>After Li Che carved out the temple deity statue, it seemed to have been "beaten" before, the divine energy fluctuating, the emotions intense.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these three temple deities really have been beaten before?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The research on the mysterious temple by the successive dynasties has never stopped.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the previous dynasty, or even further back, the dynasty when the mysterious temple was just beginning to grow, there were people conducting professional research on it.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the mysterious temple and the temple deities within it...</p><p></p><p>Some conclusions have also been drawn, the temple deities must have relationships with each other!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the temple deities carved by Li Che now, really beat the three temple general deities he carved?</p><p></p><p>There was no time to study further.</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director had already clapped his hands lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, very good."</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity that emerged from the Fire-Eye Mysterious Awakening Monkey Temple deity? Ahe, is this your own imagination, or... do you have some reference?"</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao was also staring at the seven-element deity statue carved by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>That's right, it was a seven-element deity statue! To be able to carve a seven-element deity statue, it already belongs to the business scope of a first-class guest official.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the ability Li Che has shown is completely enough to become a second-class guest official.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Yao didn't care about these, what he cared about was the deity statue carved by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Monitoring Director's question, Li Che was startled, and nodded: "A few days ago, after entering the Fire-Eye Mysterious Awakening Monkey Mysterious Temple and observing the temple deities, I vaguely saw this temple deity, and engraved it in my heart, and now I have carved it out."</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director narrowed his eyes, his face still smiling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao became serious, leaning in and observing repeatedly, focusing intently.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he seemed to have thought of something, his pupils slightly narrowing, stepping back, looking at the Monitoring Director.</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director nodded imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao looked at Li Che again, his eyes extremely bright, with a bit of heat.</p><p></p><p>"This is a talent, Li Master's talent in wood sculpture carving is truly amazing."</p><p></p><p>"In the three assessments, Li Master meets the requirements, so Li Master is promoted to the second-class guest official of the Heavenly Monitoring Office, enjoying the treatment of a second-class guest official and assistant supervisor."</p><p></p><p>"The monthly salary will be increased to one Nine-Sun Divine Energy Crystal, and a resource of one Eight-Extreme Spiritual Wood will be obtained every half year, and the 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Art (Volume II)' will be issued!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao solemnly announced.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he recovered Li Che's third-class guest official token, and handed the second-class guest official token that had been prepared in advance to Li Che, asking him to leave his divine imprint on it.</p><p></p><p>This token had been prepared in advance, based on the assumption that Li Che would pass the second-class guest official assessment, a precaution, of course, if Li Che had not passed, this token would have been void.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Li Guest Official can reach the second-class guest official in just a year, and achieving first-class or even special-class guest official in the future is not a problem at all." Lu Yao's expression softened.</p><p></p><p>He patted Li Che's shoulder, looking at him very favorably.</p><p></p><p>For Lu Yao, Li Che was only in his twenties, still very young, and the road ahead was still very long.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is that Li Che was actually able to carve out such a temple deity statue! Lu Yao had already recognized it...</p><p></p><p>This temple deity statue...</p><p></p><p>It's somewhat similar to the temple deity that once dominated the world, the Heavenly Temple's temple deity! However, the Heavenly Temple has long been in decline, and the temple deity has retreated back into the Heavenly City, and no one has seen it.</p><p></p><p>There are records in the Heavenly Monitoring Office of the Capital City, so Lu Yao had a vague impression.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Yao was more surprised that Li Che was actually able to carve out this temple deity! You know...</p><p></p><p>The higher the rank of the temple deity, the more difficult it is to present it!</p><p></p><p>Although in theory, the higher the rank of the wood carving master, the more likely they are to carve out a high-rank temple deity statue.</p><p></p><p>But often, even for high-rank wood carving masters, it is still difficult to carve it out.</p><p></p><p>Because their minds can hardly contain the impression of this temple deity.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing the temple deity, when they start carving again... they will forget everything.</p><p></p><p>Many times, to carve high-rank temple deities, it also requires a divine affinity.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Li Che, through a mysterious Eight-Extreme Monkey Temple, was actually able to see the existence of this "Heavenly" temple deity, which is of great significance, too important!</p><p></p><p>This is an excellent seedling, and in the future, after breaking into the Heavenly City and eliminating the demons occupying the Heavenly City, Li Che, as a wood carving master who can connect with the "Heavenly" temple deity, will play a huge role in exploring the Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this matter, although the Great Dynasty has united many divine sects to plan, can still be considered far away, and only the sect masters of the major divine sects will have the opportunity to know the deeper inside story and arrangements.</p><p></p><p>After all, the demons occupying the Heavenly City, absorbing the divine energy of the Heavenly Mysterious Temple, their metamorphosis... is far from ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao only heard about it, and felt that Li Che, as a rare one who has a divine affinity with the Heavenly, is very rare.</p><p></p><p>"Li Guest Official, are you interested in developing in the Capital City?"</p><p></p><p>"The Capital City is much more developed than the Golden Light Prefecture City, not only the cultivation conditions, but also the temple deities you can contact are higher than the Golden Light Prefecture City."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao began to invite Li Che, planning to poach him. </p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director glanced sideways at him, not very pleased with the old Lu, directly poaching in front of him, as if he didn't exist as the Prefecture City Monitoring Director? But the Monitoring Director thought of something, sighed, and did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not immediately reject Lu Yao.</p><p></p><p>Because, going to the Capital City in the future may be something he will actually do.</p><p></p><p>Xixia now has the talent of a divine child, and after cultivating for a few more years, the educational resources of the Golden Light Prefecture City may not be enough for her.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Xixia may have to go to the main gate of the Qianyuan Divine Sect in the Capital City.</p><p></p><p>This is something Nan Liehuo has already arranged for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>When Xixia turns seven, she will try to break into the Qianyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo has even started to plead with Wang Kuyu, to see if the Sect Master of the Qianyuan Sect can take Xixia as his last disciple.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Sect Master is going to take in the last disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xixia still has a chance.</p><p></p><p>"The Capital City... I may have the opportunity to go there in the future, but for now... my wife and daughter are all here, and my daughter has even entered the subordinate sect of the Golden Light Prefecture City Sect Master, and in the future, if my daughter enters the main sect to cultivate, we as a family will naturally go to the Capital City."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I will need Mr. Lu to take care of us."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Yao's face immediately broke into a smile, his heart settled, it's promising!</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, when you get to the Capital City, just come to the Heavenly Monitoring Office and contact me." Lu Yao smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the matter is done, we should go and see how the little prince and the grand master have caused such a grand momentum in worshiping the mountain, how is the worshiping going?"</p><p></p><p>The Monitoring Director said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly feigned surprise: "Ah? The grand master is worshiping the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao explained to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The little prince wouldn't be going after my daughter, would he?" Li Che became worried.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao was startled, and then realized this was an excellent opportunity to win over people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Then Li Guest Official, come with us to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"If there is any conflict, I can also step in to mediate."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said, still with considerable confidence in his words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's heart moved, and he immediately cupped his fists in thanks.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao smiled, waving his sleeve, a majestic divine energy surged out, the powerful and terrifying level of pressure, making Li Che's whole body hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, many Dao fruits were pounding.</p><p></p><p>In the Nirvana Inner Realm, the Immaculate Heart Foundation was shaken to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>So strong!</p><p></p><p>Extremely strong! This Deputy Monitoring Director of the Capital City, Lu Yao, has an extremely terrifying strength, even surpassing the Monitoring Director! Li Che's heart trembled, could it be... the Divine Element Venerable? Previously, he hadn't noticed, but when Lu Yao truly revealed his divine energy, it was like a dormant fierce tiger awakening, bursting out with terrifying pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even the Monitoring Director could no longer bring such a sense of oppression to the current Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, it must be a higher realm Divine Element Venerable! No wonder Lu Yao had the confidence to say he could intervene, a Divine Element Venerable... in the current Golden Light Prefecture City, indeed has the strength and capital to sway the situation!  Li Che's heart sank slightly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts in the Golden Light Prefecture City are increasing...</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master, the Divine Element Venerable... these are some that he currently has difficulty dealing with.</p><p></p><p>The curious divine child Tang Ren</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ren was also swept up by Lu Yao's qi, and the three of them rose into the air and rushed swiftly towards the direction of Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Even carrying two people, Lu Yao did not feel the slightest bit of strain.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor was playing the erhu as he chased after them.</p><p></p><p>The group hovered in the air above the dense forest 100 zhang from the Golden Peak, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Given the distance of 100 zhang, it was not much for Li Che now, so he did not observe through the perspective of the flying chess piece within Xixia.</p><p></p><p>His expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, he clearly saw the situation on the main platform of Golden Peak...</p><p></p><p>A fierce look surged in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the main platform of Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed Grand Master Xue Dufu and the Divine Element Immortal had been clashing for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The two were in a standoff.</p><p></p><p>The martial will of the Grand Master collided with the pressure of the Divine Element's spiritual realm!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the ultimate burning flames met the torrential downpour in the icy cold pool.</p><p></p><p>The collision of ice and fire let out various howling gusts.</p><p></p><p>The turbulent airflow seemed to have generated a vortex on the main platform, stirring up the unrest.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master followed the way of qi and blood, an ancient cultivation method passed down on this continent.</p><p></p><p>While the Divine Spiritual method was a peculiar cultivation system born from the strange temples, where cultivators trained through the divine spirituality permeating the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The two systems were different, but at the peak, both were extremely formidable! Xue Dufu did not make a move, gripping the hatchet at his waist, his martial will burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to be emitting dazzling golden light!</p><p></p><p>His physical body hummed incessantly, his qi and blood surging like a volcanic eruption.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master, his physical body tempered to perfection, even though Xue Dufu was missing an arm, the wound had long since healed, and his physical body would not leak a single bit of essence and blood.</p><p></p><p>He was like a human nuclear warhead brewing and gathering strength.</p><p></p><p>While the Taoist priest Wang Kuyu floating in the air seemed a bit ethereal, not as intense as Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Element Elixir floated, its brilliant radiance like the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Within the elixir, it seemed a temple deity was seated in meditation, eyes closed, not yet opened, but once opened...</p><p></p><p>It would be the moment when the thunderous power was unleashed!</p><p></p><p>Young Prince Jie Haiwei's eyes were shining, finally unhurriedly climbing from the foot of the mountain to the main platform on the peak.</p><p></p><p>Six black-armored guards protected him, shielding him within.</p><p></p><p>They were unaffected by the backlash of the collision between the Grand Master and the Divine Element Immortal's martial will and spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>These six guards had extremely powerful cultivation, their gazes sharp, their qi and blood settled.</p><p></p><p>They were an elite squad under the command of Jie Mo, not to be underestimated by anyone.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo and the others shielded the divine children like Xixia, blocking the backlash of the clash between the Grand Master and the Divine Element Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was only a collision at the level of aura, not an all-out confrontation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Grandpa Dufu, we're here to pay respects to the mountain, not to bully anyone..."</p><p></p><p>The young prince raised his hand lightly.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu glanced at the young prince, not saying much, suppressing his martial will.</p><p></p><p>He was sent by the prince to protect the young prince in entering the Golden Palace and completing this temple deity resonance event, naturally he would not cause any trouble due to his martial ambition.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu restrained his fierce martial will, the trembling and shaking mountain vegetation all returned to calm, and the surging airflow gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu was not a warlike person either, and he also dispersed the divine spirituality, the elixir returning to his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Young prince, you are truly the son of the Pacifying King, just like your father, not at all reasonable, sending a Grand Master with martial will to assault our Golden Peak, is this to harm the innocent divine children here?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>His expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the young prince Jie Haiwei, in the depths of his eyes there was barely concealed killing intent.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Huai was Jie Mo's disciple, he wanted to kill him, and this offspring of Jie Mo, his killing intent was even greater.</p><p></p><p>The young prince Jie Haiwei seemed to sense it, raising his head to look at Nan Liehuo, his youthful face bearing a maturity beyond his years.</p><p></p><p>"Just a worm struggling to survive."</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He seemed... to know some inside information.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes suddenly raged, his five fingers clenching, countless thunderbolts erupted and crackled, appearing like a spider web over the Golden Peak!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan previously did not trust Nan Liehuo, because he suspected Nan Liehuo had betrayed and joined the Corpse God Sect, but the facts proved that Nan Liehuo had not done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>As the new elder of the Golden Peak Sect's Law Enforcement Hall, Li Qingshan naturally unconditionally defended his sect master!</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>Just about to say something.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia had already jumped out with a furious expression, glaring at Jie Haiwei: "Don't you dare speak that way about my sect master!"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei's gaze shifted, suddenly falling on Xixia.</p><p></p><p>His strange purple eyes suddenly flashed with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xixia, Jie Haiwei's eyes slightly narrowed...</p><p></p><p>Because on Xixia, he saw a towering purple gas dragon, circling around her small figure.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"This little girl, in divine spiritual talent, is actually not inferior to me?"</p><p></p><p>"I have the bloodline of my father the king and mother the queen!"</p><p></p><p>"Yet this ordinary divine child of the Golden Peak, can actually reach such a level?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei's purple eyes could clearly see Xixia's divine child talent, and compared to his own, he was somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also saw the little fatty and the beautiful yet young Cloud E beside Xixia.</p><p></p><p>In Jie Haiwei's eyes, their divine spiritual talents were also extremely high, but... they were still inferior to him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Li Nuanxi?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei looked at Xixia, his purple eyes eerie, and said.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to answer you, you foul-mouthed brat, you'd better apologize to my sect master!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia suddenly furrowed her brows, hugging her suddenly trembling arms.</p><p></p><p>While also puffing out her chest and little belly.</p><p></p><p>Not showing the slightest fear of Jie Haiwei's overbearing presence.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty Zhou Peng wanted to pull Xixia back, but was a step too slow.</p><p></p><p>Cloud E also walked out, standing beside Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Whatever Xixia did, she would blindly support her.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo looked at the Xixia who had stepped out to fight for him, his expression suddenly becoming extremely gentle, his heart warm and happy.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, standing in front of Xixia.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jie Haiwei was Jie Mo's son, with many tricks, if he set his sights on Xixia, it would ultimately be a troublesome matter.</p><p></p><p>But Jie Haiwei just smiled, looking at Nan Liehuo, waving his hand: "Sect Master Nan, don't worry, I won't compete with a little girl."</p><p></p><p>"Since I've come to pay respects to the mountain, I naturally know the rules, the temple deity resonance is about to begin, I just want to test the level of the competitors I'll be facing."</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>His purple eyes flashed eerie, eager to try, staring at Xixia: "You're called Li Nuanxi, right?"</p><p></p><p>"As for apologizing to your sect master... I can also do that..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, my father has taught me since I was young, as a ruler, one must persuade with reason."</p><p></p><p>"How about this... I'll suppress my cultivation and compete with you, if you can defeat me, I'll apologize to your sect master for my previous words?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's cute eyes narrowed, still with her hands on her hips: "Daddy told me to be careful when acting outside, you can't trick me, what if I lose?"</p><p></p><p>"If you lose, then you'll be my maid."</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei stood with his hands behind his back, his purple eyes eerie and flashing in the wind and snow, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui! Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"You're just the yellow-haired brat my dad always mutters about! Ptui ptui ptui!"</p><p></p><p>However, Xixia did not accept the battle as Jie Haiwei had expected, instead repeatedly spitting, her eyes revealing a look of disgust.</p><p></p><p>"You're even more detestable than the little fatty."</p><p></p><p>The little fatty Zhou Peng: "..."</p><p></p><p>Among the divine children, Lü Qiangshang heaved a sigh of relief, inexplicably happy that Xixia didn't use him as an example this time.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you don't want to compete after all..."</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was still pressing her trembling arm, as if the gun hidden in her arm had been provoked.</p><p></p><p>"We can compete, but it has to be fair!"</p><p></p><p>"How old are you, what cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia asked in a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei's eyes flashed, the corner of his lips curling up: "Jie Haiwei, five years old, Profound Vein."</p><p></p><p>He did not hide his cultivation, openly displaying it.</p><p></p><p>On the main platform of Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>Many people couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Five years old, Profound Vein?!</p><p></p><p>Truly the disciple of the Pacifying King Jie Mo!</p><p></p><p>"As for tempering the nature, I could have forged the divine foundation, but my father told me to wait, wait until after this temple deity resonance, to obtain the inheritance of the Third Prince, and then forge the Third Prince's divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>"So for now, I'm just at the peak of tempering the nature."</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei said indifferently, seeming to smile yet not smile as he looked at Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes rolled, comparing her own and Jie Haiwei's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Exchanging blood five times, reaching the Profound Vein realm... it seems a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Daddy said, the gap is too big, it's best not to fight...</p><p></p><p>Niuiu teacher also said, the gap is too big, ambush is the main tactic.</p><p></p><p>But in the current open and public situation... it's not very good to ambush.</p><p></p><p>However, the maximum firepower state of the fireworks, can it defeat him?</p><p></p><p>Xixia remembered that Niuiu teacher said her fireworks at maximum firepower could even peel the skin off a grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>So, Xixia couldn't help but be tempted, should she give it a try? Mainly because Xixia really disliked this purple-eyed brat, how could he be so arrogant? Xixia's Emperor Grandpa wasn't even this arrogant!</p><p></p><p>The little gun in Xixia's arm also disliked this little boy! But Xixia had to be steady!</p><p></p><p>"I, Xixia, four years old, exchanged blood five times, just at the beginning of tempering the nature... how dare you bully the small with your might?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>The just blasted and bruised Zhong Liushou shamefully lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei laughed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not bullying the small with my might, I'll have Grandpa Dufu help me suppress my cultivation to the level of exchanging blood five times to fight you... is this okay?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei stared at Xixia, this girl whose divine spiritual purple aura was surging to the point of forming a dragon, her talent not inferior to his, inexplicably brought him great pressure.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that this little girl would become his biggest competitor in the temple deity resonance.</p><p></p><p>So he was eager to fight Xixia...</p><p></p><p>As long as he defeated Xixia...</p><p></p><p>His dragon divine purple eyes could absorb and devour some of the purple aura on Xixia!</p><p></p><p>His talent would rise again! The temple deity resonance... would also eliminate one formidable competitor!</p><p></p><p>This visit to pay respects to the mountain... </p><p></p><p>Was this not his true purpose?</p><p></p><p>In fact, Jie Haiwei even planned to challenge these divine children one by one, absorbing their purple aura into his own, transforming it into his purple talent.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was, only the divine children whose purple spiritual talent was roughly equivalent to his own could activate the effect of his dragon divine purple eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xixia heard Jie Haiwei's words, and was indeed a bit tempted...</p><p></p><p>At the same level of exchanging blood five times, Xixia's Emperor Grandpa feared no one...</p><p></p><p>At the same realm, Xixia still had great confidence in herself.</p><p></p><p>She blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>And Jie Haiwei had already turned to look at the Grand Master Xue Dufu beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Dufu, help me."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's expression changed slightly: "Young prince... are you really going to do this?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei's purple eyes were eerie as he stared at Xue Dufu: "What? We've come to pay respects to the mountain, we should have some sincerity, could it be... Grandpa Dufu thinks I will lose?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the overbearing aura emanating from the young prince Jie Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu understood that the young prince Jie Haiwei's mind was made up.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu did not say much, he vaguely knew the secret of the young prince Jie Haiwei's purple eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young prince, I apologize."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Xue Dufu's lone arm tapped out, landing on Jie Haiwei's body, consecutively striking several acupoints.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei's cultivation immediately sank, falling to the level of exchanging blood five times.</p><p></p><p>Jie Haiwei turned to look at Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Slowly walking to the center of the platform, slowly spreading his arms.</p><p></p><p>"Now we can fight, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

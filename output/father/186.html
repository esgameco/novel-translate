            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, the Nine Dragon River and the one dug out within the city were completely different rivers.</p><p></p><p>One was constantly turbulent, with waves constantly bursting forth, roaring ceaselessly, with surging tides and undulating waves. Even seasoned martial artists would not wish to fall into its depths.</p><p></p><p>The other, however, was extremely calm, like a docile young horse, without any temper, allowing itself to be manipulated.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in reality, both were the Nine Dragon River.</p><p></p><p>Many carriages approached the riverbank, to a specific location - a massive, jagged and ferocious cliff rock, pounded by the river water, with clear-cut edges, like a steel blade.</p><p></p><p>This huge rock was a stone from the nearest mysterious temple to the center of the river - the "Furious Three Prince of the Eight-Armed Hell Lotus".</p><p></p><p>Standing here, one could clearly feel the surging, raging and extremely turbulent divine nature.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Golden Light Mansion named this rock the "Cliff of Hearing Fury".</p><p></p><p>Standing on this massive cliff, as vast as a large platform, one could hear the furious roars of the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Causing one's liver and gall to shatter, one's spirit to break!</p><p></p><p>Hence it was called the "Cliff of Hearing Fury".</p><p></p><p>Carriage after carriage crashed through the wind and rain, the rainwater pounding on the cliff, the rushing water flowing down into the great river like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was the first to step out, parting the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>Behind him followed the elder Jiao Shao Qiu, who suppressed and sealed the Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel.</p><p></p><p>The coachman, having calmed the dragon-like horses, actually carried a large spear, silently following the elder, his muscles twitching, his vital energy surging, with a roaring aura! This coachman was actually a great master!</p><p></p><p>Silently guarding Jiao Shao Qiu.</p><p></p><p>After Nan Li Huo, there was Wang Ku Yu, as well as several other elders of the Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku Yu did not vie for Nan Li Huo's glory, although he was a Divine Element Venerable, he was very low-key, standing with Li Qing Shan, Zhu Hong Dou, Zhang Qing Zheng and Weng Wu Yu, the four elders of the Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the upper echelons of the Golden Light Sect had all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>On the side, from the Zhen Miao Mansion, the great master Zhu Chao Yang of the Dao City Supervisory Office, led by Xie Jing, stood aside, while the iron-faced Cai stood in the crowd, his arms crossed, disdainful.</p><p></p><p>From the Qin Tian Monitor, it was led by the Monitor Hu Ying Yue, with Luo Yao and Lin Xiu standing quietly to the side, Luo Yao being a Divine Element Venerable, yet not as domineering as Zhu Chao Yang, leading Tao Ren, quietly standing behind.</p><p></p><p>And from the direction of the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai Li, bringing the young prince Ji Hai Hui, also got off the carriage, standing in the front.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter! The rain roared and washed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A bell wave exploded! Zhang Qing Zheng, in a Confucian robe, walked out from the Divine Ancestor camp.</p><p></p><p>His face was sour and bitter, without any expression, cold and messy.</p><p></p><p>He chanted something in a rising and falling voice, his voice echoing in the vast divine nature, reverberating in the heavens and earth, reaching everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>After the carriages stopped, the elders one by one led their spirit children down from the carriages.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carried Xi Xi and got off the carriage, while Zhang Ya and Shang Guan Qing Hong did not get off the carriage, but held up oil-paper umbrellas, squatting on the carriage pole, looking out.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack! Lightning flashed, thunder roared! The flickering lightning seemed like blue dragons darting in the dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Guard soldiers, holding knives and spears, were deployed around, the defensive forces were full, maintaining order while also demonstrating the majesty of the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing Zheng, as an elder of the Divine Ancestor in charge of rituals, was experienced in etiquette.</p><p></p><p>A long sandalwood table was spread out in the wind and rain, arranged on the edge of the Cliff of Hearing Fury, facing the Nine Dragon River, facing the mysterious temple in the wind and rain, which was vaguely visible, suppressing the ultimate terror, as if it would tear the heavens and earth apart.</p><p></p><p>Burning incense, praying, Zhang Qing Zheng's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>As the sect master, Nan Li Huo also joined, burning an incense stick and inserting it into the incense burner.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain roared, the large raindrops fell, but could not extinguish the three sticks of incense inserted in the incense burner!</p><p></p><p>These were incense sticks made of special materials, burning not ash, but divine nature! The wispy smoke rose into the sky, gradually isolating the wind and rain around the Cliff of Hearing Fury! The raging Nine Dragon River also seemed to have calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The surging waves became calm.</p><p></p><p>As if the terrifying existence locked at the bottom of the river by invisible chains had gradually calmed down, beginning to listen to the ritual chants, settling its heart.</p><p></p><p>When all the procedures were completed.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Cliff of Hearing Fury, it was quiet.</p><p></p><p>Many people's restless voices echoed, strangely watching the mysterious power that had blocked the raging rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up, his heart also feeling very surprised.</p><p></p><p>Was this really communicating with the mysterious temple? Communicating with the temple gods of the Four Forbidden Temples? It was said that the mysterious temples needed to be conquered before normal communication could be established, just like the temple on Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>This "Furious Three Prince" mysterious temple, which had not yet been conquered, could still produce normal communication? The atmosphere was quiet, and no one spoke.</p><p></p><p>Even the great families of the Golden Light Mansion, such as the Qin family and the Hai family, were calm and composed, not daring to speak loudly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, everyone's eyes began to waver.</p><p></p><p>Because the old man who held a golden wheel in his palm moved, the old man with white hair, wearing an ancient long robe, walked out in the howling wind.</p><p></p><p>In the Mansion of the City Lord, Su Huai Li, holding the young prince Ji Hai Hui, smiled warmly and bowed slightly to Jiao Shao Qiu.</p><p></p><p>The young prince Ji Hai Hui, with his purple eyes shining like mirrors, bowed with him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhen Miao Mansion camp, Zhu Chao Yang, Xie Jing and others also gripped their swords and bowed.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Tian Monitor was the same.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, as if it was contagious, all the people who got off the carriages unconsciously clasped their fists and bowed, showing reverence and respect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xi Xi and bowed in an imitative manner.</p><p></p><p>Xi Xi then curiously looked up and whispered to Li Che, "Daddy, the little wheel is calling Xi Xi again!"</p><p></p><p>"Can Xi Xi play with it?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Xi lowered her voice, her childish voice soft and cautious.</p><p></p><p>But many of the powerful experts present, whose cultivation was not weak, could hear Xi Xi's voice as clear as thunder.</p><p></p><p>Many gazes were cast towards them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head and also lowered his voice, gently saying, "No, the little wheel has important things to do!"</p><p></p><p>Xi Xi was a little disappointed: "Oh..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this father-daughter's amusing conversation, many people couldn't help but twitch their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral elders of the great families, the virtual and real masters of the Zhen Miao Mansion and the Qin Tian Monitor, as well as the City Lord Su Huai Li and others...</p><p></p><p>They all were at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>They heard that the "wheel" the father and daughter mentioned should be the Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel that Jiao Shao Qiu held in his palm.</p><p></p><p>They just thought this father and daughter were boasting.</p><p></p><p>Although Xi Xi's talent was quite good, being a divine child of the Jia Zi generation, to be able to activate the Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Although there were vague rumors circulating on Golden Light Peak, no one took them seriously.</p><p></p><p>They just thought it was the Divine Ancestor's hype, wanting to make other participants in the temple god communion competition feel intimidated and retreat.</p><p></p><p>But Jiao Shao Qiu smiled, the corners of his mouth slightly trembling, and a strange light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yes...</p><p></p><p>This old man... is sweating profusely!</p><p></p><p>This golden wheel is really struggling! Constantly trying to break free from the seal, Jiao Shao Qiu almost used the strength he had forgotten since infancy to suppress this golden wheel.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the golden wheel would have already erupted with sparks and shot towards Xi Xi!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiao Shao Qiu couldn't wait for the temple god communion to begin.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if this girl could really gather the complete set of the Three Prince's divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>But even Jiao Shao Qiu was not too clear on what the divine weapon set of this "Furious Eight-Armed Hell Lotus Three Prince" consisted of.</p><p></p><p>The famous ones were only three, respectively the [Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear], the [Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel], and the [Inextinguishable Hell Lotus Heavenly Binding Silk]...</p><p></p><p>This information was obtained from other mysterious temples.</p><p></p><p>What other divine weapon sets there were still needed to be explored.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if this temple god communion could produce even one of the Four Forbidden Divine Weapons, it would be very good.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shao Qiu felt the struggling golden wheel, exhaled, and no longer bothered to talk, turning and stepping to the edge of the Cliff of Hearing Fury, gazing towards the temple towering in the center of the river!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he released the seal, according to the divine incantation researched by the Divine Ancestor, his powerful divine soul ignited divine light, pouring divine consciousness, gesturing the seals.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle!</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, the rings of the Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel began to spin rapidly, with sparks constantly bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, more and more, with a boom, the flames burned, soaring into the sky!</p><p></p><p>As if it had transformed into a phoenix spreading its wings! Extremely dazzling, extremely eye-catching!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying level of the Four Forbidden Divine Weapons pressed down, as if sweeping away mountains and seas, the howling wind whipped up waves on the river! Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel shot up into the sky, as if there was the sound of metal rings rubbing, ringing ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>Then, it transformed into a falling meteor of fire, continuously circling in the sky above the great river.</p><p></p><p>With a splash...</p><p></p><p>It shot towards the top of the Cliff of Hearing Fury.</p><p></p><p>Whooshing over everyone's heads, kicking up scorching and scalding winds! The roaring sound echoed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai Li's eyes narrowed, and he took a step forward, shielding the young prince Ji Hai Hui.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Zhu Chao Yang's vital energy exploded, with surging divine auras, the powerful great master's aura raging incessantly! However, the golden wheel completely ignored them.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, leaving a trail that burned the air, it appeared above Xi Xi and Li Che. Xi Xi looked up, her chubby baby face full of dimples, and a brilliant and happy smile blossomed.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, the little wheel has come to find Xi Xi!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xi Xi, a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>She really makes a big splash.</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che, was such a low-key person, how did he end up with such a high-profile daughter? The golden wheel hovered above Xi Xi, sparks constantly bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Many people around had their expressions completely changed!</p><p></p><p>The Hell Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel...</p><p></p><p>Actually made such a grand scene?</p><p></p><p>It really favors this girl so much!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this girl... is the reincarnation of the temple god?!</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, then this temple god communion would be completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"She absolutely cannot be the reincarnation of the temple god."</p><p></p><p>"The reincarnation of the temple god cannot be like this... the temperament also cannot be like this."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Shadow Guard landed beside the young prince Ji Hai Hui, whose purple dragon eyes were flickering, and said solemnly, "The first thing every reincarnation of a temple god does is... to kill their father and mother, severing all their karmic ties in the world."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard said.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hai Hui, hearing this, actually let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"As long as she is not the reincarnation, then I still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>"Father has prepared wonderful means for me, I will definitely not betray Father's trust!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hai Hui had been preparing for a long time for this temple god communion.</p><p></p><p>This scene made many people's eyes flash, and many were amazed.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shao Qiu finally finished the incantation, his divine nature bursting forth, a dazzlingly brilliant golden elixir floating out from his Nirvana Palace!</p><p></p><p>In an instant... </p><p></p><p>A pressure that almost suffocated the entire scene swept by! Even the Shadow Guard Venerable felt a sense of oppression! Divine Element Golden Body! </p><p></p><p>Although it fell back to the original divine soul, this pressure still possessed the power and might of the Golden Body Shedding! </p><p></p><p>Ding, ding, ding!</p><p></p><p>Sparks burst and scattered, as if there was a phoenix cry!</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel, under his control, shot out, towards the great river!</p><p></p><p>Splash, splash!</p><p></p><p>The river water surged and roared.</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel, like a proud sun, kept striking towards the direction of the mysterious temple, the speed getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shao Qiu's forehead was beaded with sweat, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely dangerous moment.</p><p></p><p>If someone attacked and killed him at this moment, Jiao Shao Qiu would be completely defenseless. That coachman great master, his body slightly bent down, like a hunting fierce tiger, his powerful vital energy surging like waves, his sharp eyes full of malice.</p><p></p><p>As if anyone who dared to approach at this moment, he would explode with full force to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shao Qiu's whole body trembled, and he stumbled back two steps.</p><p></p><p>Then he sat down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why did this temple god communion need the Divine Ancestor to initiate it? It was because only the Divine Ancestor mastered the secret of how to control the golden wheel.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why Ji Hai Hui previously brought Xue Du Fu to worship the mountain, not daring to be too reckless.</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel shot towards the mysterious temple, as if it was being distorted by an invisible force.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a short distance, it took a long time to fly.</p><p></p><p>Gradually...</p><p></p><p>A thick mist rose on the river surface, spreading from both sides, like the curtain on a stage, enveloping the entire river.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Within the Mysterious Pavilion, it seemed that one terrifying dark shadow after another was flashing by, with a powerful and terrifying aura that spread out a little, causing one's hair to stand on end and one's spirit to be extinguished! The Mysterious Pavilion of the Four Guardians Mysterious Temple!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone became tense! The most terrifying thing about a mysterious temple is the Mysterious Pavilion. Once the spread of the Mysterious Pavilion cannot be controlled, there will be extremely terrible dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Children, pay attention."</p><p></p><p>While everyone's mind was drawn to the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Fearful of the terrifying existence in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were murky.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and gestured.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel, which had previously swept across the path, suddenly appeared slowly.</p><p></p><p>Like a blade, it cut open a narrow, passable path in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the path, the floating, rapidly rotating, and sparking Golden Light Wheel was suspended.</p><p></p><p>This Four Guardians Divine Weapon was shaking incessantly!</p><p></p><p>Humming and buzzing as it turned!</p><p></p><p>As if it was striving to open up a path!</p><p></p><p>"Form up the troops, those who wish to participate in the Temple God Resonance, follow me..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was no different from the "Temple God Resonance" of previous years.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiao Shaochun dared not be careless, and was very solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although the world could obtain the divine law and great opportunities from the Mysterious Temple,</p><p></p><p>it would also be accompanied by danger!</p><p></p><p>And the Temple God Resonance was the least dangerous way to detect it.</p><p></p><p>But that doesn't mean there is no danger.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a commotion suddenly rang out from the Angry Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Many of the spiritual children began to feel fearful and shrink back, mainly because the Mysterious Pavilion was too terrifying. Just a glance made people feel an overwhelming sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>But the elders of the clan did not want the children to shrink back.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple God Resonance is an opportunity to change one's fate. If you have the chance to obtain the Temple God's opportunity, even if it's just a small one, it can raise the limit of your original cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>The parents all hoped their children would become dragons.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they would not allow the children to shrink back! Qin Huofire, Hai Chaosheng, Gong Yuanliang, Gongyang Xiu and other top spiritual children from the Golden Light Prefecture City were the first to step out.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy Zhou Peng, Yun'e, Zhong Liushou and other authentic spiritual children from the Qianyuan Sect also stepped out one after another.</p><p></p><p>They all had the confidence and self-assurance in their own talents.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there were also other spiritual children from other prefectures and cities rushing over...</p><p></p><p>The number was really not small.</p><p></p><p>The large platform was soon crowded with children.</p><p></p><p>Lu Che cupped his hands towards the carriage where Grandma Su was, his expression solemn and respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Su, Che is going."</p><p></p><p>Lu Che said.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su looked at Lu Che, her eyes gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Go, don't put too much burden on yourself."</p><p></p><p>Lu Che was stunned, did Grandma Su... already know something?</p><p></p><p>He pursed his lips, solemnly nodded, and walked towards the large platform.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Caizai from the Temple Guard, a spiritual child from the Divine Capital, walked towards the large platform with a disdainful attitude towards the other spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>Tang Ren was also thrown out by Lu Lao.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the children gradually gathered on the large platform, suddenly attracting everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>The large platform also suddenly became lively.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xixia: "Does Xixia want to go?"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to go, we won't go."</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xixia hugged Li Che's neck: "Daddy, don't worry, Xixia is very powerful too!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia gave a "mwah" kiss on Li Che's cheek! "Daddy, watch Xixia the Great Emperor's performance!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia broke free from Li Che's embrace and jumped down.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a red belly band, with two buns tied up, she ran excitedly towards the center of the large platform! "Xixia! Come!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gongyang Xiu saw Xixia and immediately waved excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xixia went over to them, hands on her hips, chest out, looking just like a big sister.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at his excited daughter helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Well...</p><p></p><p>This girl doesn't know what fear is.</p><p></p><p>Temple God Resonance...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, looking at the dense Mysterious Pavilion, and every Dao Fruit in his chest was trembling, warning of the terrifying threat!</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the Corpse Guardians in the Mysterious Pavilion must be extremely terrifying and powerful!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Mysterious Pavilion of this Four Guardians Mysterious Temple has not gone out of control.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Pavilion is still confined to a certain range.</p><p></p><p>If this Mysterious Pavilion becomes restless...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Prefecture City might fall into an extremely terrible danger.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Mysterious Pavilion after all?"</p><p></p><p>"And why does this Four Guardians Mysterious Temple appear here?"</p><p></p><p>Many doubts kept surging like a tide.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head slightly, Li Che no longer sensed the Mysterious Pavilion or thought about it, his gaze falling on his daughter Xixia in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, there was only his precious daughter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was</p><p></p><p>like the other parents around him,</p><p></p><p>like ordinary parents.</p><p></p><p>Eagerly waiting for the children participating in the assessment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun stood up, glancing at the bustling children behind him, who seemed to be lining up for an outing.</p><p></p><p>His expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>His ancient long robe fluttered as he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>He began to walk towards the front.</p><p></p><p>"Children, follow me."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Jiao Shaochun stepped out from the empty space of the Angry Cliff, stepping into the path opened by the Golden Light Wheel in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>A group of children wearing red belly bands followed closely.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, there was a feeling of weightlessness, and some spiritual children even screamed.</p><p></p><p>They looked down and found that they were walking in midair, with the raging river below.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying! Some spiritual children closed their eyes in fear, their legs trembling.</p><p></p><p>But after walking a short distance, they were suddenly hit by a terrifying repulsive force and were thrown out of the Mysterious Pavilion path, falling onto the cliff, stunned.</p><p></p><p>They then sat on the ground, crying sadly.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the path of the Temple God Resonance for these spiritual children had ended.</p><p></p><p>As the children continued to walk through the Mysterious Pavilion path, more and more spiritual children were repeatedly expelled.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were spiritual children with average talents, who had tried to sneak in to take a chance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Temple God had rejected them and kicked them out.</p><p></p><p>A short distance of ten meters had already determined the future heights of the children.</p><p></p><p>Cruel and realistic.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, your limit is just the starting point for others.</p><p></p><p>The world is so cruel.</p><p></p><p>Many parents sighed, resigned to taking their crying children away.</p><p></p><p>After clearing out the low and medium-level spiritual children, the remaining ones on the Mysterious Pavilion path were mostly top-tier spiritual children and prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun walked in the lead, clearing the path for the children, his hands constantly maintaining a seal. Behind him was Shi Haiwei, her purple eyes flickering, followed by Iron Caizai, the chubby boy Zhou Peng, Yun'e, and others.</p><p></p><p>Xixia followed behind Yun'e.</p><p></p><p>The big-headed Lu Che quietly stayed by Xixia's side.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng, Gong Yuanliang, Gongyang Xiu, Huang Sixiang and other top-tier spiritual children from the Sect were all walking proudly behind Xixia the Great Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual outlook of this group of children was quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Pavilion path was very long, with the river roaring below.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, the children all became silent, quietly following the old man.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Golden Light Wheel shone like a lighthouse, illuminating the path the children were taking in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Roar, roar, roar—</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Pavilion, amidst the hazy mist, there were roars that echoed constantly, as if terrifying black shadows were suddenly approaching, revealing a blurred face from the mysterious fog!</p><p></p><p>Many spiritual children were frightened and let out shrieks.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at them, don't be afraid, don't pay attention, don't mind them..."</p><p></p><p>"Look at the path ahead, look at the Golden Light Wheel..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaochun's voice drifted over.</p><p></p><p>Calming the children who were frightened by the vague monsters appearing in the Mysterious Pavilion fog.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Mysterious Temple had come to life, and one could vaguely see the moss-covered walls of the Mysterious Temple, as well as the old black tiles.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dark temple gate of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred meters away from the Mysterious Temple! Howling winds, swirling mist! Jiao Shaochun stopped, his breathing heavy and slightly panting.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Wheel kept turning.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, it seemed that one terrifying existence after another was projecting their gaze from the Mysterious Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Golden Light Wheel supporting the Mysterious Pavilion path,</p><p></p><p>the monsters in the Mysterious Pavilion might have already lost their patience and attacked.</p><p></p><p>"The Temple God Resonance... The Temple God will give you a test.

        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city.</p><p></p><p>The rain pours down like pillars, as if the heavens have seen the evil in the mortal world and thus unleash the heavy downpour to cleanse it.</p><p></p><p>In a pavilion.</p><p></p><p>A man sits quietly, dressed in black, his face covered by a cat-like mask, his body hunched over as he carves a wooden sculpture with a knife.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops shatter on the ground, their impact waves merging together, whipping up a fierce wind that blows the wood shavings sliding off the knife.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the wooden sculpture takes shape.</p><p></p><p>It is not a Buddha, nor a deity.</p><p></p><p>But a graceful and pure-looking woman, dressed in a flowing robe, holding a slender sword with a python-head hilt, her gaze turned back, a hint of heroic spirit between her brows.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the cat mask gently caress the somewhat rough carvings on the statue.</p><p></p><p>Forty years, a fleeting moment, the beauty has faded...</p><p></p><p>Humans can no longer remain young forever.</p><p></p><p>The reason he has come down the mountain without most of his divine powers is not solely for the sake of the spiritual child, but more so to catch a glimpse of a beauty from the past.</p><p></p><p>Alas, time is a sharp blade that even cultivators find hard to resist.</p><p></p><p>Unable to forge a divine foundation, he will eventually weaken and wither, the beauty fading away.</p><p></p><p>Outside the pavilion, the howling wind and torrential rain rage on.</p><p></p><p>But in the four directions around the pavilion, there are towering divine presences, distorting the sky, preventing the rain from reaching the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Four masked figures stand in the rain, surrounding the pavilion, or rather, the old man wearing the cat-like mask inside.</p><p></p><p>"Four divine foundations acting in unison, such a grand display... It seems something momentous is about to happen in the city," the old man murmurs.</p><p></p><p>He looks towards the four, their divine foundations as vast as the sun.</p><p></p><p>"The Furious True Lord, the Startled and Resolute, the Furious Amitabha, and... the Suspended Thought Flowing Sword..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family is indeed a prestigious clan. Others are now targeting your family's foundation, and you don't even try to stop them or stand guard? What are you here for, then?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckles, his eyes brimming with unconcealed disdain and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery.</p><p></p><p>The spacious courtyard is in disarray, the stone ground covered in countless sword marks.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dark clouds, lightning snakes through the sky. "Whoosh... Whoosh..."</p><p></p><p>Soaked to the bone, Sumu looks deathly pale, her trembling hands gripping the python-headed long sword.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding her areYang family cultivators wearing children's masks, their gazes icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"I've... grown old after all..."</p><p></p><p>Sumu's heart sinks.</p><p></p><p>Her vital energy can no longer sustain such intense combat.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Sumu, give up. We only want to take the spiritual child... You don't need to sacrifice your life, being a peak cultivator, you should cherish it more," the burly man in the lead says in a deep voice, carrying a heavy mace.</p><p></p><p>His voice is coarse, infused with vital energy and divine power, aiming to instill fear in Sumu's heart, so that his "Startled and Resolute" divine power can quickly erode her spirit.</p><p></p><p>There is no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there never really was.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Kaihe... Do you think just by wearing a mask, old granny Sumu won't recognize you? The entireYang family is wearing spiritual infant masks, have you all joined the Spiritual Infant Cult? How pathetic, the mighty Flying Thunder Family has become like ghosts!"</p><p></p><p>Sumu grips the python-headed sword, its blade still gleaming brightly after decades of use, radiating a bone-chilling chill.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to take my Xu Sumu's children, you'll have to step over my dead body!"</p><p></p><p>Her divine power... suddenly ignites like fire! Burning quietly in the rain.</p><p></p><p>Sumu chooses to fight to the bitter end, not retreating. At her age, what does she have left to lose?</p><p></p><p>"If you don't drink the wine, you'll have to drink the penalty."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice comes from the burly man wearing the startled child mask.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the heavy mace he holds in one hand swings up with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>His vital energy surges, the muscles on his massive frame coiling like dragons, their trembling shattering the raindrops into fine mist.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Yang Kaihe was about to swing the mace to decisively end the weakened old woman, his ear twitched! The eyes behind Yang Kaihe's mask suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A familiar explosive sound rips through the rain.</p><p></p><p>Like a bird having its tail feathers plucked, it lets out a piercing shriek! "An explosion?!"</p><p></p><p>A black wooden crow, with burning embers, its wings folded, screams like a darting arrow as it hurtles towards them.</p><p></p><p>The heavy mace swings up, striking the fast-moving black crow!</p><p></p><p>Boom! An explosion erupts!</p><p></p><p>Billowing flames instantly erupt, the powerful shockwave scattering and dispersing the falling raindrops.</p><p></p><p>The Sumu, who was about to recklessly sacrifice herself, is stunned.</p><p></p><p>Watching the fire-engulfed Yang Kaihe retreat, a hint of astonishment flashes in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She quickly turns her head, the sudden movement even causing the splashing water to spray around her.</p><p></p><p>What enters her vision is an even larger and more imposing figure than Yang Kaihe!</p><p></p><p>Dark as a mountain, and on its broad shoulders sits a little girl, her eyes fixed on the explosion, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi?"</p><p></p><p>Sumu furrows her brow.</p><p></p><p>She then looks at the face of the massive figure, only to see a cute, almost bovine-like countenance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The baby is so cute... Fuck! Ox Demon! Mu Grandma's face changed drastically, and she cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>The hand gripping the sword suddenly seemed to have lost all its strength.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>The ruthless and cruel Ox Demon who specializes in twisting children's heads!</p><p></p><p>"Xixie, run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma was somewhat desperate. Wolves in front, tigers behind... </p><p></p><p>These children, why are they so unfortunate!</p><p></p><p>As spiritual children, are they destined to become the stepping stones on others' cultivation paths?! "Grandma! Niunie has brought me to save you!"</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Grandma soon heard Xixie's excited shout as she waved her little hands, her small face flushed red, clutching the oiled paper umbrella, her eyes shining brightly, showing no signs of being captured and threatened by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>It seems... a bit different from what she had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon merely glanced at her indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Step back."</p><p></p><p>The indifferent voice carried a majestic and heavy energy.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma instinctively stepped back a few steps while holding the python-headed fine sword.</p><p></p><p>Then she saw the strange mechanism the Ox Demon was swinging in his hand, with several metal tubes aimed at the blown-up Yang Kaihe.</p><p></p><p>The metal tubes began to spin at high speed, and in the blink of an eye, it seemed to have rotated hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>"Tat tat tat tat tat tat tat..."</p><p></p><p>Brilliant tongues of fire erupted from the metal tubes, like a blooming fire lotus in the heavy rain!</p><p></p><p>Wooden black crows were ejected from the metal tubes, trailing meteor-like flames, rapidly screeching and shooting towards Yang Kaihe.</p><p></p><p>Instantly engulfing Yang Kaihe... Bursts of explosive fireworks that even the heavy rain could not extinguish.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon raised his chin, his pupils reflecting the flames, the icy killing intent being unleashed crazily.</p><p></p><p>All those who want to harm his precious daughter...</p><p>Must die! Li Che's wish was simple, he just wanted to give his daughter a clean and pure world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the impurities must be swept away by him!</p><p></p><p>Namo Gatling Wooden Crows...</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The rapidly spinning metal tubes gradually came to a stop, with blue smoke drifting from the muzzles.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma turned her head to look towards the direction of Yang Kaihe, her body drenched in sweat...</p><p></p><p>But she saw the martial artist Yang Kaihe, whose cultivation was as vast as a river, was now in a pitiful state, his clothes tattered and his skin torn open by the explosions, the mask on his face shattered, revealing a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Blood dripped from Yang Kaihe's mouth.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scene of being bombarded by the Ox Demon in the alley back then.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there were a few others to share the burden with him.</p><p></p><p>But today...</p><p></p><p>He was the only one being shelled! If not for his martial arts breakthrough, he would have been blasted to death by the first round of the mechanism! Flee! Yang Kaihe stomped his toes on the ground, wanting to create an opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, holding the strange mechanism in one hand, activated it again.</p><p></p><p>Countless explosive black crows came rushing in, trailing flames!</p><p></p><p>"No! No—!"</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The figure of Yang Kaihe, who had just managed to flee a few steps, was instantly engulfed by the flames again.</p><p></p><p>When the next round of explosions ended and the flames subsided,</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihe had become a charred corpse, emanating thick heat, completely lifeless.</p><p></p><p>"Sixty shots are not enough, then let's do sixty more..."</p><p></p><p>"I prepared six thousand shots, and still can't kill you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>However, his brows under the mask were slightly furrowed. The power of the Namo Gatling Wooden Crows indeed needed to be improved.</p><p></p><p>It took so long to blast just one Yang Kaihe, against divine cultivators, even with six thousand shots fired...it might not be enough to kill them.</p><p></p><p>The rain continued to fall, and the entire Shen Modification Institute was quiet.</p><p></p><p>The remaining few Shen cultivators from the Yang family were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that their most talented disciple closest to the divine realm would be blasted to death like this.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon didn't even need to act personally.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, these powerful Yang family members all had their hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>They frantically fled towards the outside of the Xu family's Shen Modification Institute...</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced over, but he was not polite either, unleashing a barrage, with wooden crows screeching and trailing flames rushing out.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by bursting red firecrackers throughout the courtyard! These Yang family experts all followed Yang Kaihe into the afterlife, dying in the art of explosions.</p><p></p><p>Xixie sat on the Ox Demon's shoulders...</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed to the point of death.</p><p></p><p>This rain of fireworks was so dazzling!</p><p></p><p>It left a deep imprint on her young mind!</p><p></p><p>"Fireworks... I also want to play with fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>Fireworks and Xixie... a perfect match! Completely annihilating the Yang family experts.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon meticulously searched all the corpses, and apart from obtaining a Qiankun Jade from Yang Kaihe, the others only had a dozen or so leaves.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the looting, he finally walked out of the dumbfounded Shen Modification Institute.</p><p></p><p>Bringing Xixie with him.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma finally regained her senses, leaning on the python-headed wooden cane, her thin body soaked by the rain, chasing after them...</p><p></p><p>"Ox... Great hero, where are you taking Xixie?"</p><p></p><p>In the rain.</p><p></p><p>The towering Ox Demon paused, helping to straighten the crooked oiled paper umbrella in Xixie's hand.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued to stride forward.</p><p></p><p>Only then did a muffled voice carrying ruthless killing intent, overriding the howling wind and rain, reach Mu Grandma's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Going to the Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"To set off fireworks."</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, please vote for monthly tickets, please vote for recommendation tickets to support me!

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderbolt tore through the night sky, the flickering lights like a cerulean divine dragon rolling behind the dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain poured down, cleansing the mortal realm and the bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Splendor Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the private room, the fragrance of sandalwood lingered, and the graceful figure of the courtesan danced to the accompaniment of the strings and bamboo, her every expression and smile exuding beauty.</p><p></p><p>The rich aroma of wine permeated the air without end.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu gulped down one cup of wine after another, the liquid trailing down the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>His chest heaved violently, his eyes slightly reddening.</p><p></p><p>By his side, Xu Heli drank his wine and ate his meat elegantly, the precious sword he wore at his side resting quietly.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fixed on the courtesan's alluring waist, wandering over the exposed jade-like skin.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother... did we really let the Shenxiu Temple be taken away like that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu slammed the wine cup onto the table with a "bang", his eyes filled with discontent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's mood was disrupted, and he couldn't help but give him a sidelong glance. "It's just sending away Li Che's daughter and that big-headed spirit child. They are not part of our Xu family, so it doesn't matter if they are sent away..."</p><p></p><p>"But this matter is being handled by the Yang family. They definitely won't just take those two spirit children... and... just letting them barge in and kill, Aunt Su... won't give up on these children, she'll... surely die, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's voice was hoarse and low.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Su..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Back when we were still spirit children, it was Aunt Su who watched over us, taught us to cultivate our nature..." Xu Beihu poured himself another drink.</p><p></p><p>"This is the decision made by the patriarch, and we should just follow it... Besides, the loss of spirit children can be replaced, but for us, the opportunity only comes once."</p><p></p><p>"You should know how difficult it is for me to forge the divine foundation, and how low the success rate is... I have no other choice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's expression gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu also understood this, and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli sneered, "You don't have to be a good person here. The patriarch made the decision, and you were there at the time. If you're not satisfied, why didn't you raise it then?"</p><p></p><p>"If you have the guts, go talk to the patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a pity about Aunt Su..."</p><p></p><p>"But she's already old, and she's creating opportunities for us younger generation to forge the divine foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"She'll be happy about it too!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi led Xixia and the many bewildered children of the Shenxiu Temple, rushing deeper into the temple's residence.</p><p></p><p>But the increasingly terrifying divine energy outside made a trace of worry appear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Su... can she withstand these Yang family's divine cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were many divine cultivators whose cultivation was as strong as a river, and even some whose martial dao cultivation had reached the peak, on par with Simubai.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Su was old, her vital energy declining, and although her divine cultivation was profound, she ultimately could not match the peak divine cultivators due to the deterioration of her physical body. Overall, she was weaker than cultivators like Simubai at the peak.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lü Qi could guess that Aunt Su, by staying behind to delay their escape, was actually choosing death.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi was not stupid. As someone from the Divine Sect, he understood the situation better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family is no different from most aristocratic families. This is also the downside of the current era. The Great Prosperity Dynasty has given these aristocratic families increasingly solid power, but these families have become inflated, becoming indifferent to human life..."</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of interests, for the pursuit of power, they will sacrifice everything..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>But he did not turn back to help Aunt Su, even though she was an old friend of his master.</p><p></p><p>However, his primary task now was to protect his unmarried junior sister.</p><p></p><p>The safety of his junior sister... that is the priority!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lü Qi sensed a faint divine energy fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he saw a white divine chess piece shooting out from Xixia's body.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Lü Qi felt the area around him being shrouded in darkness!</p><p></p><p>Massive, majestic, domineering, powerful...</p><p></p><p>To the children, this terrifying figure was like a towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>Over two meters tall, with bulging muscles, every large tendon trembling like a fierce dragon. The surging vital energy alone was enough to make one feel suffocated.</p><p></p><p>Under the cute ox-faced mask was a pair of eyes exuding ferocity and boundless killing intent!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Che... Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Qi naturally would not forget this mask and this massive figure.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly stopped in his tracks, his eyes revealing a look of joy.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew the true identity of the Ox Demon! That was Xixia's father!</p><p></p><p>And his strength was extremely powerful. Even Lü Qi, without using the "Wrath of the Third Prince", would likely have his head twisted off.</p><p></p><p>Why would the Ox Demon appear here?</p><p></p><p>Divine secret technique? It doesn't matter anymore!</p><p></p><p>All of this no longer mattered, for the Ox Demon was a great calamity, killing without blinking.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>You all! With the Ox Demon here, Xixis safety is guaranteed! Li Che's sudden appearance startled all the children present, especially the children from the Xu family, who stared blankly at Li Che wearing the Ox Demon mask.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but recall their family's descriptions of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>This was a notorious criminal who dared to kill even government officials and divine guards, rumored to kill without blinking and enjoy twisting off children's heads to use as footballs! At night, their parents would use the Ox Demon to scare them, saying he would come and twist off their heads if they didn't sleep.</p><p></p><p>Fear quickly spread, and the Xu children all collapsed to the ground, wailing and crying, with some even urinating while crying.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>How could they be afraid of me, the Ox Demon, wearing such a cute and adorable ox mask? I don't even eat children! Xixis eyes, however, were shining with excitement as she stared at the Ox Demon, not a trace of fear in them. Seeing that Xixi was safe, Li Che felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Glancing over at Lu Chi, he nodded slightly. With Lu Chi's protection, he could rest easier.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox! You're the great hero Ox Ox that Mother spoke of!" Xixi clenched her little fists, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"I finally get to see you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>His eyes softened with tenderness, and a smile tugged at the corners of his masked lips.</p><p></p><p>He knew that while the Ox Demon's evil reputation was spreading throughout Feilei City, his wife Zhang Ya had been constantly telling Xixi that the Ox Demon was a great hero.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhang Ya knew the Ox Demon's true identity.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't want Xixi to think her father was a villain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhang Ya also knew that the Ox Demon was a hero!</p><p></p><p>Protecting their little family, safe and sound...</p><p></p><p>A great hero indeed! "Ox Ox, there are monsters and bad guys outside bullying Grandma! Can you take me to go beat up the monsters and bad guys?"</p><p></p><p>The lively Xixi stood before Li Che, who had activated the [Dragon Elephant Golden Warrior] Dao fruit "Angry Golden Warrior", his towering figure reaching two meters, as sturdy as a mountain, his aura like a battle armor.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at him, it was as if she was gazing up at a towering peak.</p><p></p><p>But she held no fear or terror.</p><p></p><p>The Xu children around them thought Xixis was simply insane.</p><p></p><p>"Xixi, run! He's the Ox Demon monster, the Ox Demon who twists off children's heads to use as footballs!"</p><p></p><p>A young Xu family disciple who had a soft spot for Xixi, trembling and urinating in his pants, mustered the courage to call out to the fearless Xixi standing before the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>His voice shook, but his bravery was admirable.</p><p></p><p>The flushed young boy felt... perhaps this was the power of love!</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The cold gaze from behind the mask swept over the young boy.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have caught a whiff of the sour scent of unrequited love...</p><p></p><p>Just a single glance was enough.</p><p></p><p>The brave young boy immediately collapsed, wailing and crying until he lost consciousness from sheer terror.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't be bothered with him.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at Xixi.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid of me?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi pursed her lips: "Mother said Ox Ox is a great hero! Mother wouldn't lie to Xixi!"</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon smiled: "Good..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you to rescue Grandma."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon said gently.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his large hand, like a fan, descended and gently grasped Xixi, placing her on his broad shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was unafraid, her little mouth curving into a giggling smile.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Chi was not as at ease, his expression deeply grave.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Third Prince's wooden sculpture, gripping it tightly in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Yangs had many powerful experts; how could a single Ox Demon change the tide of battle?</p><p></p><p>There were several cultivators at the peak of their prime...</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>How troublesome.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the need to rescue his master's old lover, he would have simply turned and left.</p><p></p><p>His childhood had just begun, and he had no desire to die.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go! Ox Ox will take Xixi to rescue Grandma!"</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the Ox Demon's shoulder, Xixi cheered excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's fingers sliced through the air, and the next moment, a small oiled paper umbrella fell into his hand, which he handed to Xixi.</p><p></p><p>"It's raining outside, hold the umbrella to avoid catching a cold."</p><p></p><p>Xixi obediently took the umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Ox Ox... so gentle!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Ox Demon grasped at the empty air.</p><p></p><p>The exquisitely crafted mechanism "Namo Gatling Wooden Raven" fell into his hand, the divine energy spreading as he controlled one wooden raven after another, which began to swirl around the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the Namo Gatling, with Xixi on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The large and small figures, surrounded by the flock of ravens.</p><p></p><p>Striding towards the divine cultivation monastery.</p><p></p><p>PS: Good news, I've confirmed the next three chapters, so let him know the real deal has arrived.

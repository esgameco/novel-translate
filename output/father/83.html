        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The winter thunder boomed, and the rain was mixed with icy snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Under the high walls and black tiles, in the courtyard, an elderly man in black robes sat upright on a high-backed armchair, his face slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>Below him, Xu Heli, Xu Beihu, and the family patriarch Xu Nanming sat quietly. The core members of the Xu family were mostly present.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Jing was injured by the suspected Saint Sect's powerful cultivator, and then suffered the tragedy of his entire family being wiped out. This has greatly disturbed his [Heart Shocked and Enraged] divine foundation, leading him to descend into madness..."</p><p></p><p>"When the Young Sect Master was chatting with Yang Jing, I was also there... The Young Sect Master guessed that the rampaging 'Ox Demon' who has caused so much chaos in Flying Thunder City is most likely Li Che!"</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Xu family spoke with a hint of laziness, coughing lightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli and Xu Beihu had already suspected as much, their expressions not changing much, but the family patriarch Xu Nanming was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che? Is he really the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming found it hard to believe, as he still had Li Che's information on his desk. A clean-cut, upright young man, a native of Flying Thunder City, who had lost his parents since childhood and was raised by his uncle. In his teens, he seized the opportunity to join the Xu Family's woodcarving workshop as a laborer...</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, he successfully passed the woodcarving master's examination and became a Xu Family woodcarving master, beginning to cultivate martial arts...</p><p></p><p>"In just three short years, he grew from a humble laborer to the ruthless 'Ox Demon' who wiped out the Yang Family's experts?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming's mind was in a whirl.</p><p></p><p>"It's highly likely... everything is too coincidental. Ever since the Lingying Sect wanted to move that 'Li Nuanxi', their experts have been dying one by one, all at the hands of the Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if Li Che is not the Ox Demon, Li Nuanxi is still closely related to the Ox Demon."</p><p></p><p>"To arrest, or even eliminate the Ox Demon, Li Nuanxi is the key."</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Xu family began to cough violently, his face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master is truly powerful. Even without divine nature, he can rival divine foundations through sheer physical prowess, and even suppress divine foundations..."</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Sect Master Cao Qingsuan has taken people to Li Che's residence."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we confirm that Li Che is the Ox Demon... we will sell all the people in his courtyard, to distance ourselves from the matter."</p><p></p><p>"Cao Qingsuan can arrest whoever he wants, and we won't interfere. It's not our concern."</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Jing is incapacitated, the old ghost of the Si Family is dead, the divine foundation members who were to share the benefits of the 'Thousand Buddha Feast' have been reduced by two... Only I and the old man from the An Family remain. The two of us... are enough to reap all the benefits."</p><p></p><p>"At this critical juncture, we must not give the Sect Master's府any excuse, or else all our previous efforts will be in vain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's gaze flickered as he respectfully asked, "And what about the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, that Ox Demon... is doomed."</p><p></p><p>"Yang Jing is now like a rabid dog, biting whoever he encounters. We divine foundation members will naturally not approach him easily..."</p><p></p><p>"But since he has fought the Ox Demon, the area has been sealed off. The Ox Demon won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"He has ruined so many of the Sect Master's plans..."</p><p></p><p>"Someone has already decided that this Ox Demon must not be allowed to live any longer."</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Xu family looked at the swirling rain and snow.</p><p></p><p>"Today, the Ox Demon must die."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally knew the power and troublesomeness of divine foundation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He had never underestimated divine foundation cultivators, even though he harbored the heart to challenge them. But he would not choose to die in vain.</p><p></p><p>He had already prepared an ambush in a narrow alley, arranging all the traps and hidden weapons he had mastered so far, forming a battlefield of his own! His [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao fruit had reached Level 3 and was highly mature.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the Thousand Swords technique, Li Che's mastery of traps and hidden weapons had reached the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this trap layout was prepared for the divine foundation cultivators of the Lingying Sect, but unexpectedly, the old patriarch of the Yang Family came to scout the area himself, so Li Che would not be polite.</p><p></p><p>He took out the "Namo Gatling Gun" to send the old man to see the Buddha! Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat...</p><p></p><p>Tongues of fire spewed forth!</p><p></p><p>Six metal barrels rotated at high speed, spitting out flames like a magnificent fiery lotus blooming in the Ox Demon's palm!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the wooden crows were ignited, releasing piercing shrieks as they hurtled towards the massive flesh mountain ensnared by thousands of spider silk threads!</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing had a divine foundation millstone floating behind him, his eyes glowing scarlet, his [Heart Shocked and Enraged] divine nature constantly surging and spreading.</p><p></p><p>Like crashing waves, the first batch of wooden crows were shattered by his powerful divine nature before they could even reach him, the explosion of fire and shockwaves sweeping through the area.</p><p></p><p>But there were too many...</p><p></p><p>There were too, too many wooden crows.</p><p></p><p>To show proper respect to the divine foundation cultivator, Li Che unleashed all six thousand without holding back, the acrid smoke filling the alley.</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Yang Family was instantly engulfed in the sparks, the exploding fireworks igniting flames that even the rain and snow could not extinguish! It was as if a mushroom cloud had risen from the ground, the tremors and shockwaves shattering countless raindrops, and the thick black smoke billowing up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>After the last wooden crow was fired.</p><p></p><p>The metal barrels of the "Namo Gatling Gun" in the Ox Demon's hand had turned bright red, like glowing hot branding irons, slowly grinding to a halt, hissing and steaming.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the Namo Gatling Gun, and the Ox Demon's eyes behind the mask calmly observed the massive flesh mountain figure in the distance at the end of the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... six thousand rounds were not enough."</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, at the root of it all,</p><p></p><p>The explosive power of the wooden crows was simply not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Although the quantity had increased, the quality was lacking, and the damage was ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>But the effect was not entirely without result.</p><p></p><p>The winter thunder rumbled and rolled, electric snakes slithering.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a violent gale had swept through, carrying away the smoke and dust, revealing the flesh-torn, charred figure of the massive flesh mountain.</p><p></p><p>Drip... drip...</p><p></p><p>The blood dripped onto the ground, making a shattering sound.</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing's gray hair was disheveled, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"I'm... so surprised!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm so shocked—ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing suddenly threw his head back, his face covered in madness despite the flesh and blood being torn apart, the divine foundation millstone behind him glowing brighter, the falling divine nature forming a veil around him.</p><p></p><p>It was this divine nature veil that had blocked the onslaught of six thousand wooden crows.</p><p></p><p>But the injuries were still severe, with his flesh and organs visibly damaged, even his spine exposed.</p><p></p><p>This injury only further fueled Yang Jing's rage and madness. A divine foundation cultivator, actually being pushed to such a state by a mere cultivator! The intense [Heart Shocked and Enraged] divine nature surged from his divine foundation like raging rivers, filling the entire alley!</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing planned to use pure "Rank" to oppress and completely crush the Ox Demon before him... Divine foundation against cultivation, the most effective and most tyrannical method! Rank suppression!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had chosen this alley and prepared the trap early... but for Yang Jing, this was also his own... battlefield! Within this alley, the suppression of divine nature Rank would be inescapable, forcing the Ox Demon to face it head-on. Cultivation facing the divine.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yang Jingchang let out a furious roar, covered in fresh blood. The flesh mountain, blasted by six thousand wooden crows, began to move and run! The thousands of spider silk threads were all broken!</p><p></p><p>It was like a terrifying flesh mountain, collapsing and rolling towards him!</p><p></p><p>The earth shook, accompanied by a terrifying divine power, endless shrieks and screams, almost bursting one's eardrums! In Yang Jing's eyes, the Ox Demon was indeed fixed in place, unable to move under the suppression of the divine foundation realm...He only needed to walk over and twist off the Ox Demon's head, and he could avenge his entire family!</p><p></p><p>Winter thunder and snow fell from the sky, but before they could land on the flesh mountain, they were evaporated and distorted into billowing hot air.</p><p></p><p>The bloodshot eyes of the flesh mountain had a crazy, sinister smile! However, the next moment...</p><p></p><p>His sinister smile froze.</p><p></p><p>Because, under the divine power pressure he had just unleashed...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... </p><p></p><p>Seemed to not feel the realm pressure at all, and blasphemously raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>A fine iron great bow appeared in his hand, he drew the bow and pulled the string...</p><p></p><p>In an instant! Wailing ghost cries echoed through the alleys! The divine power [Angry Wail Subduing Ghosts]! But this was not the main reason to stimulate Yang Jing.</p><p></p><p>The main reason came from the Ox Demon, as a brilliant golden light suddenly burst forth, as if he had put on a golden robe, like an angry Buddha roaring! The divine power [Wrathful Amitabha]! The Golden Robe of Amitabha!</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>Two divine powers! And both at the "Cultivating Nature Like a River" realm?!</p><p></p><p>What the hell?! The flesh mountain Yang Jing's hair stood on end, shocked and terrified, as if his originally chaotic and frenzied will had been awakened by this unbelievable scene! "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"He has cultivated two divine powers to the 'Cultivating Nature Like a River' realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The flesh mountain Yang Jing let out a muffled roar from his mouth!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the influence of the [Heart Startled and Firm] divine power, or the shock of his own emotions.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon drew the bow to its full, and on the arrow infused with divine power, the wind and thunder intertwined...</p><p></p><p>This was the divine power martial art of the Si family, the Angry Wail Hundred Ghosts Wind Thunder Arrow!</p><p></p><p>With the Golden Robe of Amitabha, in an instant, the explosive force gained a boost, and under the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine power, the power gushed out from the dragon-like sinews and bones on his back!</p><p></p><p>Creak creak...</p><p></p><p>The long bow was almost about to be torn apart!</p><p></p><p>At the tip of the Angry Wail Hundred Ghosts Wind Thunder Arrow, a teardrop-shaped wooden carving was bound with divine power, made of "Flesh Blood Red" spiritual wood, ranked seventh in the "Tang Family Mechanism Records". Two divine powers intertwined, combined with the seventh-ranked mechanism! This was Li Che's... full power unleashed!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to shake the foundation of the divine foundation realm! Like a hook with five fingers, he suddenly let go! In an instant, the bowstring vibrated, accompanied by countless wailing ghosts and the sound of wind and thunder! An arrow pierced through the rain and snow, smoothly cutting through the air, causing ripples, the wind and thunder intertwined, like breaking through an air barrier!</p><p></p><p>"Useless, the divine powers at the 'Cultivating Nature Like a River' realm... can't possibly break through my divine foundation realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible... Ah?!"</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Angry Wail Hundred Ghosts Wind Thunder Arrow hit the divine power robe hanging outside the flesh mountain, but...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, while the wind and thunder arrow failed to break through the divine power robe, the teardrop-shaped blood-colored tear bead attached to the arrow head...</p><p></p><p>Smoothly pierced through the divine foundation cultivator's divine power robe.</p><p></p><p>Poof...</p><p></p><p>Penetrating the flesh mountain's thick fat and flesh, entering its body! That terrifying penetrating power! Even Li Che himself was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Such penetration..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes under the Ox Demon mask became brighter and brighter! But the penetration was just a side effect of the "Bodhi Tear of Blood", this seventh-ranked mechanism in the Tang Family Records... The truly terrifying part was the explosion! Boom—! A muffled sound! Suddenly bursting from the body of the flesh mountain Yang Jing, the Bodhi Tear of Blood bloomed into thousands and thousands of extremely fine needles, each needle like having a life of its own, curling up like shrimp, stirring up a mass of flesh and blood! The next moment, Li Che saw that the body of this divine foundation cultivator Yang Jing had been pierced with hundreds of blood holes, and from each blood hole, there were large blood pearls, uncontrollably rolling out! Drip drip...</p><p></p><p>Like blood-colored, broken-string tears! In an instant, it seemed to have drawn out all the blood in Yang Jing's body.</p><p></p><p>A person, even if a Profound Vein martial artist, if drained of blood...</p><p></p><p>Would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Dizziness, loss of strength, consciousness blurred...</p><p></p><p>Thud...</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then raised the long bow again, drew the bow, and shot continuously! Angry Wail Hundred Ghosts Wind Thunder Arrows! Arrow after arrow, all aimed at Yang Jing's massive head.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The huge head, under the bombardment of wind and thunder,</p><p></p><p>Exploded!</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation millstone floating behind the flesh mountain...</p><p></p><p>Crack crack...</p><p></p><p>Covered in cracks.</p><p></p><p>Shattered into pieces!</p><p></p><p>Most of it dissipated back into the heavens and earth, leaving only a divine foundation shard, falling into the dense blood water.</p><p></p><p>After firing several more stable and cautious shots at the corpse,</p><p></p><p>The burly Ox Demon figure slowly walked over.</p><p></p><p>Without any courtesy, he put away the divine foundation shard.</p><p></p><p>Then continued to flip the body...</p><p></p><p>To harvest the fruits of his efforts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Holding a "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Infant Statue" that was extremely similar to the mysterious temple's spiritual infant deity, City Lord Cao Guang was slowly and carefully devouring the divine power within the statue.</p><p></p><p>His brow... seemed to have a black gas flow gathering, sometimes swelling, sometimes subsiding.</p><p></p><p>As if something was about to break out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>City Lord Cao Guang abruptly opened his eyes, carefully placing the imitation temple deity's three-eyed spiritual infant statue down, then flashed and appeared on the black-tiled roof peak of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The rain and snow twisted and avoided above his head.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered constantly, sensing the sealed divine power in the alleys, the shock like thick ink surging from his pupils.</p><p></p><p>"How come the aura of the Yang family's divine foundation has disappeared so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Gone?!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Family Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow were swirling.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan carried a saber, followed by Divine Constable Independent Sprout Zhang Xiangyang and several black prison guards, forming a queue, crossing the alleys and arriving at Li Che's inner city courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard gate was tightly closed, but the lively laughter of children playing could be heard from inside.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan paused, seemingly not expecting Li Che's home to be so peaceful and harmonious.</p><p></p><p>This... was a bit different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>His brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan raised his hand and knocked on the gate.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>With a creaking sound,</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in a clean and tidy black outfit, opened the door with a gracious and amiable manner.</p><p></p><p>Please support the first order!

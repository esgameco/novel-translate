        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The piercing scream tore through the tranquility, and the raindrops falling in the courtyard shattered one by one, forming a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house.</p><p></p><p>The heat was circulating, the blood and qi like a furnace, steaming with a cold aura.</p><p></p><p>In the incense burner, the twisted column of smoke rose straight into the clouds, only to be torn apart by the wind above.</p><p></p><p>The three wooden sculptures were stained with blood, as if they had been soaked in a pool of blood and emerged, the dense bloody stench intertwining and spreading, making the wooden sculptures seem to come alive, uttering heart-rending screams and roars.</p><p></p><p>The three sacrifices, five livestock, and eight big bowls, the blood seemed to have been completely drained.</p><p></p><p>This scene was indeed a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, his brow center opening and closing, the divine nature of [Furious Amitabha], like a raging river, surging out and filling the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Woven by the invisible force, constantly collapsing and accumulating.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a stream of water gurgling around Li Che, slowly as if about to submerge his breath, completely suffocating him.</p><p></p><p>Every inch of his skin seemed to be soaked by the divine river, Li Che's five senses suddenly soared to the extreme, clearly sensing the divine nature seeping through the pores of his skin, entering his body, every tendon and bone, every bit of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Then, the divine nature seemed to open its bloody maw and devour the flesh and blood! Inhale—</p><p></p><p>Exhale—</p><p></p><p>With a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt that his physical body had become extremely hot, the divine nature seemed to have turned into countless molten iron, stimulating his flesh and blood, as if it wanted to completely burn him!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly... This was not an illusion! The divine nature... was really devouring his flesh and blood, burning his body! Burning with rage!</p><p></p><p>Burning the tendons and tempering the bones!</p><p></p><p>Countless divine natures, like bone necrosis, drilled into the tempered python tendons and tiger bones, Li Che's brow furrowed, following the obtained methods, operating the [Eight Extremes Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Divine Foundation Technique], guiding the many divine natures to return to the inner landscape.</p><p></p><p>But the divine natures that had just returned to the Nirvana inner landscape would go crazy and rush out along the divine river, so Li Che had to continue to guide them.</p><p></p><p>This process, however, was extremely demanding on the physical body. If he could not withstand the scorching and invasion of the divine nature, the entire physical body would be controlled by the divine nature and eventually become a divine puppet! Li Che was a little surprised, no wonder Li Qingshan said that to forge the divine foundation, one must have at least the cultivation level of the Mysterious Vein, and the physical body tempered to the Mysterious Vein level, in order to have a high probability of withstanding the repeated onslaught of the divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Forging the divine foundation is indeed very dangerous... If it fails, even if he regains control of the physical body, his vital energy will be greatly damaged, and the divine nature will be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I feel... a bit like swallowing more than ten martial pills, and having the medicinal effects of the pills activated all at once, that kind of tempering feeling."</p><p></p><p>The first time he swallowed the Python Blood Martial Pill, the explosive power from within, igniting the blood and qi, was very similar to this moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are still differences.</p><p></p><p>After all, one is divine nature, the other is medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>Time passed imperceptibly, the divine nature eroding the flesh and blood, while the internal qi in the physical body surged, contending with the divine nature, like two fierce beasts, fighting for control within Li Che.</p><p></p><p>This process of the divine nature and internal qi colliding and canceling each other out was also the process of tempering the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Hum—! The combined power of the two, flowing through the boiling blood, circulating along the Small Heavenly Circuit, washing the fragile meridians over and over again.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Li Che felt a kind of pain like being skinned and tendons being pulled, and sweat beaded on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his heart, a sense of inexplicable anger seemed to be born!</p><p></p><p>Anger erupted from every inch of his flesh and blood, like a volcano that had accumulated to the extreme, rushing towards his mind!</p><p></p><p>As if wanting to drill into his brain nerves!</p><p></p><p>The divine nature... wants to enter the brain!</p><p></p><p>Wants to drill into his mind! This won't do!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart skipped a beat, the brain... that is the most precise and mysterious part of the human body! Once damaged, it would be too late to regret!</p><p></p><p>According to the description of the divine foundation technique, this should be the final hurdle!</p><p></p><p>As long as he can withstand it, the divine nature will become docile and condense into the divine foundation wheel.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly mobilized the qi in his dantian, gathering it at the Baihui acupoint in his brain, blocking the divine nature's charge! Boom—! One collision, like the thundering of heaven and earth, the great bell directly collided with his ears in a surprising way!</p><p></p><p>Dizzy and dazzled, stars flashing before his eyes! As soon as Li Che had just adjusted, the Furious Amitabha divine nature gathered another force, like a howling angry dog, and attacked again.</p><p></p><p>This collision was even more deafening, like the spring thunder of the heavens bursting in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's whole body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature like a river gathered again and launched the third attack!</p><p></p><p>Just like a waterfall rushing up three thousand feet, the great river hanging upside down!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The countless internal qi and divine nature collisions had a feeling of the heavens and earth collapsing.</p><p></p><p>His head was buzzing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have passed in an instant, yet it also seemed extremely long.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly opened his eyes, his entire body flushed red, gradually calming down, the large veins on his back trembling like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>In the Nirvana inner landscape, the divine nature returned to calm, the original [Furious Amitabha] river-like divine nature disappeared without a trace, replaced by a circular platform.</p><p></p><p>Evenly thick, like a flattened cylinder, purely condensed from divine nature.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature emanating from it was far more powerful than the original [Furious Amitabha] divine nature.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of divine nature was equivalent to the previous ten or even hundreds of wisps!</p><p></p><p>In the inner landscape, [Howling Hundred Ghosts] and [Startled Heart Firm and Strong], the two divine natures, were both suppressed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>[Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Divine Foundation]</p><p></p><p>Top-grade of the Eight Extremes! </p><p></p><p>Metamorphosis in position!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a breath, the airflow surging like a sharp blade, cutting through the air.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the divine foundation wheel, like a millstone, appeared behind his head, no matter how he moved, it would remain behind his head.</p><p></p><p>The wrathful divine natures in the world, like mosquitoes attracted to a light source, flocked and continuously fused into the divine foundation wheel, strengthening it.</p><p></p><p>"The divine foundation wheel has been successfully forged, it can be considered to have stepped into the initial stage of the divine foundation, but we cannot be careless, according to the description of the divine foundation technique, the newly forged divine foundation has the possibility of disintegration, the higher the position of the divine foundation, the easier it is for the divine foundation master to be counterattacked, so it still needs time to stabilize the divine foundation wheel..."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Ten Extremes divine foundation wheels take about ten days to stabilize, the Nine Luminaries require thirty days, and the Eight Extremes divine foundation wheel requires a hundred days to stabilize the wheel!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled slightly upward.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, his gaze slightly glowing, like a mirror washed clean of all dust, reflecting the flowing light of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised to find that his five senses had become even more sensitive, as if they could be manipulated, the perception could be extended, extended to the extreme, reaching a distance of ten meters! "Is this the 'divine sense' that the divine foundation cultivators speak of? Because of the impact of the divine nature on the Baihui acupoint in the brain?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che happily manipulated the divine sense, trying it out, like a child who had just obtained a new toy.</p><p></p><p>This was different from his use of the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit's heavenly chessboard perception.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly chessboard, that was a kind of overlooking perspective to observe everything.</p><p></p><p>It only required the consumption of divine nature to peek.</p><p></p><p>While the divine sense did not require the consumption of divine nature, but rather a refinement and transformation of the five senses and six consciousnesses, like an extension of the physical organs.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation realm, compared to cultivating nature, is indeed a great transformation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's ears caught an extremely faint sound of cracking.</p><p></p><p>The three spirit baby wooden sculptures that had absorbed the blood of the three sacrifices and five livestock, under the dried blood on the surface, began to crack, and then crumbled.</p><p></p><p>Three streams of divine nature gushed out from them, merging into Li Che's divine foundation wheel.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed them for a while, and was surprised.</p><p></p><p>They were actually three techniques.</p><p></p><p>One was a divine nature secret technique, one was a divine nature martial art...</p><p></p><p>And one was a method for advancing the divine foundation!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fei Lei City, Inner City.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the divine foundation, Li Che returned to his study room with the divine nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, Li Che couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>In three years, from just cultivating nature to forging the divine foundation... this speed, he reckoned that in Fei Lei City, or even in the entire Jin Guang Prefecture, there might not be many who could match him. Furthermore, he closed his eyes, his mind connecting to his own divine foundation wheel, and words seemed to float on it.</p><p></p><p>These were the techniques obtained from the three broken spirit wooden sculptures.</p><p></p><p>It was as if after breaking through the divine foundation using the sacrificial method, he had also obtained the corresponding techniques.</p><p></p><p>Divine nature secret technique [Furious True Lord Killing Gaze], divine nature martial art [Furious True Lord Three Blade Sword]! The three sculptures gave him three techniques! And there was one more, the method for forging the divine foundation together, which he had already known from the analysis of the Thousand Slivers.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the divine nature secret technique and divine nature martial art were both lower grade of the Eight Extremes, which really made Li Che extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the higher the position, the more difficult the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for the divine nature secret technique, Li Che was indeed a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>However, for the divine nature martial art, with the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao fruit, Li Che would only feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Smiling, he withdrew his divine sense from the divine foundation wheel.</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Unsullied Heart (LV2, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the information displayed in the flowing light.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a great mood, forging the [Three-Eyed Furious True Lord] divine foundation had directly caused a huge surge in the maturity of the Unsullied Heart Dao fruit, even directly breaking through the obstruction, reaching LV2 level.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... in addition to slowly accumulating the divine nature of the Unsullied Heart, forging the divine foundation is also a way to quickly improve the maturity of the Dao fruit. If I forge a few more divine foundations, I should be able to mature the Unsullied Heart Dao fruit to LV3, and obtain the embryonic form of the divine power, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm really curious what the divine power embryonic form of the 'Unsullied Heart' will be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was a bit itchy.</p><p></p><p>And with the [Unsullied Heart] Dao fruit reaching LV2 level, Li Che's mind moved, and he could actually completely conceal the aura of the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>The [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao fruit could conceal the blood and qi, the [Unsullied Heart] could conceal the divine nature, the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit could investigate the terrain and situation, the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit could make hidden weapons...</p><p></p><p>Wow! As Li Che summarized it, he felt that he was going further and further down the path of the old fox.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the temperature plummeted and snow began to fall from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The soundly sleeping Xixia suddenly caught the aroma of delicious chicken legs, causing her to instinctively open her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She found herself in the woodshed.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure, wearing an adorable cow-faced mask, was holding a chicken leg and swaying in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was overjoyed, staring at the chicken leg: "Cow Monk! Xixia has missed you so much!"</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon: "..."</p><p></p><p>He handed the chicken leg to Xixia, dispersing his vital energy to dispel the cold from her.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a custom-made small "Namo Gatling Woodpecker" for Xixia, equipped with three thousand wooden woodpeckers. "Use this to protect yourself when needed." The Ox Demon's deep voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the impressive weapon, Xixia couldn't take her eyes off it, even the chicken leg no longer seemed appetizing.</p><p></p><p>After quickly finishing the chicken leg, she happily held the Namo Gatling, excited to be able to set off fireworks again!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon squatted down, his towering and mighty figure becoming surprisingly gentle as he stroked Xixia's head.</p><p></p><p>"Safety is the most important thing. If you encounter any great danger, just call for Cow Monk, and I will immediately appear by your side," the Ox Demon said.</p><p></p><p>Hugging the large weapon, Xixia nodded happily.</p><p></p><p>"Cow Monk, if my father hits my bottom when I'm naughty, will you come and save me if I call you?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her eyes as she asked.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon: "..."</p><p></p><p>You're really going to get your father in trouble!</p><p></p><p>He made a note in his little notebook: "Call Cow Monk when in danger, remember, or I'll confiscate your fireworks."</p><p></p><p>He lightly flicked Xixia's forehead, slightly annoyed.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Ox Demon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, however, was very happy. She had seen the Cow Monk again and received her own firework launcher, although it couldn't compare to the Ox Demon's.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After storing the Namo Gatling in the Qiankun Jade given by Li Qingshan, Xixia quietly returned to her room and lay down, falling into a contented sleep.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, she had a wonderful dream.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, she sat on the Cow Monk's shoulders, and the fireworks were dazzling and unstoppable! Below, her father and Lü Datou were cheering for her, calling her the Empress Xixia...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dead of night, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and there was no moonlight to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes danced in the air, falling to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, in the guise of the Ox Demon, had delivered the miniaturized Namo Gatling to Xixia, fulfilling a promise.</p><p></p><p>At least, with the Namo Gatling in Xixia's possession, she would have the ability to protect herself when she went to the capital city, and not be easily bullied.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his sleeping wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Xixia had kicked off the blanket and was sprawled out in a "big" shape, occupying most of the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Daring father, please call me Empress Xixia!" she muttered in her dream.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>This girl... dreaming of grand ambitions?</p><p></p><p>Empress Xixia? You will always be my daughter! This girl has not inherited any of Li Che's refined and easygoing nature.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, silently appearing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had not returned to the small courtyard tonight, and Li Che guessed... he must have gone to meet his old lover.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun's glow... is also a kind of red.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the courtyard, Li Che's expression gradually turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Daoguo suddenly trembled, and in an instant, the heavenly and earthly chessboard expanded, and all the surrounding scenes were imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Under the perception of the [High Daoist Chess Saint], nothing could escape his sight.</p><p></p><p>Although his spiritual sense was good, Li Che still preferred the bird's-eye view brought by the High Daoist Chess Saint.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, about ten miles away from the courtyard, a figure stood on a black-tiled roof, wearing a horse-faced mask, with deep, penetrating eyes gazing towards Li Che's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cao He had put on the horse-faced mask and donned the black night clothes.</p><p></p><p>On his back, he carried four towering long spears, their silver tips swaying in the night wind.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow would be the day Li Qingshan, the divine emissary, left Flaming Thunder City. And the precious spiritual child, Xixia, would be leaving with him.</p><p></p><p>Cao He's toes lightly touched the roof tile, his figure standing as straight as a spear.</p><p></p><p>His gaze, however, had a slightly complex expression.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of his conversation with Cao Guang resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Cao Guang's attitude was unwilling to cause any trouble, with the sole purpose of hosting the "Thousand Buddha Sculpture Feast" well.</p><p></p><p>However, Cao Guang had still found Cao He and given him a blood-stained wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Cao He took it, his gaze narrowing.</p><p></p><p>It was a sculpture of a naked female figure, the expression extremely ferocious and the body contorted, as if in a tragic death.</p><p></p><p>It was filled with an evil aura, and just a single glance made Cao He feel as if his mind and spirit had been stolen away.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is..."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, this is the 'Corpse God' wooden sculpture, one of the three Corpse Gods, the 'Desire to Observe Corpse Flesh Guanyin' wooden sculpture?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the room, the flickering candlelight cast Cao Guang's shadow into a constantly twisting form.</p><p></p><p>Cao He looked up, and the sight of Cao Guang's shadow made him feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect! So Cao Guang was indeed involved with the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cao He's heart was suddenly gripped as if by a hand.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when they were preparing to hold the Thousand Buddha Sculpture Feast, Cao He should have had some suspicions.</p><p></p><p>But when Cao Guang finally revealed his true identity, Cao He was still somewhat shocked...</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect was irreconcilable with the court and the divine emissary. For a court official to join the Corpse God Sect was a grave crime punishable by the extermination of his entire family!</p><p></p><p>If the Judicial Bureau discovered this, they would surely be wiped out to the last man!</p><p></p><p>Yet Cao Guang did not seem to notice the change in Cao He's expression...</p><p></p><p>"An exceptional spiritual child, how unfortunate... we missed the opportunity, otherwise the Thousand Buddha Sculpture Feast would have been even more magnificent... but the value of an exceptional spiritual child is still there. Uncle, hide your identity and place the wooden sculpture outside Li Che's courtyard..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Desire to Observe Corpse Flesh Guanyin' wooden sculpture contains the 'Six Desires Corpse God Essence' and will automatically form a mark, naturally attracting Li Nuanxi, even if she goes to the capital city... an exceptional spiritual child can bring us great benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Consider it a favor..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang chuckled softly.</p><p></p><p>"Safe in the capital city? In this world, where is there an absolutely safe place?"</p><p></p><p>"The Judicial Bureau says my promotion path is blocked... what can I do? I don't believe it... who says fate is fixed?"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Gods are supreme, and after the Thousand Buddha Sculpture Feast... I will have the opportunity to condense the Corpse God divine form!"</p><p></p><p>"The path is blocked? It doesn't exist..."</p><p></p><p>"My sect has already swept across the land like a raging fire, unstoppable, unstoppable!"</p><p></p><p>A crazed look flashed in Cao Guang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Cao He, however, had his entire back drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He dared not speak, respectfully taking the "Desire to Observe Corpse Flesh Guanyin," the naked female wooden sculpture, and quickly left, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Returning to the present, the gentle wind ruffled his silver hair.</p><p></p><p>Cao He sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Once you enter the Corpse God Sect, it's as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the youthful and ambitious Cao Guang, who was once praised as the most talented member of the Cao family, destined to reach the divine form, the result...</p><p></p><p>After going to the capital city, he encountered a true disciple of the Primordial Sect and was shattered in just a few moves. From then on, he had been in decline.</p><p></p><p>Although he had inherited the position of the city lord of the Cao family.</p><p></p><p>His ambition was long gone, and he had immersed himself in the Corpse God Sect...</p><p></p><p>"Child... how foolish..."</p><p></p><p>Cao He sighed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the "Desire to Observe Corpse Flesh Guanyin" in his hand, seeing the lifelike and exquisite expression of the wooden sculpture, it even stirred a sense of resurgent vigor in this old tree that had been half-buried in the ground.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly exhaled, shifting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, Cao He's neck, hidden behind the horse-faced mask, suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>For he saw.</p><p></p><p>On the distant rooftop.</p><p></p><p>The falling snow was torn and distorted! Silently and imperceptibly, a towering, triangular figure like a mountain stood there.</p><p></p><p>The figure wore a wide-brimmed hat, slightly tilting its head up.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a cute cow-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon?" </p><p></p><p>Cao He narrowed his eyes, a cold glint in his eyes: "Indeed, as long as you have designs on the Li family, this Ox Demon will inevitably appear to protect them... so, who are you really? I should call you... Master Li, right."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon looked at the horse-faced masked Cao He with a calm gaze.</p><p></p><p>His identity had been exposed, but he had not recognized the other party's identity.</p><p></p><p>But does it matter? "It doesn't matter anymore."</p><p></p><p>Cao He was taken aback, the face behind the horse mask... suddenly smiled: "Indeed, it doesn't matter anymore. You and your family... are about to leave Flaming Thunder City, so you don't care if your identity is exposed."</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Cao He's pupils behind the horse mask suddenly shrank to the size of sesame seeds.</p><p></p><p>Because, in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, with his powerful vital energy, directly broke through the air pressure and appeared beside him in an ultimate speed, grabbing him with five fingers. The intense bloody scent spread, and a blood-colored long spear with flowing blood patterns emerged from the torn air, grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A divine weapon... the Dripping Blood Shocking Spear! Immediately, behind the Ox Demon's head, a dazzling [Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Divine Foundation] suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying positional pressure crushed down on Cao He, leaving him unable to even move a single finger.</p><p></p><p>The indifferent and murderous voice came from under the Ox Demon's mask.</p><p></p><p>"I said... who you are no longer matters."</p><p></p><p>It's the end of the month, please vote for me, recommend me, and continue to support my reading! Don't stop reading, Old Li will keep updating!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping Demon Statue!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said in a deep voice, and as soon as he finished speaking, the sound of the raging blizzard seemed to have disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Weeping Demon Statue?! Li Che's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was no longer the simple wood-carrying worker he used to be, and he also had some knowledge of wood carving.</p><p></p><p>This vast Feilei City was divided into an inner city and an outer city. The inner city was prosperous like a dream, where the long-established aristocratic families of Feilei City resided, and it was extremely wealthy and flourishing.</p><p></p><p>These aristocratic families all had their own cultivated methods, and they were even rumored to cultivate divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>In fact, each family had a wood carving workshop, recruiting and training wood carving masters, because the wood carvings carved by wood carving masters, if the spiritual charm was strong enough, would be of great benefit to the cultivators of the aristocratic families who cultivated divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>They could extract the divine essence from the wood carvings.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the prices of the wood carvings carved by the wood carving masters are so high.</p><p></p><p>And in the wood carving workshops in the inner city, there were wood carving masters stationed, and the wood carvings carved by those wood carving masters were full of spiritual charm and extremely precious, each one worth hundreds or thousands of taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, Li Che had heard many stories from Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>It's not easy to become a wood carving master, because the spiritual charm of the carved wood carvings needs to reach the level of overflowing and taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit had reached level 2, which could give the carved objects a sense of meaning, but to reach the level of a master, he still lacked something, perhaps after reaching level 3, he could reach the level of a master.</p><p></p><p>"The statue shape diagram will be provided by the Shi family, you just need to carve it..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu, with his towering figure and deep voice, looked deeply at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"This is a rare opportunity, it's because of the reputation you've accumulated from your previous carving of statues, as the meaning in your carved wood carvings is profound, that's why you've been given this opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to feel too burdened, even if the carving fails and the finished wood carving doesn't have enough spiritual charm, it doesn't matter, after all, you've only been a wood carving master for a year, and you still have room for growth, just treat it as practice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu comforted him.</p><p></p><p>For the five golden leaves' worth of work, Li Che gritted his teeth, there was no reason for him to let it go.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give it a try." Li Che cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Che had agreed, Xu Beihu was in a good mood, patting Li Che's shoulder and saying, "The young master of the Shi family wants your wood carving, most likely to use it for cultivating divine techniques. The Shi family's divine technique is called 'Weeping Demon', and if you can succeed, you'll be set for life in the future, and even have the opportunity to break through to the realm of a master."</p><p></p><p>"Divine... Weeping Demon." Li Che had heard about it from Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods, refining the body, inner strength, and divine techniques, among which divine techniques were the most mysterious, inner strength was precious, and refining the body was more common.</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques have always been controlled by the aristocratic families in the inner city, and outsiders have no way to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu glanced at Li Che and said softly, "Divine techniques are usually divided into seven veins: joy, anger, worry, thought, sorrow, fear, and surprise... Weeping Demon belongs to the sorrow divine technique. The divine technique is profound and unfathomable, but it requires the accumulation of divine essence over time, which is not easy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu didn't say much more, and looked deeply at Li Che, "Your wood carving talent is excellent, and if you become a wood carving master in the future, you have the opportunity to obtain the divine technique of my Xu family, so... don't slack off."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che quickly showed a grateful expression on his face and cupped his fists in a bow.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu nodded in satisfaction, taking out a folded paper from his sleeve: "This is the shape diagram of the 'Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping Demon Statue', the deadline is one month, and in one month, I will come and find you."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take you to the inner city to trade with that young master of the Shi family."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, taking the shape diagram.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After finishing his practice, Li Che returned to the workshop to tidy up, and then left the Xu Family Wood Carving Workshop.</p><p></p><p>He made an excuse to go buy some yellow wine and braised meat, but in reality, he was going to the outer city's market to check the situation, as Xu Beihu didn't provide him with the methods for opening the meridians and cultivating inner strength.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the method for opening the meridians was still relatively rare, but not as difficult as the divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the wood carving workshop, he walked to a small alley, and after confirming that there was no one around, he activated the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor", his figure grew taller and more burly, and he took out a wooden mask, covering his face with it, wrapped in a thick robe, and disappeared into the long street.</p><p></p><p>The market of Feilei City was located in the west of the outer city, in a not-so-dilapidated area, with shacks and old buildings.</p><p></p><p>It looked very dilapidated.</p><p></p><p>But this was the market where the cultivators of Feilei City traded, as most of the cultivators here were adventurers from outside the city, killing demons and monsters, and exploring mysterious temples.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Acquiring Cultivation Resources</p><p></p><p>The cultivator took a tattered cloth, spread it on the ground, and turned it into a stall, displaying all kinds of strange items, and started doing business.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked over and his gaze shifted. This was his first time coming here, mainly because he had not cultivated before and dared not come, fearing he would lose his life for no reason.</p><p></p><p>After wandering in front of many small stalls for a while, he finally stopped in front of a merchant who was also tightly wrapped up.</p><p></p><p>The similar demeanor gave Li Che a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>"Fresh items just out of the Mysterious Temple, are you interested, sir?" The stall owner glanced at the tightly wrapped Li Che with a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Temple..." Li Che fell silent. That was an extremely dangerous place outside the city, and it was rumored that the lineage of the Ling Infant Sect originated from the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The vast landscape had become so turbulent, and it was closely related to the Mysterious Temple that had emerged like bamboo shoots after the rain, as well as the rampant evil creatures that had escaped from the out-of-control Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>For the cultivating warriors, the subdued Mysterious Temple was a place to explore resources.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was not very interested in the Mysterious Temple at the moment. He came to the market only to seek a body tempering method.</p><p></p><p>"Merchant, do you have any body tempering methods for sale?" Li Che changed his voice to a hoarse tone and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Body tempering method?" The merchant sitting on the ground looked up strangely.</p><p></p><p>"What level does the sir want?"</p><p></p><p>"Opening the Meridians." Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Opening the Meridians? The merchant's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"I just happen to have a Middle-Grade Body Tempering Method that I fished out from the Mysterious Temple in the south of the city. It can be cultivated to the Refine Bone level. I wonder if the sir is interested?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's towering figure exuded a strong sense of oppression, but the merchant was not afraid. "I only need the Opening the Meridians method." Li Che replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the merchant no longer wasted words and deftly took out an old blue-covered book from his pocket and handed it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After flipping through it and confirming that it was indeed the Middle-Grade Opening the Meridians method, Li Che was very satisfied and covered the book.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any inner strength methods, you can also show them to me."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che had no hope for inner strength methods, but if it really didn't work out, he could go back and buy one from Old Chen. Old Chen had said before that he could sell inner strength methods to him.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you jest. Inner strength methods are monopolized by powerful families. We small stall owners cannot afford the crime of selling inner strength methods. If discovered, we won't be able to survive in Flying Thunder City."</p><p></p><p>The merchant shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt regretful, but didn't mind: "Then I'll take this Opening the Meridians method."</p><p></p><p>The merchant raised five fingers: "Five hundred taels!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed, slowly stood up, his towering figure like a mountain, and the surging blood and qi around him made the surrounding air stagnant, exuding an extremely oppressive aura, as if the sky was collapsing and the earth was sinking.</p><p></p><p>This person thought he was just a warrior stuck at the Refine Skin realm, so he was taking advantage of the situation?</p><p></p><p>But he was actually right on the mark.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred taels, that's about right." Li Che said indifferently: "I'm buying it as a gift for my junior."</p><p></p><p>The merchant felt the powerful aura and paled slightly. As someone who dared to venture into the Mysterious Temple to seek gains, he naturally had keen eyes.</p><p></p><p>This burly man's blood and qi were so powerful, the oppressive aura was no weaker than a Refine Bone warrior, and he might even have blood on his hands! Clearly a ruthless villain who treated life as worthless.</p><p></p><p>A hand-copied Middle-Grade Opening the Meridians method, selling it for one hundred taels, was still making a profit. After all, he had several copies at home.</p><p></p><p>"Deal!"</p><p></p><p>The merchant immediately agreed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che threw down one hundred taels and left with the Opening the Meridians method, disappearing into the market.</p><p></p><p>The merchant also quickly gathered up the cloth and left the stall.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With the Opening the Meridians method, Li Che was in a good mood. He could start opening his meridians tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the market, he found a secluded place, took off his shabby clothes, hid them, and then leisurely went to buy some braised meat, wine, and a box of osmanthus cakes that Zhang Ya liked, before returning to the wood carving workshop.</p><p></p><p>The snow was falling, dancing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the thick snow covering the blue stone ground, Li Che walked towards his home.</p><p></p><p>However, his steps gradually slowed, as he carried the braised meat, jar of wine, and osmanthus cakes, Li Che's brow gradually furrowed, staring at the one standing at the gate of his own courtyard...</p><p></p><p>With a faint smile, the county magistrate's constable Zhao Chuanxiong stood there, holding a saber.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The six cannon barrels howled as they rotated, spewing forth blazing light!</p><p></p><p>The golden light that burst forth was like countless furious dragons roaring out, each one a snowslide raven, encompassing the sky and earth, as if a thunderous rainstorm had descended! In just a moment, the towering Yuanjingang, moving at an extreme speed and unleashing the powerful death will of a Cursed Silver Corpse expert, was engulfed by the cannon fire!</p><p></p><p>The explosive shockwave and flames forcefully knocked Yuanjingang back down to the ground within the Qin Estate.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Estate... </p><p></p><p>It was a tragedy.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had been slaughtered, sparing neither the old, weak, nor the women and children.</p><p></p><p>Only two second-generation heirs remained - Qin Haonan and Qin Leishou.</p><p></p><p>And of these two, only Qin Leishou's will still persisted, while Qin Haonan... had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>When the entire clan was killed and sacrificed by Yuanjingang, Qin Haonan had completely lost his mind.</p><p></p><p>Because among those killed were his wife and children. </p><p></p><p>His second son, Qin Fenghuо, was also dead, leaving Qin Haonan all alone.</p><p></p><p>He sat slumped in a chair, gazing at the explosions blooming in the sky, with no fear in his eyes, but rather a sense of liberation. The tears sliding down his cheeks evaporated in the intense heat.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the fearful Qin Leishou, Qin Haonan only felt a sense of release.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The exploding snowslide ravens were like a rolling tide of flames, engulfing the heavens, scorching hot enough to boil the seas!</p><p></p><p>The entire Qin Estate was enveloped in the fiery power, with the ground torn open by the erupting bullets, kicking up vast clouds of dirt and stone. The brick-paved ground cracked open in a spider-web pattern, radiating outwards.</p><p></p><p>The dust and airflow, rapidly grinding under the scorching waves, rose up as pungent gunpowder smoke.</p><p></p><p>Shrouding the entire Qin Estate in a hellish scene.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen Ox Demons, each wielding an Immortal Flame God Fury Dragon Cannon.</p><p></p><p>Truly representing the deities that would end all!</p><p></p><p>The bombardment lasted for about thirty breaths.</p><p></p><p>The erupting flames were so intense they almost formed a sea of fire.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Ox Demon mask, stood atop the high walls.</p><p></p><p>He slowly lowered the Immortal Flame Cannon in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The power of the cannon was indeed far beyond the previous Immortal Gatling Guns, surpassing them in explosive force, penetration, and overall firepower.</p><p></p><p>But... </p><p></p><p>It wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Demon mask, a flash of light flickered, the brow splitting open to reveal the Plucking Star Pupils. In an instant, he saw the dazzling silver light standing amidst the billowing smoke!</p><p></p><p>He's not dead.</p><p></p><p>This was not a Half-Step Cursed Silver Corpse, but a true Cursed Silver Corpse, with the silver aura infused into every inch of the flesh.</p><p></p><p>Far stronger than the Half-Step Cursed Silver Corpses Li Che had killed before.</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang... </p><p></p><p>The Seventh-Rank Corpse Deity Envoy! Also the highest-ranking Corpse Deity Envoy in the Golden Light Prefecture region.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts... Ox Demon..." </p><p></p><p>The deep, hoarse voice, like metal grinding against stone, was ear-piercing, as if it would tear the eardrums.</p><p></p><p>One brilliant silver aura after another erupted, numbering over twenty-five in total! Twenty-five silver auras!</p><p></p><p>Rivaling the divine auras of Grand Masters, with twenty-five auras equivalent to opening two hundred and fifty body meridians!</p><p></p><p>The energy flow permeated every inch of the flesh, utterly terrifying! At the Grand Master realm, each refined and condensed divine aura would double one's strength. </p><p></p><p>A Cursed Silver Corpse with twenty-five silver auras was an experienced one, twenty-five times stronger than a newly-formed Cursed Silver Corpse with just one aura. Of course, this was solely in terms of raw physical power.</p><p></p><p>Some martial arts and techniques could make up for this gap.</p><p></p><p>The silver auras, like twenty-five silver spears, tore through the Immortal Flame Fury Dragon Cannon's explosion.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Che's Snowslide Ravens could not be perfectly replicated by the Painting Immortal Dao Fruit, the number of Snowslide Ravens in his bombardment was limited, mixed with many Snowslide Dragon Fangs.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the power was uneven.</p><p></p><p>But it could still be considered quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>If it had been Xue Dufu, he might have been severely injured!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The silver light pierced through the billowing dust and smoke.</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang's clothes were in tatters, with only a few remnants hanging on his body, struggling to cover him. Yet his entire body was shimmering with a silver luster, with few wounds.</p><p></p><p>Even the areas burned black by the explosion and heat were slowly recovering.</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang's blood-red eyes, sweeping through the turbulent winds, met the gaze of the black-haired, towering Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>A divine mark on Yuanjingang's brow twisted, and in an instant, his powerful spiritual sense seemed to open its eyes, unleashing a majestic divine presence.</p><p></p><p>It forcefully suppressed the many flames, although the powerful shockwave had inflicted considerable damage on him.</p><p></p><p>But at least he had withstood it!</p><p></p><p>"Cursed Silver Corpse, Spiritual Sense Transcendence Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The hoarse, low voice erupted from the mouths of all eighteen Ox Demons.</p><p></p><p>Very strong!</p><p></p><p>This Yuanjingang, though he had hidden for so long, had to be said to be truly powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... Do you think I, Yuanjingang, truly fear your Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>"So many Corpse Deity Envoys from the Golden Light Prefecture have died by your hands, your Underworld... has long since entered the Corpse Deity Cult's kill list!"</p><p></p><p>"No one can save you."</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang slowly emerged from the ruins of the Qin Estate, his overwhelming divine presence sweeping outwards.</p><p></p><p>The blood of the slaughtered Qin clan members on the ground had twisted into formations, as if summoning something through sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang glanced down at them.</p><p></p><p>Then he tilted his head back, and behind him, a distorted and bizarre spiritual sense manifested.</p><p></p><p>Visualizing the Corpse Deities, he had modeled his spiritual sense after them, but the Corpse Deities were so tyrannical, how could ordinary cultivators bear their power? Thus, their spiritual senses would become twisted and mutated during the transcendence process, but in doing so, they gained a degree of sinister and ominous intimidation! [Bone Touching Corpse Deity] The terrifying and evil intent, like a raging storm, spread out, combined with the death will of the Cursed Silver Corpse and the malevolent thoughts of the Spiritual Sense Transcendence! The two fused together, making the heavens and earth seem tainted.</p><p></p><p>Towering death energy rolled and surged, rising from all around.</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds echoed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The ground instantly caved in, cracking open in a spider-web pattern, radiating outwards!</p><p></p><p>And Yuanjingang had vanished, reappearing to strike, consecutively shattering five Painting Immortal clones.</p><p></p><p>Exploding into ink mist! "Clones of divine techniques, huh..."</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang lashed out with a kick, and the Ox Demon clone of Nascent Realm strength could not withstand it, being blasted apart!</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang's speed was too fast, wanting to destroy all the Ox Demon clones to find the true body. Wearing the cute ox-faced mask, Li Che's mind stirred! The blood qi shield flared up around him in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Yuanjingang's punch struck the blood qi shield, the invisible ripples distorting it almost to the point of deformation.</p><p></p><p>But the terrifying force and the tearing power of the silver auras were all blocked by the blood qi shield! "I've found you!"</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang spoke in a deep voice, murderous intent surging! Towards the Underworld... </p><p></p><p>His hatred ran deep! Whether it was the Ox Demons disrupting the Feilong City's full-city sacrifice plan, or their relentless pursuit of the Corpse Deity Cult in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Corpse Deity Cult's experts were all well-hidden, they were still uncovered by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Branch's Xu Jiuying, the new abbot of the Heart Monkey Temple, the Golden Rift Gate... </p><p></p><p>Almost all the Corpse Deity Cult's hidden trump cards had been exposed by the Ox Demons.</p><p></p><p>How could Yuanjingang not be enraged? Nearly a decade's worth of subordinates, all scattered because of one Underworld, needing to be rebuilt from scratch.</p><p></p><p>How could Yuanjingang not hate! The Ox Demon's towering and massive body, with his black hair lashing the void.</p><p></p><p>Facing the gleaming silver light of Yuanjingang, he did not retreat, but rather his blood qi surged, the just-refined heart and golden lungs suddenly squeezing out power.</p><p></p><p>Two divine auras simultaneously leaped out from his organs, twisting together! Touching down with his toes.</p><p></p><p>Like a thunderclap, the entire city wall instantly shattered into pieces, and he threw out a powerful punch, the Martial Saint's ultimate technique, the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant!</p><p></p><p>The dragon-shaped shadow appeared almost simultaneously! Clenching his fingers, the bones and sinews rang, and the divine aura coiled around his fist, striking out with ruthless force!</p><p></p><p>Divine auras?! This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Has already reached the Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>According to Yuanjingang's information, the Ox Demon's strength should only be at the late Nascent Realm level, with his main strength lying in his vicious battle tactics.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Now, the Ox Demon has reached the Grand Master realm in raw power! Truly...</p><p></p><p>Horrifying!</p><p></p><p>But after the initial shock, Yuanjingang revealed a look of delight.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely confident in his Cursed Silver Corpse's strength, with twenty-five refined silver auras, combined with the mutated spiritual sense of the Corpse Deity will!</p><p></p><p>He, Yuanjingang...</p><p></p><p>Would not fear the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Without any evasion, to evade would be to show weakness, and Yuanjingang was unwilling! Then...</p><p></p><p>He would meet strength with strength!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Without any fancy techniques, just fist against fist, a contest of pure physical might, the resilience of the divine auras...</p><p></p><p>This was the subtle clash between Grand Masters in the moment of kill!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! The collision of the divine auras and silver auras was like two thunderclaps crashing against each other in the clouds! The heavens and earth seemed to dim!</p><p></p><p>The air became like the surface of water, with layer upon layer of transparent ripples spreading out from the center of the fists' impact, rising up like towering ocean waves from the point of collision!</p><p></p><p>Scattering and resonating, overwhelming and earth-shaking!</p><p></p><p>This was the pure collision of raw power, the shockwaves and blood qi spreading out, becoming howling, raging airflows! Sweeping away the smoke and fire covering the Qin Estate, scattering them into countless sparks dancing across the Golden Light Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Under the terrifying power clash, Yuanjingang only felt an unmatched, overwhelming force! And a will, pure and tyrannical as the sun and clouds! The dao will, the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra, unparalleled and tempered!</p><p></p><p>I alone, undefeatable in the flesh! Even if you are a Cursed Silver Corpse...</p><p></p><p>How would that matter?!</p><p></p><p>The triangular muscles on the Ox Demon's back bunched up, the blood qi shield coiling around his arm, almost like a single-arm mecha.</p><p></p><p>Doubling his single-arm strength at least! Roar!!! The Ox Demon let out a furious bellow, throwing out his fist with tremendous force!</p><p></p><p>The power pierced through Yuanjingang's unyielding Cursed Silver Corpse arm, erupting in layers of silver mist! Yuanjingang's body was shot back like a cannonball, his chest taking the Ox Demon's punch, the deep indentation almost punching through. With a massive boom, the entire Qin Estate collapsed in large swaths, the countless tiles and beams torn to dust by the terrifying explosive force contained within Yuanjingang's body!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon seized the opportunity, his striking arm trembling, the muscles and bones swelling, his spine like a dragon! Transcendent Eight Extremities Steps! The Martial Saint's body technique secret art!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's towering, mountain-like body seemed to stride across time and space in a single step!</p><p></p><p>Planting his foot, the airflow surged, his spine like a dragon, roaring to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The Yuanjingang who had been violently blasted away was completely dazed!</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical, how could it be so tyrannical?!</p><p></p><p>Such a physique!</p><p></p><p>Such divine auras!</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... had actually broken through to the Grand Master realm by tempering his organs with the Martial Saint's true essence, refining divine auras! One misstep, and it would be a downward spiral! Dust swirling, blood qi burning like fire! Amid the turbulent airflow, the Ox Demon's fist, like a grinding millstone, came sweeping in again.</p><p></p><p>Yuanjingang's eyes bulged, wanting to forcefully dispel the unparalleled power in his Cursed Silver Corpse flesh.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Corpse Art meant being immune to pain, so Yuanjingang did not know what pain was.</p><p></p><p>But not knowing pain was one thing, and he was being completely suppressed! Meanwhile...</p><p></p><p>Ten miles away, atop an octagonal pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The wind howled.</p><p></p><p>The Painting Immortal clone wearing a horse mask stood facing the wind, the horse-faced mask gleaming with brilliant light beneath!</p><p></p><p>Crouching, he took aim! Sniper shot!</p><p></p><p>From the Immortal Flame Barrett, a beam of light shot out!</p><p></p><p>An extremely dazzling light, piercing through the air, the white airwaves it dragged along seemed to tear the heavens and earth like a shooting star!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, as Yuanjingang was being blasted back by the Ox Demon's punch, using all his power to resist the explosive force.</p><p></p><p>This sniper shot...</p><p></p><p>Aimed for Yuanjingang's eyeball! A perfect kill!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the battle erupted.</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Light Prefecture began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>In the Magistrate's Office.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang was helping Iron Caizhai ponder how to test whether Li Wanxi had truly obtained the Purple Flame Snake Spear.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Chaoyang's expression changed drastically! A powerful...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood erupted, the toes touched down, and he disappeared in a flash, appearing on the roof of the Temple Superintendent's Office in the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Temple Superintendent's Office, Xie Jing, also appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master's qi and blood are like a furnace burning in the heavens and earth! Both outside and inside the city there are..."</p><p></p><p>"How come there are so many Grand Masters all of a sudden?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the city first!"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chaoyang said in a deep voice, and the true essence of the Dao erupted wildly, clearly capturing the powerful and dense death qi and corpse qi!</p><p></p><p>There was also the aura of a Corpse God! This was a true disciple of the Corpse God Sect!</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The two of them leapt a few times and appeared on a building about a hundred yards from the Qin Mansion, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>They did not approach any closer.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon and Horse-Face from the Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>"And... Yüan Jing-gang from the Corpse God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon and Horse-Face from the Underworld are again besieging the evil cultivators of the Corpse God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Jing exclaimed in shock. </p><p></p><p>It's not that... the Underworld is more concerned about these Corpse God Sect evildoers than their own Temple Superintendent's Office, apart from people like Zhu Chaoyang.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao and the Observatory Supervisor Hu Yingue, who was playing the erhu, also soared into the sky and lightly landed hundreds of yards away to observe this battle.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Divine Palace on Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>The drowsy Jiao Shaochun suddenly had a stern expression, with a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly shot out, with the Charioteer Grand Master closely following behind.</p><p></p><p>They were the fastest, directly shooting towards the defenses of the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>But South离Fire's expression changed involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... has taken action again?"</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family really has something unusual, and Yüan Jing-gang... has actually been hiding in the Qin family all along!"</p><p></p><p>South離Fire's expression changed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>But what made South離Fire feel more perplexed was...</p><p></p><p>Yüan Jing-gang's cultivation was completely different from the intelligence report, actually being so terrifying! His physical body had been refined into a Cursed Silver Corpse, and his divine nature had evolved into an Ancestral Spirit Shedding! This kind of expert with both supreme divine nature and physical body, if Jiao Shaochun, Wang Kuyu, Zhu Chaoyang and the others were to leave, who in the Golden Light Prefecture could stop him? The Corpse God Sect has really invested a lot, actually willing to send such a powerful expert with a Cursed Silver Corpse and Ancestral Spirit Shedding to the Golden Light Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the Corpse God Sect's attention to the Prince's Mysterious Temple is far beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it... Qin Fenghuо... he must have obtained a portion of the temple deity's divine nature!"</p><p></p><p>South離Fire's expression suddenly became ugly.</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>Under this Underworld plan to hunt down Yüan Jing-gang, South離Fire suddenly felt that his assassination plan targeting the City Lord Su Huai tomorrow...</p><p></p><p>seemed a bit like a joke.</p><p></p><p>It's as if...</p><p></p><p>Using a butcher's knife to kill a chicken!</p><p></p><p>On the Correct Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan hurriedly put on a cat-faced mask and rushed out.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>This mission operation...</p><p></p><p>Why wasn't he notified?</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that it was to hunt down Yüan Jing-gang, that Cursed Silver Corpse and Ancestral Spirit Shedding dual powerhouse evil cultivator! Li Qingshan felt that not notifying him was the right thing to do.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai had his hands clasped behind his back, wearing a white robe.</p><p></p><p>He had his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>When the ground shook, the terrifying qi and blood, like burning wolf smoke, surged into the sky, disturbing the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai suddenly opened his eyes, and his pupils were extremely dark.</p><p></p><p>"It has begun..."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld has taken action!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's breathing became rapid, and his face flushed.</p><p></p><p>"South離Fire previously collaborated with the Underworld to kill Wen Long Mountain..."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, with the Underworld's current strength, South離Fire will definitely still cooperate, even if it requires a heavy price, but he will definitely... kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai tilted his head back, and his hair swayed without wind, flying up in disarray.</p><p></p><p>His body was trembling continuously.</p><p></p><p>That was the trembling of his body being invaded by fear.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld...</p><p></p><p>This force brought him too much gloom.</p><p></p><p>Chasing and attacking the Corpse God Sect, annihilating the Hunting God Pavilion, killing Grand Masters, killing the Divine Ancestor True Man...</p><p></p><p>Now, they have begun to target the strongest Corpse God Envoy stationed in the Golden Light Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>If the Ox Demon, Horse-Face, and Divine Monkey were to kill him...</p><p></p><p>Su Huai felt that he would be doomed without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Doomed...</p><p></p><p>Even though he had trump cards, he also knew that the trump cards... were not enough against the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld lets you die at the third watch, and will not leave you till the fifth watch..."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai couldn't help but murmur this phrase that had suddenly started circulating.</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the best opportunity for me to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai exhaled.</p><p></p><p>These days, he dared not move recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Because the mysterious and elusive Underworld trio made him feel very insecure.</p><p></p><p>Only by confirming the location of the Underworld trio could he put his mind at ease and flee far away.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity was the best opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Su Huai slowly squatted down.</p><p></p><p>He took out a blood-colored pearl from the Heavenly and Earthly Orb.</p><p></p><p>Within the blood pearl, the dense death qi and corpse qi circulated, and there was also a mysterious Corpse Curse Seal floating and shining!</p><p></p><p>"Corpse God Pearl."</p><p></p><p>A treasure that can temporarily seal the death qi, corpse qi, and Corpse Curse Seal within it.</p><p></p><p>It is also a means for the upper echelons of the Corpse God Sect to perfectly conceal their aura!</p><p></p><p>But to use the Corpse God methods, he must release the power of the Corpse God Pearl again.</p><p></p><p>Although this will expose him...</p><p></p><p>But to escape with his life... is not shameful.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly crushed the Corpse God Pearl.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment! The extremely dense death qi and corpse qi surged up, with a half-human, half-dragon death qi howling and roaring within!</p><p></p><p>"Sea Monster, your dragon god bloodline, the death qi formed by your death, is so domineering... please lend your brother a hand."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai said softly.</p><p></p><p>Countless death qi and corpse qi were suddenly devoured by him, violently inhaled into his nose and mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Curse Seal on his brow began to rotate, and in an instant, countless black curse seals covered his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's entire body was transformed into a dazzling silver light.</p><p></p><p>He actually...</p><p></p><p>was also a Cursed Silver Corpse!</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to wait for South離Fire to come and die..."</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, the Underworld broke out midway, damn it."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's death qi surged, and he cursed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his palm that had turned into silver radiance.</p><p></p><p>His teacher, the Pacification King, was suppressing the Corpse God Sect's rebellion in Jeju.</p><p></p><p>And as the Pacification King's disciple, he chose to cultivate the Corpse Curse Seal and Corpse Summoning Technique...</p><p></p><p>Su Huai had no choice.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, wait for me, I will definitely become someone that makes you look at me with new eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai bared his sharp corpse fangs in a grin.</p><p></p><p>He pressed his five fingers to the ground, and a dense blood pool surged and swept at the place where his palm was pressed. Time-Space Corpse Retreat! An enhanced version of the Retreat Technique, faster in distance and speed!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he did not dare to use it, because once used, it would inevitably erupt with death qi and corpse qi, and the Corpse Curse Seal would also pulsate.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld would probably come sniffing the scent!</p><p></p><p>Now, the Underworld trio are being constrained...</p><p></p><p>This is the best opportunity to escape!</p><p></p><p>Even if someone notices him.</p><p></p><p>They won't be able to hold him back! Su Huai plans to go to the Dao City, to seek out the senior brother stationed in the Dao City...</p><p></p><p>He dares not return to Jeju to see the Pacification King, Sis Moli.</p><p></p><p>After all, Sis Hai died in the Golden Light Prefecture, and he is partly to blame...</p><p></p><p>He can only temporarily seek refuge with his senior brother. If the teacher comes to punish him, he can return later.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... South離Fire..."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's body was wrapped in death qi, the curse seals rotating, and his pupils exuded a sandalwood-like death qi.</p><p></p><p>The disgrace of fleeing today.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai will never forget!</p><p></p><p>One day, he will repay it! Glug glug--</p><p></p><p>Su Huai's entire body suddenly sank into the blood pool, completely submerging into it.</p><p></p><p>Only the surging and rampant death qi and corpse qi in the entire City Lord's Mansion remained.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since the Immortal Craftsman Fire God Extreme Barrette has not yet been researched by Xian Gong.</p><p></p><p>So, the one Horse-Face is using now is still the Immortal Craftsman Fire God Barrette.</p><p></p><p>It is loaded with fifty Divine Nature Snowslide God Essence Chess Pieces of the Fire God Dragon Fang!</p><p></p><p>The speed of this sniper shot is too fast, and the timing is too good!</p><p></p><p>It was in the midst of the battle...</p><p></p><p>When Yüan Jing-gang was suppressed down by the Ox Demon's Grand Master physique of the Martial Saint True Essence.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have time to gather his strength to resist! Treacherous!</p><p></p><p>Yüan Jing-gang finally remembered the Ox Demon's battle style! Treacherous, cunning, and despicable!</p><p></p><p>He thought the Ox Demon would fight him head-on, but he had changed.</p><p></p><p>Now he understands, he was creating an opportunity for Horse-Face to snipe!</p><p></p><p>"Treacherous bastards--!!!"</p><p></p><p>Yüan Jing-gang's deep dissatisfaction and anger burst open in his chest, turning into a roar that shook half the city!</p><p></p><p>A Six Ancestral Corpse Curse Seal instantly rotated, and dense black curse seals like tattoos covered his entire body.</p><p></p><p>They were concentrated on the targeted eyeballs!</p><p></p><p>Yüan Jing-gang tightly closed his eyelids!</p><p></p><p>Facing such a sniper shot, there was no way to dodge!</p><p></p><p>He could only... endure it! The Fire God Dragon Fang with a trailing afterglow fiercely pierced into Yüan Jing-gang's eyelids!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, like a falling meteor trailing flames, it crashed into the ground!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying shockwaves and smoke billowed, forming a mushroom cloud! The entire Qin Mansion instantly collapsed, countless walls crumbled, crisscrossing cracks, wood chips and scattered stones flew through the air!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, wearing a hat, had his mask reflecting the changing mushroom cloud fire light.</p><p></p><p>His black robe fluttered in the howling wind.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's towering figure like a mountain, suddenly took a step forward, and the ground suddenly collapsed and exploded, countless shattered stones soaring into the sky, as if they were frozen in midair by a domineering Dao Essence!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying and thick blood pulsed in the meridians, the friction of the muscles and bones was ear-piercing!

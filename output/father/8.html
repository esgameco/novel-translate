        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shopkeeper Xu You narrowed his eyes, a flash of surprise flickering in his gentle gaze.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the roughly-shaped "Four-Armed Bodhisattva Holding a Child" statue, which was in the process of having its lines sketched out. Although it was just a rough draft with coarse lines, the overall piece already exuded a unique sense of beauty.</p><p></p><p>That was... the aura of meaning!</p><p></p><p>The bearing, the posture, the temperament... all emanated from it!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a compassionate four-armed bodhisattva was truly there, with one arm cradling a child, eyes downcast, hand gesturing the mudra of rebirth, holding a pure jade vase, and grasping a jade scepter...</p><p></p><p>This was carved by a mere laborer? Xu You nodded slightly. As the head shopkeeper of the wood carving shop, he had handled too many wood carvings and had a very high appreciation for the styles and carving techniques of many senior craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's four-armed bodhisattva, the carving techniques contained many of the styles and flavors of the four-knife wood carver Chen Dabao!</p><p></p><p>Talent... astounding!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had not spent any money learning wood carving at the shop, and Chen Dabao obviously would not generously impart his skills.</p><p></p><p>In other words... all of this was self-taught by Li Che! During the day, he had to transport wood and finished statues at the wood carving shop, and only had time in the evenings to go back and carve. Yet, with just the evening time for study, he was able to reach this level! "The line carving and handling still have some flaws, but the precious thing is... the aura of meaning! The four-armed bodhisattva carved by Little Li is extremely rich in meaning, as if it has come alive... This is an innate talent!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao smacked his lips, coming to his senses after sensing the arrival of Shopkeeper Xu You, and was greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the most important thing in wood carving is the spirit, the aura. Without the aura, no matter how good the techniques or how marvelous the skills, it is still just a piece of scrap wood," Xu You responded approvingly with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"He is a good seedling, and Li Che's techniques are not bad either, just a little less seasoned compared to the senior craftsmen, but far surpassing the apprentices..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems our Xu Shop is about to produce a true genius."</p><p></p><p>Xu You's lips curled up, his smile almost dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why our Xu Shop wood carvings are among the best in Feilei City is not just because of the Xu family, but mainly because the wood carvings produced by our shop are full of spiritual aura, which can provide the young masters in the city with the means to refine and extract the divine..."</p><p></p><p>"For such a talent who has an exceptional gift in grasping the spiritual aura of wood carvings, our Xu Shop will certainly seize the opportunity and nurture him well!"</p><p></p><p>Xu You stood with his hands behind his back, quietly watching Li Che's carving for a while.</p><p></p><p>After confirming through the carving techniques and the deepening of the wood carving's spiritual aura that it was indeed Li Che's work, Xu You already had his answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had also sensed Xu You's arrival and the evaluation of himself.</p><p></p><p>His heart couldn't help but be startled. He had already restrained his carving techniques a lot, but it still seemed to be far superior to the apprentices in the shop, standing out like a crane among chickens...</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had tried to control and conceal his skills.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the reaction of the head shopkeeper, it seemed that his becoming a wood carving master was secured!</p><p></p><p>Four hours passed in the sound of the carving knife tearing through the wood.</p><p></p><p>Dong--</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a sound like the shattering of a bronze bell, the burly figure of the second shopkeeper Xu Beihu, who was sitting in a grand chair sipping tea, suddenly stood up, his fierce blood surging like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>"Time's up! Everyone, stop!"</p><p></p><p>"The assessment is over!"</p><p></p><p>"If I see anyone still wielding a knife, the qualification will be canceled, and the results will be void!"</p><p></p><p>His domineering voice, rough yet commanding.</p><p></p><p>All the wood carving apprentices hurriedly stopped their work, some trembling in fear as they looked at Xu Beihu, whose eyes were like those of a tiger scanning the entire scene, cowed into silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also put down his polishing rod and stopped working on the "Four-Armed Bodhisattva Holding a Child" statue, letting out a long sigh, feeling a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>If only he had been given a little more time, he could have completed the polishing, and this sculpture would have been a finished product.</p><p></p><p>The head shopkeeper and the second shopkeeper, accompanied by a few senior craftsmen from the shop, began to evaluate the wood carvings of the various apprentices.</p><p></p><p>The evaluation was not overly harsh, and was considered fair.</p><p></p><p>Unless they encountered something truly abysmal, where the apprentice had only carved a rough draft in the four hours and the form was not even complete, they would only scold a few words.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao followed the group, squinting his eyes. When they came to Li Che's workstation and saw the four-armed bodhisattva statue standing upright on the workbench, emerging from the scattered wood chips and already taking shape after the polishing, many of the senior craftsmen couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, a mere porter actually has such superb carving skills and craftsmanship!"</p><p></p><p>"The apprentices I've trained are truly a disappointment!"</p><p></p><p>"A fine talent! It's a pity that he hasn't received formal training in wood carving all these years. Though he started late, the artistic conception of his wood carving... I would believe it was carved by a master of the three-stroke technique!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Praises did not cease.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youwen looked at Li Che with a hint of admiration in his eyes and nodded slightly, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his hands and bowed respectfully, his expression calm, unswayed by the praise.</p><p></p><p>The group continued their appreciation, and shortly after, the evaluation of all the works was completed.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, Zhao Xuan, Wang Zhengpin, your three wood carvings have stood out in this assessment. You shall be awarded the title of One-Stroke Wood Carving Master, with a monthly salary of five taels, with a sixty percent share."</p><p></p><p>As Xu You read out the three names, the workshop was instantly abuzz with commotion.</p><p></p><p>When the final results were settled, many apprentices were disheartened, some were perplexed, and some even shed tears...</p><p></p><p>After years of arduous study, they ultimately failed the assessment, and were even surpassed and crushed by a mere porter - their mentality was somewhat unbalanced.</p><p></p><p>Within the small workshop, a spectrum of human emotions was on full display.</p><p></p><p>"You three, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Xu You and Xu Behu donned their fox-fur cloaks and glanced at the three successful candidates.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the other two apprentices hurriedly followed, entering the swirling snowstorm and heading deeper into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the long corridor, they arrived in a spacious courtyard, like a flattened training ground, filled with snow-covered stone pedestals and training posts for martial arts practice.</p><p></p><p>"This is the martial arts training area of the Xu Family Wood Carving Workshop. As wood carving masters of the workshop, you can enter this area and train with the 'Jade Token Knife' representing your identity as one-stroke wood carving masters, preparing to ascend to higher levels of wood carving mastery."</p><p></p><p>The group stood in the courtyard, facing the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>Xu You distributed three jade knives to the three, then stood silently, and the second manager, Xu Behu, began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"I will be the one to provide martial arts instruction. Every month, I will come to the outer city for two days. If you have any questions about the martial arts, you can come and ask me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu's voice was like a thunderous bell, his vital energy strong, standing in the heavy snowstorm without a single flake touching him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the others quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let me tell you about the martial dao..."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of martial arts is divided into three types: body refinement, inner energy cultivation, and... spiritual cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual cultivation is something you cannot access, nor are you qualified to. Body refinement is something everyone can cultivate, while inner energy cultivation is more dependent on talent and requires time to accumulate."</p><p></p><p>"I will teach you body refinement now, and as for inner energy cultivation, you will have to wait until your body refinement reaches the skin-polishing stage before I can impart it to you to try."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>He then began to teach the three the techniques of body refinement, which were essentially arduous training methods, using external tools and equipment in the training ground to refine the body.</p><p></p><p>"Body refinement, from polishing the skin and opening the meridians, to tempering the bones and renewing the blood, allowing the blood to flow like quicksilver - this is the mark of a true master! As for the stage beyond blood renewal, where the meridians are unblocked, there are few such experts even in the entire city."</p><p></p><p>"Starting with skin polishing, every half month, you can receive a bowl of 'Boiling Skin Powder', and if you feel it's not enough, you can buy more at the cost of one tael of silver per bowl, which can accelerate your body refinement progress."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu taught earnestly, and Li Che listened attentively. This was his first encounter with the martial arts of this world, and he naturally dared not be negligent, as the threat of the Spiritual Infant Sect hung like a sword over his head, making him unwilling to let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts could increase his capital to resist the Spiritual Infant Sect, and he could not afford to be the slightest bit lax.</p><p></p><p>As the sky darkened completely, Xu Behu finally concluded the day's instruction.</p><p></p><p>He would remain in the outer city for another day to teach the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse now, and thoroughly digest the martial dao knowledge I have imparted. Tomorrow, we will officially begin the skin-polishing practice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu said in a deep voice, waving his hand and turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not leave, but sought out the third manager to inquire about the moving matter.</p>

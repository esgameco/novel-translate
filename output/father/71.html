        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes were instantly shredded, exploding into powder.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing a cat-faced mask, hunched his body and retreated from the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>He leapt onto a lush green pine tree, standing upright like a spear.</p><p></p><p>Under the black cat-faced mask, his eyes gleamed with a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>"That Li Che kid's mind is drawn and settled within, observing the deity for two hours. I hope that kid can withstand it, and not be harmed by the deity's spiritual nature..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He then turned his head to look into the distance, and saw a figure in a white robe, wearing a white mask, slowly walking out from the snowy forest, with his scattered hair flying in the snow.</p><p></p><p>The smooth, flawless white mask had no features carved on it.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer had several statuettes hanging from his waist, each about the size of a palm, carved in the image of children, some worshipping, some weeping, with various expressions, lifelike in appearance.</p><p></p><p>However, few possessed any spiritual nature, clearly not the work of a master.</p><p></p><p>"You have appeared again..."</p><p></p><p>"For the third or fifth time, do you wish to fight me again today?"</p><p></p><p>The white-masked man said, his voice slightly hoarse.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes, staring at the wooden carvings hanging from the man's waist: "Worshipping the temple deity... you dare?"</p><p></p><p>The man sighed lightly and shook his head: "It is merely a desperate measure taken in a dire situation... If you were in my shoes, you would do the same, wouldn't you?"</p><p></p><p>"We are, after all, just minor cultivators in the countryside, not the gifted disciples of the great sects with abundant resources, nor the divine warrior reserves of the major temple authorities backed by the imperial armory. Everything we have... must be fought for."</p><p></p><p>"Worshipping... is also a form of fighting."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his head and did not say much more.</p><p></p><p>Everyone who does evil deeds will find their own justifications, and others cannot sway their beliefs.</p><p></p><p>"Come then, old man may not have much divine power left, but it should be enough to play with you."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Countless snowflakes exploded from the ground, Li Qingshan's body wrapped in divine power, while a circular divine foundation rose behind the white-masked man.</p><p></p><p>The two engaged in battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan intentionally diverted the battlefield, heading deeper into the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>The candle flames flickered restlessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was pounding, this was the most daring thing he had ever done, even more so than when he first made the decision to kill.</p><p></p><p>But his impulse was not a whim, after all... he had the "Heavenly Thunder Chess Sage", and if he sensed anything amiss, he could instantly teleport to the chess piece anchor point in the city and leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had said that the temple deity of a Level 10 Mysterious Temple was equivalent to the Divine Foundation Realm, although far stronger than ordinary Divine Foundation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Che believed that a Divine Foundation level existence... should not be able to block his Dao Fruit ability.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Che's gaze burned with determination.</p><p></p><p>His fingers opened and closed, gradually descending.</p><p></p><p>Covering the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spirit Child Statue" with its furious expression.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an extremely scorching sensation spread from his palm, as if he was not grasping a statue, but a red-hot branding iron forged through countless hammerings!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed with concentration, his mind extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>His arm emanated a jade-like glow, shrouded in a jade mist.</p><p></p><p>The divine technique in its nascent form, the Thousand Separation Palm! Vaguely, it seemed that a thread of divine power was being extracted from the temple deity statue, beginning to coalesce into the shape of a chess piece.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he had previously gathered divine power chess pieces from the deceased Zhao Xuanhai, this was far more difficult.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>He was trying to pull out a deeply embedded wooden branch, but the roots had spread and entangled underground, making it extremely arduous.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, despite the difficulty, Li Che had the patience, slowly... pulling bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was engaged in a tug-of-war with the slumbering temple deity.</p><p></p><p>A thick and resilient divine power seemed to be extracted from the statue, swirling around the tips of his Thousand Separation Palm.</p><p></p><p>Two hours had passed in Li Che's consciousness, as if it had flown by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As the sky gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately released his hand.</p><p></p><p>Retreating, he jumped down from the altar.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple was dimly lit by candles, the wooden statues painted in red, seemingly looking at him with an eerie gaze.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was oblivious, his emotions in turmoil, as he raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like glow spread, and half a chess piece... emerged in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The chess piece was formed from an extremely dark divine power, only half a piece.</p><p></p><p>Yet the intensity of this divine power made Li Che's heart slightly startled, even more robust and formidable than the divine foundation fragment he had obtained from the old ancestor of the Si family.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes, raising his hand, and the [Unsullied Heart] Dao Fruit pulsed...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the unsullied divine power he exhaled condensed into a white chess piece.</p><p></p><p>As his divine power cultivation improved, the number of unsullied divine power chess pieces he could condense also increased.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hid the divine power chess pieces under the altar, using them as a coordinate anchor point.</p><p></p><p>Since he could confirm that he could absorb the temple deity's divine power...</p><p></p><p>He naturally had to find opportunities to indulge in it a few more times.</p><p></p><p>First, set up a coordinate, and it would be much easier to come and go.</p><p></p><p>It was almost dark, and Li Qingshan had not yet returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Three-Eyed Spirit Child deity sitting high on the altar, he suddenly exerted force beneath his feet, his figure rocketing out of the mysterious temple, shooting towards the outside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Back in the inner city, Li Che removed his disguise, putting away the mask, clothes, and other items into his spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he went to the Golden Brilliance Pavilion to order some wine and dishes, then returned to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya was diligently practicing martial arts in the courtyard. Ever since Li Che had taught her the martial arts, she had been cultivating hard every day, knowing that she had a late start, so she wanted to catch up to her husband through hard work.</p><p></p><p>"My lord."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya wore a set of training clothes, with a thin waistband cinching her curvaceous figure.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the corner of Li Che's lips as he walked up behind her and embraced her with his hands: "My lady, would you like your lord to teach you some fist techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's pretty face blushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>After cuddling for a while, the old Chen, who was sitting under the eaves drinking gourd wine, finally couldn't help but feel disgusted: "Cough cough cough... You young couple, I'm still here!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't you two lovebirds stop showing off your affection in front of this old man?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen raised his gourd, extremely annoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're still here? Didn't you go for a stroll?" Li Che turned back and feigned surprise.</p><p></p><p>"If you just change your position, won't you not be able to see it? Old Chen was immediately furious, this household was no longer livable, this Li Che... was no longer as honest as before! Hugging his gourd of wine, the irritated Old Chen prepared to leave home.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, why don't you go to the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery on the way and pick up Xixing and Lv Datou?" Li Che's calm voice drifted out.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen became even more annoyed, Aiya, there was no way to live this life!</p><p></p><p>However, Old Chen still hurriedly went to the Spiritual Cultivation Monastery to pick up Xixing and Lv Cheng. Holding Xixing, Old Chen had a full smile of doting, and the idea of leaving home also faded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not a good son, but Old Chen had Xixing.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>After sending Xixing and Lv Cheng to the Spiritual Cultivation Monastery, Li Che came to the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>After his martial cultivation reached the qi vein realm, the usual practice was to cultivate, circulate the internal qi and blood, store qi in the five viscera, and rotate the small celestial cycle, to accumulate and strengthen the internal qi. This was the main focus of this stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was also a matter of grinding.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of spiritual nature had not been neglected either. Cultivating the "Wrathful Amitabha" spiritual nature, refining Zhao Xuanhai's spiritual nature chess piece, it must be said that Li Che's spiritual cultivation speed was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual stream in the Nirvana Inner Realm was constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>After completing a series of daily essentials.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on a wide-brimmed hat and a cute ox mask, transforming into the Ox Demon, his mind activating the "Chess Saint" Dao fruit, observing the situation of the Bizarre Temple through the anchor placed under the strange altar, before opening the teleportation of the Flying Thunder Chess Saint.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, Li Che grasped a white chess piece.</p><p></p><p>But his figure had already arrived in the extremely gloomy "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spirit Child Bizarre Temple".</p><p></p><p>The temple was extremely quiet, with the pungent smell of candles permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed his hands and floated up to the altar, beginning to absorb the spiritual energy of the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>It basically took two hours to absorb half a piece of spiritual energy chess piece.</p><p></p><p>It took two days to condense a complete chess piece.</p><p></p><p>This efficiency was vastly different from when he was absorbing Zhao Xuanhai's spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Day after day passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten days flew by like grains of sand.</p><p></p><p>As for the wood carving he had promised the Young City Lord Cao Qingyuan, Li Che had not the slightest intention of picking up a knife.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the purpose of the City Lord's Mansion in summoning the wood carving masters to carve the wood carvings, Li Che no longer had the heart to pick up the knife.</p><p></p><p>In the Bizarre Temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che skillfully jumped onto the altar, staring at the "Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spirit Child Temple Deity" who seemed both angry and aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Old friend, I'm here again..."</p><p></p><p>Striving to condense the fifth piece of temple deity spiritual energy chess piece today.</p><p></p><p>"I've almost finished refining Zhao Xuanhai's spiritual energy chess pieces... My current 'Wrathful Amitabha' spiritual nature has also barely reached the 'Cultivating Spiritual Nature like a River' level, after that there won't be Zhao Xuanhai's spiritual energy chess pieces for me to refine anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, this temple deity's spiritual energy chess pieces are also of the 'Wrathful Spiritual Nature' lineage..."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how much of this temple deity's spiritual energy I can pluck? Will it be enough... to forge a spiritual foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che revealed a dazzling big white smile.</p><p></p><p>Skillfully unfolding his hands towards the almost encrusted head of the Spirit Child Temple Deity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds piled up layer upon layer.</p><p>Oppressive and gloomy, with electric dragons rolling within.</p><p>Cold raindrops poured down from thousands of feet above, splattering on the ground, exploding into mist, obscuring the world.</p><p></p><p>Inner City, Xu Family.</p><p>Outside the Spiritual Cultivation Monastery.</p><p>The flashes of lightning revealed one dark figure after another, they wore black clothes, wore wide-brimmed hats, and wore children's masks, silently crossing the rain.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery... still has two spirit children."</p><p></p><p>"The old man of the Xu Family has already made a deal with the City Lord's Mansion... tacitly turning a blind eye..."</p><p></p><p>A burly figure pressed down on his wide-brimmed hat.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe? Two spirit children? Since we've come, we must take all the spirit children of the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery."</p><p></p><p>"Move quickly, catch and leave, send them to the City Lord's Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"After this matter is settled, our Yang Family can immediately organize the clan members to withdraw from Flashing Thunder City."</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, please continue reading, please continue reading, self-reflect every day, please support with monthly votes, please support with recommendation votes!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The metal tubes, under the surging energy, gradually turned red, like an enraged ferocious beast, bursting out the ultimate light and heat!</p><p></p><p>The six metal tubes of Nanwuxian Gatling gun wielded by Xixia began to heat up, and the spirit wood raven hidden within started to roar out!</p><p></p><p>The bursting golden light gushed out from the muzzle.</p><p></p><p>Bam bam bam bam—</p><p></p><p>Streaks of golden light, like swords tearing through the heavens and slicing through the darkness, pulled long golden lines, bombarding towards the Golden Third Prince who was soaring on the golden wind fire wheel!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! The sounds of explosions reverberated through the divine hall, the raging airflow constantly ravaging and impacting!</p><p></p><p>Brilliant bursts of fireworks, as if decorating the golden divine hall, kept blooming in the air!</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves spread out, disturbing the air!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had set three levels of power for Xixia's Nanwuxian Gatling gun. Clearly, facing the Golden Third Prince, the trial set up in this golden divine hall was simply unreasonable. She directly chose the maximum firepower! Even if it was an existence from mythology, entering reality, so what?</p><p></p><p>As long as the firepower was sufficient, Xixia would have no fear in her heart, only... a frenzy for setting off fireworks!</p><p></p><p>The small golden boy cast in gold, his golden eyes emitting golden smoke, the golden smoke constantly pulling out serpentine golden curves in the air.</p><p></p><p>The wind fire wheel kept spinning on his golden cast feet, sparks flying, the airflow howling, carrying his body, dodging left and right in the air at the ultimate speed.</p><p></p><p>That speed...</p><p></p><p>It was truly too fast!</p><p></p><p>Floating in the air, yet it was as if he was walking on flat ground, moving so lightly and nimbly! However, Xixia did not hold back at all, unleashing full firepower, constantly shifting the gun barrel, scorching hot and rolling, spinning at lightning speed every second!</p><p></p><p>Like golden light swords continuously shooting out as flying swords! Entering the void, slashing out at high speed! Boom boom boom! Although unable to hit the golden cast Third Prince, it still forcefully suppressed the opponent in the distant sky, preventing him from approaching Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Suddenly, a thunderous explosion, bursting open!</p><p></p><p>A brilliant smile appeared on Xixia's face, because an immensely huge firework bloomed with light and heat, enveloping in thick black smoke, exploding in the air!</p><p></p><p>Hit!</p><p></p><p>The golden cast Third Prince was hit by her Crow Crow! Blooming the ultimate dazzling firework! The raging airflow, forming concentric circular ripples, kept dispersing outwards, forming a violent wind, blowing Xixia's clothes sewn by her mother Zhang Ya tightly against her body.</p><p></p><p>Xixia crouched and stood, her small figure bearing the Nanwuxian Gatling gun, like an unyielding rock in the howling wind.</p><p></p><p>Her face was filled with excited smiles.</p><p></p><p>The gun barrel glowed red, scorching hot, aimed at the exploding firework, frantically spitting out the spirit wood ravens! In the highest firepower state, the explosive power was stronger, and the penetrating power was also stronger! But...</p><p></p><p>Li Che had only prepared eight hundred enhanced spirit wood ravens for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom! One shot hit, then it was a barrage of bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was almost self-taught when it came to setting off fireworks, her control of range, accuracy, and angle, if categorized as martial arts, would at least be at the Grand Accomplishment level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to Li Che who possessed the [Nanwu] Dao fruit, the gap was still there.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the exploding fireworks...</p><p></p><p>Xixia suddenly ceased the firepower output, and rocket-jumped on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Bang—! A golden fire spear stabbed into the ground, this was not the true Purple Flame Snake Spear, the real one was in Xixia's arm.</p><p></p><p>But the power was also extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>The floor of the divine hall directly caved in, pierced through, with radiating cracks instantly expanding!</p><p></p><p>Xixia had just stabilized her footing when her chubby cheeks trembled.</p><p></p><p>She saw that the exploding fireworks above the sky were suddenly stirred up, like a whale swallowing a dragon, converging entirely onto that golden wind fire wheel.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Third Prince's eyes were sharp, the golden irises emanating dazzling battle intent!</p><p></p><p>With a bang...</p><p></p><p>The exploding flames of the spirit wood ravens instantly transformed into two horizontal fire dragons beneath the Third Prince's feet! Like an extremely compressed propulsive force, the Third Prince's speed was too fast!</p><p></p><p>Xixia did not hesitate at all, raising the Nanwuxian Gatling gun, the gun barrel starting to scorch and rotate! The last few dozen spirit wood ravens transformed into golden light swords, roaring and howling as they shot out.</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Third Prince actually...</p><p></p><p>Amid the impenetrable light swords, like a swimming dragon!</p><p></p><p>The two fire dragons, twisting like braided ropes, then thunderously crashed in front of Xixia! Xixia's body trembled, only feeling that the floor of the divine hall seemed to emit a long-lasting rumbling sound under the massive impact of the Third Prince's landing! Boom—! The golden five fingers rose and clenched, the golden fire spear stabbed into the ground far away, trembling and shaking, shooting towards him, grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly swinging it, the fire snake coiled, whirling with a terrifying arc, then heavily smashed down towards Xixia!</p><p></p><p>Xixia's expression turned grave, but in her heart, she muttered, the firepower is not enough... Next time, she needs to get more Crows from Master Niuiu.</p><p></p><p>The firepower must be sufficient, only then will Xixia feel at ease!</p><p></p><p>The Primal Golden Vajra Ring trembled from her neck, suddenly bursting out, colliding with the golden fire spear that the Third Prince had slammed down.</p><p></p><p>This Seven Element Treasure Artifact had formidable power, but now Xixia could only barely activate it, exerting some strength.</p><p></p><p>Clang—</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, the Primal Golden Vajra Ring was violently knocked away, falling far away.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia also took the opportunity to increase the distance.</p><p></p><p>Clenching her five fingers, the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist at the Grand Master level was struck out, with a blurry white tiger phantom appearing, its power not weak though.</p><p></p><p>But the Golden Third Prince clenched his five fingers, rapidly colliding with Xixia's punch.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's tiny figure, pitter-pattering as she rapidly retreated, her thrice-replenished flesh body, actually trembling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head to look at her own fist, faintly reddening, almost about to break the skin.</p><p></p><p>It hurt.</p><p></p><p>And with just one punch, Xixia knew...</p><p></p><p>Today's beating, she was destined to take it.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't win, couldn't win at all.</p><p></p><p>Although this Golden Third Prince's strength was also at the Replenishment Realm, the level of Cultivating Nature like a River.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Xixia felt she had no chance of victory at all.</p><p></p><p>Was she really going to be beaten to tears? But...</p><p></p><p>Xixia was not afraid, in a fight... there will be injuries, and she needs to grow through the injuries! Xixia gritted her teeth, the last time with Shangguan Qinglei, she was also filled with trepidation, she knew that her father and mother were very worried about her.</p><p></p><p>She even secretly saw her mother shedding tears when alone, worried about her injuries, worried about her encountering danger.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Xixia had secretly told herself that she must become stronger.</p><p></p><p>To the extent of being able to beat up everyone! Xixia took a deep breath, putting away the Nanwuxian Gatling gun given by Master Niuiu, her small face delicate, her big eyes very spiritual.</p><p></p><p>Her tiny figure, yet her flesh body was extremely powerful, her qi and blood surging and burning, when mobilized, the internal energy gushing out, her physique crystalline!  Xixia stepped her foot, rocket-jumping towards the Golden Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Third Prince's golden eyes held arrogance and disdain, even throwing the fire spear away, stabbing it into the ground, trembling as he charged towards Xixia with bare hands.</p><p></p><p>The two small figures were engaged in fierce battle in the vast golden divine hall, in front of the golden statue of the Heavenly King.</p><p></p><p>And on the palm supporting the golden pagoda of the Heavenly King statue, a golden incense was lit, slowly burning, as if keeping time.</p><p></p><p>Bang—</p><p></p><p>Xixia was once again sent flying, her tiny figure, heavily crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Xixia quickly climbed back up, rushing towards the Golden Third Prince again!</p><p></p><p>Xixia would not easily admit defeat!</p><p></p><p>The burning fighting spirit made Xixia fully display all the martial arts and combat techniques taught by Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Third Prince was almost like a temple deity, undefeatable at the same level! His golden cast physique was extremely tough and resilient, his strength far exceeding Xixia's.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But the little girl, at such a young age, was stubborn and proud, not giving up at all, rushing up again and again, only to be sent flying again and again.</p><p></p><p>A kind of persistence of smashing through the southern wall without turning back!</p><p></p><p>Thud—</p><p></p><p>Countless times of being sent flying.</p><p></p><p>Xixia pursed her lips, her big eyes brimming with tears, but she did not cry! In fighting this Golden Third Prince, Xixia would become stronger, she should not cry!</p><p></p><p>Xixia wanted to become powerful, so that her mother and father would not worry!</p><p></p><p>Xixia would not cry!</p><p></p><p>The little girl gritted her teeth, her chubby cheeks puffed up, turning bright red.</p><p></p><p>She shakily got up, her tiny legs trembling, having difficulty supporting her body.</p><p></p><p>She looked at that Golden Third Prince, as if everything was spinning around...</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xixia's heavy eyelids could no longer withstand, closing and opening slowly, gradually being swallowed by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the divine hall, a heartbroken sigh suddenly resounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che appeared beside Xixia, embracing the injured Xixia.</p><p></p><p>A golden light descended from the golden statue of the Heavenly King, enveloping Xixia's body, fully restoring her injuries.</p><p></p><p>Only, the unyielding fighting spirit had exhausted Xixia's spirit, and she was now soundly asleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xixia, having just seen the scene of Xixia fighting the Golden Third Prince through the reflection of the Flying Thunder Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was a test, so he did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that Xixia would automatically give up after exhausting the ammunition of the Nanwuxian Gatling gun.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected the little girl to have the willpower that even surprised him and made him feel heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"Not wanting to make your father and mother worry, so you want to become strong quickly?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che wiped the beads of sweat on Xixia's forehead, the tenderness in his eyes becoming even more profound.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, how obedient you are."</p><p></p><p>"It's because I, as your father, am not strong enough, that you have to bear such a burden at such a young age."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>It was all his fault as a father.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze shifted, looking at the small butterfly on Xixia's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Protect Xixia."</p><p></p><p>The small butterfly spread its wings and immediately flew away, landing on Xixia's back, as if Xixia had grown butterfly wings, flapping to carry her small figure and fly away.</p><p></p><p>It landed in the distance, and the small butterfly emanated intense divine energy, forming a semi-circular divine energy shield, enveloping Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Li Che withdrew his gaze, his sight falling on the Golden Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>The other party tilted his head, seemingly puzzled by the change in the one being tested.</p><p></p><p>"Enjoying the beating?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scorching hot and intense qi in his body suddenly erupted, just taking a step, the entire divine hall seemed to tremble! Howling winds arose, the terrifying pressure emanating from Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The true pressure of a Furnace Sect Master! Bang—</p><p></p><p>The floor of the divine hall seemed to be stamped out with a circle of radiating cracked lines by his footstep.</p><p></p><p>Although the cracks were slowly healing and closing, the visual impact was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had already transformed into a straight scarlet line, appearing in front of the Golden Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Third Prince opened his mouth, seemingly letting out a silent furious roar, his aura suddenly soaring, instantly stepping into the Sect Master realm, obviously with the change in the one being tested, the Third Prince's strength would also rise accordingly! True qi surging, as if transforming into a scaly dragon, with a real white tiger roaring out, then dissipating into eight white tigers, evolving into extremely sharp and piercing spear shadows!</p><p></p><p>The Furnace Sect Master, the nine martial arts cultivated to the Transformation Realm, were fused and integrated in his hands, intertwining and transforming!</p><p></p><p>Changeable and unpredictable, difficult to fathom! The Golden Third Prince was instantly bewildered!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying qi exploded into a hazy blood mist, golden mist bursting out from the Third Prince's body like cannonballs shooting backwards.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood still, his true qi transforming into a long bow, suddenly drawing the bow.</p><p></p><p>Countless wailing ghost cries roared out in a dense barrage.</p><p></p><p>The bow was like lightning, the arrows like thunder! The moment the Third Prince landed, countless ghost shadows, accompanied by a majestic true qi arrow barrage, had already pierced through, as if having a life of their own, circling once, then viciously drilling into the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The back of the Crown Prince's head! It was smashed, causing him to fly away.</p><p></p><p>Thud—</p><p></p><p>Li Che dispersed his true energy and the long bow, swaying his body, and shot out, landing at the spot where the Third Prince fell. The Blizzard Bone Wind Thunder Halberd was immediately in his hand, the Furious True Lord Three-Blade Sword!</p><p></p><p>The halberd's radiance shot out blade light, locking onto the location of the Golden Third Prince from various angles.</p><p></p><p>The blood and qi in Li Che's body were violently circulating, like a collapsed river, his viscera like a whirlpool, his spine like an exploding river dragon.</p><p></p><p>The true energy gushed out, fusing into the Three-Blade Sword, the omnipresent airflow, in the trembling and high-speed movement of the blade light, actually turned into a sky-covering wind blade!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it fiercely whipped the Golden Third Prince! Endless golden mist was sprayed unceasingly! For hitting my daughter, even if it's a trial...</p><p></p><p>I'm not happy!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom boom—</p><p></p><p>The Golden Third Prince seemed a bit dazed from the beating, his golden-cast body being knocked away repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely angry, his ordinary sect master cultivation unable to harm Li Che, continuously raising his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was also unrestrained, activating the Dragon Elephant Vajra! As the Dao fruit trembled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body grew taller, his spine roaring, his large tendons trembling, like a demon or a god!</p><p></p><p>You, the Golden Third Prince, can unlock that state? Are you kidding? I can too! Boom! Boom! Boom!!! The entire divine hall's ground was cut to pieces by countless wind blades, the cracks intertwined and repaired, but the divine hall's recovery speed was also accelerating!</p><p></p><p>When the Golden Third Prince was smashed away by Li Che again.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>A terrifyingly powerful aura suddenly burst out from the Golden Third Prince's body, the Golden Windfire Wheel spinning at high speed, the Golden Fire Spear gripped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The raging fire in his eyes erupted, his aura bursting like a geyser, instantly reaching the level of a Furnace Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Inner Landscape trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Six Wheel Divine Foundation bloomed behind him like a peacock spreading its tail! The Golden Third Prince's gaze gradually became puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The beating continues.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Peak, Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>The robe of Nan Li Huo fluttered in the wild wind, rustling, constantly flying.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, quietly waiting for Xixie to enter the Golden King Tower and the results of the first trial assessment.</p><p></p><p>"With Xixie's strength, against a Third Prince of the same realm, being able to persist for a third of an incense stick would already be considered good."</p><p></p><p>"Persisting for half an incense stick would be an extraordinary performance."</p><p></p><p>"If she can persist for a full incense stick..."</p><p></p><p>Hm? Nan Li Huo suddenly opened his eyes, looking at the Golden King Tower floating in the sky, rotating slowly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the divine hall opened.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was reflecting the scene inside the divine hall, the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xixie's sleeping figure was sent out, and Nan Li Huo flickered and caught Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Under the healing divine nature of the Golden Divine Palace, Xixie had no injuries, looking as pristine as a porcelain doll.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo looked up, his hair all scattered, gazing at the Golden Divine Palace he had not set foot in for a long time, and this look... made him stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because, the golden statue of the King in the Golden Divine Palace was holding the Golden Tower in the palm of its hand.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Third Prince, cast in gold, stood with his feet on the Windfire Wheel, holding the Fire Spear, hands on his hips.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the battered and bruised appearance, it would truly be majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingnan Road, City of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Treasure Eaves Nine Dragon Arched Pearl Heavenly Treasure Tower.</p><p></p><p>An old man with flying hair sat cross-legged on a mat, his fingers pressing a treasure seal, his ears large, the earlobes hanging down, as if containing precious pearls.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old man opened his eyes, his gaze deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, there seemed to be a blurry scene flowing.</p><p></p><p>The scene showed Xixie carrying the Immortal Craftsman Gatling Gun, bombarding the Golden Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Finally... the scene froze on the majestic yet bruised Golden Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head towards the direction of Yunzhou, his white eyebrows floating, revealing a trace of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yunzhou... the genius of the Golden Light Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>"The first trial in the divine hall of the Golden King Tower, battling fiercely with the Golden Third Prince..."</p><p></p><p>"Whose genius is this, who has beaten the Golden Third Prince to such a state?"</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right... this trial is not right..."</p><p></p><p>The old man muttered to himself, raising his hand to touch his large earlobes, rubbing them continuously.</p><p></p><p>"A bit chaotic, a bit messy."</p><p></p><p>Finger-calculating divination.</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuan Xie, from Fei Lei City, three and a half years old, blood exchange... cultivating temperament like a river... made the Third Prince cry... Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>The old man opened his eyes: "Chaotic, the Taoist is very chaotic..."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if someone... has blocked the heavenly secrets... I can't calculate it..."</p><p></p><p>"Completely unable to calculate!"</p><p></p><p>The old man closed his eyes, allowing his agitated emotions to return to calmness.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Light Mansion, the location of the Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince's mysterious temple?"</p><p></p><p>"This mysterious temple... is not simple at all... Now it has produced a genius of the generation... a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic, chaotic, chaotic..."</p><p></p><p>The old man exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Third Prince is unrivaled at the same level, this genius, although not bad, is still far from being able to be unrivaled at the same level."</p><p></p><p>"But only three years old... simply an age of invincibility, the 'Lingnan Road City Genius List' must have his name."</p><p></p><p>"Not enough to reach the first echelon, after all, he has not entered the Divine Foundation, then he will be ranked on the Genius List..."</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-one."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silently and invisibly, Li Che returned to the independent workshop courtyard in Falling Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>The surging blood and qi in his entire body gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>His gaze opened and closed, the heavy blood and qi like a dragon snake exhaling, stirring the calm airflow in the courtyard, gradually surging.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Third Prince... is really a good punching bag."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched, his entire body creaking, the muscles piled on his back like a demonic face.</p><p></p><p>Just after breaking through, he had such a good target to practice on, Li Che was truly very satisfied, not only venting for Xixie, but also adapting to the surging strength within himself, a win-win situation! Raising his five fingers, in the palm of his hand, a dark golden King Divine Nature Chess Piece appeared.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying positional pressure, like a storm, swept across, the entire courtyard flying with sand and stones, countless wood chips flying and shooting.</p><p></p><p>"The second King Divine Nature Chess Piece... hehe."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very happy, this was the third win.</p><p></p><p>He had thought it would be very difficult to obtain another King Chess Piece, but he did not expect that Xixie could enter once every half a year, which meant that he, Li Che, could pluck a King Divine Nature Chess Piece from the Golden King Statue once every half a year.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... When I was in the Golden Divine Palace, I tried to leave a Thunderbolt Chess Piece, I wonder if..."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Che condensed a Thunderbolt Chess Piece and threw it inside.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to try, if he could treat the Golden Divine Palace as his own backyard.</p><p></p><p>If he could come and go freely, wouldn't that mean he could see the golden King Statue he longed for every day? If he could condense a King Divine Nature Chess Piece every day...</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't dare to imagine how wonderful that would be.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che tried to move the Thunderbolt Chess Piece to enter.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared in the Golden Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying roar, like a thunderous clap, crashed down.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate towering positional pressure, like a giant wave, slammed down ruthlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Thief—"</p><p></p><p>"Get out!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che decisively and quickly grasped another Thunderbolt Chess Piece and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Divine Palace shook violently, the earth trembling.</p><p></p><p>The majestic and towering King Statue, glaring with fiery eyes!</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on a black tight outfit, rubbing his chin: "It seems I can't be too frequent, the King still has a temper... Once every half a year is just right, the temper will have subsided."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the sky, not continuing to cultivate, just having broken through to a higher realm, his spirit and energy refreshed.</p><p></p><p>He followed the Falling Flower Alley deeper, there was a small restaurant, this restaurant was located in a secluded place, but the chef's skills were surprisingly good.</p><p></p><p>A fly-infested restaurant can produce delicious food, some restaurants located in remote places, adhering to the principle of "the aroma of wine is not afraid of the depth of the alley", must have their own confidence.</p><p></p><p>Li Che arrived at the restaurant, a big black dog was lying at the entrance, lazily basking in the wind.</p><p></p><p>He ordered a table full of dishes and a pot of the restaurant owner's own brewed fine wine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che collected them all into the Spatial Storage, returning to the top of Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>Preparing to celebrate properly with his wife.</p><p></p><p>Just as he returned to the main courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya's long and straight legs were striking out with a bursting sound in the air.</p><p></p><p>Her bones were squirming and trembling! </p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya excitedly clenched her fists, stomping in place for a while.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tall figure in black clothes, Li Che, her eyes were shining! "Husband! I've tempered my bones!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya raised her smooth chin, excitedly and happily said.</p><p></p><p>She really had it hard, her husband and daughter were both first-class geniuses, the pressure on her was really too great!</p><p></p><p>But she didn't give up, slowly getting stronger under the pressure!</p><p></p><p>This feeling of chasing bit by bit was also very beautiful!</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and couldn't help but smile, in the past half a year, he had persistently used his pure divine nature to groom her body, and Zhang Ya's talent had also improved.</p><p></p><p>"Just right, I bought a table of good wine and food, let's call Shu Auntie and the Peak Master to celebrate together."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Ya drew closer, her pretty face blushing brightly, blinking her eyes at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Her earlobes even had a lustrous red glow, whispering: "Husband... tonight, do you have any bone tempering postures to teach me?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Discussing bone tempering postures made one a bit immersed.</p><p></p><p>Time does not wait, the seasons flow.</p><p></p><p>Two months passed like grains of sand between the fingers, flowing and slipping away.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che broke through to the Furnace Sect Master realm, he did not make any moves, just consolidating his own state.</p><p></p><p>The investigation of the hidden Corpse Deity Cult evil person in the Divine Sect was still ongoing, Elder Xu Jiuqing of the Law Enforcement Hall was investigating every day, but there was still no harvest.</p><p></p><p>But he was not in a hurry, since the evil person of the Corpse Deity Cult dared to hide, they must have the confidence and means to ensure they would not expose their tracks. </p><p></p><p>And Xu Jiuqing could not find the other party based on the Corpse Curse Imprint, so he could only use patience to grind the other party, through daily sweeping investigations, forcing the other party to panic and lose their composure, revealing their traces.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's divine sense had reached a critical moment, the divine pressure on Thunder Peak was becoming more and more dense.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, during this period, Li Che had not waited for Li Qingshan's hunting plan.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not in a hurry either, every day he just practiced punching, made wooden carvings, and nurtured his divine nature, while slowly refining the seven Corpse Curse Imprints suppressed on the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>When he had finished refining the seven Corpse Curse Imprints...</p><p></p><p>That would be the time for him to start his cleansing action, even if Li Qingshan was not there, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Once the seven Corpse Curse Imprints were successfully refined, the hidden Corpse Deity Cult experts in the Golden Light Mansion City could basically all be discovered by him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the position of the seven Corpse Curse Imprints was already very high.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the major forces in the Golden Light Mansion City had all become quiet, the entire city was peaceful and calm, even the Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince's mysterious temple in the center of the Nine Dragon River, had rarely had any mysterious disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Day after day passed steadily.</p><p></p><p>The sky was filled with large snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind was bone-piercing.</p><p></p><p>Falling Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>In the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, the Nirvana Inner Landscape rumbling, the seventh Worry Divine Nature Divine Foundation, was finally forged!</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>On the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>That Corpse Curse Imprint of the Seven Elements, all the rampaging and struggling corpse qi and death qi, under the suppression of the pure divine nature, finally... completely submitted! He opened his eyes, his powerful divine sense bursting out, the invisible waves of energy rippling out from his body like a distortion of the air, but soon returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a breath of hot air, Li Che's gaze was bright, slowly raising the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>A piece of icy cold snow fell on his face, melted by his scorching blood and qi into water.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>Another year of heavy snow in the cold winter has passed.</p><p></p><p>My Xixie, is four years old now.</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets, recommendation tickets, and continue reading!

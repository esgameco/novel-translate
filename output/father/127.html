        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Physiognomy...</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat emerged on Shangguan Zhenghen's forehead, as if they had been frozen, hanging stiffly on his face.</p><p></p><p>An invisible force appeared between heaven and earth, causing the flow of air to become extremely slow and stagnant.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen stood on the surface of the river, the waves surging, as if he could feel the undercurrent of the river through the surface.</p><p></p><p>The night wind was bitterly cold, brushing across his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>It caused every drop of blood in his body to freeze.</p><p></p><p>But a fierce expression soon appeared in Shangguan Zhenghen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why would a Divine Physiognomy expert intervene?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his affairs have been exposed?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! He has been very low-key in his actions, and has never used the "Corpse Summoning Art" in public. On the surface, he is the debonair patriarch of the Shangguan family.</p><p></p><p>With a Divine Physiognomy ancestor backing him, which powerful Divine Physiognomy expert would suddenly attack him? It's unreasonable! But Shangguan Zhenghen was unwilling to surrender.</p><p></p><p>A roar, as if making the entire river surface boil, his blood became even colder, as if it had lost all temperature, completely turning into the temperature of a corpse, all the heat being extracted, and the bronze color on his flesh becoming more and more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph? Still wanting to struggle?"</p><p></p><p>A faint voice drifted from all directions, the pressure like a sudden surge of tides, engulfing everything.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen spread his arms, his entire body trembling in every bone and sinew. He twisted his neck and raised it high, a roar bursting from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He forcibly tore open the oppressive aura brought by the Divine Physiognomy cultivator with his own physique!</p><p></p><p>That level of Divine Physiognomy pressure that made him unable to breathe!</p><p></p><p>A gloomy bronze luster surged from his flesh and blood, oozing and spreading from every inch of skin and flesh, the aura of death so thick that it was nauseating.</p><p></p><p>Facing the attack of the Divine Physiognomy cultivator, Shangguan Zhenghen's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>A palm-sized, divinely infused wooden sculpture suddenly appeared and was ruthlessly crushed by him without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a towering divine power surged! "Want to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that easy!" </p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen sneered.</p><p></p><p>After the broken wooden sculpture exploded, countless divine energies shot up to the sky, accompanied by the howling of fierce winds, as if inflated like a giant balloon, turning into a complete Divine Physiognomy.</p><p></p><p>A crystal-clear Divine Physiognomy appeared in the sky above, the overwhelming sense of terror bursting forth like a blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu's mocking voice floated between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He was not surprised that Shangguan Zhenghen unhesitatingly crushed the Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Facing the true Divine Physiognomy, the illusory one ultimately had an insurmountable level difference.</p><p></p><p>If Shangguan Zhenghen dared to try and test it with his newly learned Corpse Summoning Art, he would probably be slapped to death.</p><p></p><p>As the patriarch of a prominent family, possessing a Divine Physiognomy cultivator's Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture, which was refined with a large amount of divine energy to protect his life, was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the prominent families were not like the Fishing Clan, where the vice-clan master Liu Jinsong was beaten to death without having such a Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>After all, a Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture is an item that a Divine Physiognomy cultivator spends a year infusing their Divine Physiognomy divine energy into, requiring the exhaustion of a large amount of vital essence and spirit, in order to refine it as a life-saving object.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Physiognomy cultivator can at most refine three, any more would affect their Divine Physiognomy.</p><p></p><p>Although the Fishing Clan's clan master was a Divine Physiognomy cultivator, how could he possibly refine a Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture for a non-relative vice-clan master?</p><p></p><p>So, when Liu Jinsong was beaten to death, he didn't have a Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture to save himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had also anticipated this situation, so he called for Lin Xiu, a Divine Physiognomy realm cultivator, to provide backup! Obtaining the Divine Physiognomy support of his own ancestor, he withstood the Divine Physiognomy pressure brought by Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Zhenghen was reluctant, he finally broke free from the restraints! Boom! He stepped down heavily, like a massive boulder plunging into the great lake, causing a heaven-shaking commotion.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the surging torrents of air, Shangguan Zhenghen's face was cold, his body transformed into a Corpse Summoning Art Corpse Copper Body, violently smashing through the waves.</p><p></p><p>"Finish this quickly, no need to drag it out!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't wait for the old thing from the Shangguan family to come and intervene."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen took a heavy step, his eyes instantly bursting with overwhelming killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He knew who this voice belonged to.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>"So it was you... Li Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's body trembled, the water droplets exploding from the river surface being shattered and vaporized by his powerful physical strength.</p><p></p><p>The hazy river mist surged upward.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you?!"</p><p></p><p>The roar echoed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the roar was cut off!</p><p></p><p>Because the mist was torn open, a figure slashed through the fog, its stooped posture suddenly straightening up, with countless lightning bolts intertwining! </p><p></p><p>A ram's horn hammer slid out from the sleeve, sweeping across the arc, and numerous lightning bolts intertwined, forming a towering eagle-winged, fierce-faced divine phantom behind Li Qingshan! "How dare you?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you cultivate the Corpse Summoning Art, and even reach the level of the Corpse Copper Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen! How many innocent lives have you sacrificed?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's cat-faced mask suddenly shattered, his old face filled with cruelty and killing intent! Those associated with the Corpse Sect must die!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Shangguan Zhenghen crossed his arms to block, the ram's horn hammer striking his body, the terrifying Corpse Copper Body, transmitting a sound wave like an ancient bell exploding.</p><p></p><p>Ripple-like airflow burst into concentric circles of shockwaves...</p><p></p><p>His body was propelled away, Shangguan Zhenghen suddenly landed on the river surface, his legs tearing two white waves on the water surface, a delighted smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>He had blocked it! Shangguan Zhenghen was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's ram's horn hammer was known for its immense power in the capital city. It had killed countless experts, but now... he had blocked it with his bare flesh!</p><p></p><p>His flesh had already reached the level of a Corpse Copper Body, only lacking a tiny bit to be considered a true master, and it seemed the impact was not that great.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan...</p><p></p><p>He could no longer be killed!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the ram's horn hammer, just a name without substance!"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen burst out laughing, then unhesitatingly turned and fled, heading towards the direction of the Shangguan family.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of engaging in a bloody battle with Li Qingshan, after all, there was still a true Divine Physiognomy cultivator being obstructed by his ancestor's Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture above.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Physiognomy wooden sculpture was the divine manifestation of his ancestor, it could not block for long!</p><p></p><p>Fleeing was the most correct decision.</p><p></p><p>Even if his cultivation of the Corpse Summoning Art was exposed, with his ancestor's support, the worst he could do was give up the position of patriarch and leave the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>What could Li Qingshan do to him? As a powerful figure in the capital city of the Golden Light Prefecture, he still had the necessary authority, even if Li Qingshan obtained evidence of his crimes, so what? If crimes alone could lead to his death, there would not be so many wrongful cases in the world!</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know how Li Qingshan discovered his cultivation of the Corpse Summoning Art and summoned a Divine Physiognomy expert to kill him, as long as he could escape, he would have a chance! Li Qingshan naturally did not want to let Shangguan Zhenghen escape, he was well aware that once Shangguan Zhenghen was allowed to live, with the relationship between the five great families and the City Lord's Mansion, it would be difficult to convict Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Next time he wanted to kill him, it would not be so easy!</p><p></p><p>"Stay!" </p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan roared in anger, countless lightning bolts intertwining and coiling! Thunderous gaze, ram's horn divine punishment! Boom! Shangguan Zhenghen was sent flying again, exploding and tearing white waves on the river surface.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Zhenghen coughed up a bit of blood, his eyes shining with excitement: "Li Qingshan... you can't kill me anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not a Divine Physiognomy yet, and I've cultivated the Corpse Copper Body, you can't kill me! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>On his flesh, the sinews and bones trembled, three-headed angry dragons roaring up, the ultimate martial art, Eight Dragons Overturning the River!</p><p></p><p>True qi boiled and surged, like a curtain rising dozens of feet high! Gripping the ram's horn hammer, he struck again!</p><p></p><p>If one strike couldn't break it, then two, three...</p><p></p><p>Sooner or later, I'll smash you to pieces!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Splash! The river water was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the battle had almost erupted in a spectacular manner in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But the crossbow bolt that Shangguan Zhenghen had initially thrown out was almost ignored by everyone, yet it burst forth with a terrifying speed, heading towards the small boat that was like a speedboat!</p><p></p><p>On the boat, the young girl wearing a squirrel mask was frantically activating divine talismans, making the boat shoot forward even faster!</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Zhenghen was a Illusory Cultivator who had cultivated the Corpse Sect's Corpse Copper Body, his strength unparalleled and overbearing, the crossbow bolt he had thrown even directly chased down the one shot by her divine talisman bow.</p><p></p><p>The sound wave burst brilliantly, leaving a white trail on the river surface.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow, like a black lightning tearing through the river, the sound like a thunderclap!</p><p></p><p>Shooting straight towards her!</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>Under the squirrel mask, Shangguan Qinghong's face turned deathly pale, a glimpse of despair appearing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>So... it's still not enough, huh? She had planned and plotted so many times to assassinate Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Zhenghen was her biological father, she hated him with a passion, wishing to kill him with her own hands.</p><p></p><p>Because Shangguan Qinghong had witnessed her mother being "sacrificed" by Shangguan Zhenghen with her own eyes!</p><p></p><p>That was a lingering nightmare in her heart! </p><p></p><p>She could never imagine that a person could be so evil, watching her mother's flesh and blood slowly dissolve, her heart bleeding, and she had sworn then that she would definitely kill Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>As for Shangguan Zhenghen, he didn't care about her, his daughter, at all. After committing the crime in front of her, he left in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>He even let her live and grow up well, as if he was preparing her to be a future sacrificial material.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Shangguan Qinghong was later taken in by Lin Xiu and brought to the Astrology Bureau, finally escaping from this devil.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Qinghong's desire to kill the devil had never disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, upon learning that Shangguan Zhenghen had stayed overnight at Yunfang Pavilion for the first time in these few months, she began planning and taking action.</p><p></p><p>The divine talisman crossbow she had prepared was her greatest killing move.</p><p></p><p>It was also the only means she had, with her cultivation, to threaten Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Her divine talisman art was taught to her by Lin Xiu, and Lin Xiu was a divine talisman master at the Divine Physiognomy realm, his divine talisman mastery being so exquisite. He took in Shangguan Qinghong, not only out of pity, but also because he saw her talent in divine talismans.</p><p></p><p>"In the end... is it still not enough?"</p><p></p><p>"Can the evil person... continue to exist in the world without restraint?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the small boat, Shangguan Qinghong's body was ice cold, the divine crossbow bolt that had shot out, carrying Shangguan Zhenghen's "Extreme Dread Seizing the Divine" divine energy.</p><p></p><p>As the divine crossbow bolt approached, the Illusory Realm level pressure, the oppressive aura, gradually made her unable to even move a finger.</p><p></p><p>She could only watch helplessly as she awaited her death.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>The crossbow bolt drew near, the air surging, the squirrel mask she wore could not withstand this terrifying might, the cracks spreading until it shattered with a boom!</p><p></p><p>Revealing Shangguan Qinghong's delicate and beautiful but deathly pale face.</p><p></p><p>Unable to kill Shangguan Zhenghen, she had instead sealed her own fate.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was not unwilling to accept her own death, but rather unwilling... to fail to kill that beast, Shangguan Zhenghen! However,</p><p></p><p>Just as she thought she could not avoid the fate of being pierced by this divine crossbow bolt,</p><p></p><p>A sound of wind and thunder reached her ears, followed by endless ghostly wails, accompanied by the bowstring being drawn to its full moon, creaking, creaking...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The agonizing wails echoed...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong suddenly turned her head and saw a figure in the distance on the river surface, a tall figure.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a horse-faced mask, he was walking on the waves, drawing a bow and shooting arrows! Boom! The moment the arrow left the furious Xuanlei Serpent Bow, a vast expanse of wind and thunder exploded!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong only felt the sound of ghostly wails, the roar of the angry serpent, and the rumbling of wind and thunder resounding without end.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Hundred Ghosts Sorrowful Wind Thunder Arrow! The arrow shot towards her like a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>It collided with the divine crossbow bolt thrown by Shangguan Zhenghen! The divine energies contained in the arrow and the bolt clashed and erupted! Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The invisible shockwave rippled out in concentric circles, causing the surging river water to rise high on both sides, shattering the countless splashing water droplets into mist.</p><p></p><p>This arrow directly disrupted the trajectory of the divine crossbow bolt, completely throwing off its aim, grazing Shangguan Qinghong's fair and smooth cheek, and whistling away.</p><p></p><p>Silently, it plunged into the river surface and sank to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong panted heavily, her chest heaving violently, her eyes still filled with the terror of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Not dead... The crossbow bolt was deflected by an arrow! That arrow was the arrow that saved her life! Shangguan Qinghong felt her whole body go limp as she collapsed onto the boat, panting continuously.</p><p></p><p>But the tall figure wearing the horse-faced mask had already boarded the boat.</p><p></p><p>"I'll borrow the boat for a bit."</p><p></p><p>The Horse-faced said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, thank you for saving my life!" Shangguan Qinghong opened her eyes wide, filled with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>However, the Horse-faced did not respond to her.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the boat, the gaze under the Horse-faced mask was extremely deep and sharp.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he took out the "Namo Immortal Craftsman Barrett", which had been greatly improved and enhanced compared to when he used it to kill Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Its current power was much greater than before.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the target was also far more powerful than Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen, with his illusory cultivation and copper corpse physique...</p><p></p><p>"Sniping him should be a bit difficult."</p><p></p><p>"But at this distance, I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>The Horse-faced seemed to murmur softly, and the next moment, he took out the dragon tooth bodhi bullet that was like an artistic masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong behind him was dumbfounded, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to... know who this person was!</p><p></p><p>The legendary archer who had killed Qin Yuqing from tens of miles away!</p><p></p><p>So... it wasn't Niu Mo who killed Qin Yuqing after all! The case was solved! Shangguan Qinghong felt like she had uncovered a great secret. The Horse-faced... was the one who killed Qin Yuqing!</p><p></p><p>What was he going to do now? Shangguan Qinghong felt a sense of excitement, as if she was chasing a celebrity. She stood up, not daring to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Horse-faced insert the strange talisman into the peculiar mechanism.</p><p></p><p>It was neither a bow nor a crossbow...</p><p></p><p>Even the divine symbol crossbow could not kill Shangguan Zhenghen, so would this seemingly not-so-powerful mechanism in the Horse-faced's hand be effective?</p><p></p><p>The news of Qin Yuqing being killed from tens of miles away had spread far and wide, but Shangguan Zhenghen was no ordinary person like Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... why don't you try adding some divine talismans to increase the power?" Shangguan Qinghong tentatively suggested.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the horse-faced mask finally turned slightly, looking at Shangguan Qinghong.</p><p></p><p>Divine talismans?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Sniping was a very serious matter, requiring consideration of many factors. Recklessly adding a divine talisman, who knows how the effect would change?</p><p></p><p>If it ended up reducing the damage, it would be counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the fusion of divine talismans and the Barrett might require various experiments and adjustments.</p><p></p><p>It's not something that can be used just like that.</p><p></p><p>Li Che declined Shangguan Qinghong's kind offer.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, he focused his mind.</p><p></p><p>No longer paying attention to Shangguan Qinghong, Li Che, wearing the horse-faced mask, slowly exhaled, and his spirit and energy instantly coalesced into a single thread.</p><p></p><p>Towards Shangguan Zhenghen, Li Che's killing intent was more intense than ever before.</p><p></p><p>This was an immense threat.</p><p></p><p>Not only did this man offend his daughter Xixia, but he also harbored improper thoughts towards his wife.</p><p></p><p>He deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Today, with Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu restraining the target, this was the perfect opportunity to kill Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Li Che would absolutely not let this chance slip away.</p><p></p><p>So, he would use his strongest technique...</p><p></p><p>The sniper, the Horse-faced!</p><p></p><p>Preparations complete!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Horse-faced suddenly raised the Immortal Craftsman Barrett in his hand and crouched at the bow of the boat. The rippling waves caused the floating boat to sway up and down.</p><p></p><p>The divine energy emanating from the Horse-faced instantly stabilized the boat, making it as solid as a rock.</p><p></p><p>Intense killing intent seeped out from the Horse-faced.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit pulsed and vibrated.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the celestial chessboard expanded with the small boat on the Nine Dragon River as the star position.</p><p></p><p>The auras within the chessboard were very distinct and powerful. Lin Xiu's divine manifestation aura was dazzlingly brilliant, like a raging sun, and Li Qingshan's aura was also not weak, radiating a white light. But Shangguan Zhenghen's aura was extremely dark, emanating an intense black energy.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Shangguan Zhenghen's killing intent towards Li Che was extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>How coincidental, that when you wanted to kill me...</p><p></p><p>I also wanted to kill you.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutual pursuit, it seemed.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Craftsman Barrett was engraved with numerous patterns, similar to the talismanic scripts on divine talismans, which could concentrate and accumulate divine energy! This was the reason for the enhanced power of the improved Immortal Craftsman Barrett.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the sound of breathing and adjusting breaths remained.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Li Qingshan and the copper corpse Shangguan Zhenghen were chasing each other.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen, with his head covered, was single-mindedly running towards the shore, undoubtedly wanting to return to the Shangguan Mansion and seek the protection of the divine manifestation ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan was going to seize the opportunity while Shangguan Zhenghen was returning to strike.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was holding nothing back.</p><p></p><p>However, the troublesome and stubborn copper corpse was even more difficult to deal with than the iron corpse, withstanding Li Qingshan's blows as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan did not give up easily, swinging the ram's horn hammer again, attracting and channeling countless lightning webs to expand.</p><p></p><p>He swung it down fiercely, like an angry dragon roaring and crashing into the copper corpse Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's flesh was almost twisted into a strange shape, but his overwhelming hardness and toughness prevented him from dying.</p><p></p><p>He was shot out like a cannonball, splashing onto the river surface and creating a series of water skips.</p><p></p><p>When the last water skip bloomed, Shangguan Zhenghen flipped and rose, coughing up a mouthful of blood, the copper glow of his flesh accompanied by a dense aura of death.</p><p></p><p>He was about to flee again.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment he just stood up after the flip.</p><p></p><p>The Horse-faced, five hundred yards away, suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now is the time!</p><p></p><p>On the celestial chessboard,</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black temple god chess piece suddenly appeared in front of the Horse-faced, exploding with a bang and turning into dense black mist, merging into the "Dragon Tooth Bodhi" bullet, causing it to emanate black smoke-like energy.</p><p></p><p>The power surged! The divine sense locked onto the aura of Shangguan Zhenghen on the chessboard! "This shot..."</p><p></p><p>"The four divine bases... all bloom at once!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll send you..."</p><p></p><p>"To see the King of Hell!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a breath, and the heavens and earth fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Explode."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly pressed the trigger mechanism!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the cracks on the horse-faced mask at the brow opened, and in the inner realm of his Nirvana, the four divine bases almost simultaneously emerged behind him.</p><p></p><p>Divine energy... overwhelming! [The Angry True Lord of the Three Eyes], [The Sorrowful Demon Subduer], [The Suspended Thought Flowing Sword], [The Startled and Shocked Heart]! Anger, sorrow, thought, shock!</p><p></p><p>The four divine bases, like millstones, bloomed like a mandala from hell behind the Horse-faced, the surging divine energy almost simultaneously gushing out and infusing into the "Immortal Craftsman Barrett".</p><p></p><p>There was a sound of charging "Duu-" continuously accumulating! Shangguan Qinghong's legs weakened, and she directly collapsed onto the small boat, staring wide-eyed, her eyes seemingly devoid of light, as she blankly looked at the four emerging divine bases...</p><p></p><p>One person...</p><p></p><p>How could he possess four divine bases?! Is he human? Is he human?!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The terrifying explosion, causing the sound waves to shatter almost simultaneously, the scarlet Barrett, intertwined with five colors, in addition to the colors of the four great divine bases, also had a black divine energy from the Dragon Tooth Bodhi! Like a peacock spreading its tail towards the rising sun!</p><p></p><p>The powerful shockwave roared and gushed out from the muzzle, immediately after the Dragon Tooth Bodhi.</p><p></p><p>The entire boat was violently rocked, directly rebounding and almost shattering from the terrifying recoil impact, with countless cracks appearing on the boat's surface.</p><p></p><p>The boat was like a speedboat, shooting back over a hundred meters!</p><p></p><p>Layers of crashing and rapidly falling curtains of water waves erupted around it!</p><p></p><p>A dazzlingly brilliant golden light flashed on and off, and then...</p><p></p><p>The glowing red Dragon Tooth Bodhi shot out! Wrapped in five-colored divine light!</p><p></p><p>Tearing through the sound barrier, it pierced through the air!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen laughed heartily, his entire body emanating a copper glow, the lightning he had been deflecting was completely shaken off by him.</p><p></p><p>He had blocked Li Qingshan's blow again, and he felt extremely comfortable! Although he couldn't defeat Li Qingshan,</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan couldn't break through his defenses and kill him either! As long as he didn't act recklessly and focused on escaping back to the Shangguan Mansion to seek the protection of the ancestor, he wouldn't die!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly erupting from the distant boat!</p><p></p><p>He vaguely saw the four divine bases rising...</p><p></p><p>Saw the dazzling golden light gushing out...</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>His hair stood on end!</p><p></p><p>His eyes bulged!</p><p></p><p>The threat of death enveloped him completely! His copper corpse, which he had pushed to the limit, emanated a brilliant ancient copper glow, with a dense aura of death surging. He took a step forward, like a golden bell.</p><p></p><p>But just as the copper glow was flowing...</p><p></p><p>A sharp pain suddenly came from his chest!</p><p></p><p>That five-colored divine light that had appeared in the distance...</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, it had pierced through the chest of his copper corpse, tearing open his formidable defenses!</p><p></p><p>A piercing scream.</p><p></p><p>His flesh instantly exploded into clouds of blood! The blood droplets, like falling bodhi leaves, pattered to the ground!</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen finally heard the thunderous sound of air being pierced in the air!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, wearing the cat-faced mask, appeared at Shangguan Zhenghen's side, his copper corpse flesh having been shattered and spraying blood.</p><p></p><p>Aiming at his undefended head, he struck with his hammer! Crack! The skull exploded, flesh and blood flying, brain matter splattering!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qingshan was horrified, his hand holding the hammer even trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"So this is Niu Mo's friend... the Horse-faced?!"</p><p></p><p>"What a fast shot!"</p><p></p><p>Please give me monthly votes, recommendation votes, and continued support, Li Che thanks you!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong had already taken his leave and returned home, clearly sensing the atmosphere of intense magical battles between powerful cultivators within the capital city, knowing that a major event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had somehow produced a long staff, setting up a bench in the courtyard, sitting with the staff resting across his lap, his rugged face twitching, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that he too had sensed the disturbance in the capital and had chosen to stand guard over the courtyard with his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Although Old Chen guessed that Li Che's cultivation had long surpassed his own, he still decided to take a stand.</p><p></p><p>"Has the carving finished?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che emerge from the study, Old Chen's brow relaxed as he let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, glancing at the night sky filled with flashing thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>Those were the clashes between Sage Cultivators, their might astounding.</p><p></p><p>Reaching hundreds of meters into the sky, it was as if immortals were battling, exceeding all imagination.</p><p></p><p>Even Illusion Cultivators could freely fly and hover hundreds of meters in the air, but for those who had truly attained the Sage Realm and mastered divine powers, soaring thousands of meters was no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Sage Cultivators had lifespans reaching hundreds of years, naturally accompanied by superhuman and formidable powers.</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining the situation he had discovered, Old Chen uncapped his gourd and started gulping down liquor.</p><p></p><p>"The capital... is not safe either. In this world, there is truly no place that is safe."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen shook his head. </p><p></p><p>Li Che fell silent, having to admit that Old Chen had a point.</p><p></p><p>Not just in this era, but for over a thousand years, strange temples had constantly appeared, always bringing calamities and demonic forces running rampant. </p><p></p><p>True peace was but a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, you should go rest early, I'll keep watch tonight."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said softly.</p><p></p><p>"More hands make lighter work, I can manage..." Old Chen chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's figure shifted, his bones and sinews resonating as his surging vital energy erupted, his great tendons trembling like roaring dragons.</p><p></p><p>Blood Refinement Thrice Over!</p><p></p><p>Old Chen: "..."</p><p></p><p>Pardon the interruption.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen silently picked up his liquor jug and headed towards his room.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, this kid Li Che, he actually did Blood Refinement Thrice Over, and he's only been training for a short while... Old Chen felt like he had witnessed Li Che's rise from humble beginnings.</p><p></p><p>That timid worker who used to carefully move wooden sculptures, had unknowingly become a Blood Refinement master.</p><p></p><p>He, Chen Dabao, was no longer the strongest in this household.</p><p></p><p>Watching the grumbling Old Chen leave, Li Che couldn't help but chuckle lightly.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the bench, his gaze like pillars, peering into the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, the entire Golden Light Prefecture...</p><p></p><p>Was destined to have many sleepless souls.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Sage Cultivators' battle seemed to be tacitly avoiding the common people.</p><p></p><p>It was more like a loud thunder with light rain.</p><p></p><p>A peaceful night passed.</p><p></p><p>The Morning Star rose as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Che took a leave from the Astronomical Observatory and stayed home to accompany his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Xixia sat on the stone steps, holding the miniature Sanmukha machine that Niu had given her, gently caressing it, cherishing it dearly.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to set off fireworks, when will Niu Shifu come take me to set off fireworks..."</p><p></p><p>The little girl was lost in thought, feeling like it had been so long since she last set off fireworks.</p><p></p><p>Her little crow was almost rusting.</p><p></p><p>Listening to Xixia's muttering, Li Che was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>The little girl had not hidden the fact that she had obtained the Sanmukha machine. In her eyes, her father, mother, and Uncle Chen were all people she could trust.</p><p></p><p>Now she had to add Niu Shifu, and... half of Lü Chi, well, only half.</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze caressed, new buds sprouting.</p><p></p><p>All things were bursting with obvious vitality.</p><p></p><p>The willow branches swayed, the air carrying the fresh, cleansing scent of new life.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Hear Fragrance Alley, the sound of a carriage approached.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Che, who was just starting to train the little stinker Xixia, immediately sensed it through the Heavenly Earth Chessboard and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>When the carriage curtain was lifted, Lü Chi supported Elder Sumu as she stepped down from the carriage, and Li Che was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Familiar faces, so Li Qingshan really did manage to lure Elder Sumu away.</p><p></p><p>Little stinker Xixia would definitely be very happy that Elder Sumu had come, right?</p><p></p><p>In addition to Elder Sumu, the lazy Li Qingshan also jumped down from the carriage and walked towards the courtyard along the blue stone path.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the tightly closed courtyard gate, hearing Xixia's reluctant wails about not wanting to train, Elder Sumu couldn't help but press her lips together and smile.</p><p></p><p>Gently knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, go open the door."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xixia, unwilling but obedient, dragged a short wooden stick as she walked towards the courtyard gate, standing on her tiptoes to unlatch the door.</p><p></p><p>Then she saw the kindly Elder Sumu standing at the door.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes immediately widened: "Wow! Grandma!"</p><p></p><p>She rubbed her big eyes with her chubby little hand, staring intently.</p><p></p><p>Doubting if she was dreaming, but realizing that Elder Sumu had not turned into a fragrant roasted duck, she confirmed that she was not dreaming!</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Grandma has come, Father, Grandma has come to see me!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia immediately threw down the wooden stick and flung herself into Elder Sumu's embrace.</p><p></p><p>In the Xu family's Sage Cultivation Monastery, Elder Sumu had trained with Xixia for a long time, and they had an excellent relationship.</p><p></p><p>Elder Sumu, who had no children of her own, treated all these children as her own, doting on them deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Oh dear, little Xixia, let Grandma take a look, you've even gotten thinner, does your father not feed you?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Sumu squatted down, caressing Xixia's cheeks, her wrinkled face coming alive with a smile, full of concern.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, who was in the middle of training, also hurriedly stopped and came over, enthusiastically greeting them.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was overjoyed, encountering familiar faces from Fei Luo City in the capital, feeling a sense of meeting old friends in a strange land.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, with his hair tied in a Nezha braid, entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This girl..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at Xixia, he had come to find Li Che this time, knowing Li Che's identity as Niu Mo, so he had an important matter to discuss with him.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, just a glance at Xixia gave him a surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Bone Refining? Wait... It's almost Bone Refining Completion?! Bone Refining Completion at three years old?!"</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qingshan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>No, how could it be so fast? He knew Xixia was an exceptional spiritual child, but not to this extent? He had estimated that Xixia would be able to complete Bone Refining by the age of seven, which would already be considered exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>Bone Refining at seven, combined with Sage Realm pills, with the hope of Blood Refinement at nine, Meridian Condensation at twelve, and establishing a Sage Foundation - once she achieved this, she would have the potential to enter the true Sage Sect!</p><p></p><p>But now, Xixia was about to complete Bone Refining at three years old...</p><p></p><p>It had shattered Li Qingshan's growth plan for Xixia.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che would say, it's like finishing high school courses in kindergarten...</p><p></p><p>This girl is going to soar to the heavens! Li Qingshan took a deep breath, a solemn look appearing in his eyes, his brows even unconsciously furrowing.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking, could it be that Xixia might be possessed by a temple deity, or even be reborn as a temple deity?</p><p></p><p>This possibility was actually quite real, although the rebirth of a temple deity was extremely difficult, requiring a trace of indestructible true essence, and it could only occur when there was a pregnant woman within a hundred-li radius at the time of the deity's death.</p><p></p><p>Could Xixia be one? "No, it shouldn't be... That strange temple outside Fei Luo City is only a tenth-rank, that deity doesn't have such ability."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Qingshan's brow relaxed, but his gaze towards Xixia became even more astonished.</p><p></p><p>So, this girl...</p><p></p><p>Has no cheat codes, just pure talent? Li Che had also sensed Li Qingshan's shock, and he too was quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Qingshan's assessment of Xixia's talent, she would only have the possibility of Bone Refining at seven, but now her growth...was clearly exceeding expectations.</p><p></p><p>Why? Li Che felt that it was very likely due to the daily cultivation of the [Untainted Heart] divine nature he provided for Xixia and Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Li Che obtained the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit, he had never stopped refining the divine nature for the mother and daughter.</p><p></p><p>The [Untainted Heart] divine nature, pure and flawless, was harmless to the body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought that perhaps through the pure and flawless divine nature, he could help the mother and daughter live longer.</p><p></p><p>But it seems to have altered their talents.</p><p></p><p>Just like Zhang Ya, she had just learned the Sinew Opening technique, and although Li Che had guided her, her progress had been meteoric, and she was now almost at the Sinew Opening Completion, not far from Bone Refining.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's talent was already exceptional, and Zhang Ya's talent was also good, and it might be related to the refinement of the [Untainted Heart] divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Now, even Zhang Ya, who was not originally a spiritual child, was beginning to sense the divine nature...</p><p></p><p>"This girl, such talent!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stroked his beard, looking at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The Spring Equinox is approaching, and the Sage Sect's entrance examinations will begin. This time, the examinations cover the thirteen cities under the Golden Light Prefecture, with three exceptional spiritual children, over twenty superior spiritual children, and hundreds of medium and lower spiritual children."</p><p></p><p>"These spiritual children who have emerged from tens of thousands of children have all gathered in the Golden Light Prefecture, preparing for the Sage Sect's entrance examinations during the Spring Equinox."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled: "The three exceptional spiritual children are all ones I selected, of course, even among the exceptional spiritual children, there are high and low rankings, based on the thickness of the purple qi pillars, I've also ranked the three exceptional spiritual children..."</p><p></p><p>"Except for your old spiritual child, of course!" Li Qingshan said mysteriously, glancing at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face darkened, he didn't care? He, Li Che, would not care about competing with three children! You, Li Qingshan, should not look at people so smugly!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan continued: "Originally, I had placed Xixia in second place, the first being the scion of the prominent Black Family from Elephant Ring City, named Huang Sixiang, who was born with divine strength and exceptional spiritual talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed: "What level, higher than my Xixia's talent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan felt that Li Che was truly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"This Huang Sixiang is not even the best in talent, you shouldn't forget that this is just the exceptional spiritual children from the thirteen cities under the Golden Light Prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow: "The capital city is not included?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, the capital has five great families, the scions of these families are more likely to produce exceptional talents."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Prodigies, nurtured by precious treasures since childhood, are not few in number, as they have already won at birth."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained silent, thinking that this was indeed the case...</p><p></p><p>Among the Five Great Families, there were countless powerful experts, and they also had the bloodline inheritance of the Venerable Ancestor of Divine Physiognomy. Furthermore, they were nourished by heavenly materials and earthly treasures even before birth, so they had already gained an advantage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Li Che went to the study together, and the two of them brewed some hot tea and chatted while drinking.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Great Families... are they willing to send their talented disciples to the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly thought of something and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Great Families are different from the scions of other cities. For example, the small families in Feilei City, having a Divine Foundation as the mainstay is already the peak, and once the Divine Foundation dies, it marks the beginning of the family's decline."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the families in these cities will keep their talented disciples and cultivate them to become Divine Foundations, to protect the family and maintain their status in the city."</p><p></p><p>"If they are sent to the Divine Sect, there won't be any news for nearly two or three decades, and their sense of belonging to the family will not be strong. Even if they become Divine Foundations, they may not be willing to return to the family to be the mainstay."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sipped his hot tea and said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"So, these small families will hide their scions, unwilling to send them to the Divine Sect or the imperial court."</p><p></p><p>"But the great families in the capital city are different. One sect, one Divine Sect, one state, one sect branch, especially the Divine Sect branch in the Golden Light Prefecture, so the families in the Golden Light Prefecture have people, even many of the high-ranking members, from the capital city families."</p><p></p><p>"The capital city families have Divine Physiognomists as the mainstay, and the lifespan of a Divine Physiognomist is three to four times that of a Divine Foundation. One Venerable Ancestor can support the family for many years, so naturally, the disciples are all willing to be dispatched."</p><p></p><p>"If a disciple who can enter the main sect is produced, the family's foundation will even rise rapidly."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan finished speaking, poured himself another cup of tea, and muttered, "You little fellow, now that you're well-off, why don't you get some better tea leaves? It's so shabby."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you now a Third-rank Guest Receptionist in the Astronomical Observatory? Go find that busty and brainless Junior Receptionist, Gong Yunli, and get a good tea from Supervisor Lin Zheng's tea house."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained silent. He was only a Third-rank Guest Receptionist, not the Supervisor!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how many Spiritual Prodigies are there in the capital city?" Li Che asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his head, "I don't know. The Five Great Families are keeping it very tight-lipped, and many have even been sent to the Five Great Sects for cultivation in advance."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect entry examination held once every four years is highly competitive..."</p><p></p><p>"This year is even more so."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's voice suddenly became solemn as he took a sip of tea.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned and frowned as he sipped his tea, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>As parents, they naturally cared deeply about their children's education.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's entry into the Divine Sect was as tense as competing for a spot in a top-notch primary school.</p><p></p><p>There were only so many spots, and the more talented children there were, the less attention and benefits their own daughter would receive.</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally wanted to find out more.</p><p></p><p>"You, with your Ox Demon identity, have been living so freely in the city. Didn't you feel anything strange? You've killed so many from the Corpse Demon Sect, yet you're not curious why the Corpse Demon Sect dares to be so rampant?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan waved his hand, sealing the study so that their conversation would not be overheard.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of... the mysterious temple of the 'Furious Eight-Armed Purgatory Lotus Prince'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the disturbance at the Prince's Temple has drawn in many Divine Physiognomist experts to suppress it. The Divine Sect has sent even more, as the Golden Light Prefecture is the base of their branch sects. Of course, the disturbance at the mysterious temple has been instigated by someone, but it also has its own reasons..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sect has always relied on temples to sustain itself. A mysterious temple is both a risk and an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"This entry examination will have one item... the Divine Sect will dispatch three Divine Physiognomist cultivators and use the divine weapon 'Purgatory Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel' to tear open the mysterious portal, and send the Spiritual Prodigies to a hundred paces before the Prince's Temple..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's words fell like thunderclaps, and Li Che's eyes couldn't help but narrow.</p><p></p><p>Even the well-versed Li Che couldn't help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"What? They're going to send these delicate Spiritual Prodigies to a hundred paces before the Prince's Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Qingshan, unable to keep his voice from rising.</p><p></p><p>This is basically... no different from throwing a bunch of fragrant and juicy meat in front of a pack of dogs!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan couldn't help but laugh at Li Che's exaggerated reaction, but it was understandable, after all, that was the extremely dangerous Four-Warded Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed, and he found this examination item to be too dangerous. It was practically placing Xixia in extreme peril.</p><p></p><p>If even the slightest uncontrollable incident were to occur, it would be a catastrophe for the weak Spiritual Prodigies! Li Che looked gravely at Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suppressed his laughter, took a sip of tea, and slowly said, "I know you're worried about Xixia's safety, but although this matter has certain risks, the opportunities are even greater."</p><p></p><p>"Sending numerous Spiritual Prodigies to the area a hundred paces before the Mysterious Temple is to test their resonance with the temple deity, as you know the Prince is depicted as a child to the world. If they can evoke the temple deity's resonance, they can cultivate the temple deity's divine arts while also receiving the deity's blessings."</p><p></p><p>"Such as divine secret arts, divine martial arts, divine weapons, divine essence, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the strength of the deity's resonance is the key factor in the examination, determining the students' status within the Divine Sect, whether they will enter the inner sect, the core disciples, or the outer sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow, however, remained furrowed, as he still felt it was too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the Four-Warded Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>It was like telling a group of children to go activate a nuclear warhead.</p><p></p><p>"The main danger actually comes from the guardian corpse soldiers, which is why the Divine Sect is activating the 'Purgatory Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel'. That is a Four-Warded Divine Weapon, and although there is only one, it can provide great protective effects."</p><p></p><p>"The Windfire Golden Light Wheel is imbued with a strong temple deity aura, so the guardian corpse soldiers will behave themselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan saw that Li Che was still very grave, and suddenly realized that this young man was too anxious about his daughter's safety.</p><p></p><p>"This is both a risk and an opportunity. If they can obtain the Four-Warded Temple Deity's favor, you should know how far Xixia's future path can go! At the very least, reaching the Divine Physiognomist realm would be a breeze, and even the Divine Origin realm would not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sat up straight, with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Has such an action been taken before?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was silent for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, or rather, not just the Qianyuan Divine Sect, every Divine Sect that relies on the Mysterious Temple will have this procedure. The Qianyuan Divine Sect will not be an exception. Didn't you see Lü Chi? He was one of the top three Spiritual Prodigies in the previous action, and this time, the Qianyuan Main Sect in the Southern Continent will also send a cultivator to preside over the opening of the Four-Warded Portal."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this involves the Four-Warded Mysterious Temple, and the Qianyuan Main Sect cannot ignore it, so this is also an opportunity that the Qianyuan Main Sect has set its sights on."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes, tapping his fingers lightly on the table, "You care for your daughter and are concerned about her safety, which is not wrong. But children ultimately need to go out and explore, and this is an opportunity for the child. You can't prevent her from going just because you're worried about her safety. Children also need to be tempered."</p><p></p><p>Li Che finally relaxed his brow.</p><p></p><p>This was not an isolated case, many Divine Sects had taken such actions before the Qianyuan Divine Sect branch, and since there were precedents, he could be more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't keep Xixia completely sheltered at home, as this world had powerful divine cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was competing, everyone was striving.</p><p></p><p>Li Che needed to be responsible for his daughter's growth.</p><p></p><p>"Will the Qianyuan Main Sect also have cultivators coming to preside? If Xixia performs well, will she have the opportunity to be noticed and enter the Qianyuan Main Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shook his head, "The possibility is there, but there is a specific process for entering the Qianyuan Main Sect. If Xixia can establish a Divine Foundation before the age of twelve, she will have the opportunity to enter the Qianyuan Main Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But the competition is too fierce. How many Spiritual Prodigies in the Southern Continent have been cultivating for years, all for the sake of entering the main sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Because only by entering the Qianyuan Main Sect can they have the chance to cultivate the 'Three Purities Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>The Three Purities Technique! Li Che's body trembled, suddenly understanding the difficulty of competing for the Qianyuan Main Sect.</p><p></p><p>That difficulty was comparable to the high school students in his previous world striving for the top two universities in the country!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips felt dry, not... He had already started to feel the educational anxiety of being a parent.</p><p></p><p>"As long as there is a guarantee of safety, it's fine..." Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>But his heart had already started to stir.</p><p></p><p>If Xixia entered the Four-Warded Mysterious Temple, should he follow her?</p><p></p><p>This would be a good opportunity... to leave a mark in the Mysterious Temple, setting up a foothold for the Chess Saint.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, however, did not know Li Che's current scheming thoughts. He laughed, "Of course there will be a guarantee of safety. The Spiritual Prodigies are the future of the sect branches, how could they not care for them? Safety is the top priority, but... nothing is absolute."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"You know that the Spiritual Prodigies are the future of the sect branches, and the sect branches attach great importance to them. The Corpse Demon Sect will also pay attention to them. The Divine Sect has never been guarding against the temple deities, but more against the Corpse Demon Sect and other ill-intentioned parties!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Demon Sect?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"The threat posed by the Corpse Demon Sect is far greater than the temple deities. This force from Jeju Island has almost disrupted an entire region of the Great Prosperity Dynasty, occupying three states! The threat is enormous, and even the Divine Sect does not dare to underestimate them."</p><p></p><p>"Their methods are vicious. The Spiritual Prodigies who perform well in the deity's resonance may become their targets for plunder, and if they can't obtain them... they will choose to destroy them."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan let out a breath, as the Corpse Demon Sect also needed geniuses to form their reserve forces.</p><p></p><p>And one of their ways of obtaining geniuses was through plunder! Although bewitchment is the Corpse Demon Sect's specialty, naturally, the Spiritual Prodigies they have cultivated from a young age would have a higher degree of loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, with a glimmer of murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked at Li Qingshan, "Senior, you suddenly shifted the topic to the Corpse Demon Sect and evoked my hatred. You must have a purpose, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled, his back suddenly straightening, rubbing his fingers together with a glint in his eyes. The following words were the main reason he had come to seek out Li Che today.</p><p></p><p>"To ensure Xixia's safe participation in the deity's resonance."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, there's a great fortune to be had in cooperation... I wonder if you're interested?"</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly votes and recommend votes, and support the continued reading!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

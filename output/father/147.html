            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Manor, Zheng Leifeng.</p><p></p><p>Above the celestial dome, dark clouds gathered, with azure-colored thunderbolts rolling.</p><p></p><p>The fallen white snow was directly vaporized into mist by the thunderbolts, shrouding the high skies.</p><p></p><p>In the center of Zheng Leifeng, the small courtyard where Li Qingshan lived.</p><p></p><p>It had already become a forbidden place.</p><p></p><p>No one was allowed to approach it easily, for the divine pressure here was too strong.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators with perfected divine foundations would feel a sense of suffocation and weakness throughout their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, countless divine essences were almost solidified, as if they were about to fully coalesce into the form of a deity.</p><p></p><p>A divine temple stood tall.</p><p></p><p>On the statue of the deity that subdued thunder and vanquished evil within the temple, countless thunder snakes descended from the azure firmament.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, dressed in a blue robe, was seated cross-legged on a meditation cushion.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual light from his Nirvana Aperture kept flickering.</p><p></p><p>His entire figure seemed to be sculpted into the form of the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>He had not consolidated a false appearance and planned to directly breakthrough to the divine statue realm in one go!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had been tempering his "Subduing Thunder and Vanquishing Evil" divine foundation for a long time.</p><p></p><p>His Six Bureaus divine foundation was extremely terrifying, ranking seventh on the divine foundation list of Cloud State.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Qingshan planned to directly assault and consolidate the Six Bureaus divine statue on the basis of his Six Bureaus divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>But his physical body could not bear it, so he had to settle for consolidating the Seven Elements divine statue instead.</p><p></p><p>He would then slowly cultivate the divine statue, pushing its level to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>Slowly opening his eyes, Li Qingshan's pupils seemed to have arcing thunderbolts flickering within them.</p><p></p><p>"One step slow, every step slow... Cultivation requires fighting and striving, being too cautious... I might miss my chance."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan murmured.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a breath and stood up.</p><p></p><p>Countless thunderbolts were pulling at his body, as if wanting to make him explode.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Qingshan could feel that he was about to consolidate the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head slightly: "I don't know if I can succeed in consolidating it..."</p><p></p><p>"Probably many people don't want me to easily consolidate it, it's too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"But even if I fail, it doesn't matter, I'm already content. Before consolidating the divine statue, I went to Feilei City and found Mu Mu, my heart has no more regrets..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan walked around the mountaintop temple with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind was silent, the bitter winter biting.</p><p></p><p>The falling snow could not approach, for there were thunderbolts flickering, forming an invisible repulsive field.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan saw a figure leaning on a python-headed cane, carrying a lunch box, slowly climbing up the blue stone path from the middle of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was the elderly Mu Grandma, her youthful and beautiful appearance long gone, but Li Qingshan's eyes were filled with tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma arrived at the temple, seeing the resting Li Qingshan, and smiled as she raised the lunch box.</p><p></p><p>The two elders sat on the stone table and chairs beside the temple, and Mu Grandma took out the steaming hot dishes from the lunch box.</p><p></p><p>"My cooking skills are not good, I learned a few tricks from Xiao Ya, just bear with it, you used to tease me about my cooking skills, and I've always remembered that," Mu Grandma glared at Li Qingshan and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan rubbed his hands and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Your cooking skills were really bad back then, you could even burn the fish when roasting it, and when you boiled the fish, you just threw the whole live fish into the pot, and when I lifted the pot, the fish was still thrashing around in there."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan recalled the past events and couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma glared at him, indignant.</p><p></p><p>"We are wandering cultivators, what do we need cooking skills for! I'm not running a restaurant!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan burst out laughing, and the two began to eat and drink.</p><p></p><p>Although the dishes were not very tasty, Li Qingshan ate them with relish.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, the Beggar Sect is gone today... It was destroyed by a single person, Niu Mo, all the upper echelons of the Beggar Sect were slaughtered, and it's said they were colluding with the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Ah... I heard that the Zhen Temple Supervisory Office rescued over a thousand poor young girls from the Jin Fang Institute, it's truly..."</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma said with righteous indignation, for in her younger days of wandering the jianghu, she had a sense of chivalry and could not bear to see such tragic and outrageous events.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly slammed his chopsticks, beating his chest and stomping his feet, deeply grieved.</p><p></p><p>He had missed it again! That bastard Niu Mo had gone and eaten the big fish alone behind his back!</p><p></p><p>What happened to the "Qing Xiu Niu Ma" duo? Can't it be "Xiu Niu Ma" without "Qing"?</p><p></p><p>Mu Grandma had heard about Li Qingshan's cooperation with Niu Mo, seeing Li Qingshan's current state, she couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>"You'd better focus on consolidating your divine statue first... Otherwise, Niu Mo might not even play with you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sighed, yes, consolidating the divine statue is more important now, many things he couldn't do before.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the divine statue realm... Then he could act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>For example, this Beggar Sect incident...</p><p></p><p>He had known about it earlier, but it involved too many parties, the Beggar Sect was just a small part, there were also the Five Great Families, Five Major Sects, and many influential officials...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had planned to wait until he had consolidated his divine statue before going to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Niu Mo had taken the lead.</p><p></p><p>"Well, we're all in the 'Qing Xiu Niu Ma' team, what Niu Mo did is equivalent to me, Li Qingshan, dealing with it."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>"So, you must succeed, break through to the divine statue realm, then you can do many things you didn't dare to do before," Mu Grandma propped up her chin and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"I believe you can do it."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, so many of us wandered the jianghu together... Now, it's just you and me left."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The waves of the jianghu had taken many, some died, some disappeared...</p><p></p><p>"So, live on," Mu Grandma stroked Li Qingshan's face gently and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Promise me," Mu Grandma said.</p><p></p><p>"I promise," Li Qingshan smiled and gently tapped Mu Grandma's brow, causing her to faint.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan quietly finished all the food, not leaving a single grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chihui came running.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"Take your Mu Grandma to Xixia's place, you go with her. From now until I breakthrough and achieve the divine statue, you are to stay at Xixia's place and not go anywhere else."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chihui was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Is it this serious? With Master's talent, is consolidating the divine statue really this difficult? Li Qingshan stood up, his bones and joints cracking and popping, as if just a single movement had provoked the thunderous wrath of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If I perish, I will pass you on to the Sect Master, let the Sect Master take you as a recorded disciple. You had an excellent response to the temple deity's aura, you should have joined the Sect Master's sect from the beginning, but you insisted on becoming my disciple."</p><p></p><p>"These years, I haven't taught you much... Your origins, I don't want to investigate. As long as you are Lu Chihui, my disciple, you will be my disciple for life."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes rarely showed such gentleness as he looked at Lu Chihui.</p><p></p><p>He patted Lu Chihui's big head.</p><p></p><p>"Go, big-headed Lu."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Qingshan's words that sounded like a last testament, tears welled up in Lu Chihui's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master... You must live."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for your disciple to filially serve you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chihui knelt on the ground, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan grinned: "Bullshit, of course I want to live, who wants to die? Oh yes, if I die, you'll be passed on to the Sect Master, then you'll be Xixia's junior disciple..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chihui's face stiffened, then his eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>So it's right next to the water pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"You little bastard, are you actually interested?"</p><p></p><p>"Scram! You're going to filially serve your master to death!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Lu Chihui leave with Mu Grandma, Li Qingshan stood on the mountaintop with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>He knew.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Light Manor had too many people who did not want him to breakthrough to the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the Niu Mo incident.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo's recklessness and arrogance had already made the officials and upper echelons of Golden Light Manor drink a cup of bitter tea.</p><p></p><p>If there was another one who could act recklessly after reaching the divine statue realm, that would be Li Qingshan...</p><p></p><p>Those people would definitely not accept it.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood with his hands behind his back, bathing in the winter wind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his face twitched.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't Li Che contacted me yet? What did Ma Mian say? He couldn't have... abandoned me, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The cold flowers and snow covered the mountain waist, the icy pearls filled the green willow branches.</p><p></p><p>On the snowy and cold winter day, the long street was desolate and chilly.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard of Luo Hua Alley.</p><p></p><p>It was surprisingly lively, with figures coming and going.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the center, holding an Eight Extremes divine essence crystal, in a meditative posture, eyes closed, cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual light in his Nirvana Aperture was faintly glowing.</p><p></p><p>The "Unsullied Heart" Dao fruit in his chest was pounding vigorously, emanating a powerful suction force, frantically absorbing the divine essence from the Eight Extremes divine essence crystal.</p><p></p><p>Then infusing it into the floating Unsullied Heart divine foundation within his inner landscape.</p><p></p><p>When an Eight Extremes divine essence crystal was completely drained, it turned into a transparent crystal stone. Li Che opened his eyes, and a faint white mist seemed to be emanating from his pupils.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the crystal stone, clenching his five fingers tightly, the powerful bones and muscles roared, and a scorching air wave radiated outward from his body, whipping up a pile of snow.</p><p></p><p>The divine essence crystal instantly turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Divine essence crystal powder can suppress the power of divine essence... During the previous purge of the Beggar Sect's Jin Fang Institute, we used divine essence crystal powder grenades, the exploding crystal powder suppressed the activation of divine essence..."</p><p></p><p>"So those few virtual statue cultivators couldn't even put up any resistance and were crushed by the firepower."</p><p></p><p>"So divine essence crystal powder still has a lot of room for development, if combined with the divine art 'Great Snow Collapse' and integrated into Avalokitesvara Lotus Grenades, the moment they explode, while suppressing the firepower, they will also restrain the cultivators' divine essence..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly malicious and incisive."</p><p></p><p>Li Che praised his own design, so he carefully collected these divine essence crystal powders.</p><p></p><p>These were research resources, not to be wasted.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and the scene before him flickered with light.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Unsullied Heart (Lv.3, 12%)]</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a turbid breath, after absorbing the divine essence of one Eight Extremes divine essence crystal, it could now only increase the maturity by 5%.</p><p></p><p>The effect was greatly reduced, one could only say that the appetite of the "Unsullied Heart" Dao fruit was becoming more and more demanding.</p><p></p><p>"If I could obtain a Seven Elements divine essence crystal, the first time absorption effect would definitely be excellent."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>And now, the only path for him to obtain a Seven Elements divine essence crystal was to cooperate with Nan Li Huo and attack Manor Lord Su Huai.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, Li Che practiced martial arts for a while longer, studying the new supreme art "Lü Xuan Sword Classic", in a few more days he should be able to master it and integrate it into the "Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant".</p><p></p><p>The surging blood and qi in his body gradually subsided, and his burly figure became calm.</p><p></p><p>"Sword art... seems not quite suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>When Niu Mo transformed, his Angry Buddha appearance, with a towering height of two meters and twenty, wielding a great halberd was just right, using a sword... would feel like Zhang Fei embroidering.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the halberd was much more satisfying.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for a while longer, Li Che left the small courtyard in Luo Hua Alley.</p><p></p><p>He had left eight "Painting Immortal" clones in the small courtyard, seven of them were single divine foundation clones, used for cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not stingy, he had given each clone a Nine Luminaries divine essence crystal.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eight Extremes divine essence crystals, Li Che planned to keep them for his own use, to increase the maturity of the Unsullied Heart, although the effect was greatly reduced, but it was a slow and steady process.</p><p></p><p>There was also one Painting Immortal clone, which was arranged to be involved in the research and development of the "Avalokitesvara Lotus Main Battle Tank".</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual wood is not enough... If I want to manufacture the 'Avalokitesvara Lotus Main Battle Tank', I need a large amount of spiritual wood materials."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, after it's manufactured, I can directly use the 'Painting Immortal' Dao fruit to replicate it, but the initial investment is still necessary."</p><p></p><p>"I need to select the type of spiritual wood, it needs to have high strength and durability."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was summarizing his flash of inspiration in the research and development.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual wood... To obtain high-quality spiritual wood, I'll have to go to the 'Divine Sculpture Ridge', Senior Qingshan has always said he wants to take me there, once he consolidates his divine statue, he should be able to take me there."</p><p></p><p>Although the Astronomical Observatory had channels to obtain spiritual wood, to get high-grade spiritual wood, one could only go to the Divine Sculpture Ridge.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to what Senior Guan Qinghuang said, the spiritual wood source of the Astronomical Observatory also came from the Divine Sculpture Ridge.</p><p></p><p>After arranging all the work for his Painting Immortal clones to diligently cultivate, he himself leisurely went to the Fly Tavern in the alley to pack some meals to take back.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the inner sanctum of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che first went to Golden Light Peak to pick up Xixia from school.</p><p></p><p>On the vast platform of Golden Light Peak, the heavy snow was swirling.</p><p></p><p>The tiny Xixia was practicing martial arts on the platform, her blood and qi rumbling, faintly seeming to have thin scarlet dragon snakes wildly coiling.</p><p></p><p>Around her neck, the Primordial Golden Vajra Ring was whirling with a howling sound, being wielded by Xixia with great agility.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Xixia was gripping a gleaming golden short sword, a Nine Luminaries divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Combining the supreme art "Mysterious Thunder Golden Light Annihilation Sword Technique", the display was wind and snow-filled, with golden light rending the sky, the momentum was quite impressive</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Then he entered the door!</p><p></p><p>At the age of four, he has truly mastered the supreme martial art! This is the bearing of a great master!</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought.</p><p></p><p>After Xixia finished her sword practice, she saw Li Che waiting in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>The little girl happily showed a smile, and with quick little steps, she rushed over.</p><p></p><p>With a final leap, like a forcefully kicked soccer ball, she "whooshed" and shot towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed heartily, grabbing her with five fingers, easily catching the little girl.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Che had the physique of a furnace sect master, catching the charging Xixia was nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>"Say goodbye to your Shifu Sister Yin Yin."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pinched Xixia's little nose and said.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Sang Guanyin, in a long yellow dress, stood quietly in the white snow, tranquil and graceful, waving goodbye to Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Bringing Xixia back to Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>Xixia chattered nonstop along the way, as if she had endless things to say, endless energy.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, Li Che sensed that Mu Popo had fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow, and Lü Qi explained.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded: "Then stay here for the next few days, and wait until Senior Li Qingshan successfully sculpts the divine image."</p><p></p><p>It should only take a day or two.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had knocked Mu Popo unconscious, not wanting her to worry and get distracted.</p><p></p><p>However, isn't Li Qingshan afraid that after Mu Popo wakes up, she will settle the score?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was also practicing martial arts in the courtyard. After the tempering of her bones, she still couldn't withstand the slightest effort from her husband, so she became more determined and her fighting spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts requires a goal, and with a goal, one's enthusiasm will be full.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the packed meals and invited everyone to eat together.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days passed in the continuously falling snow.</p><p></p><p>The next night, deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>The night sky was deep, the clouds rolling, but above Zheng Lei Peak, countless thunder snakes were intertwining and flashing, vaguely reflecting the brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, the sky was illuminated like daytime.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Li Che entered the study.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the Immortal Fruit in the painting, he created two clones, one staying in the study to carve a wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>The other transformed into a Ox Demon, rushing towards the top of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>He himself appeared in the courtyard of Luohua Alley, grasping the Flying Thunder Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>The black robe fluttered in the snowy night wind.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, eight clones of the [Immortal in the Painting] were all focused on cultivation and research, bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up, watching the falling snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the roar of thunder, countless intertwined thunders spanned the sky, emitting dazzling light and heat.</p><p></p><p>The falling snowflakes melted, turning into warm raindrops, pattering down to the earth.</p><p></p><p>A raindrop fell on Li Che's cheek, with a tingling electric arc.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, focusing.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Sages Divine Image? </p><p></p><p>"Not the Seven Elements [Suspended Thought Thunder Execution Vajra] Divine Image?!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Li Qingshan... does not want to refine the Seven Elements Divine Image, but wants to break through to the Six Sages Divine Image?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"This is really... not cautious at all."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"This is Senior Li Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>"In one's life..."</p><p></p><p>"Who wants to live a mediocre life?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>The melting snow turned into warm raindrops, seemingly containing vibrating lightning arcs within.</p><p></p><p>Falling from the sky, descending to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo, with his white hair flying, stretched out his hand and caught a raindrop, which floated in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The lightning arc in the raindrop flickered, like an angry roaring thunder dragon.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Li Qingshan does not want to refine the Seven Elements Divine Image, but wants to refine the Six Sages Divine Image..."</p><p></p><p>"After observing the divine images for so long, bypassing the illusory images, stepping directly into the divine image realm... and now wanting to refine the Six Sages Divine Image."</p><p></p><p>"What a grand ambition."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>And beside the divine hall, a Taoist priest was leading a constantly "smacking" little fat boy.</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother, the Golden Light Mansion has also produced a capable person, this Li Qingshan's name, I've heard of it in the Dao City."</p><p></p><p>"Seventh on the Spiritual Foundation Ranking of the Cloud State, that's not bad for a figure in the Dao City."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Smack, smack..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Taoist priest finished speaking, the little fat boy next to him was chewing on mutton jerky, making a faint sound.</p><p></p><p>"Don't eat anymore, mind your manners!" The Taoist priest glared.</p><p></p><p>The little fat boy immediately stopped, solemnly nodding, pursing his lips, and the movement in his mouth became much quieter.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo suddenly laughed: "This disciple of yours, Brother, is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest composed himself, stroking his beard leisurely: "He's not bad, a spiritual child, let's see if he can resonate with the Santatsu Temple's divine beings."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, are you willing to lend a hand tonight?" Nan Lihuo looked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest was at a loss: "Junior brother, aren't you making it difficult for me?"</p><p></p><p>The little fat boy, not knowing when he had gotten a large flatbread, took a bite and mumbled a word.</p><p></p><p>"Coward."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest was furious.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo waved his hand with a smile: "Alright, I won't trouble you, but we brothers haven't seen each other in so many years, can you help me go to the Santatsu Mysterious Temple and assist the Prefect's Office in guarding the Mysterious Temple?"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest stroked his beard and nodded: "Guarding the Mysterious Temple... that's not a problem, but for me, your elder brother, to go out and fight and kill, you know I don't like that kind of thing."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo pursed his lips and nodded: "I understand, Brother doesn't like these things."</p><p></p><p>This Taoist priest was Wang Kuyu, who came from the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect in the Dao City of the South.</p><p></p><p>Bringing the spiritual children and prodigies from the Dao City to participate in the temple divine resonance event.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo wouldn't really make things difficult for the Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, it seems it won't be peaceful."</p><p></p><p>If Li Qingshan chose the Seven Elements Divine Image breakthrough, there would be obstruction and destruction, but it wouldn't be too drastic.

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pure white snowflakes were flying and falling on the black tiles, standing out starkly.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard gate was wide open, and the sound of footsteps treading on the accumulated snow rose and fell, with endless congratulatory voices.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another came walking in from outside the courtyard, one by one presenting their first-year birthday gifts.</p><p></p><p>They were all familiar faces from the wood carving shop, and Li Che and Zhang Ya, dressed in formal attire, stood at the entrance to welcome these guests.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the staff of Chunfeng Pavilion had already set up a canopy and arranged the tables and chairs, while the head chef had prepared the stove in a corner and the fragrant appetizers had already been served to each table.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of nine tables, not a small number, after all, many of the senior craftsmen from the shop had brought their whole families, just wanting to celebrate the lively occasion.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao was holding the adorable Xixia, who had changed into a red robe and skirt, delicately carved like jade, and was proudly showing her off to a few old fellows, his face full of overflowing affection.</p><p></p><p>The uncle's family had also come, the old scholar puffing on a pipe but not lighting it, accompanied by a young couple who were holding a baby boy still in swaddling clothes, his chubby face wide-eyed and curiously observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, Aunt, Cousin, please come in!" </p><p></p><p>Li Che saw this family and a warm smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Towards the uncle's family, Li Che was filled with gratitude. If it were not for the uncle's family taking him in and raising him, Li Che would not have been able to live so comfortably in this chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>And it was also the aunt who helped arrange Li Che's marriage to Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar, his face full of wrinkles, smiled and said, "You've made it, you've really made it, Ahe."</p><p></p><p>"Your parents in the afterlife will be overjoyed."</p><p></p><p>The old scholar patted Li Che's shoulder, his smile beaming.</p><p></p><p>The aunt then took out a silver ornament wrapped in a red sleeve cloth and handed it to Li Che: "Ahe, this is Xixia's first-year birthday gift, please accept it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not refuse, solemnly accepting it, then turning to look at his cousin Li Zhengran and his wife Liu Chunming, who were holding the baby boy.</p><p></p><p>"Shouzhu is half a year younger than Xixia, right? He's almost a year old too, can he already turn over by himself now?" Li Che asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Very skillfully, he kicks his little legs and flips over like a windmill, lively and energetic!" Cousin Liu Chunming said with a laugh to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Being able to become a master woodcarver at Xu's Woodcarving Shop, Cousin Liu Chunming was well aware of the significance, and her attitude towards Li Che was much warmer than before.</p><p></p><p>Li Che chatted with them for a while, then led the uncle's family to their table.</p><p></p><p>As the time arrived, the banquet began, and the Chunfeng Pavilion staff loudly called out the dish names, serving one delicacy after another onto the banquet tables.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che, who possessed the "Immortal Craft" Dao fruit, had his wood carvings in high demand due to their rich artistic conception, although not as skilled as old Chen, he had even sold one for fifty taels of silver! His wealth was already vastly different from the past, and although the Chunfeng Pavilion's banquet was expensive, he could still afford it.</p><p></p><p>Plus, the senior craftsmen from the courtyard would bring gifts when attending the banquet, so in the end, not only was there no loss, but even a considerable profit.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Che, the Third Manager is here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who was exchanging toasts with several senior craftsmen, heard that the Third Manager had arrived, and quickly took Xixia in his arms and went with Zhang Ya to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Xixia's first birthday, I came specially to see her, and this is a birthday gift for Xixia."</p><p></p><p>The Third Manager Xu You was a humble person and highly respected in the shop, of course, it was also possible that he had the intention of currying favor with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che was now able to create wood carvings with a profound artistic conception, and had become highly sought after in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manager, Xixia, come thank your Uncle Xu." Li Che held the delicately carved Xixia and called out with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's eyes were lively, her eyelashes long, her skin as white as jade. Xu You took a look and also took a liking to her, taking her from Li Che's arms and playing with her for a while, reluctant to return her.</p><p></p><p>"I won't be staying for the birthday banquet, I have some other matters to attend to. Recently, the mysterious temple in the outer city has been in an uproar, and many evil creatures have emerged. The major families in the inner city have organized teams to go and exterminate them... I need to go there as well."</p><p></p><p>Xu You explained.</p><p></p><p>Then he took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Xu is truly a good person..." Zhang Ya said softly beside him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, Xu You was indeed a good person, humble and unassuming, without the arrogance of a wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che had heard that within the inner city, Xu You was not...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Being favored, he was dispatched to manage the Xu Shop in the outer city, which was equivalent to being transferred away from the power center of the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the industries in the inner city, the Xu Shop's wood carving workshop in the outer city was ultimately not a big business.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, the more gentle one is, the more likely they are to suffer. Bad things... always target the honest ones for a beating."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, holding a wine cup, came over and shook his head with a somewhat complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this mission to eliminate the strange and evil forces lurking outside the temple in the outer city, which of the great families and clans would send their core disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Beihu's cultivation is extremely strong, so he was not sent, but instead they sent the weaker Xu You. Isn't it because Xu You is not well-regarded in the clan?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, holding Xixia, also remained silent, watching Xu You's lonely figure disappear into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After much toasting and drinking.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was in an excellent mood today, getting completely drunk and falling asleep early.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya took Xixia to the inner room to put her to bed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wiped the cold snow off his face, sobered up, and sat in the workshop by the side hall, lighting the oil lamp and continuing to work on the mechanism.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and information floated up before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Name: Li Che】</p><p>【Bonds: Daughter (Li Nuanxi)】</p><p>【Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv2, 89%), Dragon-Elephant Vajra (Lv1, 2%)】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the 【Immortal Craftsman】 Dao Fruit. In a year's time, the maturity of the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit had risen to 89%, and it was close to breaking through to Lv3. </p><p></p><p>He just needed to complete one more mechanism to do it.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, he went to a corner of the workshop and gently turned a wood carving, and a hidden compartment suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He took out a seated Guanyin statue on a blood-red lotus mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Guanyin had a benevolent expression, but upon closer inspection, the statue was actually made up of countless fine wooden needles!</p><p></p><p>This was one of the three mechanisms from the "Tang's Mechanism Records" that did not require internal energy.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Guanyin Blood Lotus, there were also two square matchboxes. He took out one of the square matchboxes, covered it in his palm, and immediately heard the faint sound of a mechanism from within, as eight long spider legs emerged and embedded themselves in Li Che's palm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che waved his hand lightly, and suddenly countless thin silver threads shot out silently, cleanly slicing a piece of wood several meters away.</p><p></p><p>His fingers danced, and the silver threads whirled frantically around the room, whistling as they cut through the air.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the silver threads quickly retracted back into the matchbox.</p><p></p><p>"A fine Thousand Threads Spider. With my mastery of skin refinement, even ordinary martial artists who have opened their meridians would find it difficult to resist the spider silk's strangling power."</p><p></p><p>"But once martial artists reach the meridian opening realm, they will cultivate internal energy. If I can combine the Thousand Threads Spider with internal energy, as Old Chen said, its power will increase by thirty to forty percent, and with internal energy martial arts, its destructive power will be even greater."</p><p></p><p>"But I cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to focus on strengthening my own martial power. Once I can cultivate internal energy, and use it to empower the Thousand Threads Spider, its might will surely be even greater!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che put the Thousand Threads Spider and Guanyin Blood Lotus mechanisms back into the hidden compartment.</p><p></p><p>He sat back down in front of the oil lamp and began trying to make other mechanisms from the "Tang's Mechanism Records".</p><p></p><p>Due to his lack of internal energy and robust vital energy, he had failed in making the other mechanisms so far.</p><p></p><p>But that was not a big problem. Failures were part of the learning process, and once he cultivated internal energy, he would be able to complete them easily.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che picked up his carving knife, his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He went out of the workshop and quickly came to the courtyard gate, gazing into the distance. He saw a black shadow that flashed like lightning and disappeared into the night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes immediately sharpened, and he slowly looked down.</p><p></p><p>There he saw a familiar...</p><p></p><p>Three-headed, six-armed spirit infant statue.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the three-headed, six-armed spirit infant's eyes were wide open, glaring at him fiercely!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

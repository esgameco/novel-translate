        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che, dressed in black attire, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying him was his uncle's family.</p><p></p><p>The group trudged through the increasingly turbulent wind and snow, not even having time to be alarmed by the skirmish that had just broken out in the small courtyard. The family just wanted to flee to Xu's woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>Walking along the stone-paved street, due to the inclement weather, there were few passersby, most of them hurrying with their heads down.</p><p></p><p>The entire way, everyone remained silent, no one spoke.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's steps paused, the accumulated snow pushed out into a small mound by the sudden stop of his feet.</p><p></p><p>Through the hazy wind and snow, there was a lingering scent of smoke.</p><p></p><p>The sound of gongs and drums, suona horns, and devout chanting came from the other end of the long street, forming an eerie symphony that made the hairs on one's neck stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"The holy spirit teaches, to wash away the mundane, the reincarnation without worry method, requires the highest wisdom to succeed without being taught..."</p><p></p><p>The mournful melody drifted over from the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>There was a bare-chested burly man wearing a child's mask, carrying a sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>On the sedan chair was placed a three-headed, six-armed spirit infant statue, its three faces expressing anger, sorrow, and joy... its eyes lively, as if real eyeballs were embedded.</p><p></p><p>Marching in orderly formation, there were dozens of them, the congregation members processing, the spirit infant paraded through the streets! There were also women with graceful figures wearing child masks, carrying flower baskets, accompanying the music, scattering flower petals, vying with the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, he instructed the uncle's family behind him not to look and to keep their heads down as they pressed on.</p><p></p><p>However, this time the spirit infant street procession of the congregation did not simply pass by Li Che as before, without incident.</p><p></p><p>In the blinding snowfall, these spirit infants saw the uncle's family, saw the nephew Liang Chouzhu in his aunt Liu Chunming's embrace, and seemed to have become excited.</p><p></p><p>They danced in strange steps, wearing children's masks, tilting their heads and twisting their bodies like raging hell demons, step by step approaching and drawing nearer.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive atmosphere permeated the heavens and earth, swept up in the wind and snow, assaulting them!</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li Liang was drenched in cold sweat, his legs trembling.</p><p></p><p>Cousin Li Zhengran's eyes were wide with alarm, gripping a chopping knife tightly.</p><p></p><p>The aunt and aunt Liu Chunming were terrified beyond measure, having never seen such a spectacle, almost on the verge of tears, tightly embracing the frightened Liang Chouzhu.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a step forward, his blood surging, his skin flushing red, revealing his cultivated and perfected abilities.</p><p></p><p>"In broad daylight, what are you trying to do? Forcibly seize the child?!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you not consider the imperial court, the laws of the land?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che roared with great force, momentarily cowing the congregation members.</p><p></p><p>But the gongs, drums, and suona horns sounded again, and these masked congregation members once more surrounded and drew closer, the greedy and eerie glow flickering in the children's masks.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>He thought... they're wearing masks! These congregation members kept getting closer, and vaguely, there seemed to be a unique aura permeating, disrupting the spirit, affecting people's emotions!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart raced... spiritual energy? Not dense, only a trace, but for ordinary people, it was still extremely deadly!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow erupted, a figure rushed in from the distance, falling before Li Che and the uncle's family with the force of a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>Powerful blood energy surged, internal energy gushing out, kicking up great winds and waves, the gale-force airflow dispersing those approaching spirit infant procession congregation members.</p><p></p><p>"I am... the third shopkeeper of Xu's woodcarving shop, Xu You."</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, in broad daylight, this kind of intimidation is a bit excessive. Feiluo City... has not yet reached the time when the Spirit Infant Congregation can do as they please."</p><p></p><p>The figure in white fur cloak, snow-white clothing, with flowing black hair, spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback, never expecting the arrival to be the long-unseen third shopkeeper Xu You, who had disappeared after going out of the city to hunt demonic beasts. Now he appeared in such a situation.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's blood energy burned like fire, his internal energy gushing wildly, standing there, his explosive power utterly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Those spirit infant procession congregation members scattered in all directions, the dispersed spiritual energy also vanishing without a trace in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>No dialogue, no words.</p><p></p><p>The procession members, carrying the spirit sedan, stepping to the dance, scattering flower petals, accompanied by the gongs, drums, and suona horns, gradually faded away, disappearing into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The evil aura also seemed to have retreated along with them.</p><p></p><p>The uncle's family finally let out a long sigh of relief, the aunt in particular feeling as if she had narrowly escaped disaster, unable to hold back her tears.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clasped his hands in gratitude: "Many thanks, Third Shopkeeper."</p><p></p><p>Xu You turned around, his face more weathered than before, the handsome scholarly features now bearing a scar.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Li Che and smiled: "I had just returned from the city outskirts after dealing with the sinister temple's evil creatures, and then encountered this situation..."</p><p></p><p>"Seeing that it was you, I stepped forward. For the sake of Xu's reputation... the Spirit Infant Congregation</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's still given to you," Li Che thanked him again, and then told his uncle's family's situation. Xu You sighed, "The Lingying Sect... is becoming more and more lawless."</p><p></p><p>"However, to make it perish, it must first be made to go mad, and eventually someone will destroy it."</p><p></p><p>"Well then, your uncle's family can move to live in the Xu Family's manor, find a secluded courtyard, but... the rent will have to be paid separately."</p><p></p><p>As a wood carver, he did not need to pay rent to live in the courtyard. Although the uncle's family had Li Che's background and did not qualify to live in the Xu Family manor, Xu You relaxed the conditions, but the rent could not be waived.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, considering that you are a talented wood carver, the rent will be a bit cheaper."</p><p></p><p>Xu You smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go back to the courtyard with you. I'll go take a look at the crime scene you mentioned... a powerful martial artist was beaten to death, wearing a Niu Mo mask... that Niu Mo? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Xu You simply said, then took his leave and disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched Xu You's disappearing figure and let out a breath. Letting the uncle's family live in the Xu Family manor, this should be Xu You's way of showing goodwill and trying to win him over...</p><p></p><p>After all, he has the opportunity to become a master wood carver.</p><p></p><p>Showing goodwill... is quite normal.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Anping Alley, amidst the wind and snow, several powerful figures arrived. Xu You, wearing a fox fur cloak, walked in with his hands behind his back. In the courtyard, there were more than one figure.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong had a knife hanging on his waist, his expression grim as he looked at the dead Bagua Staff martial artist, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the knife handle, his eyes even showing a hint of ferocity and... fear.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Zhao Chuanxiong, there were three other powerful figures, all of them from prominent aristocratic families in the inner city, managing their businesses in the outer city. They were of similar status to Xu You, not favored within their own families, but highly respected in the outer city.</p><p></p><p>The four major aristocratic families in the inner city were the Yang, Xu, An, and Si families.</p><p></p><p>"He was beaten to death with sheer brute force, his chest bones completely shattered, his internal organs crushed, completely overwhelmed, without any resistance..."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the cause of death, there's no way to tell what martial technique the culprit used..."</p><p></p><p>"This household left a survivor, we can ask them to find out the appearance of the culprit."</p><p></p><p>"But in the outer city, the one capable of killing a Tempering Bone martial artist is undoubtedly that wanted criminal, Niu Mo."</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo just committed a crime in the inner city, killing a disciple of the Lingying Sect who was valued by the Sect Leader, and now in the outer city, he has killed a Deputy Incense Master of the Lingying Sect who had reached the Tempering Bone realm... Truly outrageous."</p><p></p><p>The manager from the Si family looked at Xu You and smiled, "Third Young Master Xu, are you interested in joining hands to capture this Niu Mo?"</p><p></p><p>"Si Liuxian... Your Si family is mixed up with the Lingying Sect, but my Xu family is not. This Niu Mo... is obviously targeting the Lingying Sect, and those he has killed are all evil disciples of the Lingying Sect who have harmed innocent children. In my eyes, this is an act of righteousness."</p><p></p><p>"He has done what we dared not do. I want to applaud him and call him a hero. Why should we capture him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You glanced indifferently at Si Liuxian from the Si family, and sneered.</p><p></p><p>Si Liuxian's expression immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>Xu You swept his gaze over the Bagua Staff martial artist whose body was completely shattered, his eyes narrowing as if he had recognized something. He then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong stood by, head lowered, not daring to speak much. These aristocratic family disciples, although not favored in the inner city and far from the center of power, were still scions of great families. Zhao Chuanxiong had no right to be arrogant in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also because Zhao Chuanxiong was panicked at the moment...</p><p></p><p>Last time, he and the Bagua Staff martial artist had hunted down Niu Mo together...</p><p></p><p>And now, the Bagua Staff martial artist was dead in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Who would be next?</p><p></p><p>Would it be him? That culprit Niu Mo... in just a month, had advanced from the initial Tempering Bone realm to the Tempering Bone Perfection realm, capable of unleashing a force of tens of thousands of jin, crushing the Bagua Staff martial artist to death.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying, too terrifying...</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's forehead was beaded with fine sweat, and he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>What should he do?</p>

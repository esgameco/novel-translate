            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Fire Spear?!</p><p></p><p>Fuck?! Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, and his breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>The overlapping mythologies of two worlds seemed to crash upon him like the dark waves of the deep sea at this moment!</p><p></p><p>This Fire Spear was the divine weapon of the Third Prince! How could it have emerged from the Heaven King Tower?</p><p></p><p>Li Che was momentarily stunned, his heart filled with both terror and a thick, suffocating fog that obscured the truth. His turbulent emotions soon settled, and Qian Xi's analysis of the floating, scorching divine energy provided some clarity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Divine Weapon (Supreme Grade of the Four Sovereigns): Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear】</p><p></p><p>【Craftsmanship: ???】</p><p></p><p>【Introduction: A mythical weapon, possessing only a physical form without a spiritual core, an incomplete existence whose flames are like a fierce python burning the heavens and earth, exhaling and swallowing the frigid mist, obscuring the sun】</p><p></p><p>【Perfect Mastery: Comprehend the Way of the Five Elements of Fire and Water, Martial Saint and above, Divine Embryo and above】</p><p></p><p>【Secondary Mastery: Martial Master and above, Perfected Divine Foundation and above】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the information Qian Xi had analyzed.</p><p></p><p>Waves of shock and amazement surged in his heart. A Supreme Grade of the Four Sovereigns divine weapon...</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary opportunity for his daughter!</p><p></p><p>A truly heaven-sent opportunity...</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, his expression shifting from joy and shock to a grave solemnity.</p><p></p><p>An innocent man harboring a precious treasure is guilty - this Supreme Divine Weapon, if wielded by a three-year-old child, would be no different from a three-year-old carrying a hundred million in gold and flaunting it.</p><p></p><p>Greed can sway the heart, and in this world, the extremely precious Four Sovereigns divine weapon is no exception.</p><p></p><p>Could the Sect Master Nan Li Huo protect Xixie? Or would Nan Li Huo himself be tempted?</p><p></p><p>It was not that Li Che was misjudging Nan Li Huo, but rather that the human heart is not easily tested! Furthermore, if the Corpse God Sect learned that Xixie possessed a Four Sovereigns divine weapon, especially the weapon of the Third Prince, they would undoubtedly go mad and send wave after wave of powerful experts to attack, capture Xixie, and seize the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear!</p><p></p><p>A worried frown appeared on Li Che's brow.</p><p></p><p>But to give up such an opportunity...</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat reluctant.</p><p></p><p>A Four Sovereigns divine weapon, even rarer than the Four Sovereigns Mysterious Temple, was something ordinary cultivators might never glimpse in their entire lives! To abandon it? Li Che was deeply conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was still in a state of confusion, not yet fully awake.</p><p></p><p>As her father, Li Che had the right to make decisions for his three-year-old daughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the towering golden statue of the Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>The statue still glared at him with an angry, fearful gaze.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared at it.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered with light, and after a long while, he let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Abandon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che made the decision to forgo this opportunity and not take the Four Sovereigns divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>To give or to take is a matter of a single thought! This Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear was not something that the current Xixie, or even the current Li Che's family, could wield.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had the bond with Xixie, and he only needed his daughter to grow up safely, to attain the Fruit of Enlightenment year by year...</p><p></p><p>In the future, the Four Sovereigns divine weapons... will come to him!</p><p></p><p>To live, is to have everything!</p><p></p><p>To give up, is to gain!</p><p></p><p>"Abandon!!!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shouted.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to embrace Xixie, intending to take her and leave the statue.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as his hand touched Xixie's body, the Fire Spear suddenly trembled and shook, and a streak of purple flame abruptly shot out from it.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had transformed into a purple fire snake, lunging towards Li Che, its tongue flicking out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had no choice but to release his hold.</p><p></p><p>The purple fire snake darted towards Xixie's face and then plunged into her palm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a purple snake-shaped flame tattoo was imprinted on Xixie's chubby little hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Purple Flame Snake Spear began to shake even more violently.</p><p></p><p>Countless brilliant golden lights flashed and scattered, like thousands of dazzling rays, radiating outwards.</p><p></p><p>The glare was so blinding that Li Che could hardly keep his eyes open!</p><p></p><p>When the golden light faded, the Four Sovereigns divine weapon... had vanished without a trace! Li Che was taken aback, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Could it have retreated into Xixie's body?</p><p></p><p>That purple snake tattoo?</p><p></p><p>Li Che grabbed Xixie's hand, the skin still scorching hot, but the heat was gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>He saw the purple snake tattoo faintly glowing, shifting between red and blue.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Xixie was unharmed by touching her forehead, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It has been absorbed into Xixie's body?"</p><p></p><p>"According to Qian Xi's analysis of the mastery requirements, the current Xixie... definitely cannot wield this divine weapon, not even the 'Secondary Mastery'."</p><p></p><p>"However, it seems Xixie has gained the recognition of the Heaven King Temple's deity, and now, bathed in the golden light, she has likely gained the Fire Spear's acceptance, allowing it to be absorbed into her body."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took Xixie's hand and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Using his divine sense, he could not perceive anything.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The Chessmaster's Fruit of Enlightenment pulsed, and the next moment, a network of intersecting chessboards enveloped Xixie's body.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Li Che could "see" with great difficulty. On Xixie's arm, an extremely terrifying aura was quietly hidden there, as if in cultivation, like a sheathed sword that had been honed for a hundred years, whose sword qi and sword intent could cleave mountains and rivers once unsheathed!</p><p></p><p>Using the Chessmaster's Fruit of Enlightenment's perceptive ability, Li Che carefully sensed whether the divine energy emanating from the Fire Spear would harm Xixie's physical body.</p><p></p><p>However, upon sensing it, he found that the divine energy not only did not harm Xixie, but was actually subtly improving and enhancing her physical body! Li Che was immediately relieved and dispersed the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sleeping Xixie, a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"A Four Sovereigns divine weapon hidden within her body, it's as if Xixie has activated an accelerator for her cultivation. Her current talent... is likely even more terrifying than before!"</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy? The term 'prodigy' is no longer sufficient to define my daughter."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but laugh happily.</p><p></p><p>He was already looking forward to the time when Xixie would be tested by the temple deity's resonance, and the gap between her and the other spirit children.</p><p></p><p>Other spirit children would be role-playing, striving to resonate with the Third Prince, but Xixie would be directly wielding the divine weapon used by the Third Prince! It was a dimensional strike!</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, his lips curving upwards.</p><p></p><p>He gently stroked Xixie's sweat-soaked head, her scattered bangs sticking to her scalp.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze fell on the butterfly perched on Xixie's shoulder, its wings folded, as if it was peeking at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che "hmm'd" and wanted to catch it to take a closer look, but then remembered that in this world, there were not only divine weapons, spiritual wood, but also divine beasts, spiritual beasts, and even demonic creatures infested by the temple deity's divine energy.</p><p></p><p>A spiritually aware butterfly was not worth making a fuss about.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was lying on the ground, fast asleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his gaze fixed on the towering, majestic golden statue of the Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>The statue held a pagoda in its hands, which was faintly emitting light.</p><p></p><p>"One of the Three Heaven King Towers..."</p><p></p><p>"If the Three Heaven King Towers are united, they can enter the ranks of the Three Pure Celestial Weapons."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze gleamed with eagerness.</p><p></p><p>"If Xixie can pass the test and obtain the Fire Spear, then perhaps I... can also obtain the Heaven King Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered with anticipation and speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie was bathed in the golden light projected by the pagoda because, as a spirit child, with the 'Untainted Heart' divine energy I transmitted to her, she gained the great opportunity of the divine weapon..."</p><p></p><p>"Could I try as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Who isn't a spirit child?"</p><p></p><p>"At twenty-two... I can also be a spirit child."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat down cross-legged, tearing open the air to take out a divine energy crystal.</p><p></p><p>Clenching it, the 'Untainted Heart Divine Foundation' within his Nirvana Palace immediately began to spin frantically, unleashing a terrifying suction force.</p><p></p><p>It devoured and absorbed all the divine energy within the crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Untainted Heart divine energy began to slowly recover.</p><p></p><p>"Father..."</p><p></p><p>Xixie, who was beside him, had awakened. Seeing Li Che, her eyes widened with delight and filled with tears.</p><p></p><p>"Father... Xixie isn't dreaming, right?"</p><p></p><p>"How can Xixie see Father here?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie rubbed her eyes vigorously, trying to confirm if it was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Once she was sure it was not an illusion, Xixie suddenly burst into loud sobs and rushed towards Li Che, throwing herself into his embrace. The speed was so fast that it almost made the old father sprain his waist! After all, Li Che had the 'Dragon Elephant Golden Armor' Fruit of Enlightenment, and his physical body was extremely powerful. Even if it was an unexpected impact, it would be rare for him to sprain his waist.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that...</p><p></p><p>Xixie's strength had increased greatly!</p><p></p><p>Increased tremendously!</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xixie was already very strong, but now... it seemed she truly had divine power.</p><p></p><p>The small Xixie burrowed into Li Che's embrace, her head nuzzling against him, wiping her tears and snot all over Li Che's black robe.</p><p></p><p>"Father, wuwuwu... Father, Xixie missed you!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie cried.</p><p></p><p>During these days at Golden Peak, she had not seen her parents for several days, and Xixie had missed them terribly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart softened, becoming much gentler. He gently stroked Xixie's little head and patted her small back.</p><p></p><p>"Father is here, Father has always been here..."</p><p></p><p>"Father has always been protecting Xixie."</p><p></p><p>Xixie's small head emerged from Li Che's embrace, her disheveled hair, wide eyes filled with trust and anticipation, as she asked, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Is what Father said true?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che used his sleeve to wipe Xixie's tears clean, then re-braided her hair into two buns.</p><p></p><p>"Of course what Father said is true."</p><p></p><p>"Father, let's do the pinky promise!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie extended her chubby little finger.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and hooked his finger with hers.</p><p></p><p>"Pinky promise, a hundred years no changing, whoever changes is a puppy!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie recited in her childish voice, very seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Seal it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che tapped his thumb with Xixie's thumb.</p><p></p><p>Xixie immediately cheered and started hopping and jumping around, startling the butterfly on her shoulder to flap its wings.</p><p></p><p>Xixie then chased after the butterfly to play.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Che, he stood up, feeling the complete divine energy in his 'Untainted Heart' divine foundation, then looked towards the towering Heaven King statue.</p><p></p><p>Imitating Xixie's gesture, he reached out and touched the statue's foot.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clearly felt a surge of heat flow through his body, circulating once and then disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had prepared to infuse his Untainted Heart divine energy.</p><p></p><p>But the result...</p><p></p><p>"Bone age exceeded, divine nature untainted, reward can be obtained..."</p><p></p><p>It was as if a voice like a great bell had resounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Then, a golden light ball floated in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the massive light ball that had previously contained the Fire Spear and enveloped Xixie, this was simply incomparable...</p><p></p><p>It was the size of a ping-pong ball compared to a basketball.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat insulted.</p><p></p><p>He had even wanted to obtain the Heaven King Tower, but he was clearly just dreaming.</p><p></p><p>But... at least try to test his 'Untainted Heart'.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine nature?! Li Che was at a loss for words, but he still happily accepted the reward.</p><p></p><p>Free rewards, why not take them?</p><p></p><p>Normally, he wouldn't be able to enter here, but thanks to Xixia, he was able to bask in Xixia's glory. So this reward for Li Che can also be considered as a free handout.</p><p></p><p>The golden light dissipated, and Li Che obtained a book with a golden cover.</p><p></p><p>"'The Fearless Golden King God Physiognomy of the Six Offices'!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly lit up! The Physiognomy of the Six Offices! Unimaginable wealth and nobility! Oh Heavenly King, although you humiliated me, you gave me plenty...</p><p></p><p>Li Che happily put away this book of divine physiognomy.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che wanted to break through the divine physiognomy, he needed to gather seven types of divine physiognomy techniques. One part is not enough, starting something is always difficult, he'll slowly accumulate them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has obtained one part, it's also a good start.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—— Perhaps sensing that Xixia and Li Che had both completed their rewards.</p><p></p><p>The entire Golden Divine Temple seemed to start shaking.</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sound echoed without end.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, the hand he had placed on the feet of the Heavenly King statue did not loosen, but instead... began to caress it familiarly.</p><p></p><p>The touch was just like when he had stroked the bald head of the Three-Eyed Spirit Baby Deity in the Mysterious Temple of the Flying Thunder.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Sunder Hand... Devour! [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit! Full power!</p><p></p><p>Instantly...</p><p></p><p>A mighty suction force burst forth from the palm of Li Che's hand! Strands of golden light began to rapidly condense...</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat appeared on Li Che's forehead, and his entire body tensed up involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Just as the divine chess piece was about to fully condense.</p><p></p><p>A powerful pulling force suddenly erupted from the body of the Deity Statue!</p><p></p><p>It almost scattered the condensing chess piece!</p><p></p><p>"Insolence——!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble——! A terrifying voice suddenly exploded, like rolling thunder, the wrath of the Thunder God! Li Che immediately released his hand, and the Heavenly King Deity chess piece he had devoured instantly fell onto the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>With a loud boom! The entire chessboard trembled, and the star position where the piece had fallen, as well as the intersecting chessboard lines, seemed to instantly sink and collapse.</p><p></p><p>As if unable to bear the weight.</p><p></p><p>Li Che caught a fleeting glimpse, and it was a chess piece that appeared "black-gold" in color!</p><p></p><p>Still black...</p><p></p><p>Can only the chess piece of the Untainted Divine Nature be condensed in white?</p><p></p><p>A puzzled look flashed across Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>Then he felt a huge repulsive force.</p><p></p><p>He and the chasing butterfly Xixia were both expelled from the Divine Shrine.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of being expelled, Li Che grasped the Flying Thunder chess piece and instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Peak, Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Treasure Golden Pagoda floating in the air suddenly began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>A fierce wind suddenly blew, and countless golden rays of light shot out from the pagoda, spinning around.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xixia's small body was expelled.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo had been closely monitoring the situation, his eyes narrowing, and he immediately waved his sleeve, a gust of clean wind enveloping and protecting Xixia's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat——!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Nanlihuo only felt a thunderous roar in his ears, and his powerful divine sense was almost shaken.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's calm and gentle expression changed for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"The Deity Statue is angered?!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia... what did you do in the Divine Shrine?!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo looked at Xixia, his eyes full of puzzlement and gravity.</p><p></p><p>Xixia... angered the Deity Statue?</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be like that!</p><p></p><p>This three-year-old divine child, with extraordinary talents and an untainted divine nature, was loved by everyone, and the Heavenly King Deity... should have liked her.</p><p></p><p>How could it be like encountering some evil spirit child? A butterfly was perched on Xixia's shoulder, and she sat blankly on the clean wind stirred up by Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, she slightly opened her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Daddy?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's my big Daddy?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia soon became wistful.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I must have missed Daddy so much that I dreamed of him..."</p><p></p><p>Xixia became a little sad again.</p><p></p><p>But Sangguanyin quickly ran over to comfort Xixia, and when Xixia saw her beautiful shijie, her mood improved a lot, and she no longer thought about her Daddy.</p><p></p><p>Catching the butterfly that had come out with her, she exclaimed excitedly, "Wow, the butterfly came out with Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>The pagoda returned to calm, settling back on the altar.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo furrowed his brows, utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the butterfly, he relaxed a bit. Perhaps... the Deity Statue's angry roar was not directed at Xixia, but at the butterfly that had followed Xixia out?</p><p></p><p>"A spiritual beast, I don't know what kind of spiritual beast it is, I'll take it to the Celestial Observatory tomorrow to consult the Observatory Master. The Celestial Observatory collects all kinds of rare books and researches astronomy and geography, they should know about it."  Nanlihuo didn't pursue it further.</p><p></p><p>Because the aura and pressure of this spiritual beast were not strong.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, it was just a young spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual beasts live for a very long time, and it will take a long time for it to mature. </p><p></p><p>Xixia... will definitely not outlive this spiritual beast, and when the spiritual beast recognizes its master, it will fly away after its master dies.</p><p></p><p>So Nanlihuo did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he became curious about what Xixia had gained in the Divine Shrine.</p><p></p><p>A divine child with an untainted divine nature should have been able to gain the Deity Statue's favor and receive excellent rewards, right? Although he had entered the Divine Shrine himself, his talents were limited, and he only obtained a mid-level Six Offices divine physiognomy technique.</p><p></p><p>With Xixia's talents, perhaps she could have obtained a complete Five Elders-level divine physiognomy technique, or even a complete Four Guardians-level divine physiognomy technique! The Golden Light Division also has a Four Guardians-level divine nature technique, the "Furious Three Princes of the Eight-Armed Hell Lotus", but it is only a cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>As for divine foundation techniques... they have fallen to the Six Offices level.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention higher-level divine physiognomy techniques, for many small sects, a single divine physiognomy technique is enough to support the foundation of the sect!</p><p></p><p>"What did you gain?" </p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her big eyes, thought for a while, and remembered her Daddy's instructions in the dream not to easily reveal the gun she had hidden.</p><p></p><p>So she could only talk about another gain.</p><p></p><p>She still had a technique in her mind that could be cultivated to the divine physiognomy level.</p><p></p><p>"'The Sorrowful Wind and Fire Subduing Dragon Three Princes', this is the cultivation technique Xixia obtained in her mind."</p><p></p><p>Xixia said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she mentioned this, Xixia's mood became low, thinking of the poor little boy in the dream.</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Xixia's heart trembled, and she rubbed her chest, pouting, unable to suppress her sadness, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's heart slightly startled, this was the influence of the divine nature.</p><p></p><p>He quickly expanded his divine sense to soothe Xixia's emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a Five Elders-level divine physiognomy technique, encompassing cultivation, divine foundation, and divine physiognomy!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled him was that this "Sorrowful Wind and Fire Subduing Dragon Three Princes" was a bit different from the "Furious Three Princes of the Eight-Armed Hell Lotus" in the Four Guardians Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Three Princes... are there other Seven Emotions divine nature techniques as well?</p><p></p><p>This was a new discovery, an interesting research direction.</p><p></p><p>"With a Five Elders-level divine physiognomy technique, at least the path before you reaching the divine physiognomy is worry-free. Once you cultivate the Five Elders divine physiognomy, looking across the vast Golden Light Prefecture, you can easily subdue many divine physiognomies."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo patted Xixia's head, feeling very delighted and satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This little disciple really gave him a great surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia, in about a year, you will go to the 'Furious Three Princes of the Eight-Armed Hell Lotus' Mysterious Temple to undergo the Deity Statue's resonance test. In this year, you need to complete the transformation of your divine nature, fully transforming it into the 'Sorrowful Wind and Fire Subduing Dragon Three Princes' divine nature."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said gently.</p><p></p><p>"Does Xixia have the confidence to complete it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing there was a challenge, Xixia immediately puffed out her chest and belly, excitedly saying, "Xixia will definitely be able to complete it!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Teacher, can Xixia take the little butterfly with her to play?" </p><p></p><p>Xixia pointed to the butterfly on her shoulder and said.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you can." </p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo smiled warmly, ruffling Xixia's head.</p><p></p><p>"Did you obtain any divine nature secret techniques or divine nature martial arts from it?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's smile grew even more abundant.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and a black and red intertwined book appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"As for the divine physiognomy technique, your karmic affinity is deep, and it must be extremely compatible with you. This divine nature secret technique, 'Hellfire Lotus Body', is what I will impart to you."</p><p></p><p>"And as for divine nature martial arts, which type do you want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia tilted her head, thinking of the little gun in her arm, her eyes lighting up: "Xixia wants to learn spear techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Spear techniques?</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo nodded, cultivating the Three Princes divine physiognomy, learning spear martial arts would indeed be more suitable.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, your teacher will teach you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che grasped the Flying Thunder chess piece and instantly teleported.</p><p></p><p>Back in the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Night, silent and dark.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were quiet, the clear moon hanging high in the sky, the cool moonlight sprinkling across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in the tranquil courtyard, slowly exhaling a breath, as if it were a rumbling of thunder.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was creaking, as if there were dark blood-colored electric currents rapidly surging, his qi and blood like lightning! He's back...</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his body relaxing, appearing a bit weary.</p><p></p><p>Setting out to meet up with Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu, hunting down Shangguan Zhenghen, and then learning that Xixia had gained a great opportunity, rushing to assist her.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been so busy that his feet barely touched the ground.</p><p></p><p>But the gains were rich and pleasing.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but smile slightly.</p><p></p><p>The biggest gain... was still the Six Offices divine physiognomy technique he obtained in the Heavenly King's Golden Divine Shrine, as well as... the one Heavenly King Deity chess piece he extracted by touching the Deity Statue! That was a Heavenly King Deity chess piece! Even if it was not the complete Heavenly King Golden Pagoda...</p><p></p><p>Just one of the three pagodas, the power of its Deity Statue is absolutely not to be underestimated!</p><p></p><p>That Deity Statue divine nature chess piece...</p><p></p><p>If he were to use the [Ascend Stairs] technique with this Heavenly King Deity chess piece, how powerful would it be?! Just thinking about it, Li Che's mood couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Like...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King God descending? I'm invincible!</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't suppress the smile on the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly suppressed his own emotions.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the courtyard, the night was deep, the evening breeze was cool.</p><p></p><p>Exhale—</p><p></p><p>Inhale—</p><p></p><p>Li Che inhaled and exhaled, adjusting his own state, whether it was his qi and blood or his divine nature, all of it was restored to perfection by him!</p><p></p><p>With a thought.</p><p></p><p>He was about to use the Chess Saint Dao Fruit to expand and encompass the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The thought arose.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly opened his eyes!

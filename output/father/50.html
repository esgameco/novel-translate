        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu's Woodcarving Shop.</p><p></p><p>The charcoal furnace was emitting high heat, causing the boiling water inside to churn up and down. A few emerald green tea leaves were sprinkled in, immediately filling the room with a rich tea aroma.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli sat in the high position, carefully polishing and maintaining his treasured sword with sword oil.</p><p></p><p>His sword required meticulous care every time it was drawn from its sheath.</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu and Xu You were seated below, waiting for Xu Heli to finish maintaining the sword.</p><p></p><p>The room was extremely quiet. Xu Heli was the eldest son of the Xu family in this generation, and was renowned as one of the "Three Young Masters of Feilei" together with Siju's Sumu Bai and Anjia's An Ruosu, his spiritual cultivation far surpassing that of Xu You and Xu Behu.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, accompanied by the gentle sound of the treasured sword being sheathed, Xu Heli had completed the maintenance.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xu You: "Third brother, in the future, do not disturb me before you have fully understood the matter..."</p><p></p><p>"This was a one-time occurrence, it will not happen again."</p><p></p><p>Xu You heard this, stood up, and respectfully bowed: "Little brother understands."</p><p></p><p>"This Li Che... after two years of tempering his bones, his martial talent is indeed not bad. After his blood is changed, he may have the opportunity to cultivate spiritual laws, it's just unknown how his spiritual talent is..."</p><p></p><p>"His daughter is a top-grade spiritual child, so Li Che's spiritual talent should not be too poor. Although it has been neglected, with cultivation afterwards, he should have the chance to nurture it to the 'lamp' realm."</p><p></p><p>"As for nurturing it to the realms of 'like a stream' and 'like a river', there is basically no hope."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, this Li Che... his character is timid, his courage is not too great, and he lacks ambition. Even if he cultivates spiritual laws, it will be difficult for him to become a capable assistant for our Xu family."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, after his blood is changed, grant him a secondary spiritual law."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xu Heli looked at Xu You: "Third brother, do you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You lowered his head, his expression unreadable, and softly said: "I will defer to the decision of the eldest brother."</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu finally spoke up, his brow furrowed: "Elder brother, this Zhao Xuanhai's verbal conscription... conscripting the skilled woodcarvers among these, and offering such high wages, what is the purpose?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that he intends to harm these woodcarvers?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli gently rubbed the sword hilt, gazing out the window at the heavy rain, as if pondering something, then lightly smiled: "Most likely not... these woodcarvers come from various families. Although the city lord is a court official, the Great Prosperity has lost control over the various regions, Feilei City... is still dominated by our aristocratic families."</p><p></p><p>"If he were to harm these woodcarvers... would the major families of Feilei City let it go?"</p><p></p><p>"So, that Li Che is overly cautious. For him, this conscription is indeed a stroke of good fortune, ten gold leaves, even for him, in the case of receiving a good commission, it would take a year and a half at most, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Behu nodded, the corner of his lips curling up, his assessment of Li Che not too different.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli tapped the table, indifferently saying: "As for the city lord's purpose... I can probably guess a thing or two. It can also be considered an unexpected benefit of this trip. I plan to go back and report to the old patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli looked at Xu You.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, third brother."</p><p></p><p>"That Li Che's daughter has excellent spiritual talent. The spirit infant cult's chaos outside the city is not safe. To prevent any harm to this spiritual child, go tell that Li Che to send his daughter to our Xu family's 'Spiritual Cultivation Institute'."</p><p></p><p>Xu You's cheeks lifted slightly as he looked at Xu Heli: "Elder brother... what if Master Li is unwilling?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli tapped the sword hilt lightly, causing the sword to let out a brilliant chime that filled the warm room.</p><p></p><p>"If he is unwilling, it means he does not wish to integrate with our Xu family. Then, that spiritual law will not be given to him."</p><p></p><p>"When the spirit infant cult's forces truly run rampant outside the city, the safety of his daughter... let him fend for himself."</p><p></p><p>Xu You heard this, remained silent, and slowly lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the workshop, Li Che sat in the chair, feeling the strand of wrathful spiritual energy he had just grasped, his emotions in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he froze.</p><p></p><p>His brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Because of the woodcarving he had obtained two months ago from killing a blood-changing expert of the spirit infant cult.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wrathful divine nature that was just drawn up was actually being gradually devoured by Zhao Xuanhai's divine nature! It was somewhat similar... as if they were merging together!</p><p></p><p>"Merging... devouring?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a characteristic of divine nature, or perhaps... the two divine natures are of the same origin?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Che pondered this, his breathing stilled. If they were of the same origin...</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean that this Flying Thunder City's one of the three great divine hunters, the powerful divine cultivator... is also a powerful expert of the Spirit Infant Sect?!</p><p></p><p>Upon this realization, Li Che's hair stood on end!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how the government had withdrawn the arrest warrant for Lei Chunlian just a few days ago...</p><p></p><p>And that Zhao Chuanxiong was from the Spirit Infant Sect...</p><p></p><p>Li Che had originally thought Zhao Chuanxiong was just an isolated case, but now he realized, the vast government of this Flying Thunder City must be deeply entangled with the Spirit Infant Sect! Even the top-tier divine hunters within the government were affiliated with the Spirit Infant Sect...</p><p></p><p>What about the City Lord who was said to have forged a divine foundation?</p><p></p><p>"If that's really the case..."</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of urgency suddenly enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>If the government was indeed affiliated with the Spirit Infant Sect, and the Spirit Infant Sect coveted spiritual children... wouldn't Xixia be in great danger? When the Spirit Infant Sect decides to go all out, would the Xu family even be able to protect Xixia? They might not even be willing to protect her.</p><p></p><p>The sense of urgency made Li Che's hairs stand on end as he looked at his palms and murmured, "I'm still not strong enough..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>It was a rare sunny day.</p><p></p><p>The warm winter sun was most comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen were in the courtyard, accompanying Xixia as she practiced her horse stance. Old Chen kept teasing Xixia, calling her "little stinky Xixia," making the little girl's face turn beet red with anger.</p><p></p><p>It was a mystery where this girl got such a temper from.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen were drinking tea and eating winter plums, waiting for the sun to rise higher. Li Che planned to go to Listening Rain Alley again. Over the past two months, he had visited the market a few times, asking his old acquaintance stall owner to look for divine nature techniques and superior inner strength methods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had received no news.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a bowl of tea and chewing on the tea leaves, Li Che planned to head out, just as the gloomy-faced Xu You arrived.</p><p></p><p>Xu You repeated the words Xu Heli had said the day before.</p><p></p><p>"So... if I don't let Xixia go to the 'Divine Cultivation Institute' in the inner city, after I change my blood, the Xu family won't easily pass down the divine nature techniques to me?" Li Che furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sat in the rattan chair and chuckled, "This has always been the way of the powerful families. Little Xu, your elder brother is much more ruthless than you. You are too kind and gentle."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, people like you are easily taken advantage of."</p><p></p><p>"Your second brother Xu Beihu, he may look simple-minded, but in reality... he is also cunning and ruthless."</p><p></p><p>Xu You remained silent, only looking at Li Che. "I've gotten you approval to accompany Xixia. You can take her to and from the inner city every day, and I will personally send Xixia to the Divine Cultivation Institute and ensure her safety."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, the Divine Cultivation Institute will be much safer than the outer city..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered this.</p><p></p><p>Xu You did not interrupt Li Che's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not think for too long before making his decision.</p><p></p><p>Go, send Xixia there!</p><p></p><p>Xu You had already secured excellent conditions for him and Xixia.</p><p></p><p>He could not keep Xixia confined in the courtyard forever, she eventually had to go out and experience the world.</p><p></p><p>And with Xixia entering the Divine Cultivation Institute, she could quickly begin cultivating her divine nature and lay a solid foundation for her divine cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>Besides that, there was another very important reason.</p><p></p><p>Being able to freely enter and exit the inner city every day...</p><p></p><p>Li Che would have the opportunity to get close to the reclusive Simu Bai...</p><p></p><p>And twist that number one anti-fan of Xixia's head off!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

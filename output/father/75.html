        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain was washing the ground, accompanied by howling winds, causing the pooled water to whip up white-capped waves that surged along the long stone street.</p><p></p><p>Through the blurry rain curtain,</p><p></p><p>Two figures wearing children's masks stood on the extremely slippery black tiles of the rooftop, holding umbrellas.</p><p></p><p>The rain crashed against the umbrella surfaces, bursting into plumes of mist.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it seems... haha... that it's over?" </p><p></p><p>The figure wearing a laughing girl's mask was unable to stop laughing, the eyes beneath the mask gazing at the Shenxiu Temple under the endless rain curtain, with a sense of gravity rather than mirth.</p><p></p><p>Beside him stood a burly figure, brow furrowed, a sharp long blade hanging at his waist.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that?</p><p></p><p>The sound of the explosion...</p><p></p><p>Just like that night."</p><p></p><p>The figure wearing a fearful boy's mask exhaled a thick breath, his voice muffled by the pounding rain, overpowering the laughter of the person beside him.</p><p></p><p>"And... I can smell the scent of terror..."</p><p></p><p>The fearful mask spoke softly, taking a deep inhale.</p><p></p><p>Terror... the smell of death.</p><p></p><p>It was truly overpowering.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth,</p><p></p><p>The two fixed their gaze</p><p></p><p>Towards the long street shrouded in the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered, lightning snaking.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting a towering figure.</p><p></p><p>Bulging muscles rippling under the tight black clothing, sinews taut like coiled dragons, letting out a long, shrill roar.</p><p></p><p>A bovine mask, yet exuding the most terrifying fear imaginable.</p><p></p><p>"It's him, for sure!"</p><p></p><p>The two were startled.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes turned to the small girl seated on the Ox Demon's shoulder, holding a small oiled paper umbrella, shielding a patch of clear sky, the rain unable to soak her as the droplets sliding off the umbrella rim were instantly evaporated by the Ox Demon's aura, not a single one landing on the girl.</p><p></p><p>And behind this odd pair,</p><p></p><p>Silently following, was a boy with a Nezha-style braid, drenched by the rain.</p><p></p><p>This strange combination radiated an unsettling feeling that chilled the two to the bone.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head back, the eyes beneath the mask gleaming with cold.</p><p></p><p>"They all deserve to die."</p><p></p><p>With that,</p><p></p><p>A chorus of crows!</p><p></p><p>The Sanwu Gatling Wood Crows opened fire! The metal barrels flashed rapidly, spitting out fiery lotus blossoms! </p><p></p><p>The screeching wooden crows, like arrows loosed from a taut bow, trailed flames as they darted towards the two figures on the rooftop. But due to the distance, the two were able to react in time, their surging auras shattering the rain curtain and evaporating the mist, allowing them to evade the barrage.</p><p></p><p>"The speed still isn't quite fast enough..."</p><p></p><p>"At this distance, they had time to react, but if the speed was high enough, they wouldn't be able to respond in time."</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow, silently analyzing the shortcomings. </p><p></p><p>Perfecting a top-tier mechanism requires constant refinement.</p><p></p><p>The rising steam dissipated, the downpour continuing, and the two figures had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the lingering divine auras...</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiangyang and Zhou Ruoguan, the 'Awe-Inspiring' and 'Confounding Delight' of the Three Great Divine Hunters?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>The 'Unsullied Heart' Dao fruit in his body pulsed, instantly analyzing the origins of the two divine auras.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of terror... and the 'aura of delight', the other two of the seven emotions..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Hunters, the imperial court, the Lingying Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"How utterly laughable."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon tilted his head back, the rain-soaked mask hiding the "Sanwu Gatling Wood Crows", the Ox Demon's fan-like hand unfurling.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His palm grasped and supported the umbrella held by Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, sit tight."</p><p></p><p>Xixia's face was flushed red. This was her first time experiencing something like this, and she felt not fear, but endless excitement.</p><p></p><p>How thrilling and joyful... she was almost going crazy with excitement...</p><p></p><p>This was such an exciting thing, and she absolutely couldn't let her father find out, or he would surely not let her do such fun things.</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Che, the lights flickered.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Warrior (Lv2, 75%)】</p><p></p><p>Ever since his martial arts cultivation broke through the meridian level...</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Warrior Dao Fruit had undergone a sudden surge...</p><p></p><p>Li Che estimated that to break through the Dragon Elephant Golden Warrior to Lv3, all he needed to do was open his divine meridian, at which point divine abilities would begin to take shape.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the "Wrathful Golden Warrior", and his qi and blood surged with a roar, refining his physical body to an unparalleled degree. Based on his meridian cultivation, Li Che's qi and blood had multiplied several times over!</p><p></p><p>It spread like wildfire across his body! At this moment, Li Che felt that his refinement had reached the Mysterious Meridian realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless raindrops exploded.</p><p></p><p>With a heavy step, his towering figure shot forth like an arrow released from a bow.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he leapt up onto the rooftop, and with a heavy stomp amidst the bursting raindrops, he charged after the laughing-mask-wearing Divine Constable Zhou Ruoguan!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ruoguan fled like a sparrowhawk across the rooftops! Suddenly, scorching hot qi and blood came rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>His vision went dark! And he saw the terrifying, mountain-like figure of the "Ox Demon" blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>Searing hot qi and blood, like a raging river, crashed against him!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's you!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Ruoguan was utterly horrified.</p><p></p><p>How could this be so fast?! No, wait...</p><p></p><p>He had split up and fled with Zhang Xiangyang... Why was this "Ox Demon" coming after him?</p><p></p><p>Did he think Zhou Ruoguan was easy prey?! In this moment, Zhou Ruoguan felt deeply insulted!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Ox Demon! Do you think I'm weak?!"</p><p></p><p>His roar was mixed with laughter.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ruoguan burst forth with raging qi and blood, and an intense divine aura poured out from him!</p><p></p><p>He was one of the Three Great Divine Constables, Zhou Ruoguan, a martial arts master with a cultivated nature like a river! Did this Ox Demon think he was just trash like Zhao Xuanhai?! </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for those terrifying mechanisms, those exploding black crows, in a direct confrontation, how could the Ox Demon, who had only just broken through the Blood Transformation realm, possibly make Zhou Ruoguan afraid?!</p><p></p><p>And in the current situation, Zhou Ruoguan had no choice but to counterattack with all his might!</p><p></p><p>The surging, tumultuous【Chaotic Seductive Deity】divine power, as Zhou Ruoguan clapped his palms together, stirred the wind and rain, gathering the rainwater into a massive, grinning head!</p><p></p><p>Countless chaotic, mind-piercing laughter sounds, drowning out the pounding of the rain, came from all directions, as if trying to burrow into the brain! "Divine Art: Joyful Flying Decapitated Head!"</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhou Ruoguan had condensed the divine art of the Joyful Flying Decapitated Head, it was ruthlessly crushed and popped like a balloon by the Ox Demon's grasping five fingers. Zhou Ruoguan was overcome with a chill.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... had divine power far exceeding his own realm! It seemed that even the rainwater falling from the great heights had not yet reached the Ox Demon's body before being evaporated by the scorching hot qi and blood, which twisted the air around it, nearly suffocating Zhou Ruoguan!</p><p></p><p>How could this Ox Demon be so strong?! "Such qi and blood... such refinement..."</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Meridian?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ruoguan suddenly understood why Zhao Xuanhai had died.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon was a monster!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's over, haha..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The laughter was cut short.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's massive, searing fist...</p><p></p><p>Had already crashed down!</p><p></p><p>Shattering the laughing child's mask, shattering Zhou Ruoguan's nasal bone, shattering his skull...</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>His entire head burst open like a watermelon.</p>

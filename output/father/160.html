        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The daughter brought a friend home to play.</p><p></p><p>This would normally not be a problem, as it is a common and ordinary occurrence.</p><p></p><p>However, the friend the daughter brought back had a temple deity hidden within her, which was very problematic.</p><p></p><p>This was the situation Li Che now faced.</p><p></p><p>Turning and entering the kitchen, Li Che's expression became grave, as a young girl had a temple deity hidden within her.</p><p></p><p>Through the [Plucking Star Pupils], he could clearly see the intense divine nature of the temple deity within this young girl, and its rank was not low.</p><p></p><p>At least, it was higher in rank than the Temple Deity of the Eight Extremes Fire Eye Mysterious Gibbon he had just absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was solemn, as this was equivalent to a time bomb next to Xixia. </p><p></p><p>No one knew when it would completely explode.</p><p></p><p>However, upon observing the young girl's condition, she seemed quite normal, and it was evident that her will had not been controlled by the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>"So, this temple deity... is sealed within her body?"</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a tactic of those ancient family clans?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>This young girl, Yun'e, was from the Lingnan Road City, from an ancient family clan of the road city, with extremely rich heritage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was highly likely that the ancient family clan had sealed the temple deity within the young girl's body.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... it is for this temple deity resonance?"</p><p></p><p>Similar to how Xixia had the [Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Tip Spear] hidden in her arm, this young girl had a temple deity hidden within her, also to prepare for entering the mysterious temple of the Three Princes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but think of this reason, and it did have a high probability...</p><p></p><p>But to hide a temple deity within a young girl, the parents must have had a huge heart, as the temple deity was not just a divine weapon, and if it went berserk... the girl's consciousness could be instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, these talented geniuses from the Road City cannot be underestimated. If these two are like this, then what about the son of Ji Moli?"</p><p></p><p>"Since Ji Moli is so eager for this mysterious temple, he must have made some preparations before letting his son participate in the temple deity resonance..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Originally, because Xixia had obtained the divine mythical weapon Fire Tip Spear in the Golden Heavenly King's Palace, he felt that Xixia should be stable.</p><p></p><p>In the temple deity resonance, she should be the shining star.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems he celebrated too early.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Fire Tip Spear, it cannot be said that she can completely crush all the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover... Xixia still cannot wield the divine mythical weapon Fire Tip Spear."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to find a way to help Xixia master the Fire Tip Spear, even if it's just the initial mastery... that would be great."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is competing, as a parent, I have to compete as well..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was deep in thought as he entered the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya was diligently preparing the dishes, after all, Xixia had brought a new friend home, as the mother, she naturally wanted to show off her cooking skills.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, you're back?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya saw Li Che and immediately raised the spatula, revealing a happy expression.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Li Che was going to the mysterious temple to observe the temple deities today, and her heart couldn't help but be anxious, as the mysterious temple was a symbol of terror for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Now that her husband had returned safely, the heart that was hanging in suspense was finally put down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took out the packed meals, telling his wife she didn't need to cook, but Zhang Ya disagreed, wanting to show off her skills in front of her daughter's friend.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che could only sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything, but rolled up his sleeves and joined in the cooking process.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming wealthy, Li Che had rarely cooked, but when he was a worker at the wood carving shop, he often cooked.</p><p></p><p>Now, cooking together with his wife, he found some of the old feelings.</p><p></p><p>The couple cooked three dishes, including Xixia's favorite sweet and sour pork ribs and braised pork, and Li Che made the hometown dish of ginger duck.</p><p></p><p>They also took out the dishes packed from the restaurant and invited the children to eat together.</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo and the wind-worn Li Qingshan, who had just escaped with LÃ¼ Chi, also came to freeload.</p><p></p><p>When Li Qingshan saw the unharmed Li Che, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But the inner turmoil was no less.</p><p></p><p>Li Che... killed Wen Long Mountain!</p><p></p><p>No, it should be said that Li Che and Ma Mian worked together to kill Wen Long Mountain. Even if it was two against one, this was definitely not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was increasingly amazed at Li Che's growth rate.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, when he acts together with Niu Mo, he will be able to have even more fun.</p><p></p><p>The long table was set, with a clean tablecloth, and the steaming dishes were placed on the table.</p><p></p><p>The little fatty smelled the aroma of the dishes and felt hungry, even though he had just eaten his own big chicken leg, but his stomach seemed to be a black hole that could never be filled.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the very polite and well-educated Yun'e, the little fatty Zhou Peng was like a starving beggar, constantly stuffing food into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xixia couldn't bear to watch it at all, and after trying to compete with Zhou Peng in eating speed, she decisively gave up.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Li Qingshan clinked glasses and drank.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan, I went to the mysterious temple outside the Heart Monkey Temple today and saw something interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's drinking action paused for a moment, as if he didn't understand why Li Che would suddenly tell him this.</p><p></p><p>But he was not stupid, and immediately sensed something.</p><p></p><p>"Do you mean... there is something dirty? Do we need to clean it up?" Li Qingshan narrowed his eyes and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>The "dirty thing" Li Qingshan mentioned naturally referred to the evil people of the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, confirming Li Qingshan's guess.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes flashed with killing intent: "Let's do it."</p><p></p><p>The two simply clinked glasses and drank, completing the formulation of a plan.</p><p></p><p>After the meal.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took Shu Popo for a stroll to aid digestion.</p><p></p><p>The children played in the courtyard, and Zhang Ya began to practice martial arts diligently again, and life began to slow down and become harmonious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat under the eaves for a while, then smiled and entered the study.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Chessboard enveloped, isolating the exploration.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the study, beginning to study the Avalokitesvara Sitting Lotus Main Battle Formation and the supreme skill [Nine Seals of the Mechanism].</p><p></p><p>He was very interested in this supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that the potential of this supreme skill was far beyond ordinary skills, so he would invest more energy in researching it.</p><p></p><p>"My Dragon Elephant Dao Fruit has already reached level 3, and the maturity is as high as 90%. As long as I have a few more battles, I should be able to break through to level 4..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Untainted Heart, Chess Saint, and Painting Immortal, the progress of the Dragon Elephant Dao Fruit was the second fastest after the Immortal Craftsman.</p><p></p><p>The improvement gained from the battle with Wen Long Mountain had allowed the Dragon Elephant Dao Fruit to be fully consumed.</p><p></p><p>"So... this trip to the Heart Monkey Temple may be able to promote the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit to level 4, and the divine power will take shape!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flashed, and he couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the appearance of the great master by the side of the Prince had brought Li Che great pressure.</p><p></p><p>So, the promotion of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit, adding a little more foundation, would also be good.</p><p></p><p>More foundation means more confidence.</p><p></p><p>In case he had to face this great master in the future, he would also have the capital to take action.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>Putting two fingers together, he tore open the air.</p><p></p><p>A shiny mirror fell out of the Qiankun Space, the round bronze-backed Thousand-Mile Divine Communication Mirror!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the round mirror and glanced at it, and the flowing light immediately gathered into words in front of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Nine, the Fire Eye Mysterious Gibbon Temple, the Sect's Hunting Plan will be launched, do not act on your own."</p><p></p><p>Li Che almost laughed out loud.</p><p></p><p>How sincere the message was.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, Li Che was sure that it was because he had sensed the Thousand-Mile Divine Communication Mirror when he was staying at the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised, and collected the Divine Communication Mirror into the Qiankun Space, as they both had a sense of each other.</p><p></p><p>However, it should be within a very close distance.</p><p></p><p>"The evil people of the Corpse God Sect in the Heart Monkey Temple... want to make a move on the mysterious Fire Eye Mysterious Gibbon Temple? Hunting plan? What are they hunting... the temple deities?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know that this Xuan Nine had already been secretly killed by him, so this message should be truly reliable.</p><p></p><p>"Hunting the temple deities?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Corpse God Sect have such means?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression couldn't help but become solemn.</p><p></p><p>He studied the Thousand-Mile Divine Communication Mirror a bit, slowly infusing his divine sense, and found no response.</p><p></p><p>This thing seems to have been imprinted with the Corpse Curse, and requires death qi to activate.</p><p></p><p>If others get it, they really can't operate it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che is different...</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he raised his finger, and the death qi of the Corpse Qi Finger began to spread and entwine.</p><p></p><p>Using the death qi, he wrote on the mirror.</p><p></p><p>"I'm seriously injured, when will you act? Do you need my help?"</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven and Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Curse Seal trembled, and a wave of fluctuations spread out.</p><p></p><p>Sending the written message...</p><p></p><p>Sent! Li Che didn't mind being exposed, but he also didn't mind playing it as a free chess piece.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the side room, exhaling and inhaling death qi and corpse qi, the Xuan Li Great Master suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Thousand-Mile Divine Communication Mirror from his bosom, and the mirror had a flashing light feedback.</p><p></p><p>The light flashed and intertwined into words.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li's face revealed a smile: "If it takes too long to reply, it means the Divine Communication Mirror has been obtained by someone else, and cannot be activated by death qi and Corpse Curse Seal, so it cannot reply."</p><p></p><p>"Now that he has replied... it means Xuan Nine should not have died yet, and as I expected, he is seriously injured."</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know why he is hiding in the Qin Tian Monitoring team's group..."</p><p></p><p>"But Xuan Nine should have his own plan."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this Corpse Curse Seal is something that cannot be faked, and once imprinted... he is a person of our Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Communication Mirror is not something that anyone can activate."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Then, he revealed a sneer: "Xuan Nine... it seems he is really not good at martial arts, no wonder he has been a seventh-level lower position Corpse God Disciple for half his life, the silver storm he condensed is unstable, and was easily broken by the Monitoring Upright, so he was seriously injured..."</p><p></p><p>"Embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed, shaking his head: "But for the subsequent plan, if Xuan Nine, a seventh-level lower position Corpse God Disciple, joins us, the plan to capture the temple deities will still be very good to carry out."</p><p></p><p>Death qi grew on his finger, and he wrote on the Divine Communication Mirror again.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Nine, are you seriously injured? Do you need a seventh-level death qi condensed pill? I have one here, take it quickly to recover your injuries, and then cooperate with us in the divine capture operation."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Communication Mirror was silent for about ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li smiled, as if through the Divine Communication Mirror, he could see Xuan Nine's embarrassed and yet unwilling to accept face.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Communication Mirror transmitted a message.</p><p></p><p>Bashfully.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Li smiled.</p><p></p><p>He replied.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be embarrassed, your recovery is the most important thing for the mission to be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to receive it."</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a black jade bottle from the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>Placed it on the Divine Communication Mirror...</p><p></p><p>Forming a hand seal.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, black smoke rose from the surface of the Divine Communication Mirror, enveloping the black jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the study.</p><p></p><p>The candle light was dim.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned by the message coming from the Divine Communication Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect's Corpse God Disciple, it turns out that they are so enthusiastic and affectionate with each other? Knowing that he was seriously injured, they immediately sent a precious seventh-level death qi condensed combat pill.</p><p></p><p>But the most important thing is that Li Che was somewhat surprised that the Divine Communication Mirror could actually transmit items across space?!</p><p></p><p>The black smoke rolled, like a small-scale time and space separation technique created by the Corpse Art, swirling.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the mirror Li Che was holding, the black smoke dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A black jade bottle appeared.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his divine sense, confirming that there were no hidden tricks, no hidden needles or the like, Li Che then grabbed the jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>"A seventh-level condensed death qi combat pill... really..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>How generous.</p><p></p><p>On the mirror, there was another message: "Take it, quickly recover your injuries, and we'll call you to action."</p><p></p><p>Li Che replied enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay," he said, and then placed the divine communication mirror on the desk.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy and divine nature in his body surged, transforming into divine ink, which he then splashed onto the pure heart drawing paper. </p><p></p><p>A lifelike divine communication mirror then appeared in his hand, which he had replicated.</p><p></p><p>In the process of replicating it, with the help of the Pluck Star Pupil, after grasping the underlying principles, he slightly modified the procedure.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the divine communication mirror to not be bound by the imprint of death energy and corpse curse. Instead, it was modified to require Li Che's divine nature chess piece to activate it.</p><p></p><p>This made it a unique mark belonging only to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Users only need to fuse their divine consciousness or vital energy with the divine nature chess piece to bind it to their fixed identity, making it unusable by others.</p><p></p><p>"This thing... is quite good for communicating with the Underworld," Li Che chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his "Painting Immortal" techniques and the divine nature chess piece, he could make these items last a long time, and they would not be easily destroyed unless forcefully destroyed.</p><p></p><p>An organization needs means of communication, which is the foundation for it to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect has the Thousand Mile Divine Communication Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld... can just be directly replicated.</p><p></p><p>"However, the ability to transmit materials cannot be replicated, as that requires cultivating space-time techniques beyond just corpse techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>But the ability to transmit messages would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>After replicating a few more divine communication mirrors, Li Che was quite satisfied and stopped.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After properly guiding his wife Zhang Ya in cultivating the Temper Bone Posture, the next day, Li Che woke up to the sun shining, a rare occurrence without snow.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his wife Zhang Ya lazily curled up in the quilt, Li Che took out a divine communication mirror and handed it to her.</p><p></p><p>After teaching Zhang Ya how to use it, she immediately started playing with it joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep, husband, please respond!"</p><p>"My husband did very well, wife is very satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly received the messages through the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the various playful messages from Zhang Ya, he couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast, Li Che sent Xixia, Yunye, and Little Fatty Zhou Peng to cultivate on Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>Monk Sanguan was standing upright on the mountain path, waiting for Li Che early on.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che bringing the children, she warmly smiled and took them over.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, goodbye, remember to think of Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Xixia, Li Che descended the mountain amidst the waving arms of the little girl.</p><p></p><p>He first went to the temple at the peak of Zhenglie Peak where Li Qingshan was stabilizing his divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che appear, Li Qingshan's eyes instantly gleamed with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>After briefly discussing the upcoming actions with Li Qingshan, Li Che handed him the divine communication mirror and taught him how to use it.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Thousand Mile Divine Communication Mirror of the Corpse God Sect? This thing is a Seven Element Divine Weapon! The Underworld just casually gives these out?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's vision was naturally extraordinary, and he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Mile Divine Communication Mirror was a divine weapon exclusive to the Corpse God Sect, which could only be activated by those who had received the Corpse Curse Imprint.</p><p></p><p>In Li Qingshan's mind, the Underworld where Ox Demon and Horse Face resided had risen in status.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, I'll go explore the truth and see how many Corpse God Sect experts are hidden within the Heart Monkey Temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was eager to try, but realizing that he did not have the extraordinary escape techniques like Horse Face, if he were to get trapped by the Corpse God Sect experts swarming in the Heart Monkey Temple, with the Seven Element Corpse God Envoy stationed there, he would likely only be able to meet his demise.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Li Qingshan to pay attention to the divine communication mirror's news, Li Che then left the mountain.</p><p></p><p>As usual, he went to the Cliff Pavilion of the Astronomical Observatory to work.</p><p></p><p>When it came to work, Li Che was serious.</p><p></p><p>Nine to five, without fail.</p><p></p><p>For the next two days, Li Che's life returned to a stable and ordinary routine.</p><p></p><p>During the day, he worked, letting his "Painting Immortal" clone complete the commissioned wood carvings to earn wages. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, his main body cultivated various supreme techniques, tempering his five viscera and six bowels to become stronger. As for the cultivation of his divine foundation, he distributed divine nature crystals to his various cultivation clones to meet their cultivation needs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt he was too busy.</p><p></p><p>Even with clones, he was still busy.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of busyness, accompanied by the feeling of gradually becoming stronger, made him feel very settled and fulfilled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After entering the city, the young prince, the son of Empress Jimo, was very high-profile on the first day.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, after taking up residence in the Prefectural Mansion, he became completely silent.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had completely retreated and was focusing on cultivation, preparing for the Deity Temple Resonance.</p><p></p><p>During this period, all five major families sent people to try to establish connections, and the five major sects also dispatched people, but they were all turned away by the young prince.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what the young prince was doing.</p><p></p><p>They just assumed the Deity Temple Resonance was about to begin, and the young prince was concentrating on preparing for it.</p><p></p><p>So they no longer disturbed him.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll wait for the young prince to succeed in the Deity Temple Resonance and obtain the deity inheritance before coming to congratulate him."</p><p></p><p>Qin Family Master Qin Cang respectfully clasped his hands and bowed, retreating in the snow and wind.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Prefectural Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Snow was falling in the quiet pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The entire garden was blanketed in white.</p><p></p><p>The young prince, wrapped in a crane-fur cloak, sat in the pavilion, with a brazier beside him, emitting warmth to dispel the cold.</p><p></p><p>The old one-armed man sat quietly in the pavilion, keeping the young prince company.</p><p></p><p>The young prince's name was Ji Haihui, a name personally given by his father, the Pacification King Ji Molei.</p><p></p><p>Prefectural Master Su Huaili, in casual clothes, also sat in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The young prince was studying intently, the information Su Huaili had collected about the mysterious Temple of the Third Prince since taking up the position of Prefectural Master in the Jinguang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This information was related to whether the young prince could obtain the deity inheritance in the upcoming Deity Temple Resonance.</p><p></p><p>The young prince naturally would not treat it lightly.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been studying these materials.</p><p></p><p>"Braided double buns, wearing a red belly shirt, wrapped in red silk..."</p><p></p><p>"Do I have to dress like that as well?" The young prince put down the materials, his face slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining that image made him feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"For the Deity Temple Resonance... you need to try to match the deity's original appearance as much as possible. You have been cultivating the Fire Attribute Spear Technique since you were young, isn't it for this moment?" </p><p></p><p>"It's all to try to best match the deity."</p><p></p><p>"It's not embarrassing for the sake of the deity resonance," Su Huaili smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young prince's youthful face also showed an expression of agreement.</p><p></p><p>"My four elder brothers have all reached a deity resonance level of over 90%, obtaining the deity inheritance... and are now the four great generals under my father the King."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to be like my brothers, to relieve my father the King's worries!"</p><p></p><p>"To become the sharpest spear under my father the King, unstoppable!"</p><p></p><p>The young prince's eyes shone with ambition: "So this time's deity resonance, I must succeed. I must reach a 90% match!"</p><p></p><p>"I must obtain the divine weapon set of the Third Prince Deity!"</p><p></p><p>The young prince was full of fighting spirit! "The competition isn't that fierce. Although the Temple of the Third Prince is one of the Four Mysterious Temples and has great mysticism, the divine talents of the Deity Realm are all focused on the Temple of the Three Purities."</p><p></p><p>"To complete the resonance of the Temple of the Three Purities and obtain the inheritance..."</p><p></p><p>"They won't come to compete with me for this Temple of the Four Mysteries, so I'll be relaxed. As for the divine talents sent by the Qianyuan Deity Sect in the South Continent... they are not a threat."</p><p></p><p>The young prince sat in the chair, gently rubbing his palms near the fire.</p><p></p><p>"It's the divine talent from the Jinguang Prefecture that I need to pay more attention to."</p><p></p><p>The young prince said.</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili was taken aback, not having thought that the young prince would be more wary of the local divine talent.</p><p></p><p>"Father the King said that we must pay close attention to the local divine talents. With the deity resonance approaching, the divine talents born at this critical juncture... may possess extraordinary divine fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Such divine talents are more likely to be favored."</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili's expression changed slightly, but he nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Su, you make the arrangements.

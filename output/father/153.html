            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo crushed the white chess piece that Niu Mo had left for him.</p><p></p><p>It signified that action was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the carriage, bumping along, the carriage from the Astronomical Observatory was clearly not as comfortable as the carriage from the Gongfu Manor that he had taken to Mount Shendiao.</p><p></p><p>Gazing out the window at the constantly changing scenery.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brows raised slightly.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to kill Wen Long Mountain was by no means an easy task, first of all Wen Long Mountain's own cultivation was extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with his almost perfected Seven Element Divine Arrow Technique that was close to the Transformation Realm, his troublesomeness was no weaker than any Yuanxiang Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So, since South Lihuo was planning to act, he must have at least an 80% chance of being able to kill Wen Long Mountain before he would act.</p><p></p><p>Li Che leaned back on the soft cushion of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>His fingers lightly tapping on the table.</p><p></p><p>Then a slight arc appeared at the corners of his lips.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sect Master has confidence...</p><p></p><p>Then this Wen Long Mountain must be killed!</p><p></p><p>Opposite Li Che, Gong Yunli was eating candied fruit while chatting idly with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Ae Che, I'm very curious, how did you win over the Lord of Tangling? Was it really just your talent?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli propped her smooth chin with one hand, leaning on the table, able to be more at ease, while curiously asking.</p><p></p><p>She still hadn't guessed that Li Che was actually Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>Her clear eyes revealing a touch of foolishness.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Li Che's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>After casually responding to Gong Yunli a few times, Li Che found an excuse to get out of the carriage to get some fresh air.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli heard this and didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Temple of the Fire-Eyed Magical Monkey was not too far from the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Located in the area where the Heart Monkey Temple was, it was about half an hour's carriage ride away, during which getting out to get some fresh air and enjoy the snowy scenery was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>The snowy scenery by the Nine Dragons River, although discounted due to the inability of the river water to freeze, formed a kind of cloudy and resplendent scene in the winter due to the rising steam, with a unique flavor.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli also put on a fox fur and got out of the carriage to get some fresh air, looking at the surging river, her mood became pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at her, the Heavenly Earth Chessboard was activated, shielding his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned and entered the dense forest, and when he came out again, he had become the avatar of [Painting Immortal].</p><p></p><p>However, this avatar contained a flying thunder chess piece.</p><p></p><p>After the matter was done, Li Che could directly transfer over.</p><p></p><p>"Young Supervisor, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? You're done already? That fast?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli had just stretched, not expecting Li Che to be done so quickly.</p><p></p><p>She could only climb back into the carriage with some displeasure.</p><p></p><p>After the carriage had driven away, a towering figure slowly emerged from behind the forest.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, wrapped in a black cloak, as tall as a pagoda, with a cute cow mask covering his face.</p><p></p><p>Pressing down the hat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the carriage that was breaking through the wind and snow, clenching his five fingers, and the white flying thunder chess piece was instantly crushed by him.</p><p></p><p>His figure shifted and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak, bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo sat on the main seat, beside him was the senior brother who had come from the Dao City, Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu narrowed his eyes, waving his fly whisk, looking at South Lihuo raising his hand, a scarlet paper crane flapping its wings and landing in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother... still can't let it go?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu sighed, saying with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo glanced at the Taoist priest: "Senior brother... the way you say it, do you think I can let it go?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu turned his head to look at the large platform in front of the temple: "I brought the divine children from Dao City, and they will compete with your Golden Light Division's talent ranked on the Dao City Divine Children List in the 'Temple God Resonance' before..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to give up again on this side?"</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo's white hair flew, smiling: "Senior brother, it's rare for you to come..."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've helped my junior brother watch the show."</p><p></p><p>"I must trouble senior brother a bit, right?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu reached out and tapped South Lihuo, the helplessness completely written on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You little fellow, still as shrewd as ever, always trying to scheme against your senior brother me..."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't senior brother often help me keep watch in the past?"</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo stood up, the silk white robe on his body fluttering in the breeze, the gusting wind making his sleeves swell like inflated air bags.</p><p></p><p>"Then, help your junior brother again, will you?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu leaned back in the chair, his face full of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't have come to this Golden Light Prefecture... As soon as I came, I was used as a horse and cart by you!"</p><p></p><p>"Last time to suppress the Four Mysterious Temple, this time... to watch your house!"</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo's lips curled into a slight smile: "Then senior brother... will you go kill someone for me?"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest did not hesitate for a second, shaking his head vigorously, like a rattle drum.</p><p></p><p>"I've never killed anyone!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask me to do this."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The smile on South Lihuo's face gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother... sometimes... when others want to kill you, but you don't kill them..."</p><p></p><p>"You are too merciful."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, mercy... is not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu waved his hand: "Ah, I'm just such a person, I can only scold my little fatty disciple a bit... You be careful, junior brother."</p><p></p><p>"I just came to see you, afraid that in a few more years, I won't be able to see you anymore."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the Golden Light Peak platform in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the group of divine sect spiritual children, divine children, who looked like little radish heads.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the one with her hands on her hips, head held high with a little pot belly, the direct disciple Xie Xie.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed a touch of gentleness.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother... you just help me keep an eye on the wind, and evaluate Xie Xie's talent. If she can enter the Dao City Divine Children List, she must have gained the recognition of the Dao City Astronomical Observatory Supervisor."</p><p></p><p>"But... take a look, can Xie Xie enter the eyes of the Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said.</p><p></p><p>Taoist priest Wang Kuyu heard this, his body immediately straightened up, as long as it didn't involve fighting and killing, he would become serious.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at that little tyrant girl.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu's face was full of a tangled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult... The Patriarch has not taken in disciples for many years."</p><p></p><p>"A few years ago, the talent ranked tenth on the Dao City Divine Children List came to beg to be accepted as a disciple, but was not taken in."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch may no longer accept disciples."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo's brows slowly furrowed: "The Patriarch's direct disciples should still have one position, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there is still one position, but that doesn't mean it will definitely be taken, right..." </p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Xie's talent is really good!" </p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, this girl's talent is indeed not bad, otherwise she wouldn't have been noticed by the Dao City Astronomical Observatory and ranked 21st on the Divine Children List."</p><p></p><p>"But... she's only 21st after all." Wang Kuyu added.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Xie is only four years old!" </p><p></p><p>South Lihuo spoke seriously, only four years old, how could that not be good enough? The Taoist priest paused: "If she wasn't four years old... she might not even have entered the Divine Children List."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, don't be discouraged, whether to accept or not, it really depends on the Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... the Patriarch just happens to have an eye on this little girl?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu didn't completely shut the door.</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo smiled, no longer dwelling on it, asking the Taoist priest to preside over this challenge event.</p><p></p><p>Then his figure gracefully entered the temple.</p><p></p><p>The doors suddenly closed, with a rolling sound.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu waved his fly whisk, sighing: "Junior brother, junior brother... when will the cycle of hatred end."</p><p></p><p>"Shu Huai, the smallest disciple of Pacification King Yili, who is also the one he looks upon most favorably, has been sent to the Golden Light Prefecture... In addition to attaching importance to the Four Mysterious Temple Furious Wrath of the Third Prince, ..."</p><p></p><p>"He also has an eye on my junior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Yili... has also noticed my junior brother."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Wang Kuyu didn't know how to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly pinched his fingers, a white paper crane flew down and landed in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Who does my junior brother want to kill?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the five-year-old young master of the Pacification King, who is about to come to the Third Prince Mysterious Temple for the upcoming Temple God Resonance..."</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother wouldn't be... wanting to kill this little prince, right?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Impossible...</p><p></p><p>The son of Pacification King... how could he be so easily killed?</p><p></p><p>Maybe there is a great patriarch secretly protecting him.</p><p></p><p>Junior brother... don't go to your death.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu no longer thought about these things.</p><p></p><p>On the platform.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang Qing of the Two Sleeves Peak, with a stern face, indifferently scanned the group of children below.</p><p></p><p>He had come to preside over this challenge exchange competition again.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou, in a red robe, was also watching with interest.</p><p></p><p>And the gentle Tong Wuyu as well.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Golden Light Division were basically all here.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was accompanying Sumu Bao, still currying favor, now that Li Qingshan had officially stepped into the Shenxiang realm, he had replaced Xu Jiujie as the Execution Hall Elder.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak had also become one of the four major elder peaks.</p><p></p><p>The status of the Sword River Peak had fallen, because of Xu Jiujie's matter, the true transmissions of the Sword River Peak originally were all demoted to inner sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>It was an innocent victim of fate.</p><p></p><p>But this was a problem of destiny.</p><p></p><p>And Lü Chi of Zheng Lei Peak, who was originally an inner sect disciple, directly lucked out and became a true transmission.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was Huang Sixiang, who had entered Li Qingshan's door as an inner sect disciple, and had also been promoted to a true transmission position, mainly because the Sword River Peak had an extra true transmission position...</p><p></p><p>Huang Sixiang was also bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the four true transmissions were: Hai Chaosheng entered the Sword River Peak, Gong Yuanliang entered the Two Sleeves Peak, Gongyang Xiu entered the South Mountain Peak, and Zhu Hongdou did not accept any true transmissions.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng fell from the true transmission position because of this.</p><p></p><p>Extremely aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>Under a Elder's banner, there could not be two true transmissions, this was the rule.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng could only wait for the annual sect assessment at the end of the year to regain the true transmission position.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was sitting in the chair, comforting Sumu Bao.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>The words of comfort got stuck, he narrowed his eyes, sweeping towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he seemed to have seen a familiar figure as towering as a pagoda...</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Qingxiu Niu Ma duo had been less active, he was actually having hallucinations, missing Niu Mo? "No! That is Niu Mo!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Didn't call me to join in the fun?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan quickly understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>How could Niu Mo appear in the Golden Light Peak for no reason?</p><p></p><p>With his extremely keen sense of smell for trouble, Li Qingshan quickly sensed what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo... secretly taking on a job again, not bringing me along?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo crushed the white chess piece.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense, which was almost about to shed its mortal form, had scanned this chess piece many times.</p><p></p><p>It was just an ordinary spiritual chess piece, without anything strange about it.</p><p></p><p>But when he crushed the chess piece, Niu Mo could sense it? Complete the information transmission? What kind of secret technique was this? South Lihuo was very curious, although the transmitted information was limited, but at critical moments, it could change the situation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the darkness, a towering figure slowly emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>Wide-brimmed hat, black cloak, cute cow mask.</p><p></p><p>If not Niu Mo, then who? He actually appeared! South Lihuo's heart jumped, even more curious about Niu Mo's stealthy and elusive skills.</p><p></p><p>"Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented force.</p><p></p><p>To have such a stealthy technique, it must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"South Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The muffled voice came from under the Niu Mo mask.</p><p></p><p>"You're here?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's Ma Mian?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sniper, he won't easily expose his position... I'll come, and when it's time to act, he will strike."</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo's sleeves billowed wildly behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"The plan."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes under the Niu Mo mask narrowed slightly as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Long Mountain has been ordered to leave the Golden Light Prefecture City to receive someone."</p><p></p><p>"On the way to receive that person is the best time to kill him."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said.</p><p></p><p>"But, the kill on Wen Long Mountain must be completed before he meets with the one he is to receive... Once Wen Long Mountain meets with that person, immediately retreat."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The reason?"</p><p></p><p>"The person Wen Long Mountain is going to receive... is the five-year-old son of the Pacification King Yili, coming to the Eight-Armed Infernal Lotus Furious Wrath Third Prince Mysterious Temple to participate in the Temple God Resonance."</p><p></p><p>"The son of the Pacification King?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the son of the Pacification King, I heard his Violet Spirit Qi broke through three hundred feet, ranking tenth on the Divine Capital Divine Children List."</p><p></p><p>"His talent is quite good." Li Che praised.</p><p></p><p>"No, his talent is too poor... he is the weakest among Yili's five children."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, he was sent to the Golden Light Prefecture, wanting to obtain the opportunity of this Four Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>South Lihuo said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the Pacification King has been laying the groundwork for a long time, paving the way for this little son of his... The inheritance of the Third Prince in this Golden Light Prefecture's Four Mysterious Temple is what he has prepared for his little son, he is determined to obtain it."</p><p></p><p>"Shu Huai</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The position of the Lord of the Golden Light Prefecture was largely related to the rites of the Demonic Goddess. </p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo's expression suddenly darkened, and he abruptly waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>The window suddenly opened, and a powerful suction force erupted, pulling the eavesdropping Li Qingshan inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's identity was exposed, but he didn't mind and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch... If you're going to kill someone, how can you leave out me, Li Qingshan?"</p><p></p><p>"Killing Wen Longshan... Good, that dog, when I was about to break through, he tried to shoot me. I, Li Qingshan, have always been one to repay grudges."</p><p></p><p>"This trip, I must be included."</p><p></p><p>"You can't leave me out of the fun!"</p><p></p><p>The ram's horn hammer in Li Qingshan's sleeve slid out and was gripped in his hand, with electric arcs crackling.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo was a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan broke through the Spiritual Appearance, he was not weak.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that when it comes to escaping... I hope you don't become a burden."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's old face suddenly flushed red!</p><p></p><p>His weakness was his agility, but there was no helping it.</p><p></p><p>Damn that old scoundrel Nan Liehuo, embarrassing me!</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo smiled and shook out two pieces of yellow paper with vermilion spirit patterns written on them from his sleeve, tossing them to Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Earth Escape Symbol], one piece can allow you to escape underground for forty miles."</p><p></p><p>"Use it to escape."</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Nan Liehuo also took a piece for Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not refuse and accepted it.</p><p></p><p>The moment he took the talisman, the Nirvana Point between his eyebrows slightly warmed, and the spiritual ability [Plucking the Stars] radiated intense heat.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, the techniques for drawing this talisman were perfectly mastered in Li Che's mind.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he discovered that if he wished, he could use the [Immortal in the Painting] Dao fruit, with his pure spiritual nature as the paper, to draw talismans.</p><p></p><p>"This is also possible?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but smile inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Given the opportunity, he could indeed research it further.</p><p></p><p>He thought of how Shangguan Qinghong had previously used spirit talismans to enhance the power of the military crossbows...</p><p></p><p>If the spirit talismans were researched well, perhaps they could significantly boost the Dao of Wood Carving, solving some problems and difficulties.</p><p></p><p>"Let's set out."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo glanced at Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>Then, his large sleeve fluttered, and a white fox mask was placed over his face, combined with his white hair, truly making him appear like an ethereal white fox in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo directly activated the earth escape talisman, transforming into a stream of ochre light that merged into the ground and fled far away from Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at Li Che, grinning, and covered his face with a cat mask, also activating an earth escape talisman.</p><p></p><p>These earth escape talismans were not cheap, and Nan Liehuo had invested heavily to kill Wen Longshan!</p><p></p><p>Watching the two disappear underground,</p><p></p><p>Li Che also tried the power of the earth escape talisman.</p><p></p><p>A dragging sensation came, and his entire body seemed to be enveloped by a circle of ochre spiritual power, rushing through the soil at high speed.</p><p></p><p>The speed was not slow, like driving a high-speed car.</p><p></p><p>For Li Che,</p><p></p><p>it could be roughly considered convenient.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On top of Golden Light Peak,</p><p></p><p>the three divine children from the Dao City were two boys and one girl, one of whom was the senior brother who had been following Nan Liehuo, the little chubby boy by the side of Daoist Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>The other two were also from the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect.</p><p></p><p>A boy and a girl, both seven years old.</p><p></p><p>The three divine children, with their auras breaking through hundreds of feet, this was the foundation of the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect! Hai Chaosheng stood among the true transmission spirit children of the Golden Light Branch.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been deprived of his true transmission status, Zhang Qingzheng still allowed him to participate in this exchange meeting.</p><p></p><p>It was a friendly exchange between the spirit children of the Dao City Orthodox Sect and the Branch Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng's eyes were grave. He had always been very confident, even somewhat arrogant, and had great faith in his own talent, until he met Li Nuanxi...</p><p></p><p>He was suppressed, and his confidence was shaken.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Orthodox Sect of Dao City had produced three divine children.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng felt unprecedented pressure, but he also desperately wanted to prove himself.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng was actually dissatisfied with Nuanxi. Even if they were divine children, so what? Just because they had good talent... could they do whatever they wanted? Why did they become the darling in everyone's heart?</p><p></p><p>Everyone was good to Nuanxi! Whether it was the Sect Master, Elder Zhu Hongdou, Elder Li Qingshan, or even the foul-mouthed Elder Zhang Qingzheng...</p><p></p><p>They all liked Nuanxi! Hai Chaosheng was not satisfied!</p><p></p><p>Today's exchange with the divine children and spirit children of the Qianyuan Orthodox Sect would be Hai Chaosheng's opportunity to prove himself.</p><p></p><p>When Zhang Qingzheng announced the start of the first match of the exchange,</p><p></p><p>from the Dao City side, the seven-year-old handsome divine child stepped forward with a mature demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"From the Dao City, Qianyuan Orthodox Sect, Zhong Liushou, the 37th on the Dao City Divine Children Ranking... here to exchange with the talents of the Branch Sect."</p><p></p><p>His faint voice came from the lips of the boy in brocade robes.</p><p></p><p>And Hai Chaosheng immediately stood up, his gaze burning, his fighting spirit surging.</p><p></p><p>"From the Golden Light Prefecture City, Golden Light Branch Sect, Hai Chaosheng!"</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct me!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng was also wearing a brocade robe, and the two young men had a sense of confrontation as their hair fluttered.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou looked at Hai Chaosheng indifferently: "A top-grade spirit child? Not even a divine child... Let the divine child from your Golden Light Branch Sect who has entered the Dao City Divine Children Ranking come out and fight."</p><p></p><p>"You are not worthy."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng's face immediately turned bright red!</p><p></p><p>Looked down upon! He, Hai Chaosheng... the precious talent cherished by the Hai family ancestors, had never suffered such treatment before! "If you want to see my Golden Light Branch Sect's divine child, you have to get through me first."</p><p></p><p>"If you can't even defeat me... you're not qualified?"</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng clenched his fist, and a humming long sword fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Brave." Zhong Liushou laughed.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes and looked at Hai Chaosheng, seeing the young man's high morale, and was actually amused.</p><p></p><p>He simply rolled up his sleeves, facing the sword-wielding Hai Chaosheng with bare fists.</p><p></p><p>In the distance,</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi, who had originally planned to rush out and fight, was held back by Gongyang Xiu and Gong Yuanliang.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Nuanxi was sitting on the back of the mechanical crane, and upon hearing Hai Chaosheng's words, she couldn't help but nod repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, if he can't even defeat Hai Chaosheng, they don't deserve to fight with Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gongyang Xiu exchanged a glance, and there was a solemn look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Hai Chaosheng is despicable!</p><p></p><p>Actually using such means to compete with them...</p><p></p><p>for favor!</p><p></p><p>How hateful! That scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang was even more agitated, stomping his feet. He shouldn't have held back Nuanxi, he should have rushed to the front line without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>With such a heroic statement, it should have been Gong Yuanliang to speak first!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gongyang Xiu scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>They were all so good at speaking, unlike him, who could only follow behind Nuanxi and simply and directly praise.</p><p></p><p>The emotions of the children on the field were always changing, making it difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>But without a doubt, the two facing off on the platform, the divine child and the talented spirit child of the Golden Light Prefecture, were the most eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>The talent of a divine child is higher than that of a spirit child, this is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>But can a spirit child of the same age defeat a divine child? This made many people curious.</p><p></p><p>Boom - the aura suddenly erupted, and Hai Chaosheng's fighting spirit was ignited, his whole body surging with blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>He had actually reached the level of three blood refinements! A year of cultivation, he had made the progress of two blood refinements! But most importantly, his spiritual nature had become extremely majestic! It had reached the level of cultivating one's nature like a river!</p><p></p><p>Hum -</p><p></p><p>The sword light flowed down, and in an instant, the sound of clashing swords appeared on the platform.</p><p></p><p>A supreme skill was being displayed by Hai Chaosheng, the true meaning swordsmanship of the Flowing Sword Peak, the Lüxuan Sword Classic!</p><p></p><p>The Lüxuan Sword Classic in its initial stage! This was Hai Chaosheng's foundation! He seemed to be born to wield the sword.</p><p></p><p>Hum - the sword's hum echoed on the platform, and the dazzling sword light seemed to have shattered all the snowflakes. Hai Chaosheng kept slashing forward with his sword, blocking Zhong Liushou's every avenue of escape! He wanted Zhong Liushou to take his sword head-on!</p><p></p><p>But Zhong Liushou narrowed his eyes, gave a faint smile, and suddenly stepped forward, with countless blood qi bursting forth from his arms, intertwining into two roaring blood-colored tigers! The complete supreme skill of a fist technique!</p><p></p><p>Complete?! Hai Chaosheng's eyes narrowed, but he did not give up, wrapping the sword light and forcibly withdrawing it.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou laughed out loud, his fists constantly pushing forward, shattering the dazzling sword light.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng felt that his sword could not penetrate within five meters of Zhong Liushou's surroundings.</p><p></p><p>His expression became ugly.</p><p></p><p>But he gritted his teeth and did not give up!</p><p></p><p>Clang - Zhong Liushou's spine suddenly trembled, as if a dragon was roaring, and in an instant, his speed increased, and he ruthlessly pressed down with a punch! Hai Chaosheng's expression changed, and he could only use his sword to defend and block.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's fist heavily struck the divine weapon sword in front of Hai Chaosheng's chest.</p><p></p><p>This nine-sun divine weapon was directly bent by the punch, colliding with Hai Chaosheng's chest...</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng only heard the sound of his breastbone breaking, the excruciating pain and the fist force surging into his body, making him only feel a musty taste in his mouth and nose...</p><p></p><p>He kept stumbling back.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to swing his sword, but...</p><p></p><p>He could no longer swing it.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's fists were flowing with blood-colored fierce tigers, constantly striking out, like two spotted fierce tigers, constantly pouncing on him!</p><p></p><p>One pounce after another, the second one followed immediately!</p><p></p><p>Chest, head, shoulders...</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng didn't even have a chance to swing his sword!</p><p></p><p>The gap in skills was too great!</p><p></p><p>Pu pu pu - Hai Chaosheng kept spitting out blood, being beaten back again and again, unable to catch his breath! Zhong Liushou became more and more excited, even unable to resist letting out a shrill scream.</p><p></p><p>Boom -</p><p></p><p>The fists overlapped and slammed down at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng's figure suddenly flew out horizontally.</p><p></p><p>Crashing heavily onto the ground, dragging a long bloody trail on the platform! Zhong Liushou's fists surged with tiger-headed blood mist, like burning scarlet flames, constantly flaring.</p><p></p><p>"A top-grade spirit child, is ultimately just a top-grade spirit child... nothing more."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Boring."</p><p></p><p>He raised his gaze, falling on the Nuanxi sitting on the mechanical crane's back, and slowly raised his fist.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>However, just as Zhong Liushou was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>His words suddenly stagnated.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the shaky, sword-leaning Hai Chaosheng who had stood up.</p><p></p><p>Blood was dripping from Hai Chaosheng's mouth and nose, his eyes almost unable to open.</p><p></p><p>His chest had one broken rib after another, but he had not admitted defeat, nor did he want to.</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng had always believed that he was a genius, and would be the pride of the Hai family...</p><p></p><p>How could he not even last as long as an incense stick against his opponent?</p><p></p><p>"I... I haven't lost yet..."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng opened his mouth, and the blood dripped down, panting heavily, his every breath like a bellows.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised his head, and there was still a burning fighting spirit in his swollen eyes.</p><p></p><p>While burning with fighting spirit, there were also large drops of tears rolling down from Hai Chaosheng's swollen eyes, dripping onto the ground, splashing out crystal clear!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes were only on Nuanxi...</p><p></p><p>He, Hai Chaosheng...</p><p></p><p>had once shone brightly too!</p><p></p><p>He was not satisfied! Even if he couldn't win, he couldn't lose so miserably!</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the mechanical crane, Nuanxi stared with wide eyes, biting her lip, not knowing what she was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou was surprised to see Hai Chaosheng, and suddenly sneered.</p><p></p><p>"A meaningless persistence, what are you crying for? If crying could be of use, what's the point of talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Crying to move yourself is utterly meaningless!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou roared.</p><p></p><p>Boom -</p><p></p><p>Stepping down, his fists rose, the tiger heads roaring! Ruthlessly rushing towards Hai Chaosheng! At this moment, Hai Chaosheng could barely stand, and still wanted to fight back? With what? Kneel down!</p><p></p><p>Hai Chaosheng wanted to raise his sword, stubborn and obstinate.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>He had no strength left.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining the grip on the sword had already exhausted his energy.</p><p></p><p>He could only stare fixedly,</p><p></p><p>waiting for Zhong Liushou's fist to knock him away.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! A muffled sound! A small figure suddenly appeared in front of Hai Chaosheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou's descending tiger-headed fists were actually grasped by that small figure!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's hair flew, her bright eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou looked down at the little one who was a head shorter than him, and it was just like that, relying solely on the strength of his flesh, that he had grasped and blocked his fists.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly! "You..."</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi let out a light shout, and the blood qi in her four-year-old body suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Liushou only felt a mighty force impact him, and his fists were swept away from the grip.</p><p></p><p>His whole body arched in the air and crashed heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi patted her hands, saying in a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"This Hai Chaosheng speaks so well."</p><p></p><p>"Nuanxi the Great Emperor will protect him in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi stepped forward, and the surging blood qi in her body let out a muffled roar!</p><p></p><p>Five consecutive waves of roaring sounds! Five blood refin</p>

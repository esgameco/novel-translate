        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feeling the fear and panic that was sweeping over him amidst the raging rainstorm, Zhang Xiangyang, wearing the mask of a child, couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... </p><p></p><p>He had killed Zhou Ruoguan! Of the three great divine hunters of Feilei City, the Ox Demon had already killed two! Now... only Zhang Xiangyang was left! Wouldn't it be perfect to just kill him and round it all up?!</p><p></p><p>What should he do? What should he do? Zhang Xiangyang's bare skin exposed to the pouring rain was covered in goosebumps, and the chill was rolling in from all directions.</p><p></p><p>He dared not stop his fleeing steps, dared not look back.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take the Ox Demon long to kill Zhou Ruoguan...</p><p></p><p>If he was really determined to catch up, he would most likely succeed and beat him to death! "The Profound Vein Warrior..."</p><p></p><p>"Exaggerated, truly exaggerated!" </p><p></p><p>The face under Zhang Xiangyang's mask was contorting. Just what kind of monster was this Ox Demon? Back then, when the Ox Demon killed Lei Chunlan, he had used the divine secret art of "Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light" to retrace the scene and see the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Ox Demon had just barely reached the level of blood refinement, hadn't he?</p><p></p><p>How long has it been since then?</p><p></p><p>Two years?</p><p></p><p>In just two years, he had advanced from barely reaching blood refinement to achieving the Profound Vein?!</p><p></p><p>It's known that among all the warriors in Feilei City, most of them are stuck at the Qi Vein realm, and have almost no hope of stepping into the Profound Vein.</p><p></p><p>Even the three young lords of Feilei City don't have a single one who can achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Yet in just two short years, the Ox Demon had actually attained the realm of the Profound Vein Warrior!</p><p></p><p>"A monster..."</p><p></p><p>Without daring to look back, Zhang Xiangyang fled towards the Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Only the Marquis' Mansion, where a divine foundation cultivator was stationed, could give Zhang Xiangyang a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the Qiankun Jade on Zhou Ruoguan's headless corpse and stored it in his Qiankun Space. </p><p></p><p>Casually absorbing the "Chaotic Joy Bewitching Spirit" divine nature from Zhou Ruoguan, he condensed it into several divine nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>The color of the chess pieces was black.</p><p></p><p>Except for the white chess pieces he had condensed from his own "Unsullied Heart", the rest, whether it was "Wrathful Weeping Subduing Ghost", "Furious Amitabha", or the current "Chaotic Joy Bewitching Spirit", as well as the "Heart Startled Stern" he had previously condensed after killing Yang Kaihe, were all black chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Even the divine natures of the temple gods were condensed into black chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Che slightly puzzled. Could it be that only the divine nature of the Unsullied Heart could condense white chess pieces? Unable to find the answer for now, Li Che didn't think about it further.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of the tempering from absorbing the divine natures of the temple gods, that Li Che's speed in absorbing the divine natures of these "Cultivating Temperament like a River" divine nature cultivators had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>It was almost like taking a breath to condense a chess piece, and for someone like Zhou Ruoguan, it only took about ten breaths to completely drain his divine nature.</p><p></p><p>The divine nature he had previously absorbed from Yang Kaihe during the corpse examination had also been drained by him.</p><p></p><p>These divine natures... could only be used to speed up his cultivation of the divine nature law when he was cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head to look at Xixia sitting on his shoulder, the Ox Demon asked in a deep voice, "Little girl, are you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not cover Xixia's eyes, allowing her to directly witness this bloody scene.</p><p></p><p>In this cruel world, Li Che was very clear that letting Xixia get exposed to bloodshed and cruelty early on would prevent her from being too naive and easily deceived.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Huangmao or someone with ulterior motives...</p><p></p><p>At least Xixia would understand the cruelty of the world and develop a sense of vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Pampering a daughter is all well and good... but pampering can't prevent a daughter from being tricked by Huangmao with just a few rotten fruits.</p><p></p><p>Seeing blood can give a daughter a few more traces of heroic spirit and malice, so that she won't be bullied and afraid to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Clutching the oiled paper umbrella, Xixia was not afraid of the Ox Demon's killing.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Sumu had taught her in the Divine Cultivation Institute that bad people should all be killed!</p><p></p><p>If you don't kill them, they will kill you! So Xixia was not afraid! "Ox Ox, Xixia is not afraid!" Xixia kept shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were shining brightly, the rainwater washing the umbrella and creating a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox is so powerful, Ox Ox, can Xixia become your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia wants to become powerful, to protect Daddy and Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>The ox-masked Li Che was momentarily stunned, then burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Become a disciple? I'm your own father!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Feeling his daughter's filial piety, Li Che still smiled and answered.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Yay! Aunt Sumu said Xixia's daddy has too good a temper, he's honest, refined, and gentle, and this kind of temperament is too easy to get beaten to death by others, Xixia doesn't want Daddy to get beaten to death, so... Xixia wants to become powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xixia's eyes became even brighter, sitting on Li Che's shoulder and happily wiggling her plump little belly.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox teacher, can I play with fireworks?"</p><p></p><p>Xixia blinked her innocent eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was dumbfounded again, this girl really... what filial piety, she was just trying to sneak in a way to play with explosives.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox teacher, why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the silent Ox Demon, Xixia became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"If I learn to set off fireworks, I can protect Daddy, otherwise Daddy will get beaten to death!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia was really anxious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>This girl is really filial to the point of being ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Father.</p><p></p><p>"You can't carry it."</p><p></p><p>"Xixie is very strong, Niuiu Shifu!" Xixie clenched her little fists.</p><p></p><p>This, Li Che did not doubt. As an extraordinary spiritual child, Xixie's strength was innately great, and Li Qingshan directly said that this girl was a good seedling for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Since his daughter wanted to play with fireworks, Li Che naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>He directly handed the "Namo Gatling Woodpecker" to Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Xixie actually picked up this huge thing that was even bigger than her own figure, although it was very strenuous, and her little face was flushed red.</p><p></p><p>But with the Namo Gatling Woodpecker in her hands, the little girl's mouth kept stretching wider and wider, unable to hold back her joyful "haha" laughter, as if she had gone crazy.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Daddy won't be beaten to death anymore, I will use fireworks to protect Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>"Niuiu Shifu, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's set off the fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feilei City once had four great families, namely the Si family, the Xu family, the An family, and the Yang family.</p><p></p><p>The Si family had fallen into desolation and decay, reduced to a wisp of the past.</p><p></p><p>During the period when the Si family fell, the Yang family was enjoying a prosperous time, their mouths dripping with oil.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Si family's industries had fallen under the Yang family's banner.</p><p></p><p>Yang family mansion.</p><p>The study of the family head.</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihai, the family head of the Yang family, sat upright in the chair, writing something. His burly figure was almost like a small mountain, holding the wolf-hair brush, like Zhang Fei embroidering flowers.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts cultivated by the Yang family was a method of constantly enhancing physical strength and intensity, so the Yang family members were all as sturdy as small mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Have all the ordinary people in the clan been arranged to leave the city?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihai put down the brush and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"They have all left Feilei City, and those remaining in the city are all warrior cultivators above the level of opening meridians..."</p><p></p><p>"After the city lord's 'Thousand Buddha Feast' is held, we Yang family will enjoy this last wave, and then the entire clan will withdraw from Feilei City, this century-old foundation... should be abandoned..."</p><p></p><p>"If the old patriarch can take this opportunity to break through the divine foundation realm and step into the middle realm... our Yang family can easily establish a century-old foundation in other cities, and even rise to a higher level!"</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Feast, a ritual to worship the temple gods, once the temple gods are awakened by the devout worship, they will bestow blessings, release their divine nature, and this is a great opportunity. We who remain in the city can absorb the divine nature of the temple gods, and all of us can gain no small improvement..."</p><p></p><p>"Especially Kaihe, he may even have the chance to forge a divine foundation. Our Yang family's penetrating martial arts have more heritage than the other families... making it easier to forge a divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihai stretched and his bones and muscles creaked, his blood and qi surging, causing a violent wind to sweep through the study.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, how's it going on Kaihe's side? Have they captured the spiritual child from the Xu family and brought him to the city lord's mansion?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't have any problems... the Xu family has acquiesced to this matter."</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihai sneered.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment of laughter, he no longer smiled, after all...</p><p></p><p>His Yang family had also done the same thing.</p><p></p><p>Selling spiritual children in exchange for benefits... </p><p></p><p>It's just fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps.</p><p></p><p>Below, one of the Yang family's elites suddenly laughed, "With the young master's hand, how could there be any problems? The young master's cultivation is at the peak of tranquility, combined with his martial dao cultivation, dragon sinews and tiger bones, unless a divine foundation cultivator intervenes... The Xu family's Shenxiu Academy only has that old lady Xu Mu left, this matter is very stable."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, there was a low laughter echoing in the room.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it's a ten out of ten stable matter.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The laughter of several people abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>They all sensed something and turned their heads to look outside.</p><p></p><p>Their pupils shrank drastically.</p><p></p><p>But in the pouring rain,</p><p></p><p>A huge head smashed through the rain droplets the size of beans, spraying a continuous mist of water, arcing across the trajectory and crashing into the center of the Yang family's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The head rolled a few times, revealing a ferocious and terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>It was their Yang family's eldest son.</p><p></p><p>The future divine foundation seedling...</p><p></p><p>Yang Kaihe! "No—!"</p><p></p><p>"My son!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the study, Yang Kaihai's eyes were about to pop out, letting out a piercing scream, his surging blood and qi exploding, his divine nature surging! He burst out of the study and rushed into the rain.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Before he could approach Yang Kaihe's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! A violent explosion, flames shooting into the sky! </p><p></p><p>The Yang family's main gate was blasted open, with countless shards flying everywhere!</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of gunpowder permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Heavy footsteps, like the thousand-year bell of an ancient Buddhist temple...</p><p></p><p>Echoing in the Yang family's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A big and a small, two figures.</p><p></p><p>"Niuiu Shifu... how to set off the fireworks?"</p><p></p><p>A sweet, childish voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then, a muffled, gentle voice responded...</p><p></p><p>"Blow them all up without leaving a single one."</p><p></p><p>Seeking to be read, seeking monthly votes, seeking recommendation votes to support!

        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, if some secret techniques were used, it would be possible to devour the divinity in the corpse and make it one's own.</p><p></p><p>Although there might be cases where the divinity was not compatible.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was not compatible, it could still be refined and extracted to remove the incompatible divine will.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique originally spread from a high-level mysterious temple, and later became the main teaching of a major evil cult in the jianghu, creating one massacre after another.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's eyes flickered, and his heart was slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained this kind of technique from the cult...</p><p></p><p>But now when he tried to use it, he could not feel any divinity from Yang Jing's body, which was very unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"This Niu Mo..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang narrowed his eyes, as if he had suddenly understood something.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this Niu Mo's strength grows so rapidly every time he appears, not only is his martial talent extraordinary, but his divine power also increases quickly..."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he is like me."</p><p></p><p>"But who taught the Niu Mo this technique? Why did the Niu Mo appear in Feilei City? Is it to target me? Or... to pluck the fruit of my 'Thousand Buddha Feast'?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang felt a vague dark shadow in the darkness, watching him like the most venomous snake in the world.</p><p></p><p>He finally sneered.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, this Niu Mo... is not my match."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he is from the same cult, I am the senior, and he is the junior... just drink some soup."</p><p></p><p>"If he wants to pluck the fruit... he must leave his life behind!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's eyes became cold and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he glanced at Cao Qingyuan, who was covered in rotten flesh and broken bones, with disgust in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up this disgusting thing."</p><p></p><p>"Then... go to other cities, bring back a few spirit children to fill the two vacancies."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Feast... must be accelerated."</p><p></p><p>After the words, Cao Guang stepped away and disappeared around the corner of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan respectfully carried out the order, not daring to object.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, the eyes in Cao Qingyuan's lowered head were also burning hot.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Buddha Feast...</p><p></p><p>The blessing of the temple gods.</p><p></p><p>He had been looking forward to it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>A Serpent Blood Warrior Pill fell into his abdomen, making a muffled sound like a stone falling into a large lake.</p><p></p><p>This was a pill that could only be taken by those at the Penetrating Meridian Realm.</p><p></p><p>The blood and qi broke through into the meridian, forming a small heavenly circuit inside the body, running through the tendons, bones, and muscles, covering the five zang organs and six fu organs.</p><p></p><p>Each circulation was a fusion of internal strength and blood qi, forming a powerful internal qi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel the Serpent Blood Warrior Pill rolling in his abdomen, and as the gastric juice eroded it, the medicinal properties gradually burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The outer layer of the pill instantly ruptured, like a python raging in the stomach!</p><p></p><p>The blood and qi seemed to be ignited instantly, and his body was like a furnace baking! The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit hummed and trembled, as if there were dragon roars and elephant shrieks, and the Serpent Blood Warrior Pill was instantly crushed! The overwhelming medicinal power surged like a gale, driving the blood and qi, rushing and roaring through the meridians, like raging waves washing through the five zang organs and six fu organs! Li Che's whole body even emitted a sound of metal grinding, and his skin turned scarlet red.</p><p></p><p>"So domineering!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened, as if flames were burning, and ordinary people refining the Serpent Blood Warrior Pill would have to do it slowly.</p><p></p><p>The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit directly crushed the pill and forcefully activated its medicinal power...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's flesh "boomed" and swelled up, the dragon-like big tendons on his back trembling, his whole body having a unique rhythm, driving the blood and qi, fusing the internal strength.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Yang Small Heavenly Circuit Qi Meridian Technique was almost squeezed and stimulated to the extreme by his physique.</p><p></p><p>The internal qi kept generating, filling his four limbs and entire body!</p><p></p><p>The Penetrating Meridian Realm in the inner cultivation was different from the previous grinding, opening tendons, and tempering bones, etc. It could be called a process of refining the tendons, bones, five zang organs and six fu organs from the inside. But while refining internally, one also needs to accumulate internal qi, and the growth of internal qi is the fundamental for the cultivation of the meridian realm.</p><p></p><p>A Serpent Blood Warrior Pill was almost completely consumed and absorbed by Li Che in just half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's whole body was steaming with heat, hissing, and the internal qi circulating in the Small Heavenly Circuit had grown from a small snake to a mighty dragon.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, sweeping his gaze.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (LV3, 5%)]</p><p></p><p>A single pill directly increased the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra by 5%, which was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che could also understand that this was his first time taking the pill, so the effect was better. In the future, the rate of improvement would not be so fast.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take a few more..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was dripping with hot sweat, sensing the condition of his physique and finding no abnormalities, so he took out another pill and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were the warrior pills he had found in the Yang family's treasure vault, so he didn't mind consuming them, the only downside being the limited quantity, and he would have to find another way to obtain warrior pills after they were used up.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the medicinal power of the pill dissolving in his abdomen again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze became slightly deeper.</p><p></p><p>"With the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit's ability to squeeze out the medicinal properties of pills, my meridian realm should be able to break through to the Profound Realm soon, but... Elder Qingshan said the Primal Yang Profound Realm Technique can only be obtained after entering the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But it seems that time is approaching..."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qingshan's identity has now been exposed, which should be a sign that he is about to return to the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I'll just hold back a bit more."</p><p></p><p>"I have the Yang family's Forging Divine Foundation Technique, and Elder Qingshan said that a high-level Divine Foundation Technique can cover low-level Divine Foundation Techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"So I can hold back on the martial dao..."</p><p></p><p>"But can I try... forging a Divine Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The first light of dawn, the winter rain had just stopped.</p><p></p><p>The chill of the morning became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The distant mountains were shrouded in a thin mist like a ribbon, looking like the ink wash in a landscape painting from afar.</p><p></p><p>At the Xu family's Divine Cultivation Institute.</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo had regained her tranquility, without the noisy clamor of the children, making the place seem rather desolate and cold.</p><p></p><p>She held a python-headed wooden cane in one hand and scissors in the other, trimming the leaves of the flowers in the courtyard that were still wet with winter rain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A figure in a blue robe appeared and floated down into the courtyard, standing across from Shu Popo and looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo paused for a moment, then ignored the newcomer, and the scissors in her hand cut the branches and leaves even more forcefully, making them fall rustling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Still in a bad mood..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Shu Popo and couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively reached out to ruffle the girl's head.</p><p></p><p>However, the sharp scissors suddenly clanged open, blocking the path of Li Qingshan's palm.</p><p></p><p>"I'm no longer the little girl I used to be, don't touch me, or I'll cut it off!" Shu Popo glared and raised the scissors, threatening him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm now strong and tough, you can try cutting it if you dare?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's lips curled up in a big laugh.</p><p></p><p>This girl, still with the familiar stubborn temper, even after so many years, she had not changed at all.</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo snorted, putting down the scissors, knowing that Li Qingshan, a renowned figure in the Divine Foundation Realm, had a tough physique.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to ruin a pair of scissors for nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The great expert of the Primal Yang Divine Sect, what business do you have with this old woman? Your disciple... Master Li took him away, you should go find Master Li."  Shu Popo pursed her lips and glared at him with a sarcastic tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's palm finally landed on Shu Popo's head, gently rubbing it: "That big-headed boy is not my grandson, he is my disciple."</p><p></p><p>"When I left him with you back then, besides teasing you, it was also to find an excuse to protect Xixia. Xixia has good divine talent, I will take her to the prefecture city, with her talent, she should be able to easily pass the sect entry examination."</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo's eyes lit up at the words, but soon dimmed again, her expression becoming cold.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, old woman, I know. You can leave now."</p><p></p><p>She then leaned on the cane and walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at the old woman's retreating figure and sighed: "Shu Shu, come with me, although I'm in the Divine Observation, I've specially arranged this opportunity to come down the mountain to see you..."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll see who dares to stop me... I'll crush them."</p><p></p><p>Shu Popo paused in her steps.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, I'm already old..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm getting old," Li Qingshan said softly as he approached Mu Popo.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the past, the mountains were green and the waters were clear.</p><p></p><p>He gently stroked the young girl's head. Li Qingshan could crush countless people's heads, but only in front of a young girl would he show such tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, Li Qingshan spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, we still have the evening glow to watch together."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The emissary sent by the Heavenly Sovereign Daoist Sect to select spiritual children had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The city lord Cao Guang personally welcomed them, and according to custom, a banquet would be held in the Golden Pavilion three days later, where the major aristocratic families would be summoned to send the children from the Shenxiu Academy to be tested for their spiritual aptitude.</p><p></p><p>The aristocratic families within the inner city of Feiluo City would all attend, even the reclusive Shengi Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>This was a major event in the city that occurred once every few years.</p><p></p><p>It was a formality that both the Heavenly Sovereign and the court had to go through.</p><p></p><p>"The An family is leaving the city en masse? Going to the Golden City?"</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Che was guiding Xixie in her martial arts training when he heard the news that Old Chen had gathered from his wanderings, and he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The An family...</p><p></p><p>Were they so decisive?</p><p></p><p>Just yesterday, the old master of the Yang family had been killed, and today they had immediately fled the city, taking their entire family with them.</p><p></p><p>The cunning of the An family's old patriarch was truly renowned, and he had even managed to take the whole clan with him in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was also muttering in amazement.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Li Che's eyes, a trace of regret and sorrow flashed.</p><p></p><p>His "Sorrow Spiritual Nature" had run away.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he wanted to get his hands on the cultivation method for the "Sorrow Spiritual Nature", he would have to find another way, as the cultivation methods were precious and not easily obtained, not even in the black market.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the martial arts training with his wife Zhang Ya, Li Che went to his independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the wooden chair in the workshop, Li Che gripped the bright carving knife and began sculpting spiritual nature wooden figurines.</p><p></p><p>The falling wood chips, accompanied by the winter breeze, swirled up.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, a lifelike wooden sculpture was formed.</p><p></p><p>Capturing the spiritual nature between heaven and earth, and infusing it into the wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a prompt flashed.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 29%)]</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Immortal Craftsman was rather slow.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to create more new mechanisms. There are still some mechanisms in the 'Tang Family Mechanism Records' that I can make, and I can also try my 'Namo Immortal Craftsman Barrett', as the penetrating power of the Bodhi Tears is quite suitable."</p><p></p><p>"And I need to improve the power of the Wood Raven..."</p><p></p><p>"Handicrafts indeed become more difficult to improve as they progress."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fingers danced, and the carving knife flew across the wood, as he began to make a slightly smaller 'Namo Immortal Craftsman Gatling' for Xixie. This girl... had been nagging him about it lately.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would send it to her in the form of the Ox Demon, and also give her a Qiankun Jade to store the Gatling.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a self-defense measure for Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a bit busy, with cultivating the Dao, making immortal crafts, and refining spiritual natures...</p><p></p><p>Standing up, his whole body cracked and popped.</p><p></p><p>His powerful vital energy surged.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tore out the cute ox-faced mask with his bare hands and put it on his face.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the light flashed.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Chess Sage (Lv1, 89%)]</p><p></p><p>The advancement speed of the Chess Sage Dao Fruit... was a bit beyond Li Che's expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, it was also within his anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After all, it had condensed the spiritual nature of the old patriarch of the Yang family, a Shengi, into a chess piece, so its maturity had directly soared.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, the Flashing Thunder Chess Piece he had left in the "Shrine of the Furious Venerable True Lord" outside the city was instantly grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Reopening his eyes, he had already appeared in the flickering candle-lit, mysterious shrine.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhao Xuanhai's [Furious Amitabha] spiritual nature had already been exhausted, so Li Che used the furious spiritual nature of the shrine deity to replace it, and the effect was surprisingly good, with almost no rejection.</p><p></p><p>Now, the [Furious Amitabha] spiritual nature had reached the peak of cultivation like a river.</p><p></p><p>The forging of the Shengi was not far away.</p><p></p><p>"However, I have not yet mastered the Shengi method of [Furious Amitabha]."</p><p></p><p>"This technique... should be in the City Lord's Mansion."</p><p></p><p>After finishing the absorption of the spiritual nature, Li Che jumped down from the altar.</p><p></p><p>He glanced around at the increasingly numerous spiritual children wooden figurines of various kinds.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The City Lord... or rather, the Enlightenment Sect Master's Thousand Buddha Sculpture Banquet?"</p><p></p><p>"The purpose of the Thousand Buddha Sculpture Banquet should be to make offerings and, through the ritual, awaken the shrine deity? But how exactly is it operated?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che scanned the area and felt that the countless spiritual children wooden figurines seemed to be emanating various emotions, making his heart uneasy and angry.</p><p></p><p>The pure white spiritual nature from the [Unsullied Heart] Dao Fruit surged, calming his mind.</p><p></p><p>Resisting the urge to destroy these spiritual children wooden figurines, as Li Qingshan had said that these wooden figurines were offerings to the shrine deity, and they had formed a special connection with the deity.</p><p></p><p>If he were to destroy even one of the spiritual children wooden figurines, the shrine deity would sense it and awaken.</p><p></p><p>Towards the unknown shrine deity, Li Che was somewhat wary and had no desire to confront it directly.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to quietly absorb the shrine deity's spiritual nature, and had no intention of fighting the deity.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a breath, Li Che looked at the Three-Eyed Furious Venerable True Lord spiritual child wooden figurine on the altar.</p><p></p><p>Smiling, Li Che, wearing the ox demon mask, steadily stepped onto the altar.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the patina-covered head of the shrine deity wooden figurine, Li Che extended his hand.</p><p></p><p>His palm covered the wooden figurine's head.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his hand turned jade-colored, as if a thin layer of jade mist was swirling around his arm.</p><p></p><p>Like a jade-carved sculpture, exquisite and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Powerful absorbing power erupted from the Thousand Slivers, beginning to absorb the spiritual nature contained in the shrine deity wooden figurine.</p><p></p><p>One by one, black spiritual nature chess pieces floated and appeared around Li Che, emanating a dark aura.</p><p></p><p>The shrine deity wooden figurine sitting on the altar seemed to have an even more intense expression of fury on its face, almost as if the child whose treasures had been stolen.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it still fell short.</p><p></p><p>Li Che focused, and with the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] Dao Fruit reaching Lv3, the absorbing power of the Thousand Slivers seemed to have also grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>The speed of absorbing spiritual nature was getting faster and faster!</p><p></p><p>Originally, it took two hours to absorb half a piece of the shrine deity's spiritual nature chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Now... in half an hour, he had condensed one.</p><p></p><p>One after another, the chess pieces with dispersing black aura floated around him, one every two hours, and four chess pieces had floated around him in total.</p><p></p><p>Adding the chess pieces he had previously condensed, there were now nine pieces of the shrine deity's spiritual nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps feeling a bit unsatisfied, just as Li Che was about to absorb the ninth piece of the shrine deity's chess piece, the powerful absorbing power of the Thousand Slivers erupted...</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>To Li Che's narrowed eyes, the shocking thing was that no spiritual nature was absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The shrine deity, it seemed... had been drained by him! No, could it really be drained like this?</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che soon felt an extremely scorching hot sensation from the shrine deity wooden figurine.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the third vertical eye on the head of the shrine deity wooden figurine he had covered with his hand...</p><p></p><p>Its eyeball was rolling around.</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>One of the hands of the Three-Eyed Furious Venerable True Lord spiritual child shrine deity wooden figurine abruptly sprang up and firmly grasped the hand covered with Li Che's patina-coated head.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>Outside the mysterious shrine, it seemed as if the winter thunder was rolling, and the lightning snakes were crawling.</p><p></p><p>Inside the shrine, all the candle flames flickered, casting the shadows of the spiritual children wooden figurines in a distorted, ghostly dance.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became chillingly silent.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of complete silence in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It seemed one could only hear the thunderous pounding of the heart in the chest.</p><p></p><p>But none of this mattered... What mattered was that Li Che felt a scorching hot flow rushing from the shrine deity wooden figurine into the Thousand Slivers.</p><p></p><p>The jade color of the Thousand Slivers flowed.</p><p></p><p>Information was transmitted through the Thousand Slivers to Li Che's mind, slowly unfolding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Shengi Method (Supreme Eighth Extreme): Three-Eyed Furious Venerable True Lord Shengi]</p><p></p><p>This is the first update today.

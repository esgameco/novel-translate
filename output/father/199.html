        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xixi tilted her head, and her movement to perk up her ears froze.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't believe her ears.</p><p></p><p>She opened her wide, bright eyes and turned to look at her father and mother.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, </p><p></p><p>Xixi felt the sky was collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Her father and mother... they don't want Xixi anymore?</p><p></p><p>Xixi is no longer the only treasure of her parents?</p><p></p><p>Xixi was a bit dazed, feeling dizzy, and tears gushed out of her eyes, so sad that she could hardly breathe.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Li Che were a bit caught off guard, not expecting Xixi to start crying without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally understood that even a four-year-old child has their own thoughts and perceptions, so he had to discuss it with Zhang Ya in advance.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Che would not easily ignore Xixi's feelings.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was a bit flustered, even a little panicked, not expecting Xixi's reaction to be so strong.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she realized that her husband was right, children also have their own thoughts, and their feelings cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya quickly hugged Xixi to comfort her.</p><p></p><p>Xixi tilted her head, tears dripping down her cheeks and shattering on the bed.</p><p></p><p>After her parents have a younger brother or sister, they will definitely not want Xixi anymore. Xixi will have to go to Jinguang Peak Mountain every day to cultivate with Grandpa Elder, she will have to go outside to buy braised pork knuckle to eat, and Xixi may even have to pick up trash to earn money to support the family...</p><p></p><p>Xixi thought about it and felt extremely aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya comforted her for a while, but Xixi didn't seem to be getting any better. The little girl didn't cry or fuss, she just sadly shed silent tears.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya felt like her heart was violently pounded by a heavy hammer.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... please think of a way..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya looked pleadingly at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>He took Xixi from Zhang Ya's arms.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing Xixi's head, he said with a smile, "Okay, don't cry. Our Xixi is already a big girl, don't cry."</p><p></p><p>However, the effect was not very great, Xixi was still very sad, her nose was red, her big eyes hung with tears, and the area around her eyes was also red, very prominent against her fair skin.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then said, "If you don't cry, Daddy will take you to see the braised pork knuckle and the big dog."</p><p></p><p>At this, Xixi's brain seemed to finally connect, and she suddenly sniffed and turned to look at Li Che, her eyes shimmering with tears, her mouth drooling.</p><p></p><p>"Is Daddy telling the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pinched Xixi's cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"When has Daddy ever lied to Xixi?"</p><p></p><p>Xixi then held back her tears and smiled happily, clamoring to hook pinkies with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya let out a sigh of relief beside them.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare to mention the birth of a new baby again.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhang Ya also knew that it didn't matter now, when her strength improved, she would talk about it again, wait until she could bear her husband's physical essence.</p><p></p><p>Or wait until Xixi grew up a little more.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Zhang Ya, who was pouting her lips and feeling a bit guilty, with some amusement.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his wife's head, then hugged Xixi and directly teleported with a Flying Thunder Chess Piece to the alleys of Luohua Lane.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was suddenly disoriented and saw the small restaurant under the dim lights.</p><p></p><p>"We'll eat a serving of braised pork knuckle and then go back to sleep," Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Xixi obediently nodded her head.</p><p></p><p>Her little stomach had already started to grumble.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the restaurant entrance, the big black dog was lying on the ground, breathing rhythmically as it napped. It seemed to sense Li Che's footsteps, but without even opening its eyes, it just snorted out a puff of hot air and continued sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy! The dog! Wow, it's a dog!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi's excited and shrill voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog suddenly jolted, its eyes wide open, and it abruptly sprang up from the ground, its front paws slamming on the ground, ready to take action.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was speechless, why was this big black dog reacting so strongly? His daughter was not some demon or monster! Li Che put Xixi down, and she immediately ran up to the big black dog, coming to a sudden stop in front of it, looking up at it with her chubby cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog relaxed its entire body, oh, it's not her.</p><p></p><p>A flash of sadness passed through the dog's eyes, followed by a rare gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>It brought its big head close to Xixi and licked her.</p><p></p><p>Xixi "giggled giggled giggled", her previous unhappiness and troubles had long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog stood up, and it was really quite large, Li Che had never seen the standing form of the big black dog before, it was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>He curiously looked at it a few more times.</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling—</p><p></p><p>The curtain was lifted, and a young man in white robes slowly walked out, his gaze falling on Xixi, a few strands of gentleness appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What would you like to eat?"</p><p></p><p>"This little girl was throwing a tantrum in the middle of the night, bring us a serving of braised pork knuckle to satisfy her craving."</p><p></p><p>The boss nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He then turned and went back into the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xixi was sitting in a chair, eating heartily, and the big black dog was lying lazily and contentedly by the table.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in a chair, sipping tea with the young boss.</p><p></p><p>The boss's tea had a really different taste, sweet and mellow on the tongue, and then changing in the throat, with a myriad of flavors.</p><p></p><p>"Good tea!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The boss nodded: "What's good about it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused, he didn't know what was good about it, he just knew the taste was very good, different from any tea he had drunk before.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was eating happily, and the two of them just watched Xixi eat.</p><p></p><p>Xixi even gave a piece of braised pork knuckle to the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>"Dog, let's eat together!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the braised pork knuckle, Li Che patiently wiped the oily residue off Xixi's palms and carefully cleaned her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xixi then ran off to play with the big black dog again.</p><p></p><p>The night was deep and quiet, the fine rain hazy.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant was filled with warm steam, Xixi was riding on the big black dog's neck, and the big black dog was very doting.</p><p></p><p>The scene seemed to have a touch of frozen beauty.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't let Xixi play for too long, and he picked up Xixi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was about to take out a gold leaf, but the boss waved his hand: "This meal is on me, for Xixi."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che did not argue.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, boss, goodbye, dog, Xixi will come again another day!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi waved goodbye happily.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on the boss's stern face as he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog let out a grunt and swished its tail.</p><p></p><p>The man and the dog watched as Xixi and her father disappeared into the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>The boss looked at Xixi's disappearance, and from the incense bag at his waist, he took out some tobacco, rolled a thin cigarette with the prepared white paper, tapped the rolled cigarette a few times, then ignited the tip with his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>Exhale—</p><p></p><p>Inhale—</p><p></p><p>The smoke billowed from his lips.</p><p></p><p>The fine rain was intoxicatingly hazy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che carried Xixi, walking through the small alleys.</p><p></p><p>The rain fell, and Li Che's surging blood and qi dispersed the rain.</p><p></p><p>He even illuminated the pitch-black alley.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, Xixi has figured it out. When the younger brother or sister is born, Xixi will protect them well, Xixi has grown up!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi clenched her small fist, speaking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Xixi for a moment, then tapped her little nose.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't continue the conversation on this topic.</p><p></p><p>They returned to the small courtyard on the half-mountain of Zhenglie Peak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xixi came back, she snuggled into Zhang Ya's arms, and Zhang Ya's expression was gentle as she hugged Xixi and went to sleep.</p><p></p><p>In the deep of the night, Li Che transformed into the Ox Demon, helping Xixi stimulate the divine weapon, fusing the weapon and refining the body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was responsible for providing the big stick, while Xixi was responsible for providing the sweet dates to comfort. Surprisingly, the fusion of the divine weapon was a bit faster than expected.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>At dawn, it was a rare sunny day, no longer raining.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sent Xixi to Jinguang Peak, and Shuang Guanyin was already waiting there early, as there had been an assassination incident before, so Shuang Guanyin was now even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After taking Xixi's hand, Shuang Guanyin smiled warmly at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, will you take Xixi to see the dog again tonight?" Xixi blinked her lively eyes, asking expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che ruffled her hair: "That will depend on your performance."</p><p></p><p>"If you cultivate well, Daddy will take you."</p><p></p><p>"Yay! Xixi will definitely cultivate diligently!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi clenched her fist, full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, bid farewell to Xixi, and left Jinguang Peak.</p><p></p><p>Shuang Guanyin took Xixi to the Jingang Peak Plaza, and on this rare sunny day, a group of children had gathered there.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuofire, Wang Kuyu, and Jiao Shaoquan were standing on the white jade steps in front of the temple, chatting with each other.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuofire's gaze, full of kindness, withdrew from Xixi: "Elder Jiao... the Sect Master, this time he is accepting disciples... does Xixi have a chance?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquan knew Nan Lihuofire's thoughts: "This will be the Sect Master's last disciple. As the top-level deity of the Southern Dao, the matter of him accepting disciples is naturally not a small one..."</p><p></p><p>"All the major families under the jurisdiction of the Jingang Prefecture, as well as the Dragon Abyss Dao, the Jiangnan Dao and other nearby Dao cities, have all sharpened their minds, wanting to get this position. Even within the inner sect of the Sect, apart from those few inner elders who were personally taught by the Sect Master, many inner sect disciples are also eagerly anticipating it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, once one becomes the Sect Master's last personal disciple, the meaning is completely different."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master, as the Sect Master of the Sect, is at the peak of the divine fetus realm, a top-tier powerhouse in the entire great landscape..."</p><p></p><p>"He naturally won't just quietly accept Xixi as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuofire became a bit anxious: "Xixi's talent is really good, and this time the temple deity resonance has shocked everyone, gaining seven-tenths of the temple deity's divine nature!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuofire knew that once he assassinated Su Huaili, it would be difficult for him to stay in Jingang Prefecture any longer.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to get the best conditions for Xixi in the limited time he had.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoquan understood what he was thinking, shaking his head: "Don't worry, when the Sect Master accepts disciples, he not only looks at talent, but also at temperament, personality and so on, he will make a fair comprehensive evaluation..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nan Lihuofire was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He thought that with Xixi's current talent, she might not even need to go through the test and could be directly accepted as the Sect Master's disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Xixi's talent is indeed not bad... but those children who want to become the Sect Master's last personal disciple, how can their talents be inferior?"</p><p></p><p>"Most of them have probably resonated with the temple deities in various mysterious temples, gathering at least six-tenths of the temple deity's divine nature."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the temple deity resonance does not prove anything, it cannot become the key factor in determining whether one can become the Sect Master's disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Like Ji Haiwei and Tie Shancai, their temple deity resonance may be low, but their bloodline is not ordinary, their martial dao and divine nature talents are extremely high. Some thousand-year-old families, in order to get this position of the Sect Master's personal disciple, are probably going to send out the divine talents they have cultivated with great effort."</p><p></p><p>"Ji Haiwei's talent is actually not that good, in my opinion, not as good as his few brothers. I think it's mainly because the Dragon God bloodline has polluted the Pacifying King's Martial Saint bloodline..."</p><p></p><p>"The union of human and dragon, born across species, is not a mediocre talent, but a freak..."</p><p></p><p>"Ji Haiwei, can't be called a freak."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuofire's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Ji Mouli's four sons were the real monsters, Ji Haiwei... was more like a compromised product.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Jiao Shaoquan's withered wooden-like face: "However, I promised you that when I return to the Sect, I will introduce Xixi to the Sect Master's wife..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nan Lihuofire's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>Jiang is indeed still the sharpest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The wind rose, and the weather was sunny.</p><p></p><p>Today, it was rare to have no rain or snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the small courtyard in Luohua Lane.</p><p></p><p>He still followed the routine to complete his daily cultivation. In the courtyard, the six divine image clones were already able to display the combined attack techniques in a somewhat skilled manner.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these combined attack techniques currently don't seem to have much use.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che's cultivation reaches a higher level, and he can paint out a thousand master clones, then this combined attack technique will reveal its fangs.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>One person is an army!</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, and the divine sense in his brow's mud pill palace was trembling, emitting brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>Within the Heaven and Earth Chess Board, the divine nature of the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Awakening Ape Temple Deity, with the help of the Summoning Divine Technique, was frantically fusing into the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Now, more than half of it has already been fused in.</p><p></p><p>The speed was a bit faster than Li Che had imagined. Originally, he thought that completing the Summoning Fusion would take about four or five days, but now it should be finished in just three days.</p><p></p><p>After the fusion is complete, it's like sketching the draft on the wood, and the carving will be much easier.</p><p></p><p>Li Che will naturally be able to step into the Divine Image Realm smoothly.</p><p></p><p>He took out the six Saintly Divine Nature Crystals, grasping them in his palm, and began to refine and devour the divine nature.</p><p></p><p>The purification of the Immaculate Heart Dao Fruit has indeed made Li Che's absorption speed of the six Saintly Divine Nature Crystals faster, and the other several divine foundations are also constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>After completing the divine nature absorption, Li Che slowly opened his eyes, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Where should I go to summon the other temple deities?"</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a problem that Li Che was a bit troubled by.</p><p></p><p>The seven divine foundations, bearing seven temple deities, was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Jingang Prefecture city, there is an Eight Extremes Mysterious Temple, I can try going there."</p><p></p><p>"If it's the Seven Elements Mysterious Temple, I should also be able to try, but beyond the Seven Elements Mysterious Temple... using the Summoning</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Danger is Small.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of the ominous abyss that had been torn open, the terrifying azure fingers that seemed ready to destroy heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt an inexplicable sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>What was that azure finger...? He didn't bother thinking about it further.</p><p></p><p>Leaping into the courtyard, Li Che began to practice his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds arose, turbulent waves surged! "Exhale—!"</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—!"</p><p></p><p>Within the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire body was surging with qi and blood, his mercury-like blood driving a terrifying power, sweeping like a roaring tide, the airflow gushing out from his pores, stirring up a raging storm in the courtyard that never ceased!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, he executed a martial art, slowly pushing forward, the movements transitioning from slow to lightning-fast, to the point where only the lingering fist shadows could be seen, then countless dragon roars erupted! The Myriad Transforming Dragon God!</p><p></p><p>Li Che practiced his fists with complete abandon, his fluttering robes seemingly infused with viscous liquid, becoming sharp and slicing through the air!</p><p></p><p>His fists struck like dragons, his knees, waist, arms, elbows...converging into the peak of the fist, forming a terrifying surging force, each exhale and inhale a punch!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Powerful and heavy fists, ethereal and untraceable fists, dreamlike fists! Countless dragon shadows intertwined and coiled around Li Che, the air seeming to be stacked like waves, surging and crashing, exploding outwards for ten meters, causing the entire courtyard to undulate like ripples! "Gulp."</p><p></p><p>After completing a set of martial arts, Li Che didn't hold back, popping a sixth-grade elixir into his mouth, sinking it into his abdomen like falling into a deep well.</p><p></p><p>Scorching waves radiated out from his skin, causing the temperature in the courtyard to suddenly soar.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Divine...indeed, being personally instructed by a Martial Saint makes a difference."</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster realm...achieved."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>In a confrontation between Grand Masters, aside from the gap in foundation and physique, there was also a difference in the martial arts they cultivated.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master who had mastered the true essence of a Martial Saint's supreme technique could easily subdue another Grand Master who had only cultivated the supreme technique of their own sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was somewhat surprised, it had been too smooth and effortless.</p><p></p><p>This Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Divine technique had been so easily grasped to the Grandmaster realm by him.</p><p></p><p>Spreading out his palm, within it, there seemed to be formless dragon shadows circling, this was the true essence of the Martial Saint's supreme technique, the Myriad Transforming Dragon God! The second Martial Saint's supreme technique, mastered!  Li Che's eyes gleamed, as if countless dragon forms were constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>"The heart, has already been tempered with the true essence of the Myriad Transforming Dragon Image..."</p><p></p><p>"Then which organ should the Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Divine true essence be used to temper? The liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in place, his palm clenched around the flowing true essence, his gaze like lightning.</p><p></p><p>If understood according to the Five Elements, the liver corresponds to wood, the heart to fire, the spleen to earth, the lungs to metal, and the kidneys to water.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Saint's supreme techniques he cultivated were actually not easily divided into the Five Elements, because they were not Five Elements martial arts to begin with.</p><p></p><p>If used to temper the five viscera, it would actually cause the martial arts to gradually acquire Five Elements attributes.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Myriad Transforming Dragon Image, the reason Li Che tempered his heart was because the heart is the source of the human body, the wellspring of the blood circulation.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che's Myriad Transforming Dragon Image had fused many techniques, it was the root of his growth.</p><p></p><p>So, the Dragon Image tempers the heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Divine, shall temper the lungs."</p><p></p><p>Li Che finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his five fingers clenched tightly, and that martial dao true essence that seemed like a dragon's roar surged into his body! It circulated and flowed within his lungs, actually emitting a sound like clashing metal!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling waves, like striking a bronze bowl! Li Che's eyes shone brilliantly, the next moment, his chest swelled, and with a single breath through his nose, it was as if countless dragons had roared and pounced out!</p><p></p><p>Within the entire courtyard, fierce winds blew, turbulent gusts shot out! It took nearly a hundred breaths before it gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>A faintly golden spiritual aura appeared on Li Che's palm, flickering and jumping, extremely violent.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes it transformed into a dragon form, sometimes it exploded into golden metal.</p><p></p><p>"The second spiritual aura..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fingers trembled, and the Myriad Transforming Dragon Image spiritual aura also emerged, presenting a crimson color like glass.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed different from the spiritual aura of the Myriad Dragons Submitting to the Divine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fingers, and the two spiritual auras simultaneously returned to his body.</p><p></p><p>With one exhale and inhale, he calmed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, as if dark golden electric currents were surging out.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the mission last night was actually detected?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it should be through the sensing of the Seven Elemental Corpse Curse's mother-child seal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che swung his arms, the lines in his eyes interweaving.</p><p></p><p>As if the chessboard of the heavens and earth was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the image, the luxurious Qin family carriage was speeding down the long street, heading out of the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>And inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed the presence of Qin Fenghuо, and besides him, the Qin family's ancestor Qin Diкun as well...</p><p></p><p>They were going to send Qin Fenghuо out of the Golden Light Prefecture? Dispersing and fleeing? Last night, Li Che had actually planned to make a move, but he happened to overhear a little secret.</p><p></p><p>Such as the news about the Lotus Deity's Lotus Seed, and the legend of the Three Crown Prince's divine weapon [Qiankun Circle], and also the news about their intention to capture Xixі.</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's eyes, the dark golden electric currents surged, tearing the air, an extreme savagery erupting.</p><p></p><p>So the Lotus Seed has been condensed, huh?</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, the Ox Demon mask covered his face, his blood and qi suddenly twisting, in an instant, his entire body of bones and muscles trembled and rang, as if breaking the shackles that bound his flesh.</p><p></p><p>His flesh and blood swelled and expanded, reaching two and a half meters, his triangular back, with the tight-fitting muscle, piled up together, resembling a demonic face!</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Sect, the Seven Elemental Supreme Corpse Deity Envoy in the Golden Light Prefecture?</p><p></p><p>Hidden for so long.</p><p></p><p>Even he, Li Che, was deceived.</p><p></p><p>Today...</p><p></p><p>It's time to set out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Clop clop clop clop! The dragon-like horses neighed, under the coachman's furious whipping, their blood vessels seemed to be burning with flames.</p><p></p><p>Pulling the luxurious carriage, like a flash of fire, they sped rapidly out of the prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Flee! This is to flee! In the carriage, Qin Fenghuо's dark eye circles were gloomy, and the pitch-black Lotus Deity markings on his brow emerged, the dense temple deity spirituality gathering into three black Lotus Deity seeds in front of him.</p><p></p><p>There was another person in the carriage, the Qin family's divine Sage ancestor, Qin Diкun.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qin Diкun had a complex expression as he looked at Qin Fenghuо.</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо opened his eyes, and there were threads of dense divine light flowing and flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the three black Lotus Deity seeds in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо's lips curled into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-horse carriage sped to the city gate.</p><p></p><p>It was blocked by the divine guard soldiers stationed there.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the carriage was moving too fast, too urgently, what were they trying to do? But the carriage didn't show any signs of stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Move aside."</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun crawled out of the carriage cabin, indifferently sweeping a glance at the divine guard soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Those soldiers immediately broke out in cold sweat, hastily stepping aside, allowing the dragon-horse carriage to speed past them, kicking up a gale!  "That's... the Qin family's divine Sage ancestor, Qin Diкun?!"</p><p></p><p>The few defending city guards were bewildered.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to obstruct him.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the carriage to speed away.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the carriage left the gates of the Golden Light Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>a terrifyingly oppressive force suddenly crashed down, the dragon-like horses with blood lineage, their front hooves bent and shattered by the powerful force, slamming heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun grabbed Qin Fenghuо in the carriage and soared into the air.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the overturned carriage, the wheels still rapidly spinning.</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun's robes billowed and fluttered, his expression extremely unsightly, the oppressive presence like a towering mountain, sweeping in from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо was placed down by him, standing quietly in the carriage cabin.</p><p></p><p>The eyes under Qin Fenghuо's dark eye circles were staring fixedly in one direction.</p><p></p><p>"Martial dao will... the will of a Grand Master..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun was trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>He stared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>The rising dust, accompanied by the blowing gale, was gradually dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a figure enveloped in black smoke.</p><p></p><p>That figure slowly raised its head, revealing a face covered by a ferocious ox-headed mask, tearing open a scratch with a fingernail.</p><p></p><p>The ox-like muscular figure was covered in armor, gripping a chopping knife in one hand.</p><p></p><p>As he swung it up, the chopping knife was instantly shrouded in black smoke, transforming into a crescent moon blade, which the burly figure shouldered.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master... Xue Dуfu!"</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld!!!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun's scalp tingled! Indeed...</p><p></p><p>Qin Tiangang had told him, when they were targeted, the first thing Qin Diкun thought of was the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Only the Underworld would so relentlessly pursue the Corpse Deity Sect!</p><p></p><p>And now, following Qin Tiangang's orders, he had brought Qin Fenghuо out of the Golden Light Prefecture, and was indeed intercepted by a Underworld expert.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>Qin Diкun sighed.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qin Fenghuо let out a low chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld, huh..."</p><p></p><p>"So it's the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо tilted his head, the corners of his lips curling upwards, slowly exuding blackness, transforming into black lips, his pupils becoming even more pitch-black and demonic.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Ox Demon, Horse-Faced, and Monkey King?"</p><p></p><p>"You only sent this one traitor to stop me?"</p><p></p><p>"Underestimating me, are you?"</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fingers tightly, the next moment, he suddenly struck, stabbing into Qin Diкun's heart.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Qin Diкun let out an agonizing roar.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, shouldering the crescent moon blade, Xue Dуfu had already made his move, one foot stepping down, the ground exploding into a deep pit, the entire person carrying the crescent moon blade had already begun to charge wildly.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Endless black qi erupted from Qin Diкun's body, Qin Diкun's divine Sage aura suddenly distorted, visualizing the temple deity's divine Sage, but it abruptly became ferocious and terrifying! Countless Corpse Curse seals attached to Qin Diкun's body.</p><p></p><p>This Qin family ancestor who had always been high and mighty, his eyes instantly turned blood-red, the essence of his flesh and blood seemingly drained in an instant, entirely nourishing the Corpse Curse seals on the surface of his body, causing his body to emit a silver glow! Cursed Silver Corpse! Although it was achieved by draining life force...</p><p></p><p>It could not last long.</p><p></p><p>But it would still be enough to obstruct Xue Dуfu, this Grand Master, for a moment.</p><p></p><p>And that was enough for Qin Fenghuо.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, Horse-Faced, and Monkey King, these renowned Underworld Three Terrors, had not come to deal with him, which meant...</p><p></p><p>They should be going after Yuan Jingang.</p><p></p><p>That was exactly what Yuan Jingang wanted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by underestimating him like this, the Underworld would have to pay a price.</p><p></p><p>Today, the reckoning between the Corpse Deity Sect stationed in the Golden Light Prefecture and the Underworld would begin! After today...</p><p></p><p>The Underworld will no more!</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо let out a cold laugh, the three divine Lotus seeds floating.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, his fingers rapidly forming seals, with each seal, threads of death qi and corpse qi seeped out from his body.</p><p></p><p>In the end, his entire arm was densely covered by Corpse Curse seals, his arm swelling up, a finger pointing down at one of the divine Lotus seeds.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless death qi abruptly erupted from his body.</p><p></p><p>As if wanting to form an array, intending to summon an extremely terrifying entity from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The cold smile on Qin Fenghuо's face quickly froze.</p><p></p><p>The moment his finger touched the lotus seed,</p><p></p><p>a dagger silently and stealthily came to rest on his neck.</p><p></p><p>His black-ringed eyes slightly narrowed, and he saw a figure wrapped in black shadows, crawling out of his own shadow in a crooked manner.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Element Immortal?!</p><p></p><p>This was not underestimating him at all?</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master, a Divine Element Immortal...</p><p></p><p>He was just a child, was this necessary?! "Shadow... Guard?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо's eyes shrank.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Immortal... wasn't he dead? This Underworld...</p><p></p><p>Could this Underworld really...</p><p></p><p>Resurrect the dead?!</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо's thought had just formed.</p><p></p><p>Squelch—</p><p></p><p>His head was severed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Qin Residence.</p><p></p><p>The vast Qin Residence, deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Thick blood scent permeated and surged.</p><p></p><p>In the main position.</p><p></p><p>Wrapped in a black robe, Qin Tiangang sat quietly, head bowed, his silver fingers lightly tapping the tabletop.</p><p></p><p>And the Qin family patriarch, Qin Cang, was pale and despairing, slumped in the chair.</p><p></p><p>Below...</p><p></p><p>Were densely packed, all the Qin family members' corpses...</p><p></p><p>At the moment Qin Diкun sent Qin Fenghuо away from the Qin Residence.</p><p></p><p>Qin Tiangang, this ancestor, began to ruthlessly slaughter, summoning all the Qin family members together, and then...</p><p></p><p>Massacring them all.</p><p></p><p>Countless corpses strewn on the ground, blood continuously flowing...</p><p></p><p>As if painting a ferocious and terrifying pattern.</p><p></p><p>And Qin Cang stiffly raised his head, looking past the piles of clan members' corpses.</p><p></p><p>Towards the outside.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, their collusion with the Corpse Deity Sect...</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shaking off the water droplets from the oiled paper umbrella, Li Che entered the room and saw Zhang Ya sitting cross-legged in a chair, clutching a Shishen crystal, diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Che's spiritual perception, Zhang Ya's cultivation progress was laid bare.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating your nature like a river?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, his speed not too fast or too slow, after all, he had the Shishen crystal to assist, and Li Che's daily guidance.</p><p></p><p>This progress could only be considered average.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was in comparison to Li Che and Xixie. If it were anyone else, Zhang Ya's spiritual cultivation progress would already be considered very fast.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's long eyelashes fluttered, and she immediately opened her eyes to see her husband gazing at her with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>As an old married couple, Zhang Ya still couldn't help but blush slightly when being gazed upon like this.</p><p></p><p>Li Che embraced Zhang Ya, and with Xixie not yet back from school, the couple began their marital pleasures.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth chessboard enveloped them, shielding them from any prying eyes, as the couple embarked on their plan to have another child.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, what do you think about giving Xixie a little brother?" </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhang Ya's black hair was scattered across Li Che's chest, her fingers gently tracing circles as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly taken aback: "Shouldn't we ask Xixie's opinion first?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was actually quite cautious about whether to have another child or not.</p><p></p><p>Because he could more or less confirm that even if they had another child, it might not necessarily be bound to the Dao fruit tribulation like Xixie. His tribulation bond would only be with Xixie.</p><p></p><p>It's worth a try, but having another child in such a dangerous world would mean an additional vulnerability.</p><p></p><p>The danger would increase.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Li Che, feeling the external threats and dangers, naturally had no intention of having another child.</p><p></p><p>But now, after breaking through to the Great Grandmaster realm, Li Che felt he had the confidence to do so.</p><p></p><p>Having another child would at least guarantee a certain level of safety.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Ya paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do we really need to ask Xixie about this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya had never thought of asking Xixie, after all, whether to have a child or not was a matter for the parents.</p><p></p><p>Li Che embraced Zhang Ya, and the couple leaned back on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Although Xixie is only four years old, her mind is actually quite mature and she has her own opinions... If we don't tell her or discuss it with her, and just have another son, what if she feels that the birth of the brother will take away the love of her father and mother?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Xixie is also a member of our family, and we should discuss matters together."</p><p></p><p>"If Xixie really throws a tantrum, it won't be easy to resolve."</p><p></p><p>"So, even if we really want to have one, we have to explain it clearly to her."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya thought about it and didn't deny it, nodding seriously.</p><p></p><p>She had indeed overlooked this.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that such a young child doesn't need to be consulted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che ruffled Zhang Ya's head.</p><p></p><p>With his current mastery of the physical body, it would be too easy for him to succeed in one try, but the question is whether Zhang Ya's physical body can withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"If you want a baby, you'd better work hard. Your husband is a bit fierce now... You may need to raise your martial cultivation to at least the Divine Vein Realm to be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was not really a joke.</p><p></p><p>If Zhang Ya wanted to perfectly accept the Furnace Sect Master's breakthrough to the Great Grandmaster realm, it would indeed be a considerable challenge for her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Ya's face became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>This... Is there such a thing? Zhang Ya thought about it and immediately got up, dressed, and set out with a high morale. She was going to practice martial arts, she was going to open her meridians!</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He then said that his wife had to quicken the pace of her martial arts practice, or else... In a while, she might become a Heaven and Human Unified Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya almost cried.</p><p></p><p>Having a demonic daughter was already enough, and now she has a monster of a husband...</p><p></p><p>As an ordinary person, the pressure was really too great.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a Samoyed dog mixed into a pack of wolves.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not disturb Zhang Ya's martial arts practice, changed into a clean and tidy black robe, and left the courtyard with a refreshed spirit, heading towards the Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>The rain fell, splashing water droplets on the umbrella surface.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che arrived at the Golden Peak, he saw Xixie, under the guidance of Jiao Shaoqiu, transforming the Three Pure Level [Eight-Armed Three-Faced Hell Lotus Indestructible Divine Embryo Technique] she had obtained from the Temple God Resonance.</p><p></p><p>This technique was divided into the realms of nature cultivation, divine foundation, divine appearance, divine element, and divine embryo. It was an extremely complete technique! Because only Xixie, who had obtained the mighty Temple God's divinity, could cultivate it, others basically couldn't even think about it, so it could be understood as a matching divine technique for Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu was only guiding Xixie based on his own experience.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with his Golden Body Shedding realm cultivation, guiding Xixie to complete the transformation of the nature cultivation technique was not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>In a few days, Xixie had basically completed the transformation of her divine nature!</p><p></p><p>From afar, Li Che seemed to vaguely see a blooming black flame lotus, radiating an extremely oppressive divine pressure, bursting forth around Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu sat under the eaves, with the Grandmaster Coachman guarding by his side. Seeing Li Che, Jiao Shaoqiu immediately waved with a benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiao."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's withered and decaying old face was adorned with a benevolent smile: "Ah Che, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie has officially completed the transformation of her divine nature cultivation today, and has now reached the realm of cultivation like a river. In half a month, she can start forging her divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also smiled: "With Elder Jiao's guidance, there's naturally no need to worry about Xixie's progress."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu shook his head: "I'm not that capable. I can only give some guidance in the nature cultivation stage. When it comes to the divine foundation and divine appearance, the Three Pure level technique, I have no experience."</p><p></p><p>"Only the inner elders of the Righteous Sect's main sect can properly instruct Xixie."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu then chatted with Li Che about the assessment of the Sect's Shenxiao Mountain elders, saying that the difficulty was very high, and most of the Shenxiao Mountain elders were old fogeys.</p><p></p><p>The wood carving art was profoundly mysterious, and if Li Che participated in the assessment, he would need to compete with those old fellows...</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also modest, simply saying he would give it a try.</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, the breeze blew, sweeping across the corridor.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, other children were cultivating under the guidance of Wang Daoren, and the children who had performed outstandingly in the Temple God Resonance had been selected.</p><p></p><p>Such as Hai Chaosheng, Qin Huofire, Gong Yuanxiang, Gongyang Yu, Huang Sixiang and others, who were all being specially guided and cared for by Wang Daoren on the Golden Peak, digesting the gains from the Temple God Resonance.</p><p></p><p>And these people, like Xixie, would also go to the Righteous Sect's main sect in Lingnan City.</p><p></p><p>After all, the harvest from the Four Mysterious Temple's Temple God Resonance, all had remarkable potential.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze swept over Qin Huofire.</p><p></p><p>This Qin Huofire...</p><p></p><p>Dares to appear on the Golden Peak?</p><p></p><p>He really has great confidence in his own disguise.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che did not detect any abnormality in Qin Huofire, no death qi, no corpse qi.</p><p></p><p>Not at all like a person from the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>But the Qin family must be involved with the Corpse God Sect, and under the Starfall Eye observation...</p><p></p><p>That dense death qi and corpse qi must be hiding a big shot with the SixÂè∏Corpse Curse Seal! Li Che did not stare directly, but only casually glanced, then withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>However, Qin Huofire was very sensitive, his hackles rising, and he vigilantly scanned his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also guessed Qin Huofire's purpose for staying on the Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>It was most likely for his daughter Xixie, or rather, the Temple God's divinity within Xixie? Qin Huofire should be looking for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che would not give him that chance.</p><p></p><p>He had already planted a divine chess piece on him, constantly monitoring his situation.</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire did not detect Li Che's hidden agent.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie finished her cultivation, opened her eyes, and saw Li Che.</p><p></p><p>She immediately jumped up excitedly. Stomping her feet on the ground, she shot towards Li Che like a cannon shell.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, his five fingers grasping, effortlessly lifting Xixie by the back of her neck, then holding her in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu did not react much, but the Coachman beside him narrowed his eyes, with a hint of doubt in his gaze as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled warmly at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, Elder Grandpa, goodbye, Uncle Coachman!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie bid farewell to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>The doubt in the Coachman's eyes disappeared, and his stiff, expressionless face suddenly squeezed out a dazzling and doting smile, becoming a kind and gentle old uncle as he bid farewell to Xixie.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" </p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's spiritual perception was powerful, naturally noticing the change in the Coachman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That move just now by Master Li, displaying his physical strength, was quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The Coachman spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Jiao Shaoqiu nodded, closing his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to interfere too much. We are cultivating Xixie, his daughter... She is the treasure of our Sect. As for what Li Che does, we don't need to care."</p><p></p><p>The Coachman respectfully bowed his head in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>"When you have time, go and investigate the Qin family situation thoroughly... This Qin Huofire seems a bit off."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu slowly opened his eyes, his cloudy eyes seeming to emit a sharp light.</p><p></p><p>"In ten days, after Xixie has completely stabilized the Temple God's Hell Lotus divine nature, we will set out to escort the children to the City. I have already contacted the main sect in the City..."</p><p></p><p>"Xixie has obtained at least seven-tenths of the Temple God's divinity of the Third Prince, and is extremely compatible with this Three Pure Divine Embryo Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"If Xixie cultivates to the Divine Appearance realm, her Eight-Armed Hell Lotus Furious Third Prince Divine Appearance, may have a chance to replace our Sect in suppressing that Four Mysterious Temple's Three-Eyed True Lord Temple God..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that in Feiluo City, where Xixie was born, there is also a Three-Eyed True Lord Spiritual Infant Mysterious Temple, which is a branch temple of the suppressed Three-Eyed True Lord Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's gaze was cloudy.</p><p></p><p>The Coachman's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that Xixie can break our Sect's current predicament?"</p><p></p><p>However, Jiao Shaoqiu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"She is still just a child... How can she break the deadlock?"</p><p></p><p>"A child..."</p><p></p><p>"Just the hope of the Sect."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che brought Xixie back home, and Old Chen had not yet returned from work.</p><p></p><p>The three-member family began to enjoy the delicious food harmoniously.</p><p></p><p>Since it was stored in the Spatial Realm, the dishes were still steaming hot, just out of the pot.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, when are you going to take Xixie to the restaurant to eat?" </p><p></p><p>Xixie was gnawing on a pig's trotter, her mouth dripping with oil, tilting her head curiously at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"When there's a chance."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Oh..."</p><p></p><p>"Daddy said the restaurant has a lazy and fat big black dog? Too bad... Xixie didn't get a chance to see the doggy."</p><p></p><p>Xixie felt regretful, taking a big bite of the pig's trotter to make up for the disappointment in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After dinner.</p><p></p><p>Li Che began to guide Xixie in cultivating martial arts, teaching her his self-created Martial Saint Absolute Skill [Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant].</p><p></p><p>Of course, although Li Che is no longer at the Martial Saint realm, the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant is a Martial Saint level absolute skill, created by integrating four Martial Saint secret techniques, so it is naturally also at the Martial Saint level.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was very interested and diligently cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che's current understanding of the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant has reached the Master level.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, look!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie's left hand is dragon, right hand is elephant, coming to punch-punch!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie clenched her fists, and the purple flame snake spear hidden in her arm suddenly burst out with purple flames, coiling into a serpent shape.</p><p></p><p>As for the golden brick hidden in her right arm, it did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>Xixie shook it, but the golden brick did not manifest into an elephant.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, looking at the undisguised disappointment on his daughter's face, and immediately understood...</p><p></p><p>This golden brick needs training.</p><p></p><p>Late at night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che transformed into the Ox Demon, bringing Xixie to the courtyard of Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>No choice...</p><p></p><p>It seems the Mysterious Temple was accidentally erased by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>They could only temporarily use the courtyard in Falling Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie, half-asleep, saw the Ox Demon wearing a cute ox mask, towering like a mountain, and immediately shouted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon ruffled Xixie's head.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he activated the [Equaling Heaven Mask] to stimulate the divine weapons within Xixie.</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>Now has quite a few divine weapons in her body!</p><p></p><p>The left arm conceals the Purple Flame Snake Spear, and the right hand conceals a golden brick.</p><p></p><p>Her left foot even has a Hell Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel.</p><p></p><p>Her whole body is filled with divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che was actually a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>To complete the Three Prince's divine weapon set...</p><p></p><p>It's still quite far away!</p><p></p><p>At least, the Yin-Yang Circle and the Heavenly Silk Brocade, these two iconic divine weapons, have not fallen into Xixie's grasp yet.</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't it be? The Yin-Yang Circle and Heavenly Silk Brocade, as the iconic set, how come they didn't appear in Xixie with her Temple God Resonance degree?"</p><p></p><p>"Only the Golden Light Wheel appeared, and that golden brick is something Xixie barely won."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very concerned about this problem, after all, it was related to whether Xixie's future divine armor could be completed, so naturally he had to pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard this and suddenly felt that it made sense.</p><p></p><p>But he soon got a headache again.</p><p></p><p>"If it's not in the strange temple of the Third Prince... then where will it be?"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly King Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"Or other strange temples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered for a while, but had no clue.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's train the golden brick first."</p><p></p><p>When the divine weapon was activated, Xixia fell into a deep sleep under the influence of the "fusion of the weapon" power.</p><p></p><p>The purple flame snake spear transformed into a purple dragon snake, which Li Che beat up many times.</p><p></p><p>And the golden brick, under the stimulation of the Qi Tian's face, rolled with golden smoke and turned into a giant palm, rushing to slap Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not used to coddling it, he clenched his five fingers, and the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Splitting Spear appeared, sweeping out with a stick, directly smashing the golden palm into countless golden smoke!</p><p></p><p>Every time it re-condensed, it would be smashed to pieces by Li Che! Even if the golden smoke retreated into Xixia's arm, it was still stimulated out by Li Che's Qi Tian's face.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The purple flame big snake of the spear seemed to take some delight in the misfortune, then it also got a stick from Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Come at me together."</p><p></p><p>Li Che wore the Ox Demon mask, his figure was burly, the blood of the Great Grandmaster surging, like a towering wave, the airflow kept shooting.</p><p></p><p>And the hidden Prison Lotus Wind Fire Golden Light Wheel was also forced out by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che broke through to the Great Grandmaster, with the true meaning of the Martial Saint refined into the divine aura, combined with the divine power of the blood mist, how majestic was it? The three divine weapons were beaten without a temper.</p><p></p><p>After all, they could not be fully activated, and could only release stronger power as Xixia grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>They could only deserve to be beaten by this bastard!</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Xixia stretched and yawned, her powerful strength almost trampled the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Eh‚ÄîXixia seems to have grown stronger again."</p><p></p><p>Xixia felt the surging blood, and her blood change was unknowingly nine times.</p><p></p><p>Strength grew, power to move mountains! Li Che sent Xixia to the Golden Light Peak to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he returned to the courtyard in Luohua Alley to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He took out the gold foil paper that recorded the Subduing of the Myriad Dragons, a stream of blood suddenly surged in, and instantly, a terrifying aura burst out from the gold foil paper!</p><p></p><p>A strand of Martial Saint will hidden within it erupted, striking the extremely standard Subduing of the Myriad Dragons towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up, and he also began to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Subduing of the Myriad Dragons had already reached a high level, but faced with the fist technique struck out by this Martial Saint will, he was somewhat suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che didn't care about being suppressed, in the process of this suppression, the Fruit of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra shook, and it gradually evolved towards the Grandmaster level of the Subduing of the Myriad Dragons.</p><p></p><p>After practicing with the Martial Saint will lingering in the gold foil paper.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged, holding the gold foil paper: "This Martial Saint will can still be practiced by me three times... After the three times, the Martial Saint will will be completely extinguished."</p><p></p><p>"But three times is enough for me to push the Subduing of the Myriad Dragons to the Grandmaster level."</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, in terms of technique, this Pacification King is still a little better than me."</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was the creator of the martial arts technique.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of the integration of the seven emotions and six desires, Li Che was a little more superior.</p><p></p><p>After summarizing, Li Che stood up and continued to cultivate other Martial Saint supreme skills.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it, he cultivated five Martial Saint supreme skills, refining the five viscera, even though his martial arts talent was extraordinary, with the support of the Fruit of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had to work hard.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Mountain Solitary Blade, the lonely sword light, flashed out in an instant, splitting the air in the courtyard in two, and then the air crashed down like a broken stream, colliding with each other, the air waves raging.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the Soaring Eight Extremities Steps, the Primordial Qi Tian Cudgel...</p><p></p><p>Li Che diligently practiced each Martial Saint supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the martial arts, Li Che did not stop.</p><p></p><p>He began to study the Immortal Craftsman's mechanism techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Armor had already completed the manufacture of various components, and now only the final assembly was left.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Li Che was also busy upgrading the Fire God Fury Dragon Cannon.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che planned to integrate the Black and White Extreme Collapse into the Immortal Craftsman's Fire God Barrett.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Great Snowslide, the silent and extinguishing power of the Black and White Extreme Collapse is more suitable for sniping and assassination!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had this idea long ago and began to put it into practice.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Black and White Extreme Collapse, although it seems quiet, contains a destructive power stronger than the Great Snowslide.</p><p></p><p>Li Che needs a stronger spiritual wood to load the bullets.</p><p></p><p>But for the time being, he has not found a better spiritual wood, and the Fire God Fury Serpent Wood that Tang San Jia found for Li Che is the best spiritual wood for now.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is using it temporarily, using the Fire God Wood to carry the power of the Black and White Extreme Collapse, trying to make the Fire God Extreme Collapse Dragon Fang Bullet!</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's estimation, the power of the Extreme Collapse Dragon Fang should have a considerable increase compared to the Fire God Dragon Fang.</p><p></p><p>The Fire God Dragon Fang is actually just an upgrade of the Dragon Fang Bodhi in terms of material, and is more of a transitional product.</p><p></p><p>And this Fire God Extreme Collapse Dragon Fang is a real upgrade!</p><p></p><p>Li Che deduced it based on the experience of the Immortal Craftsman.</p><p></p><p>After the Fire God Extreme Collapse Dragon Fang is loaded into the Immortal Craftsman's Fire God Barrett.</p><p></p><p>The sniping shot will have stronger penetration power, higher stealth, longer firing range, and increased power! For the Horse Face, it is a comprehensive enhancement! Therefore, Li Che is quite enthusiastic and continues to study.</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that even if martial arts are high, as long as the firepower is strong enough, even Martial Saints are not afraid! With equipment sophisticated enough and firepower strong enough, even Martial Saints...</p><p></p><p>Can be killed for you to see! Of course, according to Li Che's understanding, to kill a Martial Saint...</p><p></p><p>The equipment may need to be updated for several more generations.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the courtyard, and suddenly, a drop of rain fell.</p><p></p><p>A snap, it fell on his face.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then stopped his research.</p><p></p><p>Tilting his head up.</p><p></p><p>"It's raining."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he stood up.</p><p></p><p>His whole body cracked and swelled, then transformed into the Tower Mountain Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Straw hat, mask and black robe.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra, Sleeping Dragon Elephant.</p><p></p><p>The aura was suppressed, even the surging blood of the Great Grandmaster, like a raging fire, was completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Then the toes touched the ground.</p><p></p><p>The whole person disappeared from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>The Qin mansion, the entire mansion had fallen into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>But it was not completely surrounded by a dead atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The lights were lit.</p><p></p><p>When Qin Huofire returned from the Golden Light Peak, he got out of the luxurious and comfortable carriage.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Qin mansion opened directly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Huofire stepped into the Qin mansion, and the gate of the Qin mansion closed again.</p><p></p><p>He had his hands in his pockets, his whole body drooping, his eyes instantly turning pitch black, with heavy dark circles.</p><p></p><p>He walked unsteadily towards the Qin mansion's main hall.</p><p></p><p>The main hall was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>The important figures of the Qin family were all sitting inside.</p><p></p><p>Qin Digun, the Qin family's divine relative elder, sat in the side position, and below, there was Qin Cang, the Qin family's patriarch, as well as the next generation Qin Haonan and Qin Leixiao.</p><p></p><p>When Qin Huofire stepped in, Qin Haonan's face changed slightly, with a touch of pain.</p><p></p><p>"Huofire... my son..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan's breathing was heavy.</p><p></p><p>However, Qin Huofire, with his drooping dark circles, just gave him a indifferent glance.</p><p></p><p>"Who is your son? Your son died long ago..."

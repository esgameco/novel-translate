            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Face of the Heavenly Sovereign...</p><p></p><p>Could it really not compare to the mere false Dragon God? Li Che did not believe it, and moreover, the Face of the Heavenly Sovereign was also a mythical weapon, two mythical weapons meeting each other.</p><p></p><p>Could they not even spark a little?</p><p></p><p>The night was deep.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard gradually became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhang Ya's lulling, Xixis lively energy of the day slowly subsided, and her whole person gradually fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>After putting the little one to sleep, Li Che also put Zhang Ya to sleep, and after teaching Zhang Ya the tempering bone posture, Zhang Ya also fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then left the room, the next moment transformed into the Ox Demon, picked up the sleeping Xixis, and directly left the original place.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was already in the mysterious temple of the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Awakening Ape.</p><p></p><p>Xixis rubbed her sleepy eyes and slowly opened them.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Where is this?</p><p></p><p>Xixis looked around puzzledly, and was directly startled, jumping up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>She widened her eyes, sweeping her gaze around, finally resting on the statue of the temple god on the Awakening Ape Temple.</p><p></p><p>"The little monkey temple god?"</p><p></p><p>Xixis sensed the powerful temple god pressure released from the statue of the Awakening Ape.</p><p></p><p>Her heart suddenly jumped, and the still dazed head in her dream began to think about why she was here.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she saw the Ox Demon wearing a cute ox-faced mask, towering like a pagoda mountain, standing behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Shifu!"</p><p></p><p>Xixis recognized the Ox Demon and was suddenly delighted, shouting out and jumping towards the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's body was too majestic and imposing, over two meters tall, in contrast to Xixis, the huge visual impact made Xixis seem super tiny.</p><p></p><p>The palm as big as a fan stretched out, and Li Che directly pinched Xixis's fate at the back of her neck and lifted her up.</p><p></p><p>Gently placed her on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Xixis sat on the Ox Demon's shoulder, swinging her feet happily.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Shifu, it's been so long since I've seen you! I thought you didn't like Xixis anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Xixis said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the cute ox-faced mask, patted Xixis's head and did not speak much.</p><p></p><p>Xixis took out the specially made immortal workmanship Gatling gun and handed it to the Ox Demon like a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Shifu, Crow Crow's is almost used up, and I seem to have dropped and damaged this immortal workmanship Gatling gun a bit in my battle with my little slave."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Shifu, fix it!"</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's palm as big as a fan took the mechanism from Xixis, but he didn't really care.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance, Li Che knew where to fix it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che didn't fix it.</p><p></p><p>He took out the upgraded version of Xixis's dedicated immortal workmanship Gatling gun and handed it to Xixis.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Che even integrated the Barrett into the mechanism, realizing a two-in-one fusion! The immortal workmanship Gatling gun was modified to be like a huge ring-shaped spiritual wood barrel, using the eighth-level spiritual wood "Flying Cloud Willow" found from the Divine Sculpture Ridge, with six metal tubes embedded in the spiritual wood barrel, and every time it fired, the metal tubes would rotate quickly, shooting out one compressed spiritual wood raven after another.</p><p></p><p>And inside the Flying Cloud Willow wood cannon barrel, a small-scale Avalokitesvara Lotus Shell was hidden.</p><p></p><p>Concealed in the form of a crossbow arrow, once fired, the Avalokitesvara Lotus Shell would be sent out by the powerful counter-thrust force arranged by the precise mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Xixis took the new immortal workmanship Gatling gun with great delight and happily shouldered it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che introduced the usage method to Xixis, regarding the fireworks, and Xixis listened carefully and understood it immediately! "Can it also launch mushroom fireworks?"</p><p></p><p>Xixis heard the Ox Demon's description, and her eyes suddenly seemed to be flooded with ripples, and she began to yearn and fantasize about such a scene.</p><p></p><p>Mushroom fireworks...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Xixis so excited that she couldn't sleep!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon chuckled and also introduced a mechanism next to the spiritual wood barrel, pressing it down, and the six metal gun barrels would stack and interweave into one.</p><p></p><p>Turning into an immortal workmanship Barrett, and there was even an eight-power scope on it!</p><p></p><p>It was an eight-power scope that Li Che had hand-crafted.</p><p></p><p>A three-in-one immortal workmanship cannon platform! It made Xixis overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xixis happily jumping up and down on the spot, the cheeks of Li Che's Ox Demon mask couldn't help but bloom with a smile.</p><p></p><p>His daughter...</p><p></p><p>He must spoil her! Spoil her to the sky! His daughter likes to play with firearms, likes to see fireworks, so he prepared the three-in-one cannon platform!</p><p></p><p>With the cannon platform as the main force.</p><p></p><p>The yellow-haired one will be stopped!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing tonight is not to give Xixis a cannon platform.</p><p></p><p>But to help Xixis try to master the fire spear in her arm.</p><p></p><p>"Hand."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xixis jumped down, carrying the extremely light cannon platform made of Flying Cloud Willow, and looked at the Ox Ox puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Ox didn't say much, just pointed to his arm.</p><p></p><p>Xixis was puzzled, and then suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Ox Shifu, do you want to see Xixis's little gun gun in her arm?"</p><p></p><p>"But it won't work, Xixis still can't control the little gun gun, I can only sense that there is a little gun gun in my hand."</p><p></p><p>Xixis shrugged, tilting her head, and sighed, a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>The little gun gun is very disobedient.</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon said softly.</p><p></p><p>Xixis nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Here."</p><p></p><p>She then stretched out her chubby arm and handed it to the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, looking at his daughter in her pajamas, single-handedly carrying the cannon platform, so cute to the point of explosion.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, the palm as big as a fan pressing on Xixis's small palm.</p><p></p><p>Big hand touches small hand.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly narrowed, his mind moved, and he mobilized two dark golden Heavenly King Temple God spiritual chess pieces from the chessboard of heaven and earth, whose lines were all pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! Li Che mobilized the dark golden divine chess pieces, as if surging in the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>Gathered in his palm, and touched Xixis's small palm on his big hand through the membrane!</p><p></p><p>Hum--!!! Instantly.</p><p></p><p>A terrifyingly powerful divine power suddenly burst out from Xixis's body, like a storm sweeping and raging, like a long knife cutting, tearing the air into one empty space after another. Purple flames, jumped out from Xixis's arm, one, two, three.</p><p></p><p>"As expected..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes behind the Ox Demon mask narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King chess pieces can indeed stimulate the [Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear]! Suddenly, Li Che found that the flames on Xixis's body were getting more and more, accompanied by a towering momentum, bursting out from Xixis's body.</p><p></p><p>Instead of controlling Xixis's body, it actually formed a giant purple flame snake outside Xixis's body! The giant snake opened its mouth wide, hissing out purple snake tongues, with flames flashing and jumping!</p><p></p><p>"Deification?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's palm suddenly released, and his figure disappeared from the original place.</p><p></p><p>Boom--! The ground was severely pounded, the purple flame snake's tail lashing violently on the temple ground, causing a spider web-like crack to tear open on the ground!</p><p></p><p>The majestic figure of the Ox Demon stood in another part of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Indifferently looking at the purple flame giant snake.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have chosen a master, you should think about properly assisting your new master, rather than maintaining a cold and aloof attitude as if you look down on the new master."</p><p></p><p>The deep voice came from the mouth of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>The giant purple flame snake opened its bloody mouth and let out a roar!</p><p></p><p>You're telling me how to do things?! Rumbling!</p><p></p><p>It actually directly separated from Xixis's body and rushed towards Li Che at high speed, the purple flame giant snake vivid and lifelike, its scales shimmering!</p><p></p><p>The tongue of fire roared, actually flying backwards in the air, the speed so fast that it was at the extreme, like a super-fast long spear, piercing through quickly!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Ox Demon's eyes were brilliant, he didn't even use the [Face of the Heavenly Sovereign], the physique of the Furnace Sect Master erupted violently! Dragon Elephant Golden Ape · Ascending the Tower!</p><p></p><p>His hair grew rapidly, tinged with a faint golden color, and golden smoke like agarwood flowed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Every inch of his flesh and blood was swelling, with a buzzing sound, it suddenly grew powerfully!</p><p></p><p>Divine Skill · Blood Mist Crimson!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Mist Crimson instantly turned into a large blood-red net, sweeping towards the purple flame dragon snake to envelop it.</p><p></p><p>The purple flame dragon snake collided with the Blood Mist Crimson!</p><p></p><p>And the Ox Demon also moved, with full firepower, the Ox Demon whose flesh and blood had fully erupted, clenched his five fingers, and the Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Rending Gold Spear suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>A shake, in an instant, countless stick shadows burst open like a peacock spreading its tail!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of tiger and leopard thunder, beating down on the purple flame dragon snake!</p><p></p><p>It actually emitted the sound of pure iron colliding, the substantial bell waves, like ripples, spreading out, and in the mysterious temple, a sudden gust of wind rose, like the turbulent waves of the sea constantly pounding the reef.</p><p></p><p>On the altar, the Awakening Ape Temple God's face was almost twisted into a pretzel.</p><p></p><p>This bastard... came again!</p><p></p><p>The stick shadows overlapped, the vibrations intertwined, the Mixed Origin Heavenly Sovereign Stick! The ultimate martial saint art, being displayed by Li Che, with the assistance of the divine skill Blood Mist Crimson.</p><p></p><p>The divine power gathered and dispersed by the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear was easily suppressed by Li Che, one stick after another constantly pounding on the head of the purple flame giant snake.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of air waves accompanied by scorching purple flames burst open.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind surged out of the mysterious temple, causing the hazy smoke outside the mysterious tower to sway involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The deep night, hazy and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yang Hao was looking at the documents, when his expression suddenly changed again.</p><p></p><p>"It's happening again? Rampaging again? This Fire-Eyed Mysterious Awakening Ape Mysterious Temple... is the temple god having an episode?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yang Hao was speechless.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it involved the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to relax either, putting down the documents in his hand, the whole person carrying a knife, appearing outside the warning line.</p><p></p><p>The other subordinates also approached, staring strangely at the turbulent hazy smoke.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, should we take action?"</p><p></p><p>One of the subordinates couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yang Hao waved his hand: "No hurry, let's just watch the situation."</p><p></p><p>"If the temple god is having a fit... it'll be fine in a while, we don't need to join the frenzy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yang Hao seemed to have gained some experience.</p><p></p><p>The other subordinates heard this and also didn't move, if they could avoid entering the hazy smoke, that would naturally be the best.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The hazy smoke in the mysterious tower began to slowly return to silence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yang Hao's mouth twitched a few times, looking at the deep and unfathomable mysterious tower, his face almost had a black line.</p><p></p><p>As expected, this mysterious temple, came up with this set again...</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be in a rampage, huh?...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The long golden red stick shook, wherever it passed, the airflow was split in two!</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound shook, as if there were fierce tigers roaring and leopards screeching, the endless surging airflow and gale seemed to be abruptly stagnant!</p><p></p><p>Boom--! Countless purple flames burst open.</p><p></p><p>The virtual space exploded, the purple flames of the giant snake were beaten and sprayed, flying across the sky of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>The purple flame giant snake was the power of the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear deified, its power was quite impressive, but it had not reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when the purple flame giant snake erupted, it was also helping Xixis to refine the weapon and body.</p><p></p><p>The power of the mythical weapon was affecting Xixis's flesh and blood! But if Li Che couldn't hold on, then this purple flame giant snake would return to Xixis's body, and the weapon refining and body tempering would be over.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Spear...</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be responding to Li Che in such a reckless manner!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Ox Demon mask, his eyes were bright, and he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Then let him help his daughter refine the weapon and body well!</p><p></p><p>Weapons... are just weapons after all!</p><p></p><p>The dragon snake charged again, Li Che clenched his five fingers, and the stick shadows instantly became dense, seemingly covering the entire sky of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Ultimate killing move! Mixed Origin One Stick! The countless stick shadows instantly disappeared, fusing into one stick.</p><p></p><p>One stick hit the purple flame giant snake, the sky was shattered by the impact, and the giant snake was also shattered by the impact!</p><p></p><p>Endless ripples and waves of impact spread out.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying wind and ripple impact waves hit the interior of the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Blowing the temple god statues on the altar to sway...</p><p></p><p>The many white candles inside the mysterious temple were all extinguished by the wind! The purple giant snake exploded and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's towering bones and muscles kept trembling, the flesh and blood body that had been reborn was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>When the ultimate move of the Mixed Origin Heavenly Sovereign Stick was unleashed...</p><p></p><p>The explosion was too strong! It directly smashed the purple flame giant snake that had condensed divine power!</p><p></p><p>After the purple flame giant snake exploded, it seemed to turn into countless flames refining Xixis's physique.</p><p></p><p>The arm that originally only contained the divine weapon has now been tempered.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xixis's whole body has been tempered!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xixi closed her eyes, and suddenly a mighty surge of energy and blood rose up from her small body!</p><p></p><p>Blood exchange... sixth stage! Xixi had directly advanced from the fifth stage of blood exchange to the first stage of energy and blood cultivation! The mysterious temple became quiet.</p><p></p><p>The white candle flame that had been extinguished suddenly flared up again with a buzzing sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood there, wrapped in a black robe, with the remaining elastic clothes supporting his powerful physique.</p><p></p><p>"It's really going to tire out this old father."</p><p></p><p>"The divine nature transformation released by this fire spear, if this old father cannot smash it, then Xixi will not be able to obtain the power of the mythological weapon for tempering..."</p><p></p><p>"This fire spear... is so annoying."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered, putting away the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Rending Gold Spear.</p><p></p><p>Xixi fell into a deep sleep, and her physique was undergoing subtle changes, with her muscles and bones gradually becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't bother to wake her up, and directly took her back to the house.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was exhausted and sleeping deeply.</p><p></p><p>Li Che placed Xixi down, covered her with a blanket, and then left the house.</p><p></p><p>He didn't lie down to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he went to the study, removed the disguise of the Ox Demon, and changed into a clean ink-black robe.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Sixth Celestial Spiritual Crystal and began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As the Grand Masters of the Golden Light Mansion and the Divine Immortal Sages increased, Li Che also gradually felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>After helping Xixi with her cultivation, Li Che couldn't let his own cultivation fall behind either.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Xixi opened her eyes sleepily and sat up from the bed, yawning widely.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at the deeply sleeping Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>"Mother is sleeping in again..."</p><p></p><p>"Mother really likes to sleep in."</p><p></p><p>Xixi shook her head like a little adult and jumped off the bed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xixi's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>She raised her arm and saw the purple flame snake spear pattern appear on her forehead. She could even feel the little spear in her arm! Moreover, Xixi could sense the spear's extremely aggrieved emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Little spear, who bullied you! Tell Big Empress Xixi, and Big Empress Xixi will punish him!"</p><p></p><p>Xixi put one hand on her waist, puffing out her little belly, speaking like a big sister.</p><p></p><p>The purple flame snake spear fire tip trembled even more, as if complaining about something.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xixi tilted her head and listened for a long time, but couldn't sense who the fire spear was complaining about.</p><p></p><p>She could only pat her chubby arm to soothe it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pushed open the door and saw the awakened Xixi.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake, go wash up, and I've brought your favorite meat buns for breakfast."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently ruffled Xixi's head.</p><p></p><p>The fire spear in Xixi's arm immediately calmed down, and Xixi, not understanding, didn't think about the fire spear's matter anymore.</p><p></p><p>She was completely captivated by the meat buns.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast, Li Che took Xixi to the Golden Light Peak to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Xixi put on a red belly warmer, a golden hoop around her neck, and tied up her Nezha braids, then was sent by Li Che to the Golden Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she arrived at the Golden Light Peak, Xixi ran around excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Even Sanguan Yin couldn't catch her.</p><p></p><p>Xixi couldn't wait to share with her little friends the amazing thing that happened while she was sleeping - completing the blood exchange.</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched Xixi's small figure leave with doting eyes.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Sanguan Yin who came to pick up Xixi, he turned around and walked away, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>His ink-black robe fluttered in the winter rain.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the rain-soaked mountain path, he headed towards the mansion city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya lazily stretched, her graceful figure faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>"My husband... has become even more powerful."</p><p></p><p>"The tempering of the bones, I can't quite bear it."</p><p></p><p>"I need to get stronger quickly."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya combed her cascading blue-black hair, her gaze soft.</p><p></p><p>After getting up and washing up, Zhang Ya went to the kitchen and saw the meat buns that Li Che had left warming for her.</p><p></p><p>They were from the small restaurant in Luohua Alley, with a delicious taste that Zhang Ya loved.</p><p></p><p>After breakfast, Old Chen had already gone to work at Zheng Lei Peak. He had found a job there and was quite content.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak now had many disciples, even forming a small town-like scale.</p><p></p><p>After getting up, Zhang Ya practiced her martial arts for a while, then changed into clean clothes, opened an oiled paper umbrella to block the drizzling winter rain, and left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>She locked the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya carried a basket, planning to go to the vegetable market to buy ingredients, so she could cook Xixi's favorite dishes in the evening when Xixi returned.</p><p></p><p>Such as braised pork, such as sweet and sour pork ribs, these were Zhang Ya's signature dishes.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya really enjoyed the current life, without worries about food and drink, with her daughter cultivating at the best Golden Light Peak, her husband having a stable job and powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya felt she was truly a winner in life.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the days three years ago, she felt a sense of being in a different world.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the couple were still struggling to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Her husband was just a porter at a wood carving shop, and she was only doing some handicraft work at a tailor's shop to supplement the household expenses.</p><p></p><p>She never imagined that her family could live such a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Branch Sect was very large, with many disciples.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak had now become a senior disciple peak, and the disciple town at the halfway point of the mountain had been expanded again.</p><p></p><p>The number of outer sect disciples gathering there was increasing.</p><p></p><p>There were even many inner sect disciples' families living in the town.</p><p></p><p>The town had all kinds of supplies to meet daily needs.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p><p></p><p>She was no longer a martial arts novice.</p><p></p><p>She had now reached the Tempering Bone realm, with her vital energy and spirit refined, and her perception quite keen.</p><p></p><p>In the way of divine nature, her talent was average, but she had cultivated her nature like a stream.</p><p></p><p>She also had the strength to be reckoned with! And today, as Zhang Ya stepped into the vegetable market... she immediately sensed something was wrong!</p><p></p><p>There was danger!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che came down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>After greeting the old caretaker, he stepped onto the blue stone road of the mansion city.</p><p></p><p>His ink-black robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering the issue of the mechanism, how to improve the Guanyin Lotus main battle tank.</p><p></p><p>The key was how to release the large amount of Guanyin Lotus missiles using the main battle tank as the carrier. If the control was not handled well, once the lotus missiles exploded, it would harm oneself, which would be counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>Inside the mansion city, it was bustling.</p><p></p><p>The winter rain fell lightly.</p><p></p><p>The patter on the rain hats made a buzzing sound, and the pedestrians hurried along, splashing water as they stepped on the puddles on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che came to Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>He planned to go to the independent workshop inside to research and cultivate, and then go to the Qin Tian Observatory to work.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped into the alley of Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>The high walls on both sides blocked the light, causing a momentary darkness to descend.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by this was the falling of divine spiritual crystal powder.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>Divine spiritual crystal powder!</p><p></p><p>Li Che stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit in his chest pounded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The celestial chessboard expanded, sensing everything within it.</p><p></p><p>The rain hat rose, and Li Che's face was expressionless, without any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were emotionless.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect... that the Hunting God Pavilion would actually target his identity.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the Ox Demon... </p><p></p><p>Not the Horse Face, not the Monkey King! But the openly upright and gentle Second-Class Envoy of the Qin Tian Observatory!</p><p></p><p>A harmless and kind Master Li! But...</p><p></p><p>Why would the Hunting God Pavilion target him?</p><p></p><p>In the shadows of Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a strange sound of surprise.</p><p></p><p>As if they had not expected Li Che to discover their hiding.</p><p></p><p>With the divine spiritual crystal powder scattered, the divine sense was obstructed, and the divine nature could not be fully utilized...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, how could Li Che sense their presence?</p><p></p><p>The cultivation level Li Che displayed was only at the Divine Foundation Initial Realm, completely suppressed by the divine spiritual crystal.</p><p></p><p>As for his martial dao cultivation, it was only at the Mysterious Vein Realm as well...</p><p></p><p>And the reason the bounty price was so high was because of Li Che's identity as the Second-Class Envoy of the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>But this identity should not have added to his strength.</p><p></p><p>Luohua Alley was a road Li Che walked every day.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the vigilance would be relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the assassin of the Hunting God Pavilion seized this moment of lowered vigilance to launch a sudden and unexpected assassination.</p><p></p><p>Assassination...</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion was professional! But unfortunately, they encountered an even more professional counterpart.</p><p></p><p>Since the identity was exposed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a semi-transparent figure seemed to slide down from one of the walls of Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>A razor-sharp black dagger, seemingly merged with the darkness, swiftly swept towards Li Che's neck.</p><p></p><p>"You are really courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Under the rain hat, the warmth in Li Che's eyes disappeared, becoming cold and ruthless, with a surging killing intent! The assassin of the Hunting God Pavilion was experienced.</p><p></p><p>The sudden attack, combined with the pre-arranged divine spiritual crystal powder, forced the target to only be able to use his martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And this assassin was a martial arts master, as well as a Divine Foundation Late Realm cultivator, immune to the divine spiritual crystal powder, still able to mobilize divine nature.</p><p></p><p>With this combination of attacks, against the Li Che who was only at the Mysterious Vein Realm according to the intelligence, it naturally presented a must-kill situation! However, the assassin suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Because in the air...</p><p></p><p>Powder had started to float again, this time it was Eight Extremes Divine Spiritual Crystal Powder, making the assassin's divine nature also suddenly unable to be used, unable to mobilize even a bit!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the divine spiritual crystal powder, various poisons and toxic powders were also floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The assassin's expression under the black iron mask changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Encountered a counterpart! In the next moment, he only felt a burning sensation in his throat, the poison was so potent?! He forcefully stepped on the ground, trying to retreat and escape!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>An oppressive force that made him unable to move, his whole body stiffening even more terribly...</p><p></p><p>Erupted from the supposedly harmless wood carving Master Li Che!</p><p></p><p>That wood carving Master...</p><p></p><p>The black robe on his body suddenly expanded, the flesh and blood constantly writhing and distorting, his stature rising, a black towering wall!

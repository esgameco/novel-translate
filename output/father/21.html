        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen held Xixia in his arms, his expression grave, but he shook his head: "Of course, it's also possible that he obtained the information from elsewhere, but this Zhao Chuanxiong seems to have some problems."</p><p></p><p>"In his position as the city's constable, this loophole could not have been so obvious, it's more like..." As Old Chen spoke, he couldn't help but squint his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Just like those followers of the Lingying Cult who leave the statue of a spirit baby at your doorstep, it's a kind of ritual..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's words made Li Che's heart suddenly heavy, and an intense murderous intent surged up within him.</p><p></p><p>Based on what Old Chen said, this Zhao Chuanxiong... might be involved with the Lingying Cult? "The constable of the government office... could also be involved with the Lingying Cult?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Old Chen suddenly laughed: "Your words... It's said that even the Prime Minister of the Great Landscape worships the Buddha, so why can't a mere constable be involved with the Lingying Cult?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Old Chen's expression became solemn: "The Lingying Cult originates from a mysterious temple... They have divine techniques, which are a great temptation for many martial cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The depth of the Lingying Cult is far greater than one can imagine."</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's heart suddenly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>"But you'll be safer staying inside Xu's woodcarving shop, these people don't dare to cause trouble here. Old Chen lives next door and will keep an eye on you at all times."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the spirit babies..." Old Chen shook his head, looking at the Xixia in his arms with some affection.</p><p></p><p>"Their spirituality is too strong, it's not a good thing... It's the source of calamity."</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow howled, raging between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood upright, gazing at the disappearing figure of Zhao Chuanxiong in the blizzard.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon-Elephant Vajra Fruit in his chest was pounding rapidly, as if with the roar of a dragon and the cry of an elephant. "Old Chen, what cultivation level does this Zhao Chuanxiong have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Holding Xixia, Old Chen was slightly taken aback, this scene seemed... familiar.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Che had asked about Sun Changbiao's cultivation level as well.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't suspect anything, after all, he had seen Li Che's own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"As the constable of the outer city, Zhao Chuanxiong's cultivation is not weak, he should be at the Tempering Bone realm, and as for his internal energy, from the brief encounter just now, he has likely reached the Third Heaven realm, making him an elite expert in the outer city."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether he cultivates divine techniques, I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's expression was grave and serious. Zhao Chuanxiong's cultivation was indeed not weak, and if he had divine techniques backing him, even Old Chen might not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly, exhaling a breath.</p><p></p><p>It seems that wanting to kill Zhao Chuanxiong immediately might be a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all this was just speculation by Old Chen and himself, so the first thing to do is to find out if Zhao Chuanxiong is actually related to the Lingying Cult.</p><p></p><p>If he is...</p><p></p><p>Then he must be killed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, having such a powerful expert constantly coveting his precious daughter Xixia would always make him feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, didn't you say you have an internal energy technique to sell? Sell me one..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the woodcarving shop, the workshop.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu had people bring the prepared wood materials for the young master of the Si family into his workshop.</p><p></p><p>It was a piece of high-quality nanmu wood, not young in age.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Li Che's cultivation was not high and he had not cultivated internal energy, Xu Beihu had already had people dry the wood with internal energy, so that Li Che could start carving it directly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the chair, taking out the pattern diagram given to him by Xu Beihu, which was the "Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping and Subduing Ghosts Picture", a complex pattern that was even more intricate than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>A one-month deadline, it was a bit rushed.</p><p></p><p>Carefully observing the pattern, the nine heads of Avalokitesvara were all in a state of sorrowful and wrathful weeping, each with a different expression, but all with a predominant sense of grief.</p><p></p><p>After looking at it for a while, Li Che even faintly felt his emotions being infected, his nose aching, as if he wanted to cry and wail.</p><p></p><p>His heart suddenly shuddered, his eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>"Divine power... divine power... truly terrifying and eerie."</p><p></p><p>As Old Chen had said, this was the most profound and terrifying divine cultivation, and Li Che now finally experienced a glimpse of it.</p><p></p><p>Patting the large block of nanmu wood on the worktable, caressing it in various places, he formed a spatial diagram in his mind, planning the proportions, measurements, and angles.</p><p></p><p>Then he took a brush and ink and began to sketch the lines on the nanmu wood.</p><p></p><p>Construct.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the form was completed, he took out the carving knife, focused his gaze, calmed his mind, and began to make the first cut.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>In a courtyard outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes were flying and drifting down from thousands of feet above, but before they could even approach Li Che's body, they were directly torn into powder by a powerful flow of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Che maintained a strange posture, his waist twisted nearly 90 degrees, his arms crossed, maintaining a unique circulation of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Around him, it seemed as if invisible air currents were rushing and roaring, surging like the tides of a great river!</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not stimulate the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], entering the state of the Golden Armor Transformation, but simply did not suppress his own cultivation, unleashing the qi, blood, and power accumulated in the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Sinew Technique of the Xu Family."</p><p></p><p>This was the sinew-opening technique Li Che had found in the market.</p><p></p><p>It belonged to the middle-grade sinew-opening techniques, better than the common lower-grade ones that weighed around 20-30 taels.</p><p></p><p>Like the Xu Family's technique, it could give him a sinew-opening method of a similar grade.</p><p></p><p>But the Xu Family naturally had even higher-quality upper-grade sinew-opening techniques, which were only for the cultivation of their own family members and could not be leaked or circulated externally.</p><p></p><p>In the external markets, they were essentially unavailable, unless a great family fell, and their cultivation techniques were leaked, otherwise, they could not be bought at all.</p><p></p><p>And an upper-grade sinew-opening technique would be worth more than a thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>This was just the sinew-opening technique, if it were followed by the bone-tempering and blood-changing techniques, the value would be even higher!</p><p></p><p>Humâ€”! The major sinews tensed, like the drawn bowstring, emitting a buzzing, exploding sound.</p><p></p><p>The entire body's skin turned scarlet red, and under the skin, a major sinew like a coiling dragon rose up, undulating and containing surging, mighty power.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the figure relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long, hot breath like fire, melting the fallen snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>"I've opened one major sinew, which is just the beginning of sinew-opening... the power is far greater than when I was just refining the skin."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Li Che's lips.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Armor (lv1, 10%)]</p><p></p><p>The prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>When the sinew-opening was successful, the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor Dao Fruit directly increased by 5%, reaching 10%!</p><p></p><p>That is to say, opening one major sinew can give a 5% increase in the maturity of the Dao Fruit, and the Xu Family's sinew-opening technique requires a total of nine sinews to be opened.</p><p></p><p>When the Dao Fruit's maturity reaches 50%, his sinew-opening will be complete! Li Che's eyes shone brightly, and his mood had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>And as long as he diligently cultivates and refines his physique every day, the maturity of the Dao Fruit can increase by 1%...</p><p></p><p>"That means, if I cultivate diligently without interruption, in forty days..."</p><p></p><p>"I can complete the sinew-opening!"</p><p></p><p>To conceal his cultivation, Li Che deliberately rented a spacious courtyard outside the shop for his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xu Family's practice ground was crowded and noisy, and Li Che really couldn't perform well there.</p><p></p><p>Stimulating the Dao Fruit, the qi and blood instantly flowed out, the skin turning scarlet, and his body undulating and growing taller, his back roaring like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the breakthrough in the Golden Armor Transformation...</p><p></p><p>"The power is even greater, about doubled. Previously, a single punch had the force of a thousand catties, and now a single punch... is probably around two thousand catties of force."</p><p></p><p>"The reaction speed and agility have also increased, with an overall doubling of enhancement."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up in a smile, and after testing, he could finally confirm that the Golden Armor Transformation was related to his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The stronger his own cultivation, the greater the enhancement from the Dao Fruit!</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand catties of force, in the Bone-Tempering realm, is considered a minor achievement, while the Great Accomplishment of Bone-Tempering is said to have five thousand catties of mighty force, and the Perfection of Bone-Tempering can reach ten thousand catties! The explosive power is extremely terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the 'Snake Internal Energy Technique' I purchased from Old Chen has also successfully cultivated a strand of internal energy... With the Dao Fruit [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], my martial arts cultivation progresses extremely quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled brilliantly, raising his hand, and in his palm, a strand of invisible energy flow was intertwined and circulating, like a small snake in a pool of water, containing powerful explosive force.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the energy flow dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, and he wrapped his burly, muscular figure in a thick robe, covering his head with a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p></p><p>He stuck a wooden carving of a cow's face mask onto his face, and instantly, his entire demeanor completely changed, becoming the notorious outlaw 'Ox Demon' that the authorities were offering a bounty for!</p><p></p><p>Murderous intent surging, an aura of malevolence.</p><p></p><p>In the snowy night, the Ox Demon walked.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

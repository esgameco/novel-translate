        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The howling winds shattered the slowly drifting snowflakes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's feet lightly touched the ground, kicking up swirls of snow dust as he fled towards the courtyard in the depths of the alley with the speed of an arrow loosed from a bow.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the courtyard gate, he forcefully bent his knees, unleashing a surge of vital energy from his body, and with a powerful leap, he soared over the high wall, standing atop it like a sharp spear.</p><p></p><p>The wind howled and wailed like a ghostly cry!</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's inner energy was circulating and overflowing through his limbs, his eyes clear and bright as he gazed into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The fragrant plum blossoms hung with snow.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the courtyard, Li Che, wearing a leather bib, was sitting in a chair, carving a wooden sculpture with a sharp knife, the wood chips fluttering down and piling up on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Shhh, shhh, shhh...</p><p></p><p>The sounds were rhythmic and soft, faintly capturing the divine essence of heaven and earth, infusing it into the wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Although the carving marks were rough, the wooden sculpture was gradually coming to life.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's brow furrowed, and the hand gripping the sword hilt slowly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>It's not him...</p><p></p><p>Li Che was still carving the divinely inspired wooden sculpture, gathering and channeling the spiritual energies of heaven and earth, a process that required a prolonged period of cultivation and tranquility of the mind.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for someone to have just committed a murder and then immediately enter such a focused state to carve a divinely inspired work.</p><p></p><p>That would be a dangerous state of mind.</p><p></p><p>But observing Li Che at this moment, he was clearly in a well-adjusted state, immersed in the carving, drawing out the elusive divine essence.</p><p></p><p>Even a master wood carver at the Jiuyao level would find it difficult to switch between states so quickly! Li Che slowly stopped his movements and turned his head, frowning slightly, seemingly displeased at being disturbed, and looked towards the figure standing atop the wall - Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>"Master Manager, it's not very appropriate for you to barge into my private workshop like this, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Heli gracefully descended from the wall, his gaze still carrying a scrutinizing air.</p><p></p><p>But... how coincidental!</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhao Xuanhai was about to abduct Li Che, he was killed by the Ox Demon right in the alley where Li Che was located...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Ox Demon had nothing to do with Li Che? Or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>Was the Ox Demon hiding within Li Che's workshop?!</p><p></p><p>"Pardon the intrusion, Master Li, but a murder has occurred in the alley - the vicious Ox Demon has appeared and killed the Divine Constable Zhao Xuanhai. As a master warrior who has attained the Refined Bone Perfection, surely you must have sensed the clash of vital energies and divine essences in the alley?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli's expression darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Xu Heli as if he were a fool, and then smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Sensed it? And then what, open the gate and go watch the show, only to be killed and silenced by that ruthless Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>That's right, with the Ox Demon's ferocity, if Li Che had dared to open the gate and peek out, that Ox Demon who loved to twist off heads would have undoubtedly torn off Li Che's head without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Che, a mere Refined Bone cultivator, resist the Ox Demon who had reached the "Tranquil as a River" realm?!</p><p></p><p>"Master Manager, if you have something to say, just say it directly."</p><p></p><p>Li Che picked up the wooden sculpture, examining it carefully, and spoke in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's indifferent attitude, Xu Heli's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xu Heli's figure and vital energy burst forth, the divine essence surging, and he vanished from the spot in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, after thoroughly searching the entire house, he returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master Manager suspects that the Ox Demon is hiding in my courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon is so vicious, I fear it may be hiding here without your knowledge, and if it harms you, that would be disastrous."</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes, looking at Xu Heli with indifference.</p><p></p><p>To search his private residence without his consent...</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli had completely disregarded him, treating him with a lofty and superior attitude, further confirming Li Che's belief that the Xu family had indeed sold him to the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai's appearance here was no coincidence either.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the dense "Suspended Thought Sword" divine essence emanating from Xu Heli, Li Che licked his lips, feeling the urge to eliminate Xu Heli and then... drain him dry.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his sleeve, his poisoned crossbow bolt was primed and ready.</p><p></p><p>After all, if you are not benevolent, then I shall not be righteous.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family did provide him shelter when he was weak, but now that you have sold me, that kindness has been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't understand why the Xu family would push out a master wood carver like himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, it should not have been like this.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew he would leave the Flying Thunder City, he did not want to make friends or invest resources, nor should he have offended the dead, right?</p><p></p><p>This was not in line with the usual style of the aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Che was hesitating whether to take action, his eyes suddenly narrowed slightly. He only felt that the [Unsullied Heart] Dao fruit in his chest was pounding violently, giving him a strong warning, making him abandon the idea of taking action.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw that on the courtyard wall, a lifelike wooden sculpture about the size of a palm had appeared, standing on the black tiles, as if it were a living person, coldly observing the scene in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli glanced at the wooden sculpture, slightly startled, and cupped his hands in a long bow.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The ancestral patriarch of the Xu family... </p><p></p><p>A Shengi cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Heli, come back, the Ox Demon is not hidden in Master Li's courtyard, go apologize to Master Li, after all, he is a great master, and our Xu family should give him the respect he deserves."</p><p></p><p>The faint voice came from the mouth of the wooden sculpture.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Xu Heli respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sculpture looked at Li Che with its eyes, which, though carved, were lifelike and seemed to be the gaze of a real person.</p><p></p><p>This craftsmanship... is extremely exquisite! Such a wooden sculpture is undoubtedly the work of a master! But what is more terrifying is the divinity that gives the wooden sculpture a vivid and lifelike presence.</p><p></p><p>And it was precisely the perception of the appearance of the wooden sculpture that made Li Che abandon the idea of taking action against Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Heli and the divine wooden sculpture leave without saying much, Li Che's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Using a divine wooden sculpture as a medium, and infusing the powerful divinity of a Shengi cultivator, is it like a manifestation of a divine avatar?"</p><p></p><p>"This should be a divine secret technique..."</p><p></p><p>"A Shengi cultivator, just a wooden sculpture containing divinity, has already put such great pressure on me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh, his heart shaken, and he became more and more aware of the Shengi cultivators.</p><p></p><p>According to the "Record of the Nine Suns Wrathful Weeping Demon Cultivation" obtained from Simo Bai, among Shengi cultivators, those of lower realms may be able to transcend their realms and fight.</p><p></p><p>But the gap between different levels is like an unbridgeable chasm.</p><p></p><p>Even if one cultivates a fourth-level divine technique, as long as it is still for cultivation, when facing a Shengi cultivator who cultivates the tenth-level divine technique, they will be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This is the so-called level suppression.</p><p></p><p>And the divine techniques that can break through the level suppression... are already the top-tier techniques in the world.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a mouthful of turbid air, Li Che rubbed the carved marks on the wooden sculpture and pursed his lips.</p><p></p><p>"The divine energy contained in that Shengi wooden sculpture must be extremely majestic, truly making me a little... envious."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes drifting.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immersed himself in carving again...</p><p></p><p>After about half an incense stick's worth of time, confirming that Xu Heli and the Shengi wooden sculpture would not return.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then got up, stretched, and his whole body cracked. Activating the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit, the chessboard intersected and enveloped the entire courtyard, confirming that there was no prying.</p><p></p><p>He then took out Zhao Xuanhai's Qiankun Jade from the Qiankun space, ready to count the harvest from killing Zhao Xuanhai this time.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Qiankun Jade, there was also Zhao Xuanhai's eight-hundred-pound精iron大刀, which had already been taken by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Infusing divine energy, the Qiankun Jade was immediately breached.</p><p></p><p>The treasures hidden inside were instantly exposed to Li Che's perception.</p><p></p><p>After carefully counting the silver notes, silver ingots, gold leaves, gold ingots, and other wealth-inducing items...</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, and after a few seconds of pulling, two golden leather notebooks fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>One was a divine technique, the other... a divine secret technique! The first one that caught his eye was:</p><p></p><p>"The Great Landscape Temple Eight Extreme Wrathful Amitabha Cultivation Method"</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the notebook, his gaze burning.</p><p></p><p>According to the common knowledge of divine cultivation, the seven-emotion divine techniques are cultivated by refining the emotions, choosing one emotion to nurture the divine nature. Too many will result in emotional instability and spiritual fragmentation...</p><p></p><p>Feeling the [Unsullied Heart] in his chest pounding, Li Che's breathing became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>"Then, can I cultivate two divine techniques at the same time?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Please continue reading, please continue reading, please continue reading, self-reflection every day, please support with monthly tickets and recommendations!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

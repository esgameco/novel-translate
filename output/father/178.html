            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The torrential rain grew increasingly fierce, as if a fierce dragon was roaring behind the clouds, with the Thunderer and the Lightning Goddess enraged and summoning the thunderbolts! A mushroom-shaped firework blooming in the human world seemed to have provoked the heavens, angering them and causing the unceasing downpour! Pitter-patter!</p><p></p><p>The rain was washing away, continuously lashing against the black-tiled eaves, the falling raindrops forming a continuous curtain of water.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>The silence was deafening, only the fierce aura of the Black-armored Blood Guards gripping their broadswords was surging, the intertwining of qi and blood, spreading a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>On the young Prince Jishuihui's delicate face, a fearful expression appeared. That dazzling mushroom-shaped firework, its terrifying explosion and tremors, even within the Marquis' Mansion, he could vaguely feel its horror! If such a mushroom firework was planted in the Marquis' Mansion...</p><p></p><p>Would he die?</p><p></p><p>Prince Jishuihui's purple pupils, like mirrors, reflected the flowing light, the bone-chilling fear permeating his entire body.</p><p></p><p>His small frame was trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a prodigy, the descendant of the Pacification King...</p><p></p><p>The dragon and martial saint bloodlines flowing within him...</p><p></p><p>But when facing true death, he was no different from an ordinary person, he too would fear, tremble, and despair...</p><p></p><p>The shock of a martial grandmaster's death was immense for the young Prince Jishuihui. After all, the grandmaster was sent by his father the King to protect him, but he was killed, reducing the means to protect his life.</p><p></p><p>The Black Shadow Guard Elder returned, glanced at the young prince, his spiritual force rippling and enveloping Jishuihui.</p><p></p><p>Jishuihui's emotions gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Shadow Guard, I lost my composure."</p><p></p><p>Jishuihui lowered his head guiltily.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, this is not your fault..."</p><p></p><p>"You are still young, you have not experienced true terror. On the martial path, willpower is most important. You need to overcome and suppress your fear, only then can you progress further on the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"As for the spiritual aspect, there is even less to worry about. Young Prince need not be concerned, with this old man here, even if that mushroom firework explodes in the Marquis' Mansion, I have the confidence to protect you completely."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Under his soothing, the young Prince Jishuihui finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then, a trace of sadness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Granduncle Duju is dead..."</p><p></p><p>His mood was somewhat low.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, he could imagine that Granduncle Duju's death was likely related to him.</p><p></p><p>"I sent Granduncle Duju to the Hunting God Hall to assassinate Li Nuanxi's parents... The Hunting God Hall's first attempt failed, and they specifically sent someone to discuss whether to continue the mission."</p><p></p><p>"But before the result of the discussion was relayed, Granduncle Duju was killed by the Divine Monkey. The location of that terrible mechanism's explosion... should be the Hunting God Hall's headquarters in the Golden Light Prefecture City."</p><p></p><p>"Granduncle Duju is dead, the Hunting God Hall destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>In Jishuihui's purple eyes, the divine light was violently fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Shadow Guard, you said..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it that Li Nuanxi's parents are so untouchable?"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder listened to Jishuihui's analysis, a trace of admiration flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the young Prince did not completely inherit the Dragon Queen Consort's stupidity from the Dragon God Clan, he still had the ability to think, more like the King. This was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>If he was like the Dragon Queen Consort, relying on his temperament to act, never using his brain...</p><p></p><p>That would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately... The King's bloodline is strong enough!</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld should be a killer organization like the Hunting God Hall, with Ox Demon, Horse Face, and Divine Monkey as its members."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Nan Li Huo went to the state capital to escort the young Prince's convoy, hiring the Ox Demon and Horse Face..."</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon first appeared in Feilei City, Li Yue's family... should have had contact with the Underworld, so they were able to hire the Underworld assassins."</p><p></p><p>"Just like Nan Li Huo, Li Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen through the nature of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Then why was the Underworld's Divine Monkey so obsessed with killing Granduncle Duju?"</p><p></p><p>Prince Jishuihui took a deep breath and asked.</p><p></p><p>Why... </p><p></p><p>Were they so obsessed with killing such an extremely difficult-to-kill grandmaster?! The Shadow Guard's aura fluctuated, recalling the Divine Monkey's reckless words outside the Marquis' Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Saying they would let them all die slowly...</p><p></p><p>"Reckless scoundrels!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder's killing intent surged, the true person's pressure from his divine essence constantly rippling.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, the task the Underworld accepted should not be just killing Xue Duju, the Underworld's target... should be the same as the Hunting God Hall, you, Young Prince!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Hunting God Hall is not as crazy as the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>"A force eager to make a name for itself, wanting to stand out, acts so lawlessly and violently!"</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld wants to make you feel the fear of having your trusted ones removed one by one!"</p><p></p><p>"Seeking attention through evil and arrogance, nothing but reckless scoundrels."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The young Prince's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of such a scene, his heart felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld dares not throw a mushroom firework in the Marquis' Mansion, if they attack the Marquis' Mansion, that would be a grave offense. At that time... the Temple Guardians, the Imperial Censorate, the Divine Guard Army, even the Divine Sect would have to take a stance."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is essentially trying to single-handedly confront the entire power of the prefecture city."</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis' Mansion is the office of an imperial official, representing the face of the court..."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder said softly: "Besides the fact that they cannot blow up the Young Prince with that mushroom bomb from this old man's hands, the Underworld also does not want to completely tear off their face with the court."</p><p></p><p>The young Prince listened thoughtfully and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, rest assured, Xue Duju must have fallen into an ambush, killed by a sneak attack. I found many different wounds on his body."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he was not cautious enough, thinking that after reaching the grandmaster realm, he would be invincible in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Xue Duju was only just at the initial stage of the grandmaster realm, the grandmaster realm is divided into three levels, each a vast distance."</p><p></p><p>"The divine qi grandmaster is only the lowest level of the grandmaster realm."</p><p></p><p>"After reaching the divine qi grandmaster realm, one needs to refine the body with divine qi, penetrate the 360 meridians of the body, and be able to draw the energy of heaven and earth with the martial will."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating to the extreme, realizing the unity of heaven and man... only then can one be considered to have stepped into the second realm of the grandmaster, the Heaven and Man Unity Grandmaster."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder explained the levels of the grandmaster realm to the young Prince.</p><p></p><p>The young Prince had vaguely heard of it before, and now listened attentively to the explanation of the grandmaster realms.</p><p></p><p>"After the second realm of the grandmaster, one has the qualifications to assault the third realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The Pinnacle Three Flowers!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Elder said softly.</p><p></p><p>The Pinnacle Three Flowers...</p><p></p><p>The young Prince felt a roar in his ears, his whole body slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"After the Pinnacle Three Flowers gather, and the five energies can be drawn into the origin, there is a chance to become the Martial Saint of the era!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Saint of the era!</p><p></p><p>Prince Jishuihui's heart was filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>He thought of his father the King, who just by standing there, seemed to be able to suppress ten thousand troops with his majestic presence.</p><p></p><p>"I must become a Martial Saint!"</p><p></p><p>"Become a person like my father the King!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I must set off a huge firework!"</p><p></p><p>"Just like Master Niu Niu!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie said seriously to the sister Yun'e next to her.</p><p></p><p>Yun'e was dumbfounded, although she admitted that Xixie looked cool when setting off fireworks...</p><p></p><p>But such a huge firework was a bit exaggerated, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Yun'e, coming from a thousand-year-old family in the Dao City, had a high vision, but today's mushroom cloud firework still shocked her.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-shaking, terrifying power, as if burning mountains and boiling seas! Even a divine essence true person would not dare to take a direct hit, right?</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Tong family's mechanism art?"</p><p></p><p>Yun'e couldn't help but have such a thought in her mind.</p><p></p><p>No wonder... </p><p></p><p>No wonder the court had to exterminate the Tong family, mastering such terrifying destructive power, it must have been a great threat to the court.</p><p></p><p>A group of children wearing red belly bands, with buns tied up and bound in red ribbons, gathered at the railing, watching the gradually fading mushroom cloud firework.</p><p></p><p>Chattering endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qing and Zhu Hongdou, the two elders, came out and pulled all the curious children back into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they returned to the main hall, Lu Che came running.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie, your mother is in trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Che's words made Xixie pause, and her face immediately turned pale: "What happened to my mother?"</p><p></p><p>"There was an assassin who tried to kill your mother, but he has been dealt with." Lu Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xixie let out a sigh of relief. She was really scared just now, if something happened to her mother, what would Xixie do?</p><p></p><p>Xixie turned and ran, going to find her shijie Sang Guanyin.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie Guanyin, Xixie's mother is in trouble, Xixie wants to go home and take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie grabbed Sang Guanyin's hand, shaking it constantly.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin heard this, gently patting Xixie's head.</p><p></p><p>Then she looked at Elder Zhang Qing.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go with her." Zhu Hongdou came over and said.</p><p></p><p>So Zhu Hongdou carried Xixie, and she and Sang Guanyin quickly left Mount Jingang and rushed towards Mount Zhenglie.</p><p></p><p>When Xixie returned to Mount Zhenglie, reaching the top, she saw her mother Zhang Ya chatting with Grandaunt Sumu.</p><p></p><p>Xixie let out a loud wail and ran to Zhang Ya, repeatedly examining her.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that Zhang Ya was fine, she then threw herself into Zhang Ya's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, it's okay, Xixie don't cry, mother is fine."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes were gentle, gently comforting her daughter.</p><p></p><p>Prodigies, in addition to their extraordinary talents, also have early maturity. </p><p></p><p>They are more mature than ordinary children of the same age.</p><p></p><p>"Where's father? Is father alright?"</p><p></p><p>Xixie asked with tear-filled eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya wiped the tears from the corners of Xixie's eyes and said gently, "Your father is fine, he is very capable, he won't have any problems."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xixie finally relaxed completely.</p><p></p><p>But she kept clinging to Zhang Ya and wouldn't let go, as if letting go would make her mother disappear.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Light Prefecture, Falling Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>The rain poured down like columns, washing and falling.</p><p></p><p>The increasingly torrential rain had accumulated a lot of water in the courtyard, the raindrops hitting the surface, creating ripples colliding with each other.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue returned to the house.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, he let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, replaying the life-and-death battle with the grandmaster Xue Duju! In this battle, he had exhausted all his tricks, all his layered killing moves... finally killing the divine qi grandmaster Xue Duju! It was indeed not easy.</p><p></p><p>The divine qi grandmaster had his five viscera and six organs refined and complete, flawless, with a peerless physical body, generating divine qi, refining a martial will, sharp and indestructible! That tenacity was terribly formidable!</p><p></p><p>"I used the Seven Emotions Divine Formation to limit Xue Duju's spiritual cultivation, so he could only rely on his martial cultivation to fight me..."</p><p></p><p>"And I further used the divine chess piece of the Golden King Temple's deity to suppress him, greatly weakening him, and Xue Duju finally met his end."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue opened his eyes, as if there was a sharp light constantly surging! In this battle, although he did not get Xue Duju's Heavenly Dao Jade, he was not without gains!</p><p></p><p>First, he had captured a grandmaster as a divine general, although unable to fully display Xue Duju's pre-death strength, it could still exert seven or eight tenths! Secondly, it was the harvest of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Battle... has always been the best stimulant for growth!</p><p></p><p>Especially for Li Yue, who possesses the peerless [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], enhancing his martial talent!</p><p></p><p>Yes, Li Yue... can be called a martial prodigy.</p><p></p><p>He took out a jade bottle and poured out a Seven Element Martial Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>Like a huge stone thrown into a lake, a muffled sound.</p><p></p><p>The pill fell into his stomach, crushed by the powerful gastric wall, the powerful medicinal properties erupting, frantically driven by the qi and blood, infusing into the four limbs and the whole body!</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes and calming his mind, he felt the lingering surges and tremors from the battle process.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this residual momentum and shock, to cleanse and refine the five viscera and six organs!</p><p></p><p>If the previous realm of the grandmaster was external refinement, then after reaching the grandmaster realm, the internal refinement...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there was also an inner refinement! Tempering the five viscera and six bowels, making the five viscera and six bowels as strong as refined iron! When reaching the realm of the Grand Master, the skin, muscles, tendons, bones, five viscera and six bowels all become extremely tough, both internally and externally, as strong and resilient as divine weapons!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! The furnace-like body was scorching hot, the whole person seemed to be a glowing hot iron, with steam billowing up, hissing and steaming.</p><p></p><p>The temperature within the small courtyard rose sharply, with rolling heat waves! A great battle allowed Li Che to gain rich experience, and the five viscera and six bowels were undergoing a powerful tempering! The profound esoteric arts of the various schools, the true essences cultivated, flowed like a spiritual dragon, washing, impacting, and refining the five viscera and six bowels.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Thunder Body, Eight Dragons Overturning the River, Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Arrows, Thousand-Hand Divine Eagle...</p><p></p><p>Except for the Lü Xuan Sword Sutra, the Nine Seals of Mechanisms, and the just-obtained Golden Roaring Tiger Spear, which had only reached the great perfection level and not yet stepped into the Grand Master level to refine the true essence.</p><p></p><p>The other four arts had all been cultivated by Li Che to the Grand Master level, refining the ultimate esoteric arts!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the three Martial Saint arts of Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, Primordial Heavenly Staff, and Thousand Mountains Solitary Blade, Li Che had not yet reached the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were Martial Saint arts, far more abstruse than ordinary Master-level arts.</p><p></p><p>And Xue Daofu's "Lone Desert Smoke Blade" art, due to Xue Daofu's attainment of the Grand Master realm, belonged to the Grand Master esoteric arts, and would be even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The true essence surged through the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, the five viscera violently pulsing, the six bowels also clamoring, as if there were dragons and elephants roaring within!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood gushed forth like mist, forming dragon and elephant forms outside Li Che's body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly opening his eyes, there seemed to be two blazing flames burning within.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his five fingers, and the airflow in the room was instantly crushed!</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (LV4, 20%)】</p><p></p><p>Killing the Grand Master Xue Daofu directly raised the maturity from 5% to 20%, a 15% increase in one go.</p><p></p><p>Truthfully, at the LV4 level of Dao Fruit, the rate of improvement is very slow.</p><p></p><p>However, the harvest and improvement brought by killing a Grand Master is abundant.</p><p></p><p>This was the biggest gain in this battle for Li Che!</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the 【Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra】 Dao Fruit hummed, as if the dragon and elephant were roaring in unison...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's ears burst open, as if divinely assisted, his mind becoming incredibly clear! It was as if at this moment, he entered an extremely lucid state! The martial dao insights also felt like they were rapidly elevated...</p><p></p><p>Just like the feeling when the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao Fruit advanced to LV4! Li Che's body shot out, crimson like hot iron, and began to practice martial arts in the courtyard. Pouring rain fell, hissing and rolling with heat waves!</p><p></p><p>Cultivating and practicing martial arts can improve the maturity of the Dao Fruit, and the rising maturity of the Dao Fruit can also reciprocally assist Li Che's cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fingers, a divine weapon sword slid into his hand, the seven-element top-grade 【Lü Xuan Ice Yang Sword】, obtained from the elder Xu Jiuqing! Cultivating the Lü Xuan Sword Sutra, a Master-level esoteric art! The sword light surged, dense and numerous, accompanied by Li Che's sword swings, the resplendent sword chants exploding in the courtyard!</p><p></p><p>Like a thousand, ten thousand pear blossoms blooming!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent self-generated, the silver light dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Brilliantly dazzling to the extreme!</p><p></p><p>The Lü Xuan Sword Sutra, entering the Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were resplendent, the flesh and blood of his brow's Mud Pill opening, his star-gazing pupils also brilliantly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Piercing Gold Spear in hand, for spearmanship, Li Che also had his own understanding, the spear moving, like a fierce tiger roaring! A keen golden light burst from the spear head, the metal elemental force of the five elements!</p><p></p><p>One of the forces of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Metal, wood, fire, water, and earth, the five great sects' esoteric arts each occupy one element.</p><p></p><p>With Li Che's current insights, grasping this metal elemental force was not difficult!</p><p></p><p>Tearing!</p><p></p><p>One spear strike, like a colorful giant insect pouncing and biting!</p><p></p><p>The air even exploded into a hollow, with raging airflows scattering in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Golden Roaring Tiger Spear... Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>Although he had just obtained it, Li Che already had his own understanding of spearmanship, and was able to wield it extremely well.</p><p></p><p>One martial art after another was pushed by Li Che to the Grand Master realm!</p><p></p><p>The true essence emerged, consumed by the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, and fused into this esoteric art he had created himself! Li Che's furnace-like body became even brighter, like a resplendent great sun! Numerous esoteric arts' true essences were intertwined upon it!</p><p></p><p>Fusing into the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, repeatedly washing the five viscera and six bowels!</p><p></p><p>Causing the five viscera and six bowels to become increasingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation at the post-Master realm was still rising! Li Che now only lacked cultivating one Martial Saint art to the Grand Master level, comprehending the Martial Saint true essence, and fusing it into the Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, to refine the five viscera and six bowels one last time! Then he could have the flawless, balanced inner and outer physique, and give birth to the divine might that only Grand Masters can possess! And now, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could be called a Half-Step Grand Master! Li Che's mind stirred, the Heavenly Earth Chessboard enveloped and expanded, shielding his perception.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Flicking a finger, a black light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Bind Spirit!</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's form as a spirit general immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed, tearing open the void space, and tossed the Crescent Moon Blade to Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's lifeless eyes, in the moment of grasping the Crescent Moon Blade, wavered a bit, then his eyes showed a look of conflict and struggle.</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fighting spirit burned, but his eyes now brightened! "The humble servant... pays respects to the lord!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's lifeless spirit general body saluted with clasped hands, his hoarse voice echoing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Self-awareness?! Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>This Bind Spirit is indeed interesting! Without further words, Li Che's Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound Spear ruthlessly struck out.</p><p></p><p>Wind and thunder accompanied the moving sound, the spear thrusting like a flowing star! Xue Daofu, upon receiving the order, charged with the blade!</p><p></p><p>A professional Grand Master, online for battle.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was drenched in sweat, extremely refreshed, his pores fully opened, his spirit exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>The dark-colored Xue Daofu, holding the Crescent Moon Blade, stood quietly, awaiting orders.</p><p></p><p>Li Che waved a hand, and bound Xue Daofu again.</p><p></p><p>Back in the room.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave, the Avatar Li Che clones nimbly emerged, each taking the divine spiritual crystals Li Che handed over, and began to sit cross-legged in front of their corresponding wooden sculptures, starting to observe the spirits.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat on the floor, took out the precious Six Dao Spiritual Realm, and began to refine and absorb.</p><p></p><p>Also, dual-wielding.</p><p></p><p>【Dao Fruit: Chess Saint (LV3, 75%), Painting Immortal (LV2, 15%)】</p><p></p><p>The prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed, this battle with Xue Daofu, opening the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, shielding various perceptions, brought considerable improvement.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, absorbing the divine spirituality from Xue Daofu also brought improvement.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, it had already reached 75%, and Li Che would also use the Heavenly Earth Chessboard in his daily cultivation, which was a gradual improvement.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll be able to break through to LV4 soon..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite looking forward to the transformation of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit, the nascent divine ability 【Great Snow Collapse】 of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit had brought him no small help.</p><p></p><p>The Avalanche Lotus Bullet was all created based on the 【Great Snow Collapse】.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che naturally looked forward to the transformation of the Chess Saint Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>What kind of divine abilities would it give birth to! The 【Painting Immortal】 Dao Fruit, similar to the 【Chess Saint】 Dao Fruit, was also constantly being catalyzed daily, with the maturity rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>It just didn't have the means to accelerate the transformation like the Immortal Craftsman and Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra.</p><p></p><p>Slowly calming his mind.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered a state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Late at night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went out of the alley, picked up some packed meals from a small restaurant, and then returned to Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was empty, Zhang Ya should still be in Li Qingshan's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che directly took the packed meals and went to Li Qingshan's residence.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che entered, he heard a bursting shout! Xixia directly rushed into the rain, pitter-patter, stepping on a series of splashes, rushing towards Li Che at high speed.</p><p></p><p>She threw herself into Li Che's arms.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hugged her, circulating his qi and blood to evaporate the moisture, and rubbed her head.</p><p></p><p>"Father is fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said gently.</p><p></p><p>Xixia didn't believe it, circling around Li Che for a while, and only after confirming that Li Che was fine did she heave a sigh of relief, acting like a little adult.</p><p></p><p>Holding Xixia, opening the rain curtain, walking to the doorway where his wife Zhang Ya was leaning, Li Che had one arm around Xixia and the other around his wife Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, we're all fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's voice was warm and firm.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya nodded.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su leaned on her python-headed cane, looking at the warm and harmonious scene of Li Che's little family, and couldn't help but have a look of envy in her cloudy eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the passage of time had left its mark, she had aged too much, and she had already lost the ability to bear children.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan appeared, he didn't know when, and took Grandma Su's hand.</p><p></p><p>Without any words, just a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>Just like the two of them who had plunged into the jianghu in the past.</p><p></p><p>After being affectionate with his wife and daughter for a while, Li Che started to prepare dinner.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that there was food, Xixia perked up, climbing up on the table in a familiar manner, waiting for the dishes to be served.</p><p></p><p>Not long after they started eating, Nan Lihuang and Wang Daoren also came.</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoren brought the two genius children, Xiao Pang and Yun'e.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang brought Lü Chi back.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Qingshan's courtyard became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang was obviously in a great mood, after all, the arrogant Grand Master Xue Daofu had been killed.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally happy.</p><p></p><p>He even took out some precious wine.</p><p></p><p>After the meal and drinks.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuang and Wang Daoren expressed that they would reside at Zheng Lei Peak for the next period of time, to ensure the safety of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>This was also to provide a safety net for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, everyone left.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan then called Li Che to the study.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shielded the detection, his eyes finally flashing with brilliance, staring at Li Che with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"You little fellow..."</p><p></p><p>"You... you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan took a deep breath, the shock in his heart finally erupting.</p><p></p><p>"You summoned Horse Face and Monkey King, and killed the martial dao Grand Master Xue Daofu?!"</p><p></p><p>"And... the matter of the Observation Tide Pavilion being the base of the Hunting Spirit Pavilion, was also discovered by you? You directly crushed the Observation Tide Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Horse Face excels at long-range assassination.</p><p></p><p>Monkey King is recklessly arrogant, but to single-handedly fight a Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>Only Ox Demon is the most skilled in mechanisms! That mushroom cloud firework that shook the entire Golden Light City, the great killing weapon...</p><p></p><p>It came from Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>From the young man in front of him...</p><p></p><p>The unassuming youth! Li Che looked at the astonished Li Qingshan, smiled gently, and didn't deny it, but openly admitted, "Xue Daofu was indeed killed in an attack, and as for the Hunting Spirit Pavilion... I took on a mission, they tried to assassinate me and Zhang Ya, I couldn't ignore it, and besides... the Hunting Spirit Pavilion was also competing with the underworld for business, so I just crushed them."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sucked in a breath of air!</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the 21-year-old spiritual child he had tested in Flying Thunder City, after a few years...</p><p></p><p>could actually have such a fierce mentality!</p><p></p><p>So this is the power of the great killing weapon? "I just crushed them"...</p><p></p><p>That's the fucking Hunting Spirit Pavilion, the number one assassin organization in the world!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon... your Ox Demon is really powerful!</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the terrifying mushroom cloud firework that Li Che commands, it does seem to have the capital to be powerful...</p><p></p><p>Mechanism Master... each one of them is so terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was also shocked by the heroic spirit Li Che inadvertently revealed.</p><p></p><p>The underworld, perhaps really more powerful than he had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan rubbed his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, I don't know if the underworld is still recruiting? I'm also a member of the underworld now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was really anxious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had played without him many times!</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Qingshan and said seriously, "Joining the underworld is very dangerous..."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I like excitement!" Li Qingshan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled at this.</p><p></p><p>Then he narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>And uttered a phrase that sounded familiar to Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"Cat Face, there's a great fortune cooperation... I wonder if you're interested?"</p>

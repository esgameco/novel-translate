        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Father, Xixia doesn't want to go to the academy, Xixia wants to play with the scooter!"</p><p></p><p>"Mother, save me, Father is going to take Xixia away!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Early morning.</p><p></p><p>After sending the wailing Xixia, who was reluctant to go and wanted to play with the scooter, and the silent Lü Chi to the Shenxiu Temple, Li Che came to the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The hot furnace boiled the water, with a rising heat enveloping the room.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was holding white paper, brushing and writing on it.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit and had reached level 3, making the "Namo Barrett" was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Wood Raven was mainly good at explosions, and explosions were not a problem. But the penetrating power was the key to the Namo Barrett.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the theory was naturally different from the Barrett of the previous life, and many things needed to be changed. Li Che felt that divine power was the key, so he still needed to explore, which was also the arrangement for the next mechanism research.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit gave him great help in his skills, making it possible for him to realize this idea.</p><p></p><p>The cold clouds on the water did not flow, and the snowflakes blew on the brocade robe.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, the wind and snow became more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of Zhao Xuanhai's death, the fierce reputation of the Ox Demon once again resounded throughout Feilei City, and the streets of the city became much quieter.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon had gone mad, actually attacking the Divine Constable...</p><p></p><p>Rumors instantly swept through the city, and the reputation of the Ox Demon's cruelty spread to many people's ears.</p><p></p><p>Those who originally saw the Ox Demon as a hero, when chatting idly in the restaurants and teahouses, also became speechless.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon killed the official, and it was even the Divine Constable...</p><p></p><p>Could he still be called a hero?</p><p></p><p>But because of the Ox Demon's reputation for cruelty, many people in the inner city became more low-key in their actions.</p><p></p><p>The rumor was that the Divine Constable Zhao Xuanhai was killed by the ferocious Ox Demon just because he spat on the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>This made many scions of wealthy and noble families much more well-behaved when going out, not even daring to spit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not know that the reputation of the Ox Demon had suddenly become so foul under the instigation of those with ulterior motives, and that he was once called a hero, but now the Ox Demon's reputation was only slightly better than that of a flower thief.</p><p></p><p>But even if he knew, he wouldn't care. He had never thought that the Ox Demon Uncle was a good person or a hero.</p><p></p><p>It's too tiring to be a good person and a hero...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was just a hidden identity of Li Che, used to clear away some threats to protect his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>In such a chaotic world, Li Che only wanted his family to live well. </p><p></p><p>So whoever wanted to harm his wife and daughter, the Ox Demon Uncle would kill them! It had nothing to do with good or bad, only life and death!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Rolling thunders rolled in the black clouds, accompanied by raindrops and snowflakes pouring down from the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the courtyard, and the sudden rain and snow caught him off guard, but he no longer cared.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a light screen gradually unfolded before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Name: Li Che]</p><p>[Bonds: Li Nuan Xi (daughter)]</p><p>[Dao Fruits: Immortal Craftsman (lv3, 20%), Dragon Elephant Golden Armor (lv2, 55%), Unsullied Heart (lv1, 50%), Chess Sage (lv1, 10%)]</p><p>[Nascent Divine Power: Immortal Craftsman · Thousand Analytical Hands]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>His gaze reflected the radiant light, looking at the overall improved maturity of the Dao fruits, and the corners of his lips curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>In these days, he had been immersed in the research of the "Namo Barrett", coupled with the completion of the mechanism [Bodhi Tears of Blood], which had suddenly caused a great improvement in his Immortal Craftsman.</p><p></p><p>"The [Blood Red Essence Wood] is not easy to find... Fortunately, I successfully made the [Bodhi Tears of Blood] in one try."</p><p></p><p>He secretly looked forward to it, not knowing how powerful this [Bodhi Tears of Blood], which ranked before the Wood Raven among the secret weapons, would be! Since he only made one, Li Che had not tested it yet.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the improvement of Immortal Craftsman, the maturity of the second divine cultivation method, [Unsullied Heart], suddenly soared to 50%, which surprised Li Che a lot.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what surprised Li Che even more was [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor], which broke through the bottleneck of 50%, making his martial arts cultivation more solid.</p><p></p><p>Even the mid-level cultivation method he practiced earlier to strengthen his physique had made up for the deficiencies and reached an advanced level, making his physical body tend towards perfection.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Turnings of Blood Transformation had reached the Great Perfection, with the qi now born from the blood and circulating throughout the muscles and bones.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>A faint sound rang out, and Li Che suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He saw a stooped old man floating into the courtyard, stepping on the snow like a flying wild goose, with a touch of artistic conception.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was the cultivator Li Qingshan from the Qianyuan Shenzong.</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful was this Li Qingshan? Li Che could not fathom it at all...</p><p></p><p>But he was definitely not weaker than a Shen Basis cultivator, after all, that Shen Basis Patriarch of the Si Clan was defeated by this person.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the Nine Turnings of Blood Replenishment, your qi and blood are thick and rich, flowing like quicksilver. Your foundation is extremely solid. I thought you would still need a month or two... To reach this realm in just three years of cultivation, you are truly a martial arts prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan floated down to the eaves, took a sip of hot tea, exhaled a breath of hot air, and stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite smart, knowing to solidify your foundation before attempting to unblock your meridians."</p><p></p><p>"Although the pursuit of all things divine is the goal of divine cultivators, any powerful divine cultivator must balance both their divine nature and their qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>"Tempering the martial dao, strengthening the physical body, can allow one to withstand the surging divine power, allowing one's divine cultivation to advance further."</p><p></p><p>"If the divine cultivation is the same, the one stronger in the martial dao will have the advantage in confrontation and spellcasting."</p><p></p><p>"There are some divine cultivators who focus more on the martial dao, like the Warsaint Vassal King 'Ji Moli' of the Great Jing Dynasty, whose battle prowess is terrifying, unmatched by his peers at the same realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the divine realm is still the most important."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback, not expecting to hear such views.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan continued sipping his tea, chewing on a tea leaf, savoring it.</p><p></p><p>"For Shen Basis cultivators... their qi and blood cultivation has basically all opened their mysterious meridians. Attempting to break through to the Shen Basis without having opened the mysterious meridians will fail nine times out of ten, damaging their divine nature, and they will be stuck cultivating their nature for life."</p><p></p><p>"Among all the nature-cultivating cultivators in Feiluo City, those who can steadily establish the Shen Basis are basically non-existent. Figures like Xu Heli and An Ruosu, the young masters of Feiluo, their qi and blood cultivation has only just entered the Qi Meridians, their chances of reaching the Shen Basis are extremely slim."</p><p></p><p>"Because their talent in qi and blood cultivation is not enough, cultivating both nature and martial dao, that they've reached their current heights is already them exerting their utmost."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>Recalling guiding Xixie in her martial training, the little girl's sporadic efforts...</p><p></p><p>Projecting himself as a parent, anxious for his child's future.</p><p></p><p>"Then Xixie..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled lightly: "Don't worry, Xixie has entered Shenzong, and she's different from those young masters of the small city clans. Shenzong has specialized qi and blood elixirs that can rapidly enhance one's qi and blood..."</p><p></p><p>"Those elixirs are secret techniques obtained by Shenzong after plundering the Mysterious Temple, they are Shenzong's foundation. Each major Shenzong has their own foundation elixirs..."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the Great Jing Dynasty also has them. If you enter the Jing Temple Mansion, you can naturally obtain them. The small clans of Feiluo City cannot get them."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan revealed many hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but held back.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan waved his hand: "You have not yet entered Shenzong, so I cannot give you those elixirs..."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can teach you the Small Heaven Meridian Cultivation Method. Although you have your own opportunities and obtained that secret martial technique that can explosively enhance your qi and blood, that kind of strength increase is like a floating cloud without roots, and cannot be used to establish the Shen Basis..."</p><p></p><p>"And using that explosion technique too often will damage your foundation. You should avoid using it if possible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained silent, not mentioning that activating the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] would not cause any damage.</p><p></p><p>He pursed his lips and changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, can you easily impart this technique to me even though I have not entered Shenzong?"</p><p></p><p>"This is nothing... The Small Heaven Meridian Cultivation Method is just ordinary, even outer sect disciples can learn it. Passing it to you is not a big deal. The subsequent Mysterious Meridian Method and Divine Meridian Method... are more precious, those can only be obtained by entering the inner sect."</p><p></p><p>The old man chuckled lightly, then flicked his finger, and a sheet of paper flew towards Li Che like a thrown knife.</p><p></p><p>Li Che skillfully caught the paper, feeling his qi and blood surging unceasingly, greatly surprised by the old man's strength.</p><p></p><p>Despite his frail appearance, he must possess a terrifying power like a dragon or tiger.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze fell on the paper.</p><p></p><p>[The Small Heaven Meridian Cultivation Method of the Qianyuan Shenzong]</p><p></p><p>"Small Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qingshan did not explain further, instead furrowing his brow: "Someone is coming, it should be from the City Lord's Mansion... Hmm, it's also a Shen Basis cultivator... Old man shall take his leave first."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, no matter martial dao or divine cultivation, the strength of your own cultivation is the foundation."</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to take you to the Mysterious Temple today to observe the temple deity, since I've passed you the Small Heaven Meridian Cultivation Method, come to the outskirts in three days if you've opened your meridians..."</p><p></p><p>"If you fail to open your meridians, then there's no need to come."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Qingshan vanished in an instant, leaving only the rippling tea in the quietly placed teacup.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>In the snowy alley...</p><p></p><p>Footsteps were approaching.</p><p></p><p>And they were getting more and more hurried.</p>

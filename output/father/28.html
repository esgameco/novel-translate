        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The intense killing intent, almost solidifying into a tangible form, was swirling amidst the wind and snow, rushing towards them with a howling force!</p><p></p><p>Who...who is this?</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan's expression changed drastically, and just as she was about to add more charcoal, her movement suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>The entire courtyard was instantly shrouded in an aura of cold ruthlessness, and countless snowflakes exploded in midair.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood atop the false mountain, his eyes behind the mask indifferent and cold.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The guard dispatched by the Si family to protect Lei Chunlan had been sitting in the snowy pavilion, eyes closed, resting. </p><p></p><p>The moment he sensed the killing intent emanating from Li Che, he immediately opened his eyes, his heart filled with trepidation, as if he never imagined someone would dare to commit a crime within the Jin Huang Hall.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, he swiftly drew the long saber at his waist, his body springing forth, braving the wind and snow to face the towering figure standing on the false mountain.</p><p></p><p>That ox-faced mask, coupled with the overwhelming killing intent, exuded an eerie aura!</p><p></p><p>"Audacious thief! How dare you commit a crime within the Jin Huang Hall, when this person is a guest of the Si family. Depart now, and the Si family will not pursue this matter further!"</p><p></p><p>The guard, with his upright bearing and gripping the long saber, had his qi and blood intertwined, his powerful sinews trembling and resonating - he was a guard who had fully opened his meridians.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the guard indifferently... Fully opened meridians? With a light step of his toes, he floated down, landing on the snowy courtyard without leaving any footprints on the snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a heavy step forward, and the face beneath the hat suddenly lifted, his cold, indifferent eyes fixed on the guard who had drawn his saber.</p><p></p><p>The guard's heart raced, his mouth opening as if to say something, but the raging airflow had already struck his face with tremendous force! He could not utter a single word, as the overwhelming pressure came crashing down on him. Li Che's speed was too fast - the moment his foot touched the ground, the snow within several meters was sent flying up! The pressure of his qi and blood descended like a fierce dragon.</p><p></p><p>The guard had just swung his saber when he saw a fist, like lightning, thrusting straight at him!</p><p></p><p>That broad-shouldered, towering ox-like figure, with a single punch, unleashed an explosive internal force - like a white tiger in the snow, or a venomous snake spitting venom! Clang!</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, and the long saber was instantly knocked away. The overwhelming force struck the guard's chest like a whip, causing him to cough up a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"Tempered...bone..."</p><p></p><p>The guard's eyes widened in shock.</p><p></p><p>As a guard of the Si family, his skills were not weak, and even if he had truly tempered his bones, he should have been able to hold his ground for a while...</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was instantly killed by the figure before him...</p><p></p><p>Fully tempered bones!</p><p></p><p>Releasing his force, the guard's limbs and bones shattered, and his body was sent flying back.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che took a step forward, his speed even faster, catching up to the guard. Hooking and yanking with his five fingers...</p><p></p><p>The guard's eyes narrowed, and he saw the hazy snowstorm in front of him suddenly split in two by a sharp force.</p><p></p><p>A silent ripping sound, the air exploded! Hot blood sprayed onto the snowy ground as the guard realized his body had been cut in half, the remaining half falling to the ground, his eyes losing their luster.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps you were only trying to fulfill your duty as a guard, but since you stood in his way, to protect her... then you must die.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's figure instantly vanished, leaving no trace as he stepped on the snow and leapt into the eaves.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened so quickly, from Li Che's attack to the guard's defeat and being cut in half...</p><p></p><p>It was all over in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked to the eaves as if strolling in a garden.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan had just turned around, about to flee into the room.</p><p></p><p>Poof, poof, poof! Two wooden crossbow bolts whistled through the air, instantly piercing Lei Chunlan's knees, causing her to collapse on the ground, blood pooling around her.</p><p></p><p>"You... Ah... You..."</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan's face was ashen, filled with terror and despair.</p><p></p><p>Although she had joined the Ling Ying Sect, she was just an ordinary old woman, with no cultivation to speak of...</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming, towering pressure, accompanied by a gale of force, bore down on her mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan was drenched in cold sweat, unable to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Spare me... Please spare me, sir..."</p><p></p><p>"I... I'm just an old woman, just a frail old body..."</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan lay on the ground, utterly hopeless and miserable.</p><p></p><p>Just moments ago, she had been dreaming of a wonderful life as a superior being, but now she found herself in a tragic situation where her life was no longer in her own hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ups and downs of life are nothing new.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at her indifferently, without a trace of sympathy. When she killed those children, did she not have a moment of softness in her heart? When she set her sights on Xixia, had she ever felt any compassion?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>That Lei Chunlian's eyes flashed with ferocity. She pulled out a palm-sized, blood-stained wooden figurine of a spirit infant from her bosom and hurled it at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Protector will shield me!" The wooden figurine flew towards Li Che, not particularly fast.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could have easily evaded it with a slight sidestep.</p><p></p><p>But the floating wooden figurine suddenly sprang to life, its eyes wide open, glaring furiously at Li Che!</p><p></p><p>A surge of intense anger suddenly welled up in Li Che's heart, like an uncontrollable fire that threatened to engulf his mind and consciousness!</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was startled.</p><p></p><p>This wooden figurine contained spiritual power and possessed offensive might! Goodness, this Lei Chunlian... was so highly valued in the Infant Cult?</p><p></p><p>An ordinary woman, yet she still harbored such formidable abilities! Hum—</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor [Dao Fruit] trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a divine dragon roared and a demonic elephant screeched! The nameless fury that had arisen in his mind was instantly dispelled, and everything returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes regained their clarity and brilliance. Facing the wooden figurine, he raised his hand, and the exposed skin on his arm turned as white as jade, with a jade-colored mist gushing out from his pores.</p><p></p><p>The nascent form of a divine technique... the Immortal Craftsman's Thousand Slashes! Li Che firmly grasped the wooden figurine.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the spiritual power! Li Che felt a scorching heat in his palm, and the spiritual power contained within the wooden figurine of the spirit infant was completely drained by his arm!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The wooden figurine exploded, shattering into countless wooden fragments!</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlian stood there, dumbfounded...</p><p></p><p>That was a life-saving item given to her by the Dharma Master. She had sacrificed so many infant lives to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Master had said that even a seasoned martial artist could be dealt with by this wooden figurine.</p><p></p><p>But now, the wooden figurine bestowed by the Dharma Master had been ruthlessly crushed.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlian was in despair.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to beg for mercy, but the alert Li Che, fearing she might have other tricks up her sleeve, shot three consecutive bolts from his sleeve crossbow at her head, piercing her through.</p><p></p><p>There was no time to savor the taste of the spiritual power. Li Che knew he had to make a quick escape.</p><p></p><p>The inner city was different from the outer city, with many powerful experts, including terrifying cultivators from prominent families who had broken through the Blood Transformation realm and even reached the Meridian Cultivation stage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most formidable were those cultivators from prominent families who had cultivated spiritual power...</p><p></p><p>He took out a crumpled wanted poster from his bosom, which had already been withdrawn by the authorities, regarding Lei Chunlian.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Lei Chunlian's lifeless body,</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a sense of relief in his heart, as the worries that had plagued him for so long had finally subsided, albeit temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew this matter was not over, and that killing Lei Chunlian did not mean Xixia was completely safe.</p><p></p><p>The Infant Cult, the Dharma Master...</p><p></p><p>They still hung like a sharp blade over his head, making him restless.</p><p></p><p>But at least, by killing Lei Chunlian, Li Che could breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Tossing the wanted poster aside, Li Che shot a wooden arrow from his sleeve crossbow, pinning the poster to Lei Chunlian's body, the fresh blood staining the paper, as if it were tainted by her sins.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The white curtains swayed in the gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>司慕白, who had just cultivated spiritual power, was in a good mood, chatting about the topic of spiritual power with Xu Beihu over tea, feeling quite content.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu conversed with司慕白 for a while, then stood up, intending to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A figure swiftly darted in and appeared beside 司慕白.</p><p></p><p>It was one of 司慕白's guardians, a powerful martial artist who had broken through the Blood Transformation realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this martial artist's expression was somewhat strange, his brow furrowed, with a hint of unease and worry.</p><p></p><p>司慕白 glanced at him, "What's the matter... why are you so anxious, where are your manners?"</p><p></p><p>This powerful Blood Transformation martial artist looked at 司慕白 and spoke in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master... Lei Chunlian is dead."</p><p></p><p>司慕白 paused, the teacup he had just brought to his lips now frozen in place.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The book will be released at exactly 12 noon tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>I would like to thank my editor, Yexiao Dada, who has been with me for 8 years. Thank you for not giving up on Old Li, even though he has published so many books, and for providing valuable suggestions for each book...</p><p></p><p>Originally, Old Li was planning to release the book at midnight tonight, but since he didn't have any pre-written content, he had to delay it to tomorrow. He stayed up late tonight to write the content, luckily... Even after having a child, Old Li has been staying up late to write.</p><p></p><p>I'd like to express my feelings next. After failing to publish several books, I'm finally able to release a new one, and with everyone's efforts, it even reached the top three on the recommendation list. Although I lost the competition once, it's still a rare achievement. Old Li bows to everyone!  As I've mentioned before, since I've failed so many times, this fantasy novel is planned to be my last work before retiring.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the initial performance of this book was quite poor. On the first day of recommendation, it only had less than 200 collections, and the backend conversion rate was only 19‰, while the average for recommended works is around 35‰...</p><p></p><p>But at least it's better than my previous books, which only had a few dozen collections per day on the recommendation list. That's why I persisted in writing.  Later, it gradually picked up.</p><p></p><p>With my promotion, it was pushed to the top three recommendation list... Although the effect of the top three is so-so, it's still considered an honor.</p><p></p><p>As for the final strong recommendation in the new book period, the editor said the prospects are good, so they decided to release it.</p><p></p><p>After writing for so many years, this is not the first time I've released a book. But I'm still very nervous this time.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the moment to test the results of the new book period. How many pre-orders can I get?</p><p></p><p>The new book is 210,000 words long before release. I'm considered a long writer. As for the backend fake reading, it's 3,800, and the real reading, the editor said, is 2,400. I have no idea whether I can get 2,000 pre-orders, because the current starting point... is too difficult, too mysterious, I can't understand it at all...</p><p></p><p>So, I can only hope that everyone will give me some support when the book is released.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pre-order is up, please support it... Let us have a chance to peek at the recommendations after it goes live. Nowadays, the recommendations after going live are also a competition, they look at the pre-order data, not the author's face.</p><p></p><p>It's really difficult to write on Qidian now, in the past half year, the income couldn't cover the expenses, it's like being unemployed for half a year, Old Li can only rely on this book to try and earn some milk powder money for the 3-year-old child at home.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he doesn't have too high ambitions for this book anymore, now he just wants to finish writing it properly. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>After all, this is the last fantasy novel that Old Li is writing.</p><p></p><p>The target is 3 million words, finishing this book will be a victory!</p><p></p><p>As for the updates after it goes live, let me explain briefly... It will be 10,000 words per day.</p><p></p><p>As for if you guys want more, that will depend on the monthly votes. For every additional 500 monthly votes, we'll add one more update, simple and straightforward...</p><p></p><p>Old Li used to be an octopus type, the highest he's written in a month was over 50 thousand words, so don't worry, just keep following.</p><p></p><p>For this book, Old Li's goal is to finish writing it, complete it entirely.</p><p></p><p>The night rain in the jianghu for ten years, from being a foodie in 2016, to now in 2024, eight years have passed, it's not far from the ten years mark...</p><p></p><p>I don't know how much longer I can write, but as long as I'm still writing, I will strive to do so.</p><p></p><p>I won't say too much.</p><p></p><p>It will go live at 12 noon tomorrow, I only ask that you all come support the pre-order, support Old Li, so that I can catch a glimpse of the recommendations after going live.</p><p></p><p>Old Li can only repay you all by releasing more chapters! No more nonsense, gotta get back to typing, I'll pull an all-nighter tonight, charge forward tomorrow! Lastly, please subscribe! Old Li will kowtow to you all! Boom boom boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Begging for subscriptions, monthly votes, recommendation votes! Begging for your passionate reading!</p><p></p><p>See you tomorrow! Be sure to come!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

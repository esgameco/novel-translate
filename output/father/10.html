        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che gripped the wooden figurine of the spirit infant, his gaze flickering with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had set their sights on him and produced this eerie wooden spirit infant figurine as a mark, Li Che naturally dared not take the risk. What if he went out to work, and the other party forcefully broke into his humble abode and attacked? He would surely regret it then.</p><p></p><p>"The safest place... would naturally be the woodcarving workshop!"</p><p></p><p>"I am now a master woodcarver, with my own workshop. I can have Xixia and Xiaoye stay at my workshop..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, stable and safe!"</p><p></p><p>After making this steady and secure plan, Li Che called his wife Zhang Ya to wake up.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you were too exhausting last night, pent up for too long, weren't you..." Zhang Ya's fair face flushed slightly, and her gaze at Li Che seemed to be brimming with water.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and gently ruffled his wife's disheveled hair.</p><p></p><p>"My lady, pack up and bring Xixia, and come with me to the woodcarving workshop... Stay with me at work these two days."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was momentarily stunned, go to the woodcarving workshop and work together? "My lord, today is your first day as a woodcarving master... Is it really appropriate for me and Xixia to come along? Won't it displease the shopkeeper?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head: "No, it won't. The workshop is the private space of the woodcarving master, and it's fine for family members to stay there. Besides, I'll explain it to the shopkeeper."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Ya no longer said anything, and began to pack up, bringing the wide-eyed Xixia who was playing on the bed.</p><p></p><p>After carefully bundling up Xixia, the family set out towards Xu's Woodcarving Workshop, braving the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che protected his wife and daughter, the biting wind howling as he tightened the cotton coat around his wife, wrapping Xixia to shield her from the cold.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Che's peripheral vision constantly scanned the surroundings, his heart highly alert.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her husband's manner, Zhang Ya's heart suddenly chilled, knowing that something must have happened, but since Li Che didn't say anything, she didn't ask either, only silently worrying in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The couple, with their child, crossed the snow-covered cobblestone street.</p><p></p><p>"The holy spirit teaches, cleansing the mundane, the law of reincarnation without worry..."</p><p></p><p>"It takes great wisdom to succeed without being taught..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of ringing bells and beating drums echoed, as the procession of the Spirit Infant Cult, with their captivating chants, approached from the distance.</p><p></p><p>On the raised platform, the three-headed, six-armed wooden figurine of the Spirit Infant grew increasingly ominous amidst the incense smoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even vaguely felt that the gaze of the wooden figurine of the Spirit Infant Master seemed to be directed towards his family, a hazy gaze constantly watching them, making him feel like he had a target on his back!</p><p></p><p>"My lord..." Zhang Ya looked at the procession of the Spirit Infant Cult, her expression clearly anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"Don't look, just keep walking."</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted his wife, embracing her slender shoulders as they headed straight for the woodcarving workshop.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che couldn't help but feel that the cold wind was swirling behind them, as if there was a figure constantly following them.</p><p></p><p>The sense of crisis was like ink slowly diffusing in a pool, gradually darkening the entire pool.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they soon arrived at Xu's Woodcarving Workshop.</p><p></p><p>The moment they stepped into the workshop, Li Che felt his body relax. He looked back towards the distance and his eyes narrowed, sure enough, he saw a dark shadow flashing around the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Leichunlan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's chest heaved violently, and he couldn't help but be overcome by the urge to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Ache?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice sounded, and Chen Daobao, holding a gourd and drinking, saw Li Che and his wife and daughter.</p><p></p><p>This entourage... made him pause for a moment, but old Chen was shrewd, and he quickly connected it to the matter of the Spirit Infant Cult that Li Che had mentioned before, eyeing him knowingly.</p><p></p><p>"Come in first."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's expression became solemn as he ushered Li Che and his family into the workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che arranged for Zhang Ya and Xixia to stay in his own workshop, then came to find Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sipped his gourd wine, glancing at Li Che: "You've been targeted?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, taking out the wooden spirit infant figurine that had appeared at his doorstep the previous night.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the wooden spirit infant figurine, Old Chen's expression became grave, and he even stopped drinking: "You did the right thing, bringing your wife and daughter to the woodcarving workshop, your home... is no longer safe."</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Infant Cult, the Spirit Infant Cult... giving you this wooden figurine means they have assessed your daughter as a 'spirit infant'!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took the wooden figurine, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression also changed involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"They must have been watching you all along. This 'three-headed, six-armed spirit infant figurine' only appeared last night?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems they knew you had become a master woodcarver at Xu's, and knew you would move into Xu's compound, so..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression darkened: "They want to strike first?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you're fortunate enough to have moved your wife and daughter here in time..." Old Chen clenched his fist, and the wooden spirit infant figurine instantly cracked and shattered into a pile of wooden pieces.</p><p></p><p>"You said someone was following you? Was it that midwife who has harmed many children?"</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't see clearly... I can't be sure."</p><p></p><p>"Considering we're about to become friendly neighbors... I'll take you to take a look, see if it's that brainwashed midwife..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen gulped down a mouthful of strong old wine, slightly narrowing his eyes as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che couldn't help but feel delighted.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Old Chen's change in attitude was because of the woodcarving talent he had displayed, able to imbue the woodcarvings with such profound meaning - this talent, it seems, was even more important than he had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Li Che settled his wife and daughter in the workshop, instructing Zhang Ya not to wander off, and Old Chen had an experienced master help keep an eye on them, then the two of them went out of the workshop, braving the wind and snow with their hats pulled low.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the workshop, Old Chen tossed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on the cloak, and wrapped it around himself as well, then hung the gourd of wine at his waist.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at the corner of the alley.</p><p></p><p>However, they only saw a "three-headed, six-armed spirit infant statue" placed on the accumulated snow at the corner of the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Hah, they really have guts, daring to mark their territory in front of Xu's shop... Do they really think Xu's is made of mud?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen narrowed his eyes, stomped his foot, and in the surge of his qi and blood, the wooden spirit infant statue instantly exploded into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Crash!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a black shadow in the distance seemed to have been frightened, and fled quickly, trampling the snow as it ran away.</p><p></p><p>"Found it." Old Chen narrowed his eyes and glanced at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"You follow slowly, be careful."</p><p></p><p>With that, the exposed skin of Old Chen turned fiery red, his body stretched and the big tendons tightened, making a sound like a taut bowstring.</p><p></p><p>The snow beneath his feet instantly melted into water, a scorching hot wave rushed towards him, and with one step, he shot off like a red-hot iron being thrown, shattering the flying snowflakes, chasing after the fleeing black shadow.</p><p></p><p>Watching Old Chen suddenly shoot off into the distance, Li Che was slightly shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Grinding the skin, replacing the blood... Old Chen had reached an unimaginable realm, and his inner strength was also extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling the hot breath in the snowy wind, Li Che pressed down on the hidden crossbow in his sleeve, his face as cold as water.</p><p></p><p>Not afraid of the thief, but afraid of the thief remembering... </p><p></p><p>Thinking that the lovely Xixia had actually been targeted by these villains, Li Che's heart was filled with intense brutality.</p><p></p><p>You want to mess with my daughter, then I...</p><p></p><p>I will kill you all!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped on the bluestone path and quickly caught up.</p><p></p><p>From afar, he saw Old Chen leaning against the wall at the corner of the alley, sipping the wine from the gourd.</p><p></p><p>In the alley behind him, a black shadow was curled up on the ground, the white snow stained red with blood.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that midwife, just a martial arts practitioner who has reached the pinnacle of skin grinding, and has joined the Spirit Infant Cult, becoming a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen saw Li Che approaching and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart sank a little, feeling disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Not Lei Chunlian... It's really a pity.</p><p></p><p>The big man had dark skin, with a rugged resilience from being weathered by wind and sun, but now he was utterly dejected, blood seeping from his mouth and nose, panting heavily and coughing up blood as he lay on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had not even lasted a few moves against Old Chen before receiving a brutal beating and was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had beaten the man and was now drinking, with a sense of satisfaction, like having a smoke after the deed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared at the big man with his head buried in the snow pile, clenching his fists, his eyes as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Lei Chunlian?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's voice was a little hoarse as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"I... I don't... don't know..."</p><p></p><p>The big man, with his head buried, mumbled a response.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Li Che viciously kicked him in the head, slamming the big man's head against the scattered white snow on the bluestone ground, making a dull thud.</p><p></p><p>Li Che kicked him several times in succession, but the big man only grunted in pain, not crying out or making a sound.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen watched indifferently, with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the two walked in silence down the long street, Old Chen with his hands behind his back, strolling leisurely.</p><p></p><p>While Li Che looked at Old Chen and said, "Old Chen, you go back to the shop first, I'll go buy a catty of pork and two liang of yellow wine to thank you..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen heard this and immediately broke into a grin: "No need to be so polite, go on, go on, I want the pickled meat from the shop in the west of the city."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and responded, then disappeared into the snowy wind.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen watched Li Che's retreating figure, smacked his lips, picked up the gourd, pulled out the strainer, and took a big gulp.</p><p></p><p>"This kid... is actually a good father."</p><p></p><p>"But without martial arts training, killing a skin-grinding martial artist... that's not so easy."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the alley.</p><p></p><p>The snow was flying and scattering, bitterly cold.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood permeated the air. The black-skinned big man who had been brutally beaten by Old Chen was now struggling to his feet, leaning against the wall.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's strength was too overwhelming, and as a newly skin-grinding martial artist, he had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the kicks from Li Che, to the big man at the skin-grinding realm, they were nothing more than a slight humiliation.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Infant that the Patriarch has set his sights on... none of them can escape... even Xu's shop won't be able to protect them..."</p><p></p><p>The big man panted heavily.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, </p><p></p><p>he stiffened as he looked towards the alley entrance, the light blocked by a figure.</p><p></p><p>He painfully raised his head and saw a tall figure wearing a wide-brimmed hat blocking the alley entrance.</p><p></p><p>That figure in the hat raised its arm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Accompanied by a tearing sound, a whistle pierced through the flying snow.</p><p></p><p>Puck! Something seemed to have exploded...</p><p></p><p>The black-skinned big man only felt a stinging pain from his eye, a wooden crossbow bolt, carrying tremendous force, had pierced through his eyeball, and the gushing blood instantly blurred his vision.</p><p></p><p>He let out a miserable howl, the pain burning through his nerves!</p><p></p><p>Like an enraged tiger, he roared and lunged towards the figure at the alley entrance, intent on tearing him apart!</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the hat, looked at the charging black-skinned big man with utter coldness, and with a whistling sound, another crossbow bolt shot out.</p><p></p><p>Bolt after bolt, each one hitting the eye!  Even a skin-grinding martial artist's tough skin and thick flesh... can you grind out the eyeballs?</p><p></p><p>He emptied the first batch of nine bolts from his sleeve crossbow.</p><p></p><p>Until the black-skinned big man knelt on the ground, his head pierced like a hedgehog, completely lifeless and motionless.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Che shake his sleeve, hiding the crossbow with an expressionless face, and turned to walk towards the pickled meat shop in the west of the city.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped on the mud on the ground and flattened the surface.</p><p></p><p>Then, he gently placed the "Great Avalanche Bodhisattva Lotus Grenade" about two meters in front of the slowly expanding black vortex.</p><p></p><p>He also carefully adjusted the angle of the Bodhisattva's smiling face.</p><p></p><p>To ensure that at the moment of detonation, the entire area in front of the black vortex would be fully enveloped.</p><p></p><p>To make the little mushroom explode... look better.</p><p></p><p>The Great Avalanche Bodhisattva Lotus Grenade with the power of one hundred divine chess pieces, this was Li Che's first attempt, and also the first explosion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very serious and solemn about it.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen Horse-Faced Ones also simultaneously set up immortal-crafted Gatling guns, fanning out, and distancing themselves from the lotus grenade location, preparing to add fuel to the fire at a distance of five hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tiptoed and launched himself a thousand meters away.</p><p></p><p>He hid behind a tree trunk, standing still on the thick tree trunk, with the pupils of the Horse-Faced Ones flashing with flowing light, filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The black vortex was spinning faster and faster, and the range of the vortex was also expanding.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the black vortex reached a diameter of about ten meters.</p><p></p><p>The black smoke vortex suddenly shook!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Here it comes!"</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, a white divine chess piece floated in his palm.</p><p></p><p>That was the divine chess piece that controlled the detonation of the Avalanche Lotus Grenade.</p><p></p><p>As long as he crushed the chess piece, the divine chess pieces inside the lotus grenade would start to riot, and under the driving force of the nascent divine technique "Great Avalanche", they would explode with a thunderous roar!</p><p></p><p>Inhale—</p><p></p><p>Exhale—</p><p></p><p>The forest was extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>Only the winter wind blowing through the leaves, rubbing against the fallen snow, made a rustling sound!</p><p></p><p>Li Che inhaled and exhaled, staring intently at the black vortex.</p><p></p><p>As the one who escaped by using the time-space necromancy technique, it must be an evil person from the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Towards the cultivators of the Corpse God Sect, Li Che would not have an ounce of mercy, just one word, kill!</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect... </p><p></p><p>There are no good people!</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes under the Horse-Faced mask.</p><p></p><p>From the black vortex, a figure shot out at high speed, and the pungent smell of blood instantly permeated the forest.</p><p></p><p>The figure fell to the ground, gasping for breath heavily, shaking like a bellows.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the gasping stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice came from the mask covered in cracks, with a "seven" written in blood on it.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A big fish! Without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>He crushed the floating white divine chess piece.</p><p></p><p>He caught a big fish! Li Che didn't even expect that a Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy would be caught by his ambush!</p><p></p><p>Crushing the chess piece, in less than half a breath!</p><p></p><p>In the bewildered gaze of the Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy, he saw the wooden Bodhisattva statue, about half a person tall, sitting quietly in front of him...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly start to vibrate!</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>It was light! Endless light!</p><p></p><p>Engulfing his vision! "What the hell is this?!"</p><p></p><p>This Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy was deeply chilled, his silver qi had already been exhausted in the escape from the attacks of South离 Fire and Qin Tian Monitor's two Monitors.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>He was basically reduced to the level of a Great Completion Curse Copper Corpse.</p><p></p><p>Which is equivalent to an Eight Extremes Corpse God Envoy.</p><p></p><p>The silver qi...</p><p></p><p>Is the biggest gap between the Great Completion Curse Copper Corpse and the Grand Master Curse Copper Corpse!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying explosion!</p><p></p><p>The scorching light and heat engulfed this Corpse God Envoy.</p><p></p><p>The ground of the entire forest was shaking! A white-hot light column slowly shot into the clouds, then gradually spread out, like a large blob of concentrated ink poured into a pool, slowly flowing down!</p><p></p><p>Forming a mushroom cloud about four or five meters high!</p><p></p><p>Small, in Li Che's eyes...</p><p></p><p>But also very cute.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Splash splash...</p><p></p><p>The shock waves spread out in concentric circles in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Countless trees were blown and swayed in one direction, the leaves were blown off and scattered! White air waves rolled and roared like satin.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for about thirty to forty breaths.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the small, cute mushroom cloud dissipated into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took off the Horse-Face mask and put on the Ox Demon mask, his figure suddenly towering, massive like a pagoda, with a terrifying hump on his back like an inverted triangle demon face.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by sixteen Horse-Faced Ones carrying Gatling guns.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he walked towards the center of the explosion...</p><p></p><p>The black smoke vortex disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Although there is no radiation pollution, there is still turbulent divine pollution..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed it and analyzed it lightly.</p><p></p><p>The side effects seem to still exist.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins, Li Che's gaze swept over and saw only a charred and dismembered corpse scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the Thousand Analysis Hands.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out to the scattered bones.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, about seventy divine chess pieces were extracted by him.</p><p></p><p>"Seventy divine chess pieces, equivalent to just after the Divine Manifestation Realm... It's average, the cultivation of this Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy doesn't seem as high as imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Corpse God Sect's Corpse God Envoys mainly rely on the Corpse Summoning Technique."</p><p></p><p>"This Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy was severely injured and blown up... It's understandable."</p><p></p><p>"He should have escaped from Zheng Lei Peak, and was lucky to run into me, dying a very pleasant death."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Collecting the seventy divine chess pieces of the Manifestation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He can now distinguish the cultivation based on the number of chess pieces in the corpse.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Initial Manifestation Realm, about thirty or less chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>The Middle Realm, thirty to sixty pieces, seventy pieces and above is the Later Realm, over a hundred pieces... is the Perfected or even Primal Manifestation!</p><p></p><p>After collecting the divine chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Li Che rummaged through the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Spreading his divine sense, he finally found the worn, scorching hot, and cracked Rift Jade buried deep in the thick ash.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it didn't break..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He collected the Rift Jade, the collection of a Seven-Element Corpse God Envoy...</p><p></p><p>It should be able to make him look forward to it a little.</p><p></p><p>"This trip... was not in vain."</p><p></p><p>"I also earned an Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystal from Senior Qing Shan."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>In the perception of the Heavenly Earth Chessboard, there were several streams of auras rapidly shooting over.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, the dazzling light of the five-meter-tall cute little mushroom cloud had attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the Ox Demon mask and lowering his hat brim.</p><p></p><p>He snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Snap."</p><p></p><p>Sixteen Horse-Faced Ones turned into black mist and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the figure of the Ox Demon also suddenly moved away.</p><p></p><p>After the Ox Demon left.</p><p></p><p>In the forest, there were several gliding leaps.</p><p></p><p>Three figures in the uniform of the Temple Guard Supervisors landed around the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao's eyes narrowed, and his hand instinctively fell on the handle of the saber at his waist.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>Howling winds and air waves rushed past.</p><p></p><p>In front of him...</p><p></p><p>A crater about fifty meters in diameter appeared!</p><p></p><p>In the ruins of the crater...</p><p></p><p>The scattered and chaotic divine energies of the seven emotions were intertwined, forming a polluted domain that caused disorientation and uncontrollable divine frenzy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The clamor subsided.</p><p></p><p>In the City of Golden Light, the atmosphere gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew that with Li Qingshan's breakthrough to the Divine Manifestation Realm, the sky above the city was about to change.</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the five major families, no, now the four major families, all understood that their family disciples must be low-key and careful in the future.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once they offend Li Qingshan or he finds some leverage, it would be the end of the matter.</p><p></p><p>And these patriarchs would no longer be able to stand up for their clan members.</p><p></p><p>As for some cultivators with unspeakable secrets, they have already started to retract their necks and hide themselves, not daring to expose themselves at all.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>The thunderbolts were still flashing, but the dark clouds had long since dispersed, as if there was a vast golden light pouring down from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood upright with a sword in his hand, his black hair flying, his blood and qi extremely full, his back straight, his eyes burning.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, a vague divine shadow would appear behind him.</p><p></p><p>This was not an illusion, but the result of Li Qingshan's temporary inability to control his power, causing the divine manifestation to be externalized.</p><p></p><p>With the divine manifestation, his aura would become extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary people would be oppressed to the point of panic and difficulty breathing if they approached him.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan needed some time to consolidate his cultivation, he was a bit too hasty after all, so he used five Blood Serpent Dragons to directly pull the carved divine foundation and divine manifestation into his Nirvana Realm.</p><p></p><p>This process was too violent and too fast, and the burden on Li Qingshan's physical body was still extremely great.</p><p></p><p>He needed to recover for some time.</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire drifted down, and the Monitor with a two-stringed lute hanging on his waist also landed on the bumpy plateau of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Of the three Seven-Element Corpse God Envoys in the Corpse God Sect's recent operation, we left one and two escaped..."</p><p></p><p>"The harvest is still acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"The two who escaped were also severely injured, their silver qi was exhausted, and their Great Completion Curse Copper Corpses were torn apart by us, they will be hard to recover in the short term."</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire's white hair was flying, and he was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The Monitor smiled, in this scene, he really wanted to play a cheerful two-stringed lute tune to add to the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, the Monitor sat down cross-legged, took off the two-stringed lute from his waist, and rested it on his hip.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on a small stool, he took out a shiny porcelain bowl and placed it properly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The lingering two-stringed lute melody floated over Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan couldn't help but be at a loss.</p><p></p><p>This is the Monitor? He had less contact with the Monitor in the past, and as a virtual combat expert, this powerful figure was still difficult for him to face.</p><p></p><p>But now, seeing him, the upright and righteous image of the Monitor in his heart collapsed.</p><p></p><p>This is an old man who enjoys performing arts for a living!</p><p></p><p>"I also hired the Horse-Faced Ones..."</p><p></p><p>"It was also thanks to the Horse-Faced Ones' sneak attack support... Earlier, I felt a great threat, it came from the City Lord's Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"It should be that Divine Archer Wen Long Mountain wanting to ruin my breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>With his foothold in the Divine Manifestation Realm, he felt a huge transformation, he was completely different now.</p><p></p><p>His upper limit is much higher than that of Zhu Hongdou, who is also at the Six Dao Divine Manifestation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"But, he was stopped by the Horse-Faced Ones."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Archer like Wen Long Mountain posed a huge threat to him when he was in the midst of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Horse-Faced Ones, this hiring, was not a loss at all!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Horse-Faced Ones' subsequent assistance in shooting down those restless Divine Manifestation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I have to give a big red envelope... This Divine Archer must be well taken care of."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan muttered.</p><p></p><p>Having a skilled Divine Archer friend who excels at shooting hidden arrows is such a reassuring thing.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Long Mountain..."</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire lowered his eyelids.</p><p></p><p>The City Lord's Mansion does not have a major grudge against Li Qingshan, but still chose this critical moment to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The purpose is already very clear, it is mostly to annoy him, South離 Fire, and not let the Golden Light Sect add another powerful cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Find an opportunity... to get rid of him."</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan heard this and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"I must be part of it!"</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire nodded.</p><p></p><p>He did not refuse Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the edge of the cliff, looking at the faint whitish sky in the distance...</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"You, Li Qingshan, have finally broken through to the Divine Manifestation Realm, with the combat power of the Divine Manifestation Realm Later Stage... It's a great help."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Temple God Resonance' that is about to begin, with you, a Divine Manifestation Realm Later Stage cultivator, supporting it, the children will also be safer."</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan suddenly slapped his thigh and jumped up from the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, quickly help me suppress the problem of divine manifestation externalization!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>South離 Fire glanced at him and couldn't help but be puzzled: "You do it yourself, you can control it in two or three days."</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to go see my wife, otherwise I'll lose my wife..." Li Qingshan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have already guessed Sumu Auntie's murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, you've really made it. Daring to knock out your wife and cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo seemed to guess something, and couldn't help but be speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Women... only hold you back, slow down your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>Like him, alone, that's why he has today's achievements.</p><p></p><p>And there's Jingzheng, a 213-year-old old virgin.</p><p></p><p>The erhu music in the world suddenly became tragic and sharp, as if Jingzheng had felt the immense humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo hurriedly extended his hand and activated the divine nature point on Li Qingshan's brow.</p><p></p><p>Helping him to calm and suppress the revealed divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Qingshan's entire aura of a master was restrained, his back hunched, and he quickly rushed towards the courtyard on the middle slope where Li Che lived.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard of Zheng Leifeng, in the study.</p><p></p><p>Li Che crushed the flying thunder chess piece, and after returning, did not immediately leave the study.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he didn't use much physical strength, relying on the Immortal Craftsman Barrett, combined with the compression and enhancement of the divine foundation and divine nature, to assist Li Qingshan in successfully breaking through the boundary.</p><p></p><p>It was quite easy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched, feeling very good.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the dark, secretly firing a few shots, he could earn an Eight Extremes divine nature crystal.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be happy?</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, tearing open the air, the Qiankun space spat out that dilapidated Qiankun jade.</p><p></p><p>This was the Qiankun jade of the unfortunate Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was secretly relieved that it was not blasted and destroyed, and could still be used.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense didn't even touch it, directly and forcefully invading it.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the collection of the Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy, Li Che was still very looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>This was also his biggest harvest tonight.</p><p></p><p>Calming down, not being happy with things nor sad with himself.</p><p></p><p>Start counting! Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened! Grabbing with five fingers, a divine nature crystal that flashed and rolled without any flaws fell into his hand, and the surging divine nature swept over him.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A Seven Element divine nature crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were dazzlingly bright, it was worth it!</p><p></p><p>Just this one Seven Element divine nature crystal alone, the operation tonight had already achieved a perfect harvest.</p><p></p><p>"One Seven Element divine nature crystal, six Eight Extremes divine nature crystals, thirty of the Nine Brilliance's, three of the Ten Realms'..."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Realms' are too few, but that's normal, the Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy didn't really value the Ten Realms' divine nature crystals."</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed.</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming riches had once again fallen on him.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, riches must be taken by oneself.</p><p></p><p>If he had just run away when he saw the death vortex, wouldn't this wealth have run away too?</p><p></p><p>He bravely accepted this wealth...</p><p></p><p>He deserved to earn money! Continuing to count, Li Che soon furrowed his brow, calming down.</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons... are much worse than imagined.</p><p></p><p>There is only one Eight Extremes divine weapon, this is completely inconsistent with the prestige of a Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che took out a round mirror, the frame of which was made of bronze.</p><p></p><p>His arm turned jade-colored, the Thousand Slivers technique analyzed it!</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Seven Element Low-Grade): Thousand Miles Divine Communication Mirror]</p><p></p><p>[Introduction: Enter the divine sense, can communicate and exchange with other holders of the Divine Communication Mirror, a thread of divine soul connected for a hundred miles, sought for a thousand miles.]</p><p></p><p>[Mastery: Divine Foundation and above]</p><p></p><p>This thing...</p><p></p><p>So familiar.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his chin, probing, is it you?</p><p></p><p>Just this function...</p><p></p><p>Daring to label it a Seven Element divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>However, thousand miles communication, shared exchange, can also be roughly called a Seven Element divine weapon and be justified.</p><p></p><p>After all, information is sometimes the most valuable.</p><p></p><p>"The divine weapons in this world... are so fancy." Li Che smiled, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao fruit, if he switched to learning divine weapon forging, he could also earn a full bowl.</p><p></p><p>But having others give him this overwhelming wealth, how could it compare to the fragrance?</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the Divine Communication Mirror and continued counting.</p><p></p><p>The death qi pills of the Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy were naturally extremely many.</p><p></p><p>What delighted Li Che was that there was actually a Grade 7 Superior death qi condensed pill! This kind of pill, for his Furnace Sect Master, would have an excellent effect.</p><p></p><p>In terms of martial arts, the other party did not carry them on their person.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a small booklet "Corpse Deity Forbidden Techniques · Silver Radiance"...</p><p></p><p>"Like the time-space Corpse Techniques, it belongs to one of the Corpse Deity secret techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Silver Radiance..." Li Che flipped through it, his eyes becoming brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Although it is called a secret technique, in fact... it is a companion martial art for cursing copper corpses.</p><p></p><p>Using the death qi of the cursed copper corpses, refine out the silver radiance power possessed by the cursed silver corpses, although weaker than a great master's divine radiance, it has touched the threshold of that level of power.</p><p></p><p>And to cultivate the Silver Radiance, one needs a strong and resilient physique, and to cultivate the cursed copper corpses to a great success as well.</p><p></p><p>And to cultivate a strand of Silver Radiance, it can be considered to have entered the great master level of cursed copper corpses.</p><p></p><p>The transformed cursed copper corpses, with silver radiance flowers all over the body... are extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Radiance... can I cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>"Integrated into the Myriad Transformation Dragon Elephant, my [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] can't be inferior to the cursed copper corpses, right?"</p><p></p><p>"This Silver Radiance is a martial art, not a Corpse Deity technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood became agitated, and he really had the idea of cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>The explosive power of the Silver Radiance is strong, and the penetrating power is also extremely terrible...</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate the Silver Radiance and integrate it into the Immortal Craftsman Barrett, wouldn't that be a whole new upgrade path?</p><p></p><p>After counting over and over again, Li Che could no longer suppress the arc of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that Li Qingshan was rushing over in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then packed up his things and left the study.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the room, he saw Li Qingshan smiling all over his face, cuddling up to Sumu, seeking forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, you're capable, have the guts to kill me, what's knocking me out?" </p><p></p><p>"You stand still, don't come near me, back off, back off further!"</p><p></p><p>Sumu was furious.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was all smiles, but shamelessly cuddled up, starting to soothe her gently.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was full of smiles, seeing Li Che, she hopped and jumped over, leaning on Li Che's sturdy chest.</p><p></p><p>Smiling at the two old people in the room bickering.</p><p></p><p>"Husband."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"When we get old, we have to be affectionate like this too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted her head.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya bit her lips, her dimples blooming.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she thought of something: "Husband, did we forget something?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is still at Jingang Peak."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's fine, let her stay there, you and I tonight can research the seventy-two self-created Bone Tempering techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? That... that many?"</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan still has integrity, not owing Li Che any divine nature crystals.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he sent over that Eight Extremes divine nature crystal.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, please properly thank Horse Face for me, this time I was able to break through thanks to him blocking the sneak attack from the Wen Long Mountain divine arrow master..."</p><p></p><p>"When there's a chance in the future, invite him for a drink."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew the chances of drinking with Horse Face were not great.</p><p></p><p>This kind of hidden dark arrow master, would not easily expose their position.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Long Mountain? There's a chance we can kill him together."

His bones and muscles cried out, his spine roaring like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, punch after punch, not too fast nor too slow, practicing the techniques.</p><p></p><p>His stomach and stomach walls were peristaltic, the powerful force shattering that Grade 7 inferior death qi condensed pill.</p><p></p><p>The pill shell broke, the overwhelming medicinal effect surging into his four limbs and throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>The furnace-like blood qi rapidly circulating through the meridians throughout his body, the blood qi achieving a great circulation, standing at the Sect Master realm, the force he exerted with each blood qi activation was terrifyingly powerful! Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze focused, his five fingers like hooks, suddenly clenching, the airflow in the courtyard was instantly gripped and twisted, forming five white whip-like strands!</p><p></p><p>Then, a silver glow flashed and bloomed on Li Che's fist! Silver Radiance!</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a faint strand, when it lashed the air, it let out a terrifying thunderous roar!</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to be distorted and torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Finishing the practice and standing still.</p><p></p><p>The boiling blood qi melted all the snow in the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled the turbid air, his eyes opening and closing, his spirit overflowing.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver Radiance... I've cultivated it!"</p><p></p><p>Blood qi Silver Radiance, small success! "Integrating the blood qi Silver Radiance into the self-created supreme technique [Myriad Transformation Dragon Elephant], forming the Silver Radiance Dragon Elephant True Might, the explosion is extremely terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his palm, a silver arc quickly flickering between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Sect's Corpse Deity Envoys use the cursed copper corpses to refine the Silver Radiance.</p><p></p><p>While he used his own powerful furnace-like blood qi to refine it.</p><p></p><p>The power of the blood qi Silver Radiance is even stronger and more domineering.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary warriors naturally cannot do it, but Li Che has the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao fruit enhancing his martial arts talent, so it's different.</p><p></p><p>"Empowering the blood qi Silver Radiance, I can activate the Tower Ascent state, without relying on the Heavenly King divine nature chess pieces, I should be able to reach the post-Sect Master realm's explosion."</p><p></p><p>"Jingzheng the Heavenly Observatory Supervisor promised to take me to that [Fire Eye Mysterious Startling Monkey Mysterious Temple], I don't know when we'll go..."</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity divine nature chess piece I squeezed bald in Fei Lei City has been exhausted..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm starting to miss the temple deities."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity chess piece has been exhausted...</p><p></p><p>There's no sense of security at all.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he will soon enter a new mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The settled blood qi made the snowflakes in the sky return, drifting and falling on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tore open the air, taking out that divine nature crystal from the Qiankun space, which was full of rich and dense Seven Element divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Also the only Seven Element divine nature crystal he has obtained so far.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the light flashed.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Unsullied Heart (lv3, 9%)]</p><p></p><p>Grasping the Seven Element divine nature crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how high a Seven Element divine nature crystal can let him rise?!</p><p></p><p>Monday, please ask for fresh new recommendation votes!

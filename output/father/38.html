        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The vast snow, drifting all over the sky, the ice three feet thick.</p><p></p><p>The heavy and pure white snow covered the entire street of the outer city, but the common people who were struggling to survive still had to brave the wind and snow to go to work, set up stalls, just to earn a few copper coins and buy some firewood to survive this killer winter.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, who was planning to go to the rented courtyard in Tingrui Alley to cultivate, was walking down the long street, wearing a cotton coat and a rain hat. He could see that many households in the city had white cloth hanging, and the sound of weeping was still drifting in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>They were families who had lost their children. In recent months, the activities of the Lingying Sect had become more and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>After they were driven out to the outer city, they were like hungry wolves entering a flock of sheep, without any restraint, but rather escalating their actions.</p><p></p><p>Even the large courtyard established by the Yang family, a prominent family in the inner city, in the outer city, was looted of their children.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the entire city's atmosphere has become increasingly strange and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Although Feilei City has an official government, the captain of the outer city yamen, Zhao Chuanxiong, is a believer of the Lingying Sect. For ordinary people... how can they resist?</p><p></p><p>And who can uphold justice for them? No one.</p><p></p><p>The major families in the inner city have only driven out the Lingying Sect, seemingly not daring to completely offend the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that the Lingying Sect is deeply rooted, and even has connections with the mysterious temple, perhaps involving some heavyweight figures in Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>"According to what Old Xu said, the Lingying Sect has extended its hands to the children of the prominent families in the inner city, which is the foundation of these powerful families..."</p><p></p><p>"But those prominent families have only driven out the Lingying Sect, and have not completely gone to war... Evidently, they are in awe of something."</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the deep snow, Li Che saw a numb woman burning paper money at the door.</p><p></p><p>On the long street, the procession of Lingying Sect believers, chanting slogans, marched past in groups, their faces full of fanaticism and excitement, in stark contrast to the numb and desperate woman.</p><p></p><p>"This damned world, this damned Lingying Sect... My son, my son..."</p><p></p><p>The woman stared blankly at the departing believers, suddenly bursting into wails, tears streaming down her face, her voice piercing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood there, coldly watching those fanatical believers trample down the street.</p><p></p><p>He slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think that if he had not attained the Dao, he might now be as numb and powerless as this woman.</p><p></p><p>Upon further reflection, it seemed a bit... empathetic.</p><p></p><p>In this world, no one upholds justice for them.</p><p></p><p>No one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, he couldn't...</p><p></p><p>Because he had a family, a lively and lovely daughter, and more things to consider.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Li Che had returned to the small courtyard in Tingrui Alley, the place he rented in the outer city.</p><p></p><p>In the snowy courtyard, he pulled a bamboo chair and sat down, taking out a thin wooden board and a carving knife he always carried with him.</p><p></p><p>Unhurriedly, with great seriousness and focus, he began to carve.</p><p></p><p>With the sound of the knife scraping the wooden surface and the falling wood chips accompanied by the howling wind and snow, a cute ox mask took shape.</p><p></p><p>Curui was born in the year of the ox, so Li Che was used to wearing this cute ox mask.</p><p></p><p>Covering his face with the ox mask, Li Che raised his head, and the eyes behind the mask gleamed with coldness and recklessness.</p><p></p><p>Things Li Che dared not do, the Ox Demon could.</p><p>Things Li Che could not do, the Ox Demon could.</p><p>The recklessness Li Che dared not pursue, the Ox Demon could!</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect believers... have already made it onto my little black book, so let's start the reckoning."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon murmured.</p><p></p><p>The entire city has been made too oppressive by the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>Your grandpa Ox Demon is here... to relieve the pressure!</p><p></p><p>Not seeking justice, only seeking recklessness!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inner city of Feilei.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Splendor Hall.</p><p></p><p>The curtains were fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Inside the suspended pavilion, the charcoal stove was glowing red, keeping the temperature warm and comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai was sipping tea, and facing him were several figures wearing children's masks. Although the charcoal stove was releasing warmth, the cold and deadly atmosphere still chilled the air.</p><p></p><p>"That Ox Demon, we have not gone to trouble him, but he has started acting again... In the past half month, he has frequently taken action, killing several of our Lingying Sect believers who were searching for children in the city!"</p><p></p><p>"He twisted their heads, severed their hands, and used his signature crossbow bolts to pin their bodies to the walls... His methods are extremely cruel!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this considered upholding justice? Calling himself the great Ox Demon hero? How ridiculous... In this world, those who dare to be heroes..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"May you not have a good death!"</p><p></p><p>The cold voice came from the smiling child mask, as grating as a knife scraping against a white wall.</p><p></p><p>Siming Bai looked at the various demonic figures hidden behind those masks, and couldn't help but let out a soft sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this Ox Demon... will die for sure."</p><p></p><p>"Please come over, the four of you, because... this matter still requires your assistance."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Siming Bai gestured to one side.</p><p></p><p>His assistant, the blood-bathed warrior Guo Zhan, immediately lowered his body and approached.</p><p></p><p>"Go, let Zhao Chuanxiong take action..."</p><p></p><p>"My [Nurturing Divine Sculpture], I only lack that one top-grade spirit child, I can't delay any longer..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Listening to Rain Alley, within a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon who had just slaughtered the disciples of the Spirit Infant Sect returned with the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" technique.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up, Li Che sat cross-legged and began his daily spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit slightly pulsed, and in a throbbing moment, as if the heart had contracted and expanded, the pure and flawless spirituality in the universe was drawn in like enchanted sprites, flowing in like delicate streams, gathering within the [Untainted Heart].</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Untainted Heart (LV1, 3%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his brows furrowed, and he slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>"The [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit, although it can absorb the spirituality in the universe, it is ultimately limited by the lack of spiritual techniques, so my efficiency in absorbing spirituality is extremely low..."</p><p></p><p>"Until now, I've only managed to push the maturity of the Dao Fruit to 3%... and the speed is getting slower and slower."</p><p></p><p>"I really need to get a spiritual technique to research."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>This idea had been lingering in his mind for a long time, and now it was becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, spiritual techniques cannot be bought in the market, there are no channels.</p><p></p><p>Such spiritual techniques are treasures hidden away even in the wealthy families of the inner city. Even after becoming a renowned wood carver and gaining the recognition of those families, one would still have to go through extensive trust tests before being granted a lower-level spiritual technique.</p><p></p><p>"So, to obtain a spiritual technique, I'll have to find a way through those wealthy families..."</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the spiritual technique for now.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Armor (LV1, 90%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared blankly at the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao Fruit in front of him, which had risen from the original 70% maturity to 90% in just half a month.</p><p></p><p>"Combat... killing... can also accelerate the maturity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>In the past half month since the Ox Demon resurfaced, Li Che had relied on the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" and "Golden Armor Transformation" abilities of the Dao Fruit to kill many vicious disciples of the Spirit Infant Sect. Most of the battles were overwhelming, even against Tempering Bone disciples, they could not last more than a few rounds against him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this had brought the pleasant surprise of accelerating the maturity of the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>And due to the increased maturity of the Dao Fruit, Li Che's Tempering Bone cultivation had officially reached completion.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering Bone is complete... in external cultivation, I'm now lacking a Blood Transformation technique, and my internal energy has reached the Third Heaven for a long time, but without a superior internal energy technique, it's difficult to break through to the Fourth Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual technique, Blood Transformation technique, superior internal energy technique... ah, where should I go to find these?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed his brow, feeling a bit of a headache.</p><p></p><p>As the mainstay wood carver of Xu's Wood Carving Shop, his wealth was extremely abundant.</p><p></p><p>But having money doesn't mean one can buy everything they want.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up, Li Che headed towards Xu's Wood Carving Shop, braving the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>His mind was preoccupied with how to obtain the spiritual technique and Blood Transformation technique.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the shop's entrance, Li Che sensed that the atmosphere was not right.</p><p></p><p>At the door, there were two teams of guards in red and black uniforms, their waists adorned with sabers.</p><p></p><p>And from within the wood carving shop, the constable Zhao Chuanxiong, whose name was recorded in Li Che's notebook, was escorting someone out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the person being escorted by Zhao Chuanxiong, Li Che's face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen?"</p>

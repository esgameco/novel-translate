        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of the metal saber rang out, humming incessantly! It was just like the shock in Zhao Chuanxiong's heart at the moment!</p><p></p><p>Because of the child prodigy, Zhao Chuanxiong had carefully read through Li Che's information. He was an orphan who had been raised by his uncle since he was little.</p><p></p><p>Before giving birth to his daughter Li Nuanxi, he was just a hard-working porter at Xu's woodcarving shop, without any martial arts skills, not even knowing how to farm.</p><p></p><p>But in just over two years, this porter had been tempered! Practicing martial arts for two years... reaching the level of Tempering the Bones! What kind of martial arts talent was this?!</p><p></p><p>One must know that polishing the skin and opening the tendons were extremely time-consuming internal arts. It had taken Zhao Chuanxiong a full eight years to go from polishing the skin to Tempering the Bones...</p><p></p><p>"I never expected it... to reach the level of Tempering the Bones in just two short years, this porter has really made a name for himself!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong narrowed his eyes, gripping the long saber in his hand, his murderous intent clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had his sights set on Li Che's daughter, but Li Che's martial arts talent was so high, who knows if he would come back and become a huge disaster!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding woodcarvers were all gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan and Wang Zhengpin, who had learned the skin polishing technique from Xu Behu together with Li Che, were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che... had already reached the level of Tempering the Bones? How could it be so fast! They had all been practicing together, but they were still struggling with skin polishing, having just barely mastered it, not even having stepped into opening the tendons.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had actually reached the level of Tempering the Bones...</p><p></p><p>Achieving the status of a Tempering the Bones martial artist was considered a prominent figure in the outer city! Li Che's expression was ice-cold, and when he had fully mastered opening the tendons, Elder Xu had passed on to him the Tempering the Bones technique of the Xu family, and now he had revealed his Tempering the Bones cultivation, which was understandable.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhao, my apologies."</p><p></p><p>"You are just suspecting, and you don't have the right to arrest me, do you? You said the City Lord had issued a warrant to arrest Master Chen, but was there also a warrant to arrest me in that order?"</p><p></p><p>"孙Longbiao covets my daughter, and my family is the victim, so how can the victim be the guilty party?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's arms trembled, his qi and blood surging through his body, as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong narrowed his eyes, his murderous intent fully exposed, and the wide saber in his grip was humming incessantly.</p><p></p><p>He tapped his finger on the blade, the silver-white blade reflecting his grim countenance.</p><p></p><p>"The government is handling this, how dare you, a lowly commoner, talk back?"</p><p></p><p>"If I insist on throwing you into the Flying Thunder Prison, what can you do about it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's rugged face was filled with coldness. He was afraid of death, so... he had to kill Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Che was the renowned woodcarver of Xu's Woodcarving Shop, the seed of a woodcarving master... so what? In Zhao Chuanxiong's eyes, this Li Che with his fame... deserved to die even more.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Li Che rose up later, he would have to die!</p><p></p><p>"With Elder Xu not here, who in Xu's can back you up? Even if they ask about it later... Xu's won't dare to move against me, as my uncle is the inner city's Divine Constable Zhao Xuanhai..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's saber intent gradually surged wildly, his saber technique had obviously reached a high level, already having the shadow of saber intent.</p><p></p><p>Once he achieved the realm of Saber Dao, the saber intent would take form, and at that time, he would be able to resist even Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The murderous aura swept through the snowy wind.</p><p></p><p>In front of the woodcarving shop, many senior masters hesitated whether to lend a hand to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But if they provoked the raging Zhao Chuanxiong, it was obviously not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Most people facing trouble would choose to play it safe.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, his heart filled with murderous intent, but he was also somewhat surprised that Zhao Chuanxiong had a Divine Constable uncle?</p><p></p><p>This was something he had not known before.</p><p></p><p>Divine Constable... cultivating to the realm of Spiritual Cultivators in the inner city's Black Yamen. </p><p>They were true Spiritual Cultivators! Li Che's heart darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>To cut the grass, one must remove the roots, but if he killed Zhao Chuanxiong, this root... was a bit thick, not easy to remove.</p><p></p><p>Facing Zhao Chuanxiong's extremely aggressive murderous intent, Li Che was considering how to respond.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, there was a sound of something piercing the air, a figure rapidly shooting and rushing over.</p><p>The snow and wind were torn apart like curtains!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's brow furrowed as he looked towards the fast-approaching Xu You, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>This Xu You... wasn't he supposed to be constrained in the inner city? It was obvious that Zhao Chuanxiong had underestimated Li Che's standing in Xu You's heart. His plan had just started, but Xu You had received the news and rushed back directly from the inner city...</p><p></p><p>Xu You was the direct descendant of the Xu family. With him here, Zhao Chuanxiong knew he could not kill Li Che today.</p><p></p><p>Sheathing his saber, Zhao Chuanxiong gave Li Che a deep look and quickly retreated, not waiting for Xu You to arrive and question him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che kept his gaze fixed on Zhao Chuanxiong's retreating back.</p><p></p><p>Xu You landed, stirring up a snow storm, the cold wind howling. His expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen has been taken away?"</p><p></p><p>"And this Zhao Chuanxiong... also wanted to take you away?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You clenched his fist, the veins bulging: "司慕白has gone too far... too blatant."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was taken aback: "司慕白?"</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect is targeting the Xu family..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I remember that the 'Shen Xiu Temple' launched an attack, wanting to seize the spirit child and spirit infant of the Xu family... I was urgently recalled to the inner city to guard, so I couldn't be in the outer city during this period..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You looked at Li Che, his expression serious. "The Lingyin Sect dares not to move the 'Shen Xiu Temple', as it is the root of the spiritual cultivators of the aristocratic families in Fei Lei City, but... we cannot be careless, so it is a ploy, I must return..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Chuan Xiong has also taken away Old Chen at this moment, I suspect the purpose of the Lingyin Sect... is Xixia."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's spirit child's grade is too high, Simo Bai wants to forge the divine foundation, he needs a catalyst, the catalyst of a top-grade spirit child."</p><p></p><p>Xu You's voice was very cold, but also very helpless.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Sima family are acting in this way... joining hands with the Lingyin Sect, don't the families in the inner city care?" Li Che's eyelids lowered, gently stroking the protruding veins on his fist.</p><p></p><p>"After all, Simo Bai is the direct descendant of the Sima family, and he is one with the hope of forging the divine foundation, the Sima family will definitely protect him hard, without any evidence, the rest of the families can't say much..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, that old madam of the Sima family who is at the divine foundation realm is still alive."</p><p></p><p>Xu You let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Although Simo Bai is said to be the seed of the divine foundation, but... to forge the divine foundation is extremely difficult, and the hope is not even great, so he has joined forces with the Lingyin Sect, wanting to rely on the 'Nurturing Divine Sculpture' of that Lingyin Sect master to break through..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Nurturing Divine Sculpture' requires the spiritual nature of a spirit child as a catalyst, so..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You said to this point, Li Che basically understood.</p><p></p><p>It turns out...</p><p></p><p>The cooperation that Lei Chunlan discussed with Simo Bai was this.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, at that time... Simo Bai had already set his sights on Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Simo Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes... a scion of a noble family?</p><p></p><p>It's not easy to kill him...</p><p></p><p>A spiritual cultivator at the peak of Xing Xing, the current Li Che, even if he activates the 'Dragon Elephant Golden Armor', can he really kill him? It's a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>But... it's not impossible to kill!</p><p></p><p>The scions of noble families can also be killed!</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about Old Chen, he won't have any trouble, Zhao Chuan Xiong doesn't dare to do anything to him, the purpose is just to take him away."</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, you stay in the courtyard and keep an eye on Xixia, don't go anywhere... If the situation is not right, take Xixia and run, focus on maneuvering and delaying time!"</p><p></p><p>"I can come back tomorrow, as long as you delay until dawn, I will rush back immediately."</p><p></p><p>"I've also mentioned your matter to the family, unfortunately... my words carry little weight, otherwise, the Xu family should have sent a replacement warrior to protect you and Xixia's safety."</p><p></p><p>Xu You smiled self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>Being unappreciated, that's how sad it is.</p><p></p><p>Xu You had already made it clear how excellent Li Che was, but he was still not valued...</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted Xu You instead.</p><p></p><p>Without many words, Xu You patted Li Che's shoulder, and after bidding farewell to a few old masters in the shop, he turned and left, quickly heading towards the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also didn't say much, and after bidding farewell to the people in the shop who were still amazed by his martial arts cultivation, he turned and returned to the Xu family's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the courtyard was tightly closed, and Zhang Ya was hugging Xixia in the room, her complexion slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che came back, Zhang Ya regained her backbone.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, Uncle Chen has been taken away, is he... alright?"</p><p></p><p>With the backbone back, Zhang Ya became less strong and started to get anxious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che took Xixia from her arms, the little girl was sleeping soundly, even drooling, as if dreaming of the taste of sugar-coated haws.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, Old Chen is fine, just a small problem..."</p><p></p><p>"Wife, come here, I'll teach you something."</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xixia with one hand and took Zhang Ya's hand with the other.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the study, Li Che opened a box and took out a palm-sized black nanmu wood bird.</p><p></p><p>"This is a mechanism I made called the 'Wood Raven', its power is a little bit strong, if there is danger, it can protect your and Xixia's safety. I'll teach you how to operate it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che taught Zhang Ya how to operate the 'Wood Raven', and Zhang Ya listened very carefully and soon remembered it.</p><p></p><p>"Note, don't let it see any open fire..." Li Che reminded.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya nodded repeatedly, carefully putting away the 'Wood Raven', then looked at Li Che with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... you said this little wooden bird's power is a little bit strong, how strong is it exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The Wood Raven was ranked seventh among the mechanisms in the "Tang Family Mechanism Records", and Li Che had made some modifications to it with his "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit talent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment, combining his own strength, and gave a cautious answer.</p><p></p><p>The power...</p><p></p><p>"If operated properly, the power is probably... like Old Chen, the warrior, if he's not careful..."</p><p></p><p>"He can be almost killed."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Calming down, he closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che once again saw the fleeting scene he had glimpsed before.</p><p></p><p>The vast land, a great tree rising from the ground, with lush branches and leaves, the green leaves swaying, and a multicolored fruit hanging from it.</p><p></p><p>As if he had been gazing at it for a long time, the colorful fruit suddenly fell with a "plop" and floated down, landing in Li Che's hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao fruit..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured as he looked at the fruit in his palm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Your daughter is born safely, and you have obtained a Dao fruit "Immortal Craft"】</p><p></p><p>【Immortal Craft (Dao fruit): Transcendent craftsmanship, divine inspiration, unparalleled skills】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The words flashed and appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che focused his gaze, and his mood suddenly became turbulent.</p><p></p><p>After coming to this world for nineteen years, he had never obtained a "godly power", but now, with the birth of his daughter, the godly power appeared in such a way.</p><p></p><p>Is it because of the daughter's worth?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was overjoyed, the name of the Dao fruit sounded so grand, and it must be able to become his capital for establishing a foothold in this world.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was delighted, the prompt in front of him changed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Name: Li Che】</p><p>【Bonds: Li Nuanxi (daughter)】</p><p>【Dao Fruit: Immortal Craft (not yet matured, lv1, 0%)】</p><p>【Prompt: For every year the bonded object (daughter) grows up safely, the Dao tree can bear one Dao fruit】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Breathing slightly hurried, Li Che stared blankly at the prompt in front of him, his mood violently fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>For every year his daughter grows up safely, the Dao tree can bear a Dao fruit...</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's simple and unsophisticated understanding, the function of the Dao fruit is equivalent to imparting a skill, a talent to him.</p><p></p><p>The current Li Che works as a helper in a wood carving shop outside the outer city of Feiluo, carrying and moving the finished wood carvings. It's hard labor, but he gets paid by the piece, which is fair. </p><p></p><p>However, after a hard day's work, exhausted, he can only earn about thirty to forty large casting bronze coins, which is enough to support his family, but to become rich and have his family live in luxury is just a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>But from now on, if he lets his daughter grow up safely, and a Dao fruit is produced every year, perhaps everything will be different! "Xuanxi is my daughter, and I should protect her and let her grow up safely, this is what I should do as a father..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled happily, the birth of his daughter has brought him good fortune, and there is hope for the future, how could he not be overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After the Dao fruit in his palm gradually dissolved, Li Che did not notice any changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>He studied the "Immortal Craft" Dao fruit, but had no clue.</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle gurgle..."</p><p></p><p>The boiling and bubbling crucian carp soup in the pot interrupted Li Che's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He quickly poured a bowl of the fragrant, white and rich crucian carp and tofu soup, took a deep breath, and with a smile on his lips, carefully carried the steaming hot soup towards the earthen house.</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya had already fed Xuanxi, and was now contentedly drinking the crucian carp soup Li Che had cooked.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxi was being held by Li Che, and under the guidance of Grandma Lei, she was gently patting the tender back, which was called burping.</p><p></p><p>After bustling around in the earthen house for a while, Grandma Lei gave Li Che some tips on raising the baby, and then prepared to take her leave.</p><p></p><p>After handing Xuanxi back to Zhang Ya, Li Che followed Grandma Lei.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma Lei, thank you, thank you so much, you've worked hard." Li Che handed Grandma Lei ten coins.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Lei waved her hand and sighed, "Che'er, Grandma has watched you grow up since you were little. You work hard carrying the heavy wood materials and sculptures for Xu's wood carving shop, earning some hard-earned money, so keep this money and take good care of your family."</p><p></p><p>"In this outer city... there have been fewer children born recently, and many have died young. You must take good care of Xuanxi and pay attention to safety."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Lei's words made Li Che's expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma..."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Lei wrapped her head with a cloth, carrying a bamboo basket, braving the wind and snow, and advised, "Remember, don't take the child out on the streets casually, and if you encounter those who worship child gods... who burn incense... you must stay far away."</p><p></p><p>"The times are not easy, children are prone to dying young, you parents... must be extra careful."</p><p></p><p>In the cold winter wind and snow, Li Che exhaled a white breath and solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>His heart sank a little, indeed, there had been news of many children dying recently.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now that he was a father, he naturally had to be more concerned.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Grandma Lei."</p><p></p><p>Li Che responded in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Grandma Lei didn't say anything else, she sighed and tightened her cotton clothes, and disappeared into the snowy alley in front of the earthen houses, gradually vanishing into the night.</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched Grandma Lei's figure disappear, then turned and went back to the earthen house, quickly sealing the cracks to prevent the heat from escaping.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his hands, he added some charcoal to the stove, then went to the kitchen to bring the remaining fish soup.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the husband and wife had eaten and drunk their fill, Li Che climbed onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>Gently patting his sleeping daughter who had just drunk milk, Li Che squinted his eyes, unable to suppress the smile at the corners of his lips.</p><p></p><p>Speaking softly with his wife Zhang Ya, Zhang Ya, perhaps a little tired from giving birth, fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che stared wide-eyed, murmuring softly with great spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The charcoal is used up again, I'll go find the charcoal seller tomorrow to buy some more, Xixia just born, can't let her freeze."</p><p></p><p>"Wife must rest well during the confinement period, or she'll get postpartum illness..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll go to the wood carving shop tomorrow to get more statues, the demand for statues in the inner city has suddenly increased a lot, there's plenty of work, can earn a lot of money."</p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely work hard to save up money to buy a big mansion, so we can be warm even in the bitter cold."</p><p></p><p>"Wife, don't worry, our days will only get better and better..."</p><p></p><p>On the bed, Li Che gently embraced his wife and daughter, closing his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>His breathing was faint and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>Li Che got up early, watched as his wife Zhang Ya ate the breakfast he had prepared, patted the burp of their daughter Xixia after she finished her milk, then put on his hat and left the earthen house.</p><p></p><p>The ground was white, the wind biting cold, the snowflakes as big as hands.</p><p></p><p>The frigid air pierced like knives.</p><p></p><p>The heavy snow showed no signs of stopping, piling up thick layers on the ground outside the Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>After walking for several miles, braving the gloomy sky and the wind and snow, he arrived at his workplace, Xu's Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>Though called a "shop", it was actually a huge mansion, extremely spacious inside, with piles of wood for wood carving.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was one of the many hired workers, mainly responsible for transporting the wood materials or the finished wood carvings for the master carvers.</p><p></p><p>The wood carvings varied in weight, but the pay was uniform - five large cast copper coins for each time he carried a wood carving, and just one copper coin for carrying wood.</p><p></p><p>The main risk was in carrying the wood carvings - if he accidentally bumped or damaged them, the money would be deducted entirely.</p><p></p><p>Shaking off the snow on his body, taking off his hat and placing it at his workstation, Li Che entered the wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>A charcoal stove was burning inside, the temperature comfortable, the rich scent of wood materials wafting about.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, go get me a piece of 'willow' wood, a larger one, and also help me move the 'Six-Eyed Bodhisattva' statue I carved three days ago to the inner room, someone from the inner city will come to collect it in a few days, if the snow melts, it'll get soaked in water and not look good."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che entered, an old man in a cotton jacket, with white whiskers and a ruddy complexion, called out to him, holding a shiny wine gourd filled with aged yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master Chen." Li Che smiled brightly and quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>As a familiar worker in the shop, diligent and skilled, never having any accidents in transporting the wood carvings, he had a great reputation.</p><p></p><p>So a few of the wood carving masters had become acquainted with him and would specifically assign tasks to him.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen was one of Li Che's main patrons.</p><p></p><p>After responding to Master Chen, Li Che turned and entered the spacious courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The heavy snow had covered the many wood materials scattered in the courtyard, taking some effort to finally locate the area where the 'willow' wood was.</p><p></p><p>Selecting a larger piece, Li Che dragged it out, tied it up with a hemp rope, tested the weight, then patted the wood and headed towards the corner of the courtyard where the finished wood carvings were.</p><p></p><p>Since the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva" that Master Chen mentioned was something Li Che was responsible for transporting, he knew exactly where it was located.</p><p></p><p>Finding the wood carving buried under the snow, about the size of an adult, also carved from 'willow' wood, Li Che brushed away the snow on it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a strange feeling arose in his heart - the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva" wood carving seemed to have come alive, the six eyes blinking at him from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Then, hazy images emerged in his mind - scenes of Master Chen wielding the knife, carving the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva" - Li Che felt as if he was experiencing it himself, merging with Master Chen.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the carving techniques and skills used to create this Six-Eyed Bodhisattva seemed to have become integrated into Li Che's own...instincts!</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The vision before him dissipated, the Six-Eyed Bodhisattva no longer blinking, and Li Che's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>His heart stirred - just by touching the wood carving, he seemed to have learned Master Chen's carving techniques...</p><p></p><p>This must be related to the "Immortal Craftsmanship" divine ability he had gained yesterday when his daughter Xixia was born!</p><p></p><p>"The wondrous Immortal Craftsmanship, a divine touch, unparalleled skills..."</p><p></p><p>"The effects of the Immortal Craftsmanship divine ability... may give me a chance to truly become a master wood carver!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed with ambition, his heart filled with newfound aspirations.</p><p></p><p>If he could become a master wood carver at Xu's Wood Carving Shop, it would be far more promising than just being a worker transporting wood and carvings. Allowing his family to live a good life in these chaotic times would no longer be just a dream!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

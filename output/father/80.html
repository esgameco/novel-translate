        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The sobbing, crying laughter contained an extremely strong anger.</p><p></p><p>But even more terrifying and emotionally uncontrollable was the mysterious, shrill scream.</p><p></p><p>Frenzied screams, deranged screams, screams that shook the soul!</p><p></p><p>Alternating between distant and near.</p><p></p><p>Bursting in the ear like thunderclaps! Then erupting from afar, like the shriek of a ghost! It was a very strange feeling, as if the air between heaven and earth had become heavy and scorching, as if someone had raised their palm and grasped all the air, compressing it into massive, heavy blocks that pressed down mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Yang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyelids lifted slightly, his gaze clear.</p><p></p><p>"He has arrived, as expected. For these great figures accustomed to standing atop Feileicheng, a single guess is enough..."</p><p></p><p>The identity of the Ox Demon may have been guessed by some, but they could not be certain it was Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too exaggerated...</p><p></p><p>What power did the Ox Demon possess? Able to easily slaughter the divine cultivators whose nature was as gentle as a river.</p><p></p><p>And what about Li Che? Although he was a master wood carver, the strength he had displayed was only at the level of bone refining completion, with his divine cultivation just beginning. His cultivation time was only about three years!</p><p></p><p>The gap was simply heaven and earth, completely incomparable to the ruthless Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>But often, a single guess... is enough reason to take action.</p><p></p><p>The Chess Saint's Dao Fruit Network contracted, enveloping the entire courtyard, shielding the piercing screams, so that the fleeting [Heart Startled Firm] divine energy between heaven and earth would not affect the people in the house.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, Xi Xi, and... Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>They were all too weak now.</p><p></p><p>Facing the divine foundation cultivator's divine energy... they could easily be completely disturbed in mind and spirit, suffering calamity.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, taking down the hat hanging on the wall of the study, and with a tug on his black outfit, revealed the elastic black clothes underneath. Then, with his fingers together, he tore open space and dropped a cute ox-faced mask, covering his face.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Yang was a divine foundation cultivator, so Li Che naturally still felt pressure.</p><p></p><p>Could he now fight against a divine foundation cultivator?</p><p></p><p>The mechanisms and hidden weapons empowered by the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit, entering the Angry Vajra state, were enough to match the physique of a Mysterious Vein martial artist, mastering three types of divine energy, two levels of river-like cultivation...</p><p></p><p>Was it enough?</p><p></p><p>Xu You had once said that divine foundation and river-like cultivation were a gap in realm, an insurmountable gap.</p><p></p><p>Unless the cultivation method he practiced, the divine energy he condensed... was of an extremely high realm! Otherwise, he had no qualifications to challenge a divine foundation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Settling his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling like thunder.</p><p></p><p>The figure of Li Che, transformed into the Ox Demon, blurred and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Then, he was already outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body "exploded" and expanded by a circle, his blood and qi surging, looking towards the distance, where Li Qingshan in a blue robe stood at the alley entrance, nodding slightly at him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Old Master Li had returned...</p><p></p><p>With an old master guarding the rear, Li Che's heart relaxed considerably.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed to worry about the safety of Zhang Ya, Xi Xi, and Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>He could let loose.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into the Ox Demon, Li Che's body grew to two meters tall, under the Vajra transformation, his blood and qi constantly boiling.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his fists towards Li Qingshan, then bent his knees, and when he stood up straight again,</p><p></p><p>He had already shot off like an arrow released from the bowstring, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the Ox Demon left.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi poked his head out from the courtyard and ran to Li Qingshan's side.</p><p></p><p>Patting the big head with the Nezha braid, he looked puzzled at the old man: "Master, aren't you going to take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Just let the Ox Demon deal with Old Master Yang by himself?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a divine foundation cultivator, after all..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan patted Lu Chi's big head, the familiar touch making him feel at ease: "It's fine, let him try. I'll be the backup."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the divine foundation of the Yang family is not as talented as the divine foundation cultivators on the Lingnan Dao Cloud State rankings, although he cultivates the Nine Sun Cultivation, the divine foundation he has just barely formed is only at the tenth level, his realm suppression power is not that strong..."</p><p></p><p>"And the Yang family ancestor participated in ambushing me and was beaten by me, carrying injuries, the Ox Demon may not be able to defeat him... With his concealment ability, he can still escape if he wants to."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stretched and said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? They dared to ambush you, Master? How dare they! Why didn't you just kill them all?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Chi was suddenly surprised, raising his big head to look at Li Qingshan, as if puzzled by the old man's gentle way of handling things.</p><p></p><p>"That Cao Guang... has a problem, a big problem..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's gaze flickered, seeming a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"But it's fine, I've already communicated with my main divine entity, and it's rushing here at full speed."</p><p></p><p>"Once the divine entity returns, I'll definitely be the first to..."</p><p></p><p>"Smash him to death."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the inner city of Feilei City, the gloomy clouds had gathered for a long time, and the winter thunder suddenly boomed. </p><p></p><p>Once again, fine drizzle like cattle hair fell from the sky, mixed with flurries of snow. Drifting and drifting, it shrouded the entire world in a haze, but this haze was suddenly torn and shredded by a series of piercing, agonizing screams.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible sword was wildly dancing and slicing through the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>A figure with completely white hair, burly and robust, walked like a mountain of flesh down the long street. With each step, the entire blue stone street trembled and shook, and every quiver of flesh and blood seemed to be accompanied by countless twisted, shrill cries of shock and alarm.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer did not cover his face with a mask, his white hair scattered, his figure as towering as a mountain. </p><p></p><p>The flow of his qi and blood intertwined, seeming to transform into a roaring dragon.</p><p></p><p>His scarlet eyes appeared to be oozing bloody tears, filled with pain, sorrow, and even more so, murderous intent...</p><p></p><p>The Yang family... had almost been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>His obedient grandson, Yang Kaihe, who had the most hope of forging a divine foundation... had been killed.</p><p></p><p>All the experts of the Yang family had been killed off!</p><p></p><p>His family's century-old undertaking had ended in failure...</p><p></p><p>He was in so much pain! He had just sent Yang Kaihe to the Xu family to capture a spirit child, how could he have died?</p><p></p><p>With so many experts in the Yang family, how could they have been completely wiped out? How could his family's century-old undertaking have... dissipated into thin air? Only he, an old man, was left, the family was gone.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon... Ox Demon!!!"</p><p></p><p>The low roar burst forth from the throat of the Yang family patriarch. His body suddenly swelled up like an inflated balloon, growing larger and larger!</p><p></p><p>A divine foundation the size of a millstone appeared behind him, constantly emanating the divine nature of "Shock and Hardness". The divine nature almost condensed into substance, like the tentacles of an octopus, gradually falling onto the robust old man's body like a mountain of flesh, piercing into his flesh and blood, causing his consciousness to descend into madness.</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>With each step, the blue stone street sank, forming sunken footprints and spider web-like cracks.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he walked on.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind dense footprints and cracks.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The foot that was about to step down stopped abruptly, and the ripples of the splashed rainwater, as if congealed, spread and rippled towards the surroundings, freezing in the air.</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the Yang family, the Qi Condensation cultivator Yang Jing, suddenly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>His white hair flew, his scarlet eyes staring fixedly at the long street.</p><p></p><p>There...</p><p></p><p>A towering figure in black clothes, wearing a hat, stood quietly in the wind and rain on the long street.</p><p></p><p>The hat was raised, revealing a cute, wet ox-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon—!!!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired, robust old patriarch of the Yang family, Yang Jing, opened his mouth and let out a piercing, horrifying scream! Countless raindrops, countless water droplets bouncing on the ground, scattered into a hazy water mist under the high-decibel, terrifying scream!</p><p></p><p>"Mm... It's me."</p><p></p><p>The hat, mask, black clothes, the towering Ox Demon, the intertwining of qi and blood, faced the convulsing, roaring old patriarch of the Yang family.</p><p></p><p>He responded calmly, as if casually greeting a neighbor.</p><p></p><p>The convulsing scream abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing's scarlet eyes, controlled by the "Shock and Hardness", seemed to be slightly stuck and hesitant at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, the ubiquitous shrill screams burst forth, creating a brilliant air impact wave like a dragon, shattering the dense rain.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Ox Demon!"</p><p>"The Ox Demon who killed my whole family!"</p><p></p><p>As if the air was twisted and blurred.</p><p></p><p>The divine foundation millstone-like Yang Jing rose behind him, his disheveled hair and violent ferocity like a mountain blocking the sky.</p><p></p><p>Blocking all the light, it suddenly appeared above the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The pile of fatty fists thundered and crashed against the Ox Demon's crossed arms! Ripping and tearing...</p><p></p><p>The sleeves of the elastic clothes burst open, revealing the steel-like muscles that were as dense as a dragon. But...</p><p></p><p>Yang Jing's crazed will, stimulated by the divine nature, slightly paused, his blood-red eyes widening slightly...</p><p></p><p>Because, the Ox Demon in front of him, who had not yet forged a divine foundation, had actually...</p><p></p><p>Withstood his punch without budging an inch!</p>

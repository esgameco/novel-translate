        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Resounding fame, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, he was appointed as the Garrison Commander of the Nine Prefectures, overseeing each island, wielding the authority of the summer decree, and guarding the divine protector.</p><p></p><p>The great general who banishes evil and slays ghosts, the iron-faced divine lord of the Zhongnan Mountains, the Celestial Venerable who sweeps away demonic miasmas.</p><p></p><p>This is the Precious Edict of Zhong Kui.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the matter of subduing ghosts, Li Che felt that this divine deity was most suitable.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he would allow him free rein, which would be a good opportunity to try carving out the various deities that had emerged in his mind...</p><p></p><p>Whether he could, like that day, carve out the crimson sash-wielding Third Prince who swept through the four seas, and further enhance the maturity of his [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Brother Li, you must remember to cultivate that book, the 'Great Celestial Seven-Element Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique'," Upper Guan Qinghong hurriedly reminded him as he took on the task.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's only the first volume, if you want to be promoted to the rank of Second-Class Guest Attendant, you must reach at least the minor accomplishment level in this Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned, this divine sculpture technique... he had not yet studied it.</p><p></p><p>After all, since he had mastered the [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao fruit, Li Che felt that the divine sculpture technique wouldn't be of much use, as it was just carving, right?</p><p></p><p>With the [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao fruit, the unparalleled artistry it provided, the divine sculpture technique shouldn't be of much help to him.</p><p></p><p>Upper Guan Qinghong thought for a moment and said, "The divine sculpture technique cannot be simply seen as just wood carving skills, but rather it was created by the Grand Supervisor of the Eight Treasure Pavilion of the Divine Celestial Monitoring Bureau. It is not just the divine sculpture technique, but other professions' divine elixir techniques, divine weapon techniques, and so on, were all created by the Grand Supervisor..."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, they occupy an important position in the evaluation. Even if you can carve out a nine-star divine nature wood sculpture, if your proficiency in this divine sculpture technique is not up to par, you will not be able to pass the Second-Class Guest Attendant assessment."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che became more attentive and decided to study it carefully.</p><p></p><p>After accepting the task, Li Che directly left the Celestial Monitoring Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Leaving early or not, it really didn't matter much, as Li Che, being a Guest Attendant, didn't have overly strict on-duty rules.</p><p></p><p>Li Che accepted the task and went to the workshop to carve a wood sculpture, which was perfectly reasonable.</p><p></p><p>First, he went to the wood material warehouse and obtained a piece of the sacred red wood material needed to make the Zhong Kui wood sculpture statue, and then returned to the workshop courtyard within the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Closing the door, Li Che placed the sacred wood he had obtained, and then with a stirring of his mind, the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit trembled, and the celestial chessboard instantly expanded to encompass the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>If there were any abnormalities in the vicinity, he would be able to sense them immediately.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not start carving the wood sculpture yet.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he began his daily martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a Third-Class Guest Attendant, Li Che had obtained a medicinal pill from the resources, which was the "Great Celestial Angry Xuanjiang Blood Martial Pill", using genuine Angry Xuanjiang blood, not impure blood.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the medicinal properties of the pill were extremely potent, and Upper Guan Qinghong was even worried that his physique might not be able to withstand it, so he instructed Li Che to crush the pill and take it in three doses.</p><p></p><p>But how could Li Che's extraordinary physique not be able to withstand it? After swallowing one Angry Xuanjiang Blood Martial Pill, Li Che's stomach lining churned, crushing the medicinal coating and releasing the overwhelming medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>Inhale...</p><p>Exhale...</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Che stood in the spring breeze, eyes closed, recalling the divine martial art "Furious True Lord Three Saber Blades" in his mind. In the next moment, he opened his eyes and clenched his fists...</p><p></p><p>The nine-star divine weapon, the blood-stained shocking spear, immediately emerged from the Primordial Space, grasped in his hand, and with a violent shake, the spear shaft let out a roar like an angry Xuanjiang!</p><p></p><p>Then, with both hands gripping the spear, using it as the Three Saber Blades, he began to perform the dance.</p><p></p><p>With the enhanced cultivation talent brought by the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao fruit, Li Che's comprehension of martial arts was extremely fast, and he could master even divine martial arts quickly.</p><p></p><p>The Furious True Lord Three Saber Blades had been his main focus of cultivation during this period.</p><p></p><p>As Li Che immersed himself in it, the movements of the long spear became faster and faster, and countless surging airflows shot out in the courtyard, parting as the spear moved.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thrust out a spear, tearing out a fine, long blade of light over a meter long in mid-air, and Li Che's whole body steamed, shrouded in white mist in the crisp spring air.</p><p></p><p>"The Furious True Lord Three Saber Blades... has reached mastery!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled, the corners of his lips slightly upturned, and the nine large tendons on his back gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>In his dantian, the martial pill had been refined by the powerful gastric juices, and the surging medicinal power rolled and turned, transforming into a qi blood that pushed and impacted his four limbs and hundred bones, forming a rapidly moving mysterious inner qi from the top of his head to the soles of his feet.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's whole body of bones and joints clamored, as if the joints were colliding with each other, like the friction of metal.</p><p></p><p>His tendons and bones were too strong, and the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] was slowly transforming his flesh, meridians, and bones, gradually evolving towards the "Dragon Sinews Elephant Bones Golden Vajra Body". The divine meridian... was almost ready.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes to sense the inner qi, he felt his whole body was transparent, and his meridians seemed to be connected as one, and with just a thought, he could run a small heavenly cycle!</p><p></p><p>"The divine meridian technique requires cultivating a martial art to the realm of enlightenment, integrating the realm into one's daily cultivation, rather than just displaying the realm of enlightenment during combat and fighting. When every movement and action is imbued with the divine, then it is the divine meridian!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, and the realm of the divine meridian, the qi blood would also undergo several changes with the integration of the realm.</p><p></p><p>The more changes the qi blood underwent, the stronger the divine meridian would be, and it would also determine the strength after breaking through to the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the realm of the divine meridian is highly valued in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>A Grandmaster needs to cultivate a true essence supreme skill, commanding the divine meridian of the martial arts they have cultivated to the realm of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the true essence, integrating it into the qi blood, freely controlling it, then one would be a true Qi Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand, and the inner qi gushed out from his fingertips, possessing extremely formidable destructive power.</p><p></p><p>This was the characteristic of the mysterious meridian, the inner qi could be externally released and erupted, although only within a distance of one zhang around him, but the destructive power was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have a high-quality Xuanjiang martial pill to assist me, in half a month, I should be able to reach the complete mysterious meridian, and have the qualifications to assault the divine meridian..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the shocking spear and stretched, as if firecrackers were exploding without stopping.</p><p></p><p>With a stirring of his mind, the qi blood was all withdrawn, and his robust physique gradually concealed under the elastic clothing, only the faintly outlined lines revealing Li Che's extraordinary physique.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the martial art, Li Che began to cultivate the divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord technique, which had reached the divine foundation realm, after being completely stabilized, would then automatically draw divine nature from the heavens and earth to enhance itself.</p><p></p><p>As for the [Sobbing Subdue Ghost], [Heart Startled Firm], and [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword] - these three divine techniques had reached a certain level of cultivation, and he could prepare to forge the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>As for the [Chaotic Joy Bewilder Spirit], since Li Che had not spent much effort on it, the progress was a bit slow.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no hurry, he would wait until the other three had forged the divine foundation before considering it.</p><p></p><p>After consolidating his divine cultivation for a while, Li Che sat back down in the chair, brewed a cup of hot tea, and took out the book "Great Celestial Seven-Element Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture Technique (Volume 1)".</p><p></p><p>Turning to the preface written by the Grand Supervisor, he then carefully read through the main text.</p><p></p><p>As he read, Li Che couldn't help but become immersed in it, his expression changing from time to time, sometimes in awe, sometimes in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Closing the book, Li Che closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The divine sculpture technique... is not just a wood carving skill, but rather a fusion of divine technique secrets and divine martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine technique secrets are of the seventh-grade rank, and are called the divine sculpture technique..."</p><p></p><p>"And the divine martial arts are supreme skills, known as the 'Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture'!"</p><p></p><p>"To reach the standard, one must attain the same level of proficiency in both the divine technique secrets and the divine martial arts..."</p><p></p><p>"Where the iron-shod feet have never trodden, the gain comes without effort..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had always been looking for a true essence supreme skill, and now... it had been handed to him on a silver platter.</p><p></p><p>With a true essence supreme skill, he would have the opportunity to assault the Grandmaster realm of the martial dao! The [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] in his chest seemed to sense his thoughts and began to beat rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The details of the "Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture" divine martial arts flowed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Che opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it is a true essence supreme skill, I went through it three times in my mind, but still couldn't even enter the initial stage... It seems I'll have to go through it a few more times!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was somewhat amazed. Even for an excellent martial art, after simulating it three times in his mind, he would usually be able to enter the initial stage. After all, the cultivation talent granted by the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Dao fruit was indeed remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not carve the sculpture either, but immersed himself completely in the cultivation of the supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze blew, the willow trees swayed.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to roll by quickly like sand under the caress of the wind.</p><p></p><p>In half a month, Li Che's days had become quite routine.</p><p></p><p>In the daytime, he would go to the Celestial Monitoring Bureau to work for an hour, then leave and go to the workshop courtyard to carve the "Furious-Eyed Zhong Kui Subduing Ghost Statue", while also cultivating the supreme skill and comprehending the divine technique secrets.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Li Che's talent in the divine technique secrets was indeed average, and after half a month, he had only just barely entered the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>But the "Thousand-Hand Divine Sculpture" supreme skill, he had entered the initial stage on the second day of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The spring rain drizzled, for early spring was the rainy season, the rain never stopping, the melancholy never dispersing.</p><p></p><p>In the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's qi blood surged, and in an instant, he swung out an arm, with countless illusory images layering upon each other, densely packed, making it impossible to tell which hand was real and which was false.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Fingers clenched, he ruthlessly slapped down, and it was as if a cowhide drum had been struck on the surface, erupting with an earth-shattering rumble, the air beneath his palm seemingly sunken down several inches!</p><p></p><p>The power contained in this palm strike, if it were to hit a person's body, an ordinary mysterious meridian martial artist would have their internal organs shattered! Even a divine meridian martial artist would likely be unable to withstand it, at the very least severely injured.</p><p></p><p>However, to land this palm strike on an opponent...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The key point was that the opponent was not a dumb wooden sculpture standing still, allowing him to take a photo.</p><p></p><p>"Phew--"</p><p></p><p>The surging blood qi roared like a furnace, with countless illusory arms, layer upon layer, converging back into the body, like Thousand-Armed Guanyin folding her palms, mysterious and enchanting.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly as he exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme skill of the Thousand-Armed Divine Sculpture... has been mastered to a small degree!"</p><p></p><p>"However, it will only get more and more difficult from here on. Reaching the advanced level is the key, as its destructive power may even rival that of a supreme martial art cultivated to the Transcendent Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, the turbulent airflow gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then sat down on a chair and began to carve at the workbench.</p><p></p><p>It had been half a month, and the Zhong Kui statue was finally about to be completed. It wasn't that he didn't want to do it quickly, but...</p><p></p><p>When the carving overlapped almost completely with the image of Zhong Kui in his mind, each stroke of the knife became extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>When he was carving the Third Prince, he could do it so smoothly. Li Che felt it was related to the divine nature of the temple god in the Nine Dragon River tributary...</p><p></p><p>However, this "Wrathful Zhong Kui Statue Subduing Ghosts" that was almost at the level of the Nine Luminaries had already been considered complete, with only a few details left to be polished.</p><p></p><p>As the last shaving of wood was removed, the divine nature in the heaven and earth began to converge unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>The Zhong Kui statue made of tenth-grade spiritual wood and red blood sandalwood, which appeared blood-red, actually began to faintly glow...</p><p></p><p>The howling, wailing winds around it never ceased, as if there were angry roars of "Waya waya", and the vague, towering silhouette of a leopard-headed, iron-faced, brow-wrinkled figure flickered and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stepped back two paces, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His eyes shone brightly as he looked at the divinely carved wooden sculpture, which gradually merged with the shape in his mind, feeling somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"The great general who banishes evil and slays ghosts, the wrathful subduer of ghosts, invulnerable to a myriad of spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che brushed the wood chips off himself, his gaze returning to normal, with a smile on his face, quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsmanship (LV3, 78%)]</p><p></p><p>Wow! A direct increase of 10% in maturity. This confirmed his original idea.</p><p></p><p>When carving a divine image that overlapped with his own memory, he could indeed gain an extra boost in Dao Fruit maturity.</p><p></p><p>Good news...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao Fruit, which was getting closer and closer to LV4, Li Che's mood couldn't help but be stirred up.</p><p></p><p>LV4 Immortal Craftsmanship... what kind of transformation would it undergo? In fact, Li Che was also aware that he had bound a karmic connection with Xixie, and with his daughter growing safely by one year, he would be able to obtain a Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The number of Dao Fruits would only increase, and the more there were, the more he couldn't just let them all be evenly distributed.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely have to choose a few specialized Dao Fruits as the main direction for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After storing the Zhong Kui statue in the Spatial Realm, Li Che changed into a clean black robe and left the workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out of the workshop courtyard, Li Che felt a sense of being watched.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family, Qin Haonan... and the Temple Guardians... Divine Envoy Hong Yong and Shi Lei."</p><p></p><p>Li Che remained calm on the surface, but his heart was very peaceful.</p><p></p><p>These three people... had been watching him for nearly half a month.</p><p></p><p>After he came out from seeing the Chief Envoy Zhang Lianhao of the Temple Guardians, the next day, two Divine Envoys started tailing his movements.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't know that under Li Che's Heavenly Earth Chessboard, while they were watching him, he was observing them at a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that they were only tailing him, Li Che did not make a move. It was just that his schedule had been very regular these past few days, which could help dispel the thoughts of the Qin family and the Temple Guardians.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital, Li Che still maintained the image of being kind to others, not harming those who don't harm him.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to wait peacefully for Xixie to participate in the Spiritual Sect's entry examination, and that was all.</p><p></p><p>Back in the small courtyard, the sky had darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's footsteps paused for a moment. Outside the courtyard, in addition to the surveillance of Qin Haonan and the Divine Envoys from the Temple Guardians, there were also many gazes sweeping over from the alleys around the Hear Flower Lane.</p><p></p><p>They were from the local gangs in this street market area.</p><p></p><p>The imperial capital was much larger than Fei Lei City. Even in Fei Lei City, there were some gangs that collected protection fees from merchants and exploited the people.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the imperial capital, where gangs were rampant. Among them, a few large gangs were not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>The imperial capital had three major gangs: the Fishing Gang, the Black Crocodile Gang, and the Beggar's Gang.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Fishing Gang had a strong presence because the imperial capital was built along the Nine Dragon River, and the river's tributaries ran through the entire city, making water resources very abundant.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there were many people engaged in the fishing industry, and the Fishing Gang naturally became a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>The gang keeping an eye on their small courtyard was not one of the major gangs like the Fishing Gang, but a gang called the "Black Snake Gang". Within this gang, there was a Divine Foundation Realm cultivator stationed.</p><p></p><p>This Black Snake Gang had placed many people disguised as various merchants and customers outside the Hear Flower Lane, and many small stalls had changed faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't know whose knife this Black Snake Gang was, because for the major powers in the imperial capital, gangs were like commodities, constantly changing hands.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che was also a bit puzzled, because Qin Haonan from the Qin family was already personally tailing him, so there was no need for a gang to watch him as well.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Li Che thought, "Could it be the Golden Rift Sect?"</p><p></p><p>As one of the five major sects in the imperial capital, the Golden Rift Sect was slightly lower in status than the Spiritual Sect's branch sects, after all, the Spiritual Sect's branch sects were backed by the Primal Chaos Sect, a truly formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Those who could compete with the Spiritual Sect's branch sects in the imperial capital were only the Temple Guardians and the Astrology Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Sect was only on par with the Five Great Families.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt that the powers he had provoked in the imperial capital were just the Qin family...</p><p></p><p>And the Golden Rift Sect could also be considered half of it, after all, the rumors said that Qin Yuqing had some unclear relationship with the Golden Rift Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>So investigating him was understandable.</p><p></p><p>The gangs were just daggers in the hands of the great figures of the imperial capital families, the sickles that reaped the fat and blood of the imperial capital's people.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's senses were constantly exploring. These gangs might be wary of his identity as an Astrology Bureau Envoy, as well as Xixie's status as a Spiritual Sect disciple-in-training.</p><p></p><p>They only dared to secretly investigate, responsible for surveillance, and had no intention of making a move.</p><p></p><p>He quietly returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xixie was practicing punches, her blood qi surging, her divine nature fluctuating. Her small frame actually possessed tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned. Wow, this little girl... had she already reached the Tempering the Bones realm? At such a young age? Without taking any elixirs, she had stepped into the Tempering the Bones realm at the age of three? And her divine nature had also reached the level of Cultivating the Nature like a Stream...</p><p></p><p>This talent in the martial dao and divine nature...</p><p></p><p>If he, the father, didn't have any Dao Fruits, he would really be suppressed by this little girl! No wonder she is my daughter Li Che's!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled up in a smile.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, who was beside her chewing on a dry tobacco pipe guiding Xixie, had already fallen into silence. This old man had seen a lot in his life, but he was stunned by this freak.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi had also come over, looking at the Tempering the Bones Xixie, constantly scratching his big head, pouting.</p><p></p><p>So this is an exceptional spiritual child? No... even an exceptional spiritual child wouldn't have this kind of speed.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi was nine years old now. What was he doing when he was three? Oh, he was still drinking milk.</p><p></p><p>At that time, not to mention Cultivating the Nature like a Stream, he hadn't even gathered his Cultivating the Nature.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that people are jealous of people's deaths.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the one suppressing him was Xixie.</p><p></p><p>Li Che saw Lü Chi's expression and smiled, knowing that this little guy had been coming to their home every day to stand up for their family, after learning that he had been taken away by the Temple Guardians for investigation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the gang that was keeping an eye on them, Li Che casually asked about the Golden Rift Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Rift Sect? They definitely wouldn't dare to touch you. You are the students our teacher recommended, and for that Golden Rift Sect Grand Elder, Gold Xuan, even ten times his courage wouldn't be enough to dare touch you..."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the power of the Spiritual Sect, just our teacher, with that ram's horn hammer, almost smashed that Gold Xuan's head open. That guy sees our teacher like a mouse sees a cat..."Lü Chi said with a laugh as he scratched his big head.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned. In that case, the Black Snake Gang was not arranged by the Golden Rift Sect? Then who was the power behind the surveillance outside? Li Che frowned slightly, it was really a bit confusing. Qin Haonan from the Qin family was personally tailing him, so it shouldn't be him. Li Che had even seen Qin Haonan probing this gang in his Heavenly Earth Chessboard perception...</p><p></p><p>So, which power had brought in this gang? Li Che's eyes darkened slightly, but his heart began to take it more seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya had already prepared the dinner, and she brought it out and placed it in the courtyard. The whole family ate dinner together.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Xixie had stepped into the Tempering the Bones realm, her appetite had become extremely large. The small girl was holding a big bowl, shoveling food into her mouth non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Old Chen clinked cups and drank wine, feeling quite content.</p><p></p><p>The warm spring breeze blew in, comfortable and gentle.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's expression changed slightly, and he furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>Because his sister-in-law was walking quickly towards the courtyard, her face full of worry.</p><p></p><p>"Big Sister, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Ya opened the door, she saw her sister-in-law, Liu Chun'mei, with an uneasy expression.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun'mei looked straight at Li Che, biting her lip: "Ahe, your brother-in-law... has not returned home for two days and two nights..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che put down his wine cup, frowning.</p><p></p><p>Brother-in-law Li Zhengran? The divine nature chess piece he had left on Li Zhengran did not indicate that he was in any danger to his life.</p><p></p><p>No danger to his life...</p><p></p><p>Then why had his brother-in-law not returned home for two days and two nights?</p><p></p><p>(Please support the author by reading on the original platform.

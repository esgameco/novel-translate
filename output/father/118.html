        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>February 21st.</p><p></p><p>Spring Equinox, light rain.</p><p></p><p>The road leading from Jinguang Prefecture to the Qianyuan Shenzong Fenzong Mountain Gate was completely congested, with the narrow road sections seeing vehicles overtaking each other, neither side willing to give way.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, Zhang Ya, Grandma Su, and Xixia were seated in one carriage. Xixia was lively and energetic, her mood very excited. </p><p></p><p>She did not feel at all that participating in the Shenzong examination was something to be nervous about, as if she was just going out for a spring outing, full of curiosity and interest in new things.</p><p></p><p>She looked out the carriage window at the dense line of vehicles, as well as the many figures walking and leading children, constantly exclaiming in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Father, there are so many people!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia was seeing this many people for the first time, feeling very amazed - so there could be this many people in the world! "The number of people participating in the examination this year has indeed increased quite a bit compared to previous years," Grandma Su said affectionately, a hint of reluctance in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>After today, Xixia would have to enter Shenzong, going up to the towering azure peak, and the days of her returning home would be fewer.</p><p></p><p>However, Grandma Su could have Li Qingshan take her to visit Xixia, which would dispel some of her worries.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan said that this year's examination seems to be related to the mysterious Siyu Temple in the middle of the Jiulong River outside the prefecture, and while it involves risks related to the mysterious temple, it also has great opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Grandma Su said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes revealed a worried expression: "Related to that mysterious Siyu Temple? That's too dangerous, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"But Xixia can't not go to Shenzong..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes were full of conflict as she turned to look at Li Che, asking for help.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, since Shenzong dares to open the Siyu Temple to test these children, they must have some methods. Li Qingshan said that Shenzong Fenzong has mobilized the [Prison Lotus Windfire Golden Light Wheel], which is one of the Four Sovereign Divine Weapons! </p><p></p><p>It's clearly being taken very seriously, and since they dare to open it, they must be confident, it's not their first time doing this."</p><p></p><p>Since Li Che said there was no problem, Zhang Ya believed him. She just blindly believed in Li Che like that.</p><p></p><p>"The carriage is completely stuck, we won't be able to go much further... Let's just walk there instead."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the sky and said.</p><p></p><p>If they got stuck on the road and missed the time, that would be bad.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Che had this idea, the people in the other carriages had also gotten out, some leading, some carrying, heading towards the Shenzong mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya and Grandma Su had no objections, they were cultivators, a short walk was nothing to them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carried Xixia, letting her hold open a small oiled paper umbrella, and directly got off the carriage, striding forward, bathing in the spring wind and rain, as if going on a spring outing.</p><p></p><p>After getting off the carriage and walking, their speed actually increased.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, they had passed through the bustling market area of Jinguang Prefecture and arrived at the Shenzong mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>The lush green lawns extended on both sides, swaying with the spring breeze, dotted with glistening rain drops.</p><p></p><p>A conspicuous azure peak rose up, piercing the heavens, and the entire Jinguang Prefecture seemed to be built around this mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, the area around the mountain peak was actually extremely vast.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the towering, majestic azure peak, with verdant vegetation, one could see wisps of blue smoke curling from halfway up the mountain...</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the Jiulong River, a peak suddenly rose up, the main peak of Qianyuan Shenzong's Fenzong in Yunzhou, Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>Around Mount Jingang were many smaller peaks, but they were not very conspicuous, completely overshadowed by Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>Those peaks were the mountain peaks where Shenzong Fenzong's Xianxiang cultivators could establish their cave dwellings.</p><p></p><p>Like Li Qingshan, because he possessed Xianxiang combat strength, he was granted the right to establish a cave dwelling, and his mountain peak was called "Zhenglie Peak".</p><p></p><p>After crossing a stretch of lush green lawn, they saw a huge white jade archway at the foot of Mount Jingang.</p><p></p><p>In front of the archway was a massive open grass field, with a huge and exquisite wooden platform built on it.</p><p></p><p>Around the wooden platform, various powers from Jinguang Prefecture had occupied their own areas, the Five Great Families - the Qin, Gong, Hai, Shangguan, and Gongyang Families - all attaching great importance, not only bringing their family heads, but also their venerable Shenxiang elders.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Shenxiang elder of the Qin Family, Qin Dikun, was seated in the Qin Family's area, his eyelids lowered, sitting in the high position.</p><p></p><p>Beside him were the Qin Family's patriarch Qin Cangand, as well as the second-generation figures like Qin Haonan and Qin Leixiao who were of the same generation as the late Qin Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>The Five Major Sects had also sent representatives.</p><p></p><p>The Jin Lie Gate, Bamboo Forest Academy, Guanchao Pavilion, and Shaxie Forest's powerful cultivators were all present, and while they did not send their Shenxiang elders like the Five Great Families, they did have Xianxiang experts stationed.</p><p></p><p>The Black Crocodile Gang, Beggar's Sect, and other originally three-gang, now two-gang forces had also sent their experts, with the gang leaders of the Black Crocodile Gang and Beggar's Sect also appearing.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shenxiang auras were suppressed, the ripples and collisions between them still formed a terrifying aura, suffocating the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, carrying Xixia, arrived at the open space below the wooden platform, which was already densely packed with people.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lü Chi's big head popped out from the crowd, and today he was wearing the inner disciple robe of Shenzong, a green-blue color that was quite eye-catching, causing many people to subconsciously make way for him.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, Aunt Zhang, and Xixia, come this way, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi waved excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che knew there was special treatment, but he really didn't care about the gazes of the people around him, wearing a gentle smile, using his hidden aura and blood to part the crowd, and followed Lü Chi with his wife, daughter, Grandma Su, his uncle's family, and Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they followed Lü Chi, Shangguan Qinghong suddenly jumped up in the distance, anxiously shouting, "Big Brother Li, I'm over here, there's a good spot here too!"</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Liu He and Hai Chuanying couldn't help but laugh, "I didn't expect Brother Li to have people in Shenzong as well."</p><p></p><p>"That's Lü Chi, Li Qingshan's disciple, one of the three who caused the temple deity resonance last session, with a resonance degree reaching over 65%, he's the one who's still stubbornly cultivating the [Wrathful Three Princes] divine nature, wanting to forge the Six Sovereign [Wrathful Three Princes] divine foundation, learning from his teacher."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying, coming from the Five Great Families' Hai Family, had quite extensive knowledge, and introduced.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li's daughter, seems to be one of the three supreme spirit children under the jurisdiction of the prefecture city, right?" Liu He thought of something and couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Li Nuanxi, a supreme spirit child... but the chance of her becoming a true disciple is not high, she'll probably have to enter the inner sect first, and then slowly strive for true discipleship, she's really too young."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Great Families, as well as the various medium and small families in the prefecture city, have all brought out the spirit children they've been hiding, and it's said that this year there are over fifteen supreme spirit children, while Shenzong only accepts five true disciples."</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Liu He sighed and shook his head, "It's not easy, Feiluo City suffered such an incident, and Brother Li is still able to bring his supreme spirit child daughter to the prefecture city, he's really been through a lot..."</p><p></p><p>"At least being able to enter Shenzong's inner sect is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong, hearing this, suddenly became unhappy, clenching her fists, "My sister Xixia will definitely become a true disciple, you guys don't know how powerful Xixia is!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Chuanying snorted, "A three-year-old little brat who can't even pee properly, how powerful can she be?"</p><p></p><p>"The supreme spirit child of my Hai Family, Hai Chaosheng, the Shenxiang elder had to sacrifice a lot to bring him out, if it wasn't for that temple deity resonance, the elder would have continued to keep him hidden and personally instruct him."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong glanced at Hai Chuanying, you don't know the value of a three-year-old who has attained bone tempering.</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't brag about it in advance, you insignificant wretches...</p><p></p><p>Just wait to be shocked by Xixia the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the stone steps below the Shenzong mountain gate archway.</p><p></p><p>Rows of chairs were arranged, with figures in flowing robes seated, immortal and ethereal, seeming to merge into the spring wind, as the fine rain fell, it was distorted by their invisible spiritual auras before reaching their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"This session is indeed lively... so many people have come, it seems all the talented spirit children in Jinguang Prefecture have been brought here."</p><p></p><p>The old man seated in the main position, white-haired and white-bearded, gently stroking his beard, looked warmly at the densely packed crowd.</p><p></p><p>This person was the patriarch of Qianyuan Shenzong's Yunzhou Fenzong, Nanli Huo, with cultivation so profound it was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it would be lively, after all... the Three Princes Temple has opened its temple deity resonance this time, it might be another twenty years before it opens again, missing this opportunity is equivalent to having no chance for the next twenty years to obtain the Three Princes Temple's divine inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan lazily sat in a chair, speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, you're really ruthless, you just returned to the prefecture city and started swinging your mace, forcing out an Eighth Extreme Corpse Deity User from the Corpse Deity Sect, almost causing a great disaster!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Qingshan finished speaking, a scholarly-looking gaunt old man in the distance suddenly shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was immediately displeased, "What do you mean 'almost causing a great disaster'? Don't you all know what kind of thing the Corpse Deity Sect's Corpse Deity Users are? You let them roam and seduce and corrupt the various powers in the prefecture city..."</p><p></p><p>"That is the real disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you not know the situation in Jizhou? It has already become the Corpse Deity Sect's vicious lair! The common people have become tools for the Corpse Deity Sect to refine the dead qi, with countless dying..."</p><p></p><p>The scholarly-looking old man's face flushed red, "Of course the Corpse Deity Sect must be obstructed, but strategies are required, you openly hunting down Corpse Deity Users in the city, the Prefect, Supervisor, and even the Patriarch and I, the Shenxiang, are unable to return from the Mysterious Abyss..."</p><p></p><p>"If they choose to go all out and not choose to flee, and directly carry out indiscriminate slaughter of the common people... how many would have to die?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyelids lifted slightly, "That's because the Shenxiang left in the city are incompetent."</p><p></p><p>A woman in red robes opened her eyes in the distance, the flames flickering in her pupils, her tone gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, are you saying my Zhu Hongdou is incompetent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan immediately shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>This woman had been cultivating the [Eight-Armed Prison Lotus Wrathful Three Princes] for a whole century, she was a ruthless woman, and it was clear how determined and vengeful she was. It would be better for him to say less.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Nanli Huo raised his hand gently to calm the situation, "Alright, the Corpse Deity Sect and other evil forces, when found, must be eliminated, what Qingshan did was the right thing."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the methods were a bit too ruthless, it would be better to be more steady-handed in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Elder, you are a jinshi from the current dynasty, suitable to serve as the supervisor for this session's sect examination, you should be more composed, and set an example for the younger generation, don't always wear that sour expression, scaring the children."</p><p></p><p>The scholarly-looking old man was Zhang Qingzheng, one of the four great Shenxiang Elders of Shenzong. At the moment, he clasped his hands in acknowledgment and sat in the chair, rubbing his bitter lotus-like face, trying to force out a smile.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it only became more frightening.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glimpsed it and almost laughed out loud.</p><p></p><p>"The time of the hour has arrived, prepare to open the mountain gate and commence the sect examination."</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Nanli Huo cast a stern glance at Li Qingshan, causing him to suppress his laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Dong--!"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed elder Zhu Hongdou stood up and walked to the massive black bell standing behind the archway, gripping the mallet, and gently struck down.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the vibration and force were unleashed, resonating through the black bell,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sound exploded! The waves of sound were like ripples, stirring up a gale that instantly spread across the entire venue, causing a momentary silence.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhejiang branch of the Daoism Sect of the Qianxuan Divine Sect is holding a disciple selection examination."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A light drizzle, a spring breeze caressing.</p><p></p><p>In front of the sect's mountain gate, accompanied by the booming of a large black gong, the waves of sound surged forth like the rushing waters of the Jiulong River, rolling outwards and causing the surrounding parents and children to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>The black gong rang three times, and the voice of the stunningly beautiful woman in red echoed to every corner, clear and resonant despite being hundreds of yards away.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held Xixia and sat in the prepared position at the bottom left of the wooden stage in front of the sect's mountain gate. </p><p></p><p>There were several wooden chairs arranged here, and Li Che's group had just occupied their spots, led by Lu Chi. Besides Li Che's family, there were a few others in elegant attire, quietly seated and holding children.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che's family appeared, the gazes of those others swept over them, and a few of the richly dressed women couldn't help but furrow their brows when they saw the plainly dressed Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>From their attire, Li Che's family was clearly not of high status.</p><p></p><p>What standing did they have to sit together with these people? Li Che was very low-key, and few in the capital city knew of him, mostly just knowing that he was a wood carver who had survived the sacrifice in Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Even the fact that Li Che had joined the Astronomical Bureau and become a third-rank guest official was known to very few.</p><p></p><p>However, since Li Che's group was brought by Lu Chi, although these elegantly dressed people were inwardly displeased, they still held their tongues and did not provoke them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was aware of the gazes around them but paid them no mind.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, this spot was specially reserved for you by the teacher. Those in elegant attire are from the prominent families of the thirteen prefectures under the capital, and those two exceptional spirit children are among them," Lu Chi whispered to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, holding Xixia, found a seat. His brow furrowed slightly. That... the one that Li Qingshan had praised as even more outstanding than Xixia?</p><p></p><p>"Huang Sixiang?" Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi immediately pointed to the small boy a few positions away.</p><p></p><p>That little boy was following a beautifully built matron, very obedient, with a rare shaved head and bronze-colored skin. Though only five or six years old, he exuded an imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Li Che's gaze, Huang Sixiang turned his head, and his eyes immediately fell on Xixia. Seeing the delicate three-year-old Xixia, he disdainfully tossed his chin, breaking the eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"A mere three-year-old child, not worth worrying about."</p><p></p><p>Xixia felt she was being looked down upon and became indignant. "Daddy, he's staring at me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che patted his little girl's head. "Wait, I'll teach you how to beat him up later. Have you learned it all?"</p><p></p><p>"I have! I can now even throw little kittens," Xixia said proudly, blinking her bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Lu Chi was utterly bewildered. What little kittens?</p><p>What had Xixia been learning behind his back these days?</p><p></p><p>"That one is the other exceptional spirit child from the thirteen cities, aside from Xixia and Huang Sixiang. He's the genius from the Liu family of Donghuang City, Liu Changqing. The teacher's assessment is that he is not as good as Xixia."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>"How old are they?"</p><p></p><p>"Huang Sixiang is six, and Liu Changqing is seven."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi rattled off the information.</p><p></p><p>The two of them chatted for a while, then fell silent as a woman in a fiery red dress slowly walked to the edge of the stage, holding a name list - the names of the spirit children selected from various places.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Red Bean Elder, one of the four great elders of the sect, the terrifying Shen Xiang!" Lu Chi tilted his head and introduced her to Xixia and Li Che.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as Lu Chi finished speaking, Zhu Hongdou's sharp gaze swept over, landing on him.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, this Elder is a beauty beyond compare, a true rarity in the world, do not speak ill of her," Li Che firmly said, slapping Lu Chi's big head.</p><p></p><p>For his daughter's sake, he shamelessly flattered the woman.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi also felt the killing intent and belatedly realized he had said something wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Now, those spirit children whose names are called, come up to the stage."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou, seeming to have heard Li Che's flattering words, disdainfully pursed her lips, but couldn't deny that pleasant words were indeed pleasing to the ear.</p><p></p><p>"Xianghuang City, exceptional spirit child, Huang Sixiang!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the obedient boy sitting beside the imposing beauty suddenly stood up, lifting his head proudly. His bronze skin glistened in the spring rain, as if oiled.</p><p></p><p>He held his head high, proud to be the first one called.</p><p></p><p>"Feilei City, exceptional spirit child, Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou read from the list again.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy, it seems they called me," Xixia said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put her down, smoothing the wrinkles on her little training outfit, encouraging her with tenderness: "Go on, Daddy is cheering for you!"</p><p></p><p>He patted Xixia, then secretly infused two "Chess Saint" chess pieces, to ensure her extra safety.</p><p></p><p>Xixia nodded and quickly ran towards the stage.</p><p></p><p>The tiny three-year-old Xixia stood beside the much taller Huang Sixiang on the stage, dwarfed by him.</p><p></p><p>Below, there was an immediate commotion, and even some laughter.</p><p></p><p>"A three-year-old exceptional spirit child, her talent is quite good, but... she's too young."</p><p></p><p>"Participating in the examination at such a young age, she doesn't have much advantage. She should be trained for another year and enter at four years old, that would be safer."</p><p></p><p>"She's from Feilei City, I heard that Feilei City was bewitched by the Corpse God Cult, holding a Thousand Infant Sacrifice, and many spirit children died tragically. This child being able to come to the capital city alive is not easy..."</p><p></p><p>The voices from below echoed without end.</p><p></p><p>However, a three-year-old exceptional spirit child would most likely become an inner disciple, needing to be cultivated for a year before possibly being noticed by the elders and promoted to the true disciples.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou looked at Xixia with interest, then continued reading the names.</p><p></p><p>"Donghuang City, exceptional spirit child, Liu Changqing."</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family, Qin Fenghuо..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, fifteen names were read, and fifteen children stood in formation on the stage.</p><p></p><p>There were both boys and girls, but a glance showed they were all around six or seven years old.</p><p></p><p>Xixia stood among them, a head shorter, her small stature completely overshadowed.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia didn't mind, blinking her big eyes and starting to observe the boys and girls standing beside her, staring longer at the good-looking ones and quickly averting her gaze from the ugly ones, unable to bear it for even a second.</p><p></p><p>Below, however, the commotion had already begun.</p><p></p><p>The first round was directly the selection of exceptional spirit children? That meant the true disciple examination had already started, and these fifteen exceptional spirit children were competing for five true disciple positions!</p><p></p><p>Four elders, and... the sect master! A total of five true disciple spots!</p><p></p><p>Sitting below, Li Che clenched his fist, unable to deny that... he was also a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was confident in Xixia's talents and abilities, he couldn't help but feel anxious as a father, watching his little daughter standing on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tall and imposing spirit children around her, and his own small daughter, looking around with a hint of fear in her bright eyes...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart couldn't help but tremble, almost wanting to bring his daughter back.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, not knowing when, had grasped Li Che's large hand, her palms also sweaty, her nervousness visible.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, can Xixia... enter the true disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that entering the true disciples is a different world from entering the inner disciples. If you enter the inner disciples, it's very difficult to then be promoted to the true disciples," Zhang Ya said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che comforted her for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Xixia's performance won't be lacking."</p><p></p><p>"After all, she is our daughter."</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Old Chen was trembling with nervousness, more so than when he had fled and killed bandits, constantly rubbing his hands and drinking from the gourd.</p><p></p><p>Sumu Grandma didn't seem nervous at all, just continuously patting Lu Chi's big head, much to Lu Chi's annoyance. But faced with his teacher's loving care, Lu Chi could only purse his lips and endure it.</p><p></p><p>On the stage, Zhang Qingzheng, the elder responsible for hosting this examination, stood in front of the children with a face like a bitter lotus, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the fifteen spirit children dared not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Xixia almost covered her eyes, the man's face was so ugly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng, feeling his face was about to freeze into a smile, felt that these little ones still hadn't sensed his amiable nature?</p><p></p><p>"The first round of the sect's examination is the selection of true disciples."</p><p></p><p>"The true disciple selection has three stages. The first stage is the dueling round."</p><p></p><p>"There are five dueling platforms set up on the stage. I have fifteen folded papers here. You will each draw one, and those who draw the defending papers will stand on the platforms, while the rest will attack them."</p><p></p><p>"The last ones standing on the platforms will be the winners of the first stage of the true disciple examination."</p><p></p><p>"The second stage will test your spiritual talents, using the sect's divination technique to evaluate your spiritual aura."</p><p></p><p>"The scores will be divided into superior, medium, and inferior."</p><p></p><p>"As for the third stage, we'll talk about it after the first two stages are completed."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's two eyebrows drooped, like bitter yellow roots.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fifteen exceptional spirit children on the stage, smiling. </p><p></p><p>The fifteen spirit children, intimidated by Zhang Qingzheng's ugly expression, hastily stood up straight, loudly acknowledging their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng then abruptly threw the fifteen folded papers.</p><p></p><p>Invisible spiritual energy surged, and the fifteen papers seemed to be enveloped by a transparent ball, flying about in chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Each of you take one paper, open it, and you'll know whether you are a defender or an attacker."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng said.</p><p></p><p>Curious, Xixia looked at the papers fluttering in front of her, and her chubby little hand reached out and grabbed one.</p><p></p><p>The fierce airflow struck her fleshy arm, making the flesh quiver pleasantly.</p><p></p><p>After taking the paper, Xixia opened it, but her eyes were blank, as the writing on it was a character she couldn't recognize.</p><p></p><p>He glanced over it, his brow and eyes slightly raised, imperceptibly shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>A three-year-old spirit child becoming a defender, inevitably would be seen as a soft target, becoming the object of attack by the other children.</p><p></p><p>But alas, the rules of the true disciple examination were just like this...</p><p></p><p>If you dared to come and compete for the true disciples at three years old, you had to show some ability.</p><p></p><p>The face like a bitter lotus straightened, his Confucian robe fluttering, as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The defenders in the first stage are: Huang Sixiang, Qin Fenghuо, Hai Chaosheng, Gongyang Xiu..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi."</p>

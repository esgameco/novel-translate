            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon Daoist Companion!"</p><p></p><p>"Please wait."</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo looked at the burly Ox Demon, who was as sturdy as a pagoda, raised his hand, and his face showed a gentle expression as he called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had originally planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>He still had important matters to attend to, and he was also worried that Nan Li Huo would forcibly detain him.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was an existence at the Yuanxiang Realm. In the Shenxiang Realm, the Xuxiang were considered half-baked, and the Yuanxiang could be called the complete Shenxiang powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of position was the highest intensity in the Shenxiang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Che naturally had to be on guard, without any relaxation, his mind was highly tense, and he could always grasp the Flying Thunder Chess Piece to achieve relocation and escape.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon wore a mask and stared at Nan Li Huo.</p><p></p><p>The posture of ascending the tower had already retreated, but the scorching and fiery furnace-like aura was still roaring and distorting the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo also stood very far away, indicating that he had no malicious intent. He used divine sense transmission to express his attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon Daoist Companion, you and Horse Face should be from the same organization?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, how much do I need to pay for the two of you to take action?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo knew that the Ox Demon was wary of him.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he had obtained, this Ox Demon was extremely cautious and rarely let himself fall into dangerous situations.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Nan Li Huo directly opened up and stated the purpose of his request for the Ox Demon to stay.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned. Was this another cultivator hiring the Ox Demon and Horse Face? After Li Qingshan, was Nan Li Huo also planning to hire the Ox Demon and Horse Face? Were these people treating the Ox Demon and Horse Face as an assassin organization to be used?</p><p></p><p>It's quite lucrative! Li Che even felt a bit tempted...</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how about creating an assassin organization? Horse Face's sniping, isn't that professional assassination? And the Ox Demon... silently walking in the darkness, kill and leave, the matter is done.</p><p></p><p>They are also equally professional! Killing and looting to earn a share, and then earning the hiring fee... another share.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind was racing, and he even had the idea of creating an organization.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon and Horse Face...</p><p></p><p>Creating an assassin organization, and call it... the Underworld?</p><p></p><p>"Depends on your needs."</p><p></p><p>Li Che temporarily regained his senses and responded in a low voice, also using divine sense transmission.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>There's a chance!</p><p></p><p>It seems that this Ox Demon and Horse Face really came from the same organization.</p><p></p><p>However, what kind of organization it is, and its overall strength, is unknown.</p><p></p><p>Is there a Shentai Realm great cultivator leading the organization?</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital of the Great Xing Dynasty, there is a top-secret assassin organization called the Huntsman Pavilion, which is said to be able to even hunt down Shentai Realm great cultivators!</p><p></p><p>However, the lowest range of operation of the Huntsman Pavilion is the Dao City, and they rarely have any traces of activity even in the prefecture cities.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Nan Li Huo has never had any contact with them.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the cost of hiring the Huntsman Pavilion's assassins is extremely high, and the premium is very severe...</p><p></p><p>Could the Ox Demon and Horse Face be from the Huntsman Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>Probably not...</p><p></p><p>But the sincerity... Nan Li Huo still needs to show it.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Sect Master of the Lihuo Sect want to hire us for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che saw that Nan Li Huo had fallen into deep thought, so he asked again.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo raised his head, and his divine sense waves responded.</p><p></p><p>"To kill someone."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Arrow Colonel, Wen Longshan."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"And the Prefect of the Jinguang Prefecture, Su Huai."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>This is the gentle and refined Sect Master of the Lihuo Sect Division?</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Li Che was close enough to see the events clearly.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Prefect Su Huai ordering the Divine Arrow Master Wen Longshan to take action, the corpse curse mark of Xu Jiujie would have remained and could not have been taken away by the high-level experts of the Corpse Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo can be said to have been humiliated by Su Huai, but he did not react on the spot and endured it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had previously thought that Nan Li Huo was very capable of restraint.</p><p></p><p>But restraint is one thing, and whether to get angry is another.</p><p></p><p>Li Che heard from Li Qingshan that Nan Li Huo had always wanted to kill Prefect Su Huai, and the two seemed to have a great enmity.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai publicly humiliated Nan Li Huo, which was practically forcing Nan Li Huo to take action.</p><p></p><p>But Nan Li Huo endured it.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai was a prefect appointed by the Great Xing Dynasty, while Nan Li Huo was the Sect Master of a division of the Divine Sect. Strictly speaking, Prefect Su Huai's status was slightly higher.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the Great Xing Dynasty has declined somewhat compared to its heyday, the imperial court... is still the number one force within the Great Xing Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>As a prefect, Su Huai assisted the Corpse Demon Sect...</p><p></p><p>From this point, Li Che had a reason to kill him.</p><p></p><p>A prefect, assisting a rebellious sect against the Great Xing Dynasty... is that really okay? Regardless of whether there are internal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very disgusted with this kind of third-party who was just watching and suddenly took action.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, you jest... what is the strength of Prefect Su Huai?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought for a moment and asked through divine sense transmission.</p><p></p><p>"At the peak of the Yuanxiang Realm, he may have even refined an Elemental Spirit, but he has most likely not yet stepped into the Shenyuan Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't your organization have an intelligence department? Aren't you clear about Su Huai's identity?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"We did not have the intention to kill Su Huai, so we did not investigate... and a Yuanxiang expert, this task... is not easy to accept."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Nan Li Huo had to endure, Su Huai's strength... was actually higher than he imagined!</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo's eyes flickered, and he smiled, not finding it strange.</p><p></p><p>Assassins complete tasks one by one.</p><p></p><p>He sought them out without understanding the intelligence, so it was understandable.</p><p></p><p>"Su Huai..."</p><p></p><p>"Is the junior disciple of Yimo Li."</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy."</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo transmitted calmly.</p><p></p><p>The voice was like a thunderclap, instantly exploding in Li Che's ears, causing the pupils of the Ox Demon mask to shrink slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yimo Li?!</p><p></p><p>That peerless and fierce Pacification King of the Great Xing?</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>In the small Jinguang Prefecture, how could there be a disciple of the great cultivator Yimo Li?! Could it be that Nan Li Huo also has a grudge against the Pacification King Yimo Li?!</p><p></p><p>"Then let's not kill Su Huai first... can we kill the Divine Arrow Colonel Wen Longshan?"</p><p></p><p>"Eight pieces of Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo's transmitted voice came solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Arrow Master Wen Longshan, who was transferred from the prefecture city, posed a great threat to him...</p><p></p><p>To want to kill Su Huai, he must first eliminate this Divine Arrow Master.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was originally planning to grab the Flying Thunder Chess Piece and leave directly.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't resist the fact that Nan Li Huo was offering so much.</p><p></p><p>"To kill Su Huai... I can add one piece of Seven Elemental Divine Essence Crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was really going all out, showing how intense his desire to kill was.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the price of a piece of Seven Elemental Divine Essence Crystal even exceeds that of a low-grade Seven Elemental divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that the Seven Elemental Divine Essence Crystal is extremely rare and is an excellent cultivation resource.</p><p></p><p>If one can have a Seven Elemental divine weapon, it does not necessarily mean they can have a Seven Elemental Divine Essence Crystal!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was tempted.</p><p></p><p>A piece of Seven Elemental Divine Essence Crystal would be enough for him to fully cultivate his Seven Realms Divine Foundation, right?</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, who had ordinary talent in the Dao of Divine Essence, this Divine Essence Crystal was indeed very tempting.</p><p></p><p>However, temptation always comes with danger.</p><p></p><p>"First kill Wen Longshan, we will establish mutual trust, and treat it as practice..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his hand, and a piece of paper flew out and fell into the Ox Demon's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the intelligence on Wen Longshan."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to accept this task?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo seemed to have thought of the Ox Demon's righteous and heroic nature, his gaze focused, and he added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"As for Su Huai... he is not a good person, this point... you can investigate yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused his movements.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say much, his gaze falling on the intelligence in his hand. It seemed that Nan Li Huo had prepared very thoroughly, and had already harbored the intention to kill both Su Huai and Wen Longshan.</p><p></p><p>The incident tonight must have catalyzed this desire to kill.</p><p></p><p>Su Huai is the disciple of Yimo Li...</p><p></p><p>His hidden abilities and foundations must be numerous, and he must be extremely difficult to kill! </p><p></p><p>Why does Nan Li Huo want to kill Su Huai? Can he withstand the wrath of a great Shentai Realm cultivator? Even the Qianyuan Sect... might not be able to protect him, right?</p><p></p><p>Li Che fell silent.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Nan Li Huo had to endure, the forces represented by Su Huai, he had no choice but to endure.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wanted to figure out one thing.</p><p></p><p>"One last question, since Su Huai is the disciple of the Pacification King, why do you want to kill him? And why did he force you to take action?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pressed down his hat, raised the cute Ox Demon mask, and looked at Nan Li Huo from dozens of meters away.</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged divine sense in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this question, Nan Li Huo was momentarily dazed, and the entire person seemed to have aged a lot, his originally straight back slightly hunched.</p><p></p><p>As if he was recalling something that had exhausted his heart and strength.</p><p></p><p>"It's better if you don't know... I have my own reasons."</p><p></p><p>This answer was quite vague, but Li Che could feel Nan Li Huo's emotions.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he really knew the reason, and it might bring him trouble.</p><p></p><p>Such a troublesome matter, Li Che was too lazy to know about it, glanced at the intelligence on Wen Longshan, and then put the intelligence away.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>"Just kill Wen Longshan first."</p><p></p><p>"As for Prefect Su Huai... we'll see."</p><p></p><p>With that, the Ox Demon snapped his fingers, and a white chess piece flew out and fell into Nan Li Huo's hand.</p><p></p><p>"When you want to act, crush it."</p><p></p><p>"Eight pieces of Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals, kill eight, if unable to kill, halve the amount."</p><p></p><p>"I will act together with Horse Face."</p><p></p><p>"Two pieces as a deposit."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo laughed and tossed two pieces of Eight Extremes Divine Essence Crystals to Li Che, then cupped his hands: "It's a deal."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked at the Ox Demon, who was gradually fading and disappearing in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense waves transmitted a question.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, where exactly do you and Horse Face come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it... the Huntsman Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo was curious.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon seemed to chuckle softly.</p><p></p><p>He did not use divine sense transmission, but opened his mouth, his low voice echoing over the snowy plateau.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo stood in place, the wind and snow suddenly intensifying, and when he looked again, the Ox Demon had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even though Nan Li Huo's powerful divine sense was constantly locked onto him, he still could not perceive how the Ox Demon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if... he just vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld?</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo furrowed his brows, he had never heard of this organization before...</p><p></p><p>But why, upon hearing this name, did his body inexplicably emanate a chill, as if... a sense of terror of being targeted by death, arose.</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo exhaled, and did not think much about it.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the devastated Liujianjing Peak.</p><p></p><p>He felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because the high-level experts of the Corpse Demon Sect hidden within the mountain gate had been removed, and the hidden threat had diminished greatly, naturally worthy of a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Su Huai..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Li Huo's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He never expected Su Huai to take action tonight.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Pacification King Yimo Li was suppressing and dealing with the Corpse Demon Sect, and Su Huai, his junior disciple, actually assisted the high-level experts of the Corpse Demon Sect...</p><p></p><p>Su Huai had better be planning to use this incident to annoy him, Nan Li Huo, and simply force him to take action.</p><p></p><p>If not...</p><p></p><p>Then the problem... would not be small.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Jinguang Prefecture City, Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che grasped the Flying Thunder Chess Piece and returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the sounds of breathing, like thunderous echoes, rose and fell one after another.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze, he saw that in the room, the seven avatar divisions of himself were sitting in meditation, diligently and earnestly cultivating their divine essence.</p><p></p><p>This kind of diligent state made Li Che even sweat profusely.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling of being a heartless capitalist.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, he did not disturb the seven versions of himself who were working hard and diligently to nurture their divine essence.</p><p></p><p>He sat down on the bamboo chair in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The thick snow had accumulated a layer, making everything appear pure white.</p><p></p><p>In the guise of the Ox Demon, Li Che sat on the chair, raised his hand, and a mid-grade Qiankun Jade appeared in his palm. This was the collection of an elder at the Shenxiang Realm! This was his harvest after deciding to engage in close combat with Xu Jiujie, instead of trying to kill him.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, he stored this Qiankun Jade in the Qiankun Space.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Demon mask, Li Che had the lines of heaven and earth intertwined.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, images began to flash and interweave in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Dense black smoke was rolling and rushing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"Still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The transmission speed is really slow. Compared to the instantaneous movement of the Flying Thunder Chess Piece, it's much slower.</p><p></p><p>In the close-quarters combat with Xu Jiuqing, Li Che not only casually touched the Qiankun Jade, but each punch he landed would also infuse Xu Jiuqing's body with the divine nature of the Immaculate Heart.</p><p></p><p>Through the aura of the child imprint of the Seven Corpse Curse Seal, he searched for the mother imprint! </p><p></p><p>Li Che's original intention was to recover the mother imprint that suppressed this Seven Corpse Curse Seal, but he never expected that Xu Jiuqing still had a means of escape.</p><p></p><p>By a twist of fate, the Immaculate Heart divinity that was infused into his Corpse Curse Seal ended up coalescing into the Flying Thunder Chess Piece.</p><p></p><p>It became... a locator! Not only could Li Che lock onto the direction of Xu Jiuqing's Corpse Curse Seal's escape through the Flying Thunder Chess Piece, but he could also know his situation.</p><p></p><p>Escape? The one he wanted to kill, how could he escape so easily? This Corpse Deity Sect heretic who threatened Xixia, if he doesn't die... how could he be at ease?</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat quietly in the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>He was waiting, waiting for Xu Jiuqing to land from the transmission.</p><p></p><p>However, it has to be said that after experiencing the rapid movement of the Flying Thunder Chess Piece, the Corpse Deity Sect's turtle-paced transmission... really makes one anxious.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was even anxious for them.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense floated in the celestial chessboard, sensing Xu Jiuqing's transmission situation.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Li Che divided his attention.</p><p></p><p>He was reviewing this battle with Xu Jiuqing, who was at the Divine Sage realm.</p><p></p><p>Although this battle was Li Che's attempt to take action, it also allowed him to have a clear judgment of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"If I activate the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra Fruit's wrathful golden vajra state, and ascend the tower, I can suppress an Ancestral Master realm warrior. My physical body is too strong, a Furnace Ancestral Master... his physical body is peerless."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing's main body is the Curse Copper Corpse, tough and unyielding, combined with his Ancestral Master late-stage cultivation, I can't kill him."</p><p></p><p>"The fully-formed Curse Copper Corpse, is indeed both stinky and hard."</p><p></p><p>"Even with four Dragon Fang Bullets, sniping to clear the way, it still wouldn't work..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered, as snowflakes fell one by one, piling up a thick layer on his bamboo hat.</p><p></p><p>"However... if I truly bring out my trump card... I might not be unable to kill him."</p><p></p><p>Overall, Li Che had a clear understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to the level of a True Divine Sage early-stage to mid-stage.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is not to let the opponent create distance, and bombard him with divine arts.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine cultivation, Li Che was still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che's strength lies in his physical body's toughness, as a Furnace Ancestral Master who has stepped into the Nine Transformations of the Divine Veins, combined with the budding divine technique of Ascending the Tower...</p><p></p><p>Once in close combat, even a Divine Sage mid-stage cultivator would not be able to withstand his close-range burst.</p><p></p><p>But if it's a Divine Sage early-stage...</p><p></p><p>Within ten moves, he must kill! If it's against a Divine Sage late-stage or Primal Sage realm cultivator...</p><p></p><p>He would have to detour.</p><p></p><p>The divine sage cultivated by a Divine Sage late-stage is not weaker than the strength of the Curse Copper Corpse, and once the overwhelming divine pressure is exerted, that level of pressure, even Li Che who has forged the Seven Cycles of the Divine Foundation, may not be able to completely ignore.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Che could ignore the level pressure of Xu Jiuqing's Divine Sage mid-stage, was due to the immunity he gained after forging the Seven Cycles of the Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>It was not the effect brought by the Temple God's divinity.</p><p></p><p>This gave Li Che the capital to fight against opponents of higher realms. He is currently at the Divine Foundation realm, if he cannot be immune to the level pressure of divine sages, the battle process will be very detrimental...</p><p></p><p>Even with the physique of a Furnace Ancestral Master warrior, he will still be restricted and his strength will be weakened by at least 30-40%.</p><p></p><p>"With this strength... I, the Ox Demon... can be even more reckless."</p><p></p><p>Under the ox-demon mask, a faint smile appeared on Li Che's lips.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes slightly flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? He has finally completed the transmission... it took a while."</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Che stood up, his blood and qi surging, instantly melting the snow.</p><p></p><p>He pressed down on his bamboo hat.</p><p></p><p>Escape and save his life?</p><p></p><p>After bullying my daughter... still want to live?</p><p></p><p>He, the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Most likes to uproot and eliminate.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>The space seemed to fluctuate, and the falling snow was distorted.</p><p></p><p>Then, the figure of the Ox Demon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house.</p><p></p><p>The seven painted immortal Li Che's shattered open!</p><p></p><p>The seven emotional divine natures, returned to their positions!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Golden Light Prefecture City, forty miles away.</p><p></p><p>In the continuous mountain range.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black night.</p><p></p><p>A dense black smoke rolled out, first as a black dot, then gradually growing more and more, finally converging into a vortex-like black smoke cloud.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow shot out from it at high speed, landing on the ground with a huge momentum, startling the birds in the dense forest to flap their wings and fly away!</p><p></p><p>The black shadow slowly stood up, the dense smoke rolling, all of which was the pungent corpse qi and death qi, polluting the surrounding trees, causing the green leaves to wither and fall in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"South Separation Fire, Ox Demon Horse Face!"</p><p></p><p>The low voice came from the black shadow's mouth, and the opened eyes were blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's soul was hidden in the mother imprint of the Seven Corpse Curse Seal, which was also the reason why he could hide inside the Golden Light Sect's branch for so long without being discovered.</p><p></p><p>All the corpse qi and death qi could be released and absorbed through the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the power of the Curse Copper Corpse was all stored in the Corpse Curse Seal, and the flesh and blood body would only be slightly weakened in terms of blood and qi, without being detected.</p><p></p><p>And with the excuse of "nourishing the sword with blood and qi", this suspicious point was directly covered up.</p><p></p><p>So even a cultivator at the Primal Sage realm like South Separation Fire, who was almost about to cultivate the Primordial Spirit, had difficulty discovering his secret.</p><p></p><p>But it was exposed by the Ox Demon!  "Damn it... it was just a slip-up, that Seven Corpse Curse child imprint... exposed my identity."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing kept roaring, his soul filled with extreme indignation, he could no longer control his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, there was white mist surging out from the forest.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, it formed the figure of a person in white robes.</p><p></p><p>The face of that figure was covered with a white mask with the character "Eight" written in blood.</p><p></p><p>It was an Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy!</p><p></p><p>Every Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy was at the Divine Sage realm!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing, I have come to guide you, to help you borrow a corpse to be reborn and revived."</p><p></p><p>The faint voice came from the mouth of the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, I need to recover your Seven Corpse Curse Seal, and since you have lost the mother imprint of the Seven Corpse Curse Seal's child imprint... so, balancing the merits and demerits, the sect can only provide you with a small success Curse Copper Corpse body to be reborn."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy fell.</p><p></p><p>In the black mist, Xu Jiuqing's soul cried out in indignation and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Small success? How can it only be small success?!"</p><p></p><p>"Be content, at this critical juncture when you were exposed, if it weren't for your identity being truly special, you might have only been granted a Curse Iron Corpse body."</p><p></p><p>The indifferent voice came from the Corpse Deity Envoy's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know, Li Qingshan is about to break through to the Divine Sage realm... your exposure has disrupted his plan to break through the Divine Sage, the price to pay could be very heavy... Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Envoy's words were suddenly interrupted by a fierce shout.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>His whole body erupted with corpse qi, and under the white robe, there was a bronze-colored glow flashing, revealing that he was also a cultivator of the Perfected Curse Copper Corpse!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing, thanks to you, I've hooked a fat fish."</p><p></p><p>The indifferent voice, accompanied by a hoarse tone, came from behind the Corpse Deity Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in black mist, Xu Jiuqing's blood-red eyes narrowed, and then he was greatly alarmed! He saw that behind the Corpse Deity Envoy, the familiar ox-demon mask emerged!</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon... how is he like a ghost?!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The air suddenly exploded, and the powerful airflow burst out in concentric circles like radiation.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy reacted extremely quickly, but he could only just raise his arm to block, and he was slammed onto the face mask, the entire person being knocked away, consecutively smashing through several ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Envoy's clothes were torn, revealing the bronze-colored Perfected Curse Copper Corpse body.</p><p></p><p>But the mask was completely undamaged.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing... you have betrayed the sect?!"</p><p></p><p>"You damn three-surname family slave!"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Envoy said coldly, his voice endlessly icy.</p><p></p><p>Hooking a fish?</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing was actually fishing!</p><p></p><p>"But, a mere Ox Demon... also wants to eat me?"</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Envoy became cold and cruel, the divine sage divine nature spilling out from him, and a divine sage with countless eyes appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Pindola Thousand-Eyed Corpse God!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying pressure, forming waves in a ring-like manner, howling winds blew, pressing all the trees within a thirty-foot range to sway unsteadily!</p><p></p><p>The rolling black smoke of Xu Jiuqing was almost about to go crazy.</p><p></p><p>"It's not me!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't!"</p><p></p><p>He howled.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ox Demon's body suddenly exploded, becoming more burly, more robust, with pulsing blue veins.</p><p></p><p>The black hair grew rapidly, falling to the waist.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, and opening them again, golden smoke emanated from the pupils under the mask.</p><p></p><p>"Quick battle, quick decision."</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll test it out."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon in the Ascending the Tower state said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Test? </p><p></p><p>How dare a mere Ox Demon try to test him?! Extremely arrogant!</p><p></p><p>But the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy sneered: "You cooperated with Horse Face's hidden weapon attack, but still couldn't kill Xu Jiuqing, what makes you confident you can kill me?"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che just glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>Snapping his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The celestial chessboard instantly enveloped the surrounding ten-meter area, concealing all auras.</p><p></p><p>The change in the environment made the Corpse Deity Envoy and Xu Jiuqing both change color.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon! The next moment, the Corpse Deity Envoy and Xu Jiuqing saw the Ox Demon's palm open up like a fan.</p><p></p><p>A dark golden chess piece quietly floated there.</p><p></p><p>The intense and terrifying Temple God divine pressure poured out from this small dark golden chess piece, overwhelming like a tidal wave!</p><p></p><p>That was the Temple God's pressure...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King!</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Envoy and Xu Jiuqing both sensed it, horrified!  "It's you—so it was you!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing cried out miserably, the one who severed the connection between his Corpse Curse mother and child imprints was indeed the Ox Demon! And this Heavenly King Temple God power...</p><p></p><p>Only South Separation Fire at the top of the Golden Light Peak could mobilize!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... South Separation Fire... it was all a scheme!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing wailed and laughed bitterly! But the Ox Demon did not pay him any attention, clenching his five fingers tightly, the dark golden Heavenly King divine chess piece was instantly crushed!</p><p></p><p>The dark golden Temple God divinity surged up like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Inhale—</p><p></p><p>Then, the Ox Demon raised his head and deeply inhaled... but only a third of it!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire ten-meter area covered by the celestial chessboard, the ground completely cracked and exploded, collapsing several feet in an instant, as if being pressed down by a terrifying suppressive force! And on the Ox Demon's terrifying physical body, there also appeared countless fine knife marks like wounds, spraying out blood mist! His flesh and blood seemed unable to withstand the power of the Temple God divinity! Countless Temple God divinity flowed out, actually forging a golden divine armor on the Ox Demon's towering mountain-like body! Black hair flying, his whole body skin turning purple-red, wearing a golden divine armor! Majestic and imposing, the Golden Heavenly King ascending the tower like a deity!  "Use a cow knife... to kill you."</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon murmured, his voice echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The eyes under the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy's mask suddenly revealed terror!</p><p></p><p>Flee...</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! The sky collapsed and the earth sank, the entire mountain range shaking, with radiation-like spider web-like cracks spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Many rocks on the ground seemed to have been melted by the terrifying force and quickly frozen by the cold winter wind, turning into a crystalline state.</p><p></p><p>When everything finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes silently fell from the night sky, landing on the empty space where countless trees had been flattened.</p><p></p><p>In the huge pit in the ground...</p><p></p><p>Only the twisted, terrified, and mud-like corpse of the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy remained.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Jiuqing's soul...</p><p></p><p>It had already dissipated!</p><p></p><p>In the silent ruins.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three...</p><p></p><p>A total of six distorted figures shrouded in corpse qi and death qi emerged from the twisted black smoke vortex, standing on the edge of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Silently looking at the Eight Extremes Corpse Deity Envoy who had been smashed into mud by the supreme beast.</p><p></p><p>In the silent ruins, a voice finally echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Master?!"</p>

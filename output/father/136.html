        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Xu Jiuqing of the Law Enforcement Hall on Liujian Peak descended gracefully, standing with his hands behind his back. The sword he carried on his back trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, a figure was being escorted by a sword aura.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhao Jianmiao, the Peak Master of Qianyun Peak and the Inner Sect Steward under Shangguan Qinglei.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao's expression was grim. Although he had the cultivation of a Void Appearance, Xu Jiuqing was an Elder of the Divine Appearance, in charge of the Law Enforcement Hall, and possessed immense battle prowess. </p><p></p><p>He had no chance against Xu Jiuqing and could only surrender.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Jiuqing, you are treating me as a criminal without any justification. I am the Peak Master of an Inner Sect Peak and an Inner Sect Steward! Even if you want to arrest me, you should at least have an arrest warrant issued by the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao coldly eyed the sword-bearing Xu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Nanlihuo's gaze swept over calmly, while on the other side, Li Qingshan and the others were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze first fell on Xu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Divine Sword Cultivators! They were a type of cultivator with extremely tyrannical and powerful battle prowess, and among sword cultivators, they were the main battle type.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing, one of the four Divine Appearance Elders of the Divine Sect... </p><p></p><p>His cultivation was at the Divine Appearance Realm, stronger than Zhu Hongdou, in charge of the Divine Sect's rules and regulations. If there were any lawless disciples, he would detain them in the Law Enforcement Hall and await their punishment.</p><p></p><p>If any disciples of the Divine Sect committed crimes outside, the Law Enforcement Hall would also send people to capture them.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, I have brought the person, Zhao Jianmiao is the master of Shangguan Qinglei. Shangguan Qinglei was bewitched by a powerful member of the Corpse Deity Sect, and he has an inseparable connection with him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Li Qingshan and narrowed his eyes: "Li Qingshan, do you want to compete with me for the duties of the Law Enforcement Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"I know you cultivate the 'Thunderbolt Exorcism', upright and righteous, hating evil like an enemy, not tolerating even a speck of dust in your eyes. But... do you plan to snatch my duties with your Void Appearance cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing did not unleash the pressure of his Divine Appearance, but a single glance contained a tyrannical sword intent, making Li Qingshan's shoulders slightly sink.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingshan was also unperturbed: "I was just asking, if the Sect Master is willing, I will naturally take the order to investigate thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured that I, Li Qingshan, will handle this matter."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing laughed, and the powerful pressure immediately dissipated. He glanced at Li Qingshan and sneered, "Stop with the lip service, you should focus on reaching the Divine Appearance Realm... Dragging on and on, hasn't that trash Lin Xiu already reached the Divine Appearance Realm for several years?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo shook his head. Xu Jiuqing and Li Qingshan were both people who hated evil, but every time they met, they disliked each other.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo looked at Li Qingshan, as if he could see through the little schemes in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I know you old fellow are suspecting me, but... if I really had connections with the Corpse Deity Sect and wanted to harm Xixue, would I need to go through such a roundabout way?"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan became embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>When Li Qingshan said that Sect Master Nanlihuo might not be clean, Li Che had also thought of this point.</p><p></p><p>As Xixue's master, if he wanted to deal with Xixue, it would be too easy, and there would be no need to go through such a big circle.</p><p></p><p>Using the unseen Seven-Element Divine Weapon, and bewitching Shangguan Qinglei...</p><p></p><p>The cost was not to be said, and more importantly, it was troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo had daily contact with Xixue, teaching her cultivation, if he wanted to use the Corpse Curse Seal to infect her, he could have done it long ago.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che had doubts about Li Qingshan's suspicion of Nanlihuo.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sect Master... how could he be an expert of the Corpse Deity Sect?</p><p></p><p>This was truly... unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's direct words left many in the small courtyard somewhat bewildered and stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing sneered coldly, directly changing the subject: "Sect Master, how should we deal with Zhao Jianmiao?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, I truly don't know about the matter of Shangguan Qinglei... Although I have a master-disciple relationship with him, after Shangguan Zhenghe revealed that he cultivated the 'Copper Corpse Curse', a vicious and evil technique, I have distanced myself from Shangguan Qinglei. I am wronged!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao, bound by the sword aura, said with some grief and indignation.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo looked at Zhao Jianmiao.</p><p></p><p>Among the many Void Appearance Stewards in the Inner Sect, Zhao Jianmiao was also one of the top ones. After all, he could hold a Peak, and in terms of cultivation and battle prowess, he was not weaker than Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's expression gradually became cold: "Xixue is my personal disciple... are you aware of this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao pressed his lips together.</p><p></p><p>"Xixue is also the divine prodigy born in the Golden Light Sub-Sect of my Qianyun Sect in the Jiazi year, do you know this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>He sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master... I know, Lady Lihuo's identity is very important, and she is the key to our Yunzhou Sub-Sect competing for resources at the 'Junior God Assembly' in the main Qianyun Sect in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I am guilty, I failed to keep an eye on Shangguan Qinglei... it was my negligence, I am willing to cooperate with the investigation and accept the sect's punishment."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao was naturally dissatisfied with Xu Jiuqing's arbitrary arrest of him.</p><p></p><p>But in the presence of the Sect Master, he bowed his head readily.</p><p></p><p>Because, this matter he could not wash away, Shangguan Qinglei was his disciple, and he caused such a mess, no matter what, he had to be punished.</p><p></p><p>When Shangguan Qinglei used the Corpse Deity Sect's methods to attack Xixue, Zhao Jianmiao's heart sank, knowing that he had to bear this pot.</p><p></p><p>"Good, Elder Xu, you are responsible for the thorough investigation of Qianyun Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master of Qianyun Peak, Zhao Jianmiao, your Peak Master position is temporarily revoked, and your Inner Sect Steward identity is also suspended. After the investigation is completed, it will be restored. You are fined three years' salary and ordered to go to the Mysterious Temple in the Outer City to assist the Temple Guardians in slaying one Corpse Deity of the Eight Extremes Temple and ten Corpse Deities of the Nine Luminaries Temple, to make amends."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing tapped his fingers, dissipating the sword aura that bound Zhao Jianmiao.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao clasped his fists and bowed: "Zhao Jianmiao accepts the punishment."</p><p></p><p>"You should be grateful that Xixue is unharmed, otherwise... it would not be just this small punishment for you."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jianmiao immediately bowed deeply, his expression very complex.</p><p></p><p>He first looked at Xixue, then his gaze turned to Li Che and Zhang Ya, also saluting them with clasped fists.</p><p></p><p>"It was Zhao's negligence that caused the young miss to be frightened, I apologize to you both."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Zhao Jianmiao for a moment, his expression softening.</p><p></p><p>"This matter cannot be blamed on Steward Zhao, Shangguan Qinglei was bewitched by an evil person from the Corpse Deity Sect hidden within the Divine Sect, it was unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Li Che spoke up, directly exposing the matter.</p><p></p><p>Although the facts were as such, Li Che's blunt revelation still made Elder Xu Jiuqing's expression unsightly.</p><p></p><p>There was a member of the Corpse Deity Sect hidden within the sect, naturally this was a slap in the face of him, the Law Enforcement Hall Elder!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Li Grandmaster, rest assured, I, Xu Jiuqing, will guarantee to ferret out that Corpse Deity Sect member and bring their head to Xixue to ease her fears!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's sword intent burst forth, his words extremely direct.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Then you go for it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing, taking Zhao Jianmiao, left in a hurry, directly sealing Qianyun Peak.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo shook his head, then looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Xixue, you will stay with your father and mother at Zhenglie Peak today, and return to Jinguang Peak tomorrow. I need to prepare some protective items for you."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said gently, patting Xixue's head.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin beside them kept nodding, Xixue was too precious, not only a divine prodigy, but also the darling of their Jinguang Peak. The teacher should have prepared protective items long ago! This was a lesson, allowing the teacher to be more vigilant, and it was a good thing!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Nanlihuo looked at Li Che and Zhang Ya: "If Xixue's father and mother are worried about Xixue and do not trust me... I can make an exception and let you build a house on Jinguang Peak, so you can see Xixue's situation at any time."</p><p></p><p>Jinguang Peak was the main peak of the Divine Sect's Jinguang Sub-Sect, and ordinary people were not allowed to enter unless they were the Sect Master's true disciples.</p><p></p><p>Although Jinguang Peak was extremely spacious, it was not open to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo allowing Li Che and Zhang Ya to reside there could be said to be breaking the rules.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che shook his head: "Thank you, Sect Master, Xixue's mother and I will stay at Zhenglie Peak."</p><p></p><p>Residing in Jinguang Peak would not allow him to live with Xixue, and it would be no different from staying at Zhenglie Peak, but there would be more restrictions in Jinguang Peak, after all, it was under Sect Master Nanlihuo's watchful eye.</p><p></p><p>As for seeing Xixue's situation, Li Che had always been able to see it.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference in this regard.</p><p></p><p>As Nanlihuo said, if he really wanted to harm Xixue, he wouldn't need to go through such a roundabout way.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he most likely did not make the move.</p><p></p><p>So why not sell the Sect Master a surface-level trust?</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's lips curled up slightly upon hearing this: "Thank you, Xixue's father and mother, for your trust. Rest assured, I will take good care of Xixue, this is the promise of me, the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, you wanted to investigate, right? In this matter... I, as the Sect Master, give you the authority to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"If you can find the Corpse Deity Sect member hidden within the Divine Sect, there will be a great reward!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo glanced at Li Qingshan and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was somewhat surprised, Nanlihuo... really let him investigate?</p><p></p><p>His heart rejoiced, but his expression became extremely serious as he clasped his fists and accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo patted Xixue's head again, then turned and left with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>After Nanlihuo left, Li Qingshan immediately looked at Li Che, revealing a smile, his expression as if it could speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately understood, this was again asking him to assist in detecting the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>However, the person who struck was at least a Seven-Element level Corpse Curse Seal, and Li Che's current divine sense was somewhat lacking in the ability to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>He would need to wait a little while.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that hidden Corpse Deity Sect member, after this failed attempt, was likely to completely conceal their identity, and would not make a move in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"We can first detect the Corpse Curse Seals below the Seven-Element level. If there is someone in the sect who has imprinted the seal, we can catch them and follow the clues..."</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility was small, since they dared to hide in the Divine Sect, they must have cleaned up all the clues thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had a plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he broke through to the Divine Appearance Realm one day, this hidden Corpse Deity Sect expert, might not be able to restrain themselves, right?</p><p></p><p>At that time... perhaps that would be the best time to find the culprit.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan conveyed his thoughts to Li Che through divine sense transmission.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>"Another fishing trap?"</p><p></p><p>"Using yourself as bait?"</p><p></p><p>A sense of familiarity, what was going on?</p><p></p><p>Eating the fish bait... he was a professional.</p><p></p><p>But... this time, it seemed like...</p><p></p><p>He had to get on the table and eat the fish!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Jiazi divine prodigy, Sect Master's personal disciple Xixue, was attacked by the Corpse Deity Sect.</p><p></p><p>This incident triggered a chain reaction that was like a storm, causing various forces to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle between Zhu Hongdou and the Divine Appearance Ancestor of the Shangguan Family also came to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Appearance Ancestor of the Shangguan Family returned to the Shangguan Mansion with a chest full of anger, while Zhu Hongdou, although injured, held her head high, coughing up blood while seeming proud like a fiery red rooster!</p><p></p><p>Liu Yangsheng, who was sent by Nanlihuo to mediate, became a mere onlooker, eating melons and watching the show. It was impossible for him to persuade them.</p><p></p><p>Until Zhu Hongdou glanced at the melon-eating Liu Yangsheng, he finally reacted and hurriedly conveyed Nanlihuo's edict to appease them.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou angrily swung her Flame Spear.</p><p></p><p>"The old thing of the Shangguan Family, even though I injured him, he did not reveal any Corpse Deity Sect methods... It's a pity, I couldn't lure it out. This old thing, I don't know if he is deliberately hiding it or truly has not joined the Corpse Deity Sect."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou pondered.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Liu Yangsheng's enchantingly handsome face suddenly revealed a trace of surprise.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Elder Zhu Hongdou was not just a big-breasted fool... this battle was also a calculated attempt to probe and test.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm that woman from the Astrology Bureau?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou seemed to see through the thoughts hidden behind Liu Yangyuan's shocked expression, and let out a cold laugh. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, with a heroic bearing, she stepped on the red clouds and left with her head held high. </p><p></p><p>She was going to Zheng Leifeng, to let Xixibao see that she had suffered serious injuries for Xixibao's sake!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed in the blink of an eye, over the course of ten-odd days. </p><p></p><p>The matter of Xixibao's attack had not settled down. Elder Xu Jiuqing of the Enforcement Hall led a team to thoroughly investigate the entire Divine Sect, combing through almost every mountain peak, not leaving a single inner peak unturned. </p><p></p><p>At this point, all the disciples finally truly felt the importance of Xixibao, this genius of the generation, to the Golden Light Division.</p><p></p><p>At Zheng Leifeng.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yuanliang and Gongyangxiu, carrying the sugar hawthorns they had bought on their way down the mountain, ran to find Xixibao while Li Che was not there. </p><p></p><p>These days, Xixibao's schedule had relaxed, cultivating on Golden Light Peak during the day, and Zhang Ya would come to Golden Light Peak in the evenings to escort her back to Zheng Leifeng together with Sanguan Yin. </p><p></p><p>This made Xixibao extremely happy, as she could see her parents every day, delighted! As for Li Che, he did not stay at Zheng Leifeng all day, as he still had to go to the Astronomical Observatory during the day for his work as a Guest Scholar.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said he wanted to take Li Che to the Divine Eagle Ridge of the sect, but he had not gone yet, and Li Che was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The Astronomical Observatory also provided him with abundant spiritual wood, allowing him to practice wood carving and improve his immortal craftsmanship. </p><p></p><p>However, some of the higher-level spiritual wood were rather scarce and hard to find.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Li Che had not let his guard down either, constantly keeping an eye on Xixibou's situation with the Flying Thunder Chess Pieces.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Old Chen had gone to work as a guard at the Yunfang Pavilion, and Li Che was also keeping an eye on him.</p><p></p><p>The threads of the corpse curse power were infecting Old Chen's body, but Li Che was not in a hurry to remove it. </p><p></p><p>He simply made a note of the Beggar's Sect in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Beggar's Sect... is not weaker than the former Fishermen's Sect, and its Sect Master Hong Jiuliu is a divine physiognomist cultivator, with two Void Appearance Deputy Sect Masters and a Void Appearance Nine Sacks Elder..."</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Che had found Shangguan Qinghong and inquired about the information of the major forces in the Golden Light Prefecture City, among which the news of the Beggar's Sect was hidden.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was a disciple of Lin Xiu, with extremely rich knowledge reserves, perhaps a little inferior to Lin Xiu, but there was still a lot of room for Li Che to explore.</p><p></p><p>The corpse spirit cultivators in the Beggar's Sect seemed to have no intention of imparting the corpse curse seal to Old Chen, perhaps fearing that Old Chen might encounter an accident and be investigated by the current fast-acting Enforcement Hall of the Divine Sect, thus cutting off this line.</p><p></p><p>So their movements were very cautious, only infecting him with the deathly qi and corpse qi of the corpse curse seal.</p><p></p><p>In the Luohua Alley of the Golden Light Prefecture City, in the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che enveloped the place with a Heaven and Earth chessboard, preventing external prying.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh--</p><p></p><p>The sound of the wind surging, the air howling and raging!</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood there, his spine like a dragon, his body slightly bending forward, and suddenly, it was as if there was the sound of a bursting wave crashing against the shore! His scorching blood qi was like the rolling waves of a river!</p><p></p><p>All the airflow in the small courtyard was stirred up, slowly circling around his bursting body, like the swirling river water! His entire body trembled violently, the tendons and bones under the tough membrane seemed to be roaring and howling like a huge python, shaking and surging like the great waves.</p><p></p><p>"Roar--"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che opened his eyes wide, his five fingers clenching like hooks, and in an instant, all the airflow around his hand was pulled and gathered together, as if grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>His arm lashed out like a snake, tightening and then bursting out with a terrifying roar, smashing a large hole in the air in front of him! Then, it was as if a blood-qi python was roaring out from his fist!</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate skill of the Golden Light Division... the Eight Python Overturning the River Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"The blood-qi condensed into a python, the angry python bursting out of the river, I've reached the initial mastery!"</p><p></p><p>This was the ultimate skill that Li Qingshan had taught him, the Eight Python Overturning the River Technique!</p><p></p><p>Mastering an ultimate skill is not an easy task, much more difficult than mastering an excellent martial art. </p><p></p><p>Even with Li Che's talent, it took him half a year to reach the initial mastery of the Eight Python Overturning the River Technique.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during this half year, he did not only cultivate the Eight Python Overturning the River Technique, he had also initially mastered the Azure Thunder Body he obtained from the Shangguan family, but to reach the great mastery of the Azure Thunder Body was very difficult, requiring the observation and drawing of thunder into his body.</p><p></p><p>It required the assistance of the heavenly conditions, so Li Che had not yet started to practice it.</p><p></p><p>The two ultimate skills, the Eight Python Overturning the River Technique and the Azure Thunder Body, had both reached the initial mastery stage for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Dragon Elephant True Essence had also been greatly enhanced, and by integrating the power of the two ultimate skills into the Dragon Elephant True Essence, the explosive power became terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant True Essence, the supreme skill Li Che created with the help of the Dao Fruit, had a huge inclusiveness, and the fusion of the two ultimate skills into it was seamless.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were bright, but he was looking forward to how high the Dragon Elephant True Essence could be further elevated in the future.</p><p></p><p>In half a year, Li Che had immersed himself in cultivation, wanting to quickly improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The hidden Corpse Spirit cultivators in the Divine Sect had indeed brought him no small threat and pressure.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wished he could fly to improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>While Li Che was immersed in cultivation, with the generous provision of Divine Essence Crystals and Martial Elixirs from Shangguan Zhenghen, his progress was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The [Extreme Terror Seizing the Divine] from Shangguan Zhenghen's family heritage had already successfully forged the Divine Foundation. He had already forged five wheels of the Seven Emotions Divine Foundation. Previously obtained from Zhou Ruoguan, the Chaotic Joy Seducing the Divine, he had also found the Divine Foundation Technique for it in the Astronomical Observatory and forged the Divine Foundation. Now, with the [Extreme Terror Seizing the Divine] also forging the Divine Foundation, he was only missing the Worry Divine Essence.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the [Unsurpassed Thought-Defying Golden King Divine Physiognomy Technique] he had obtained earlier in the Heavenly King Tower Divine Sanctum as a prodigy, was the Thought Divine Essence, overlapping with the [Suspended Thought Flowing Sword], so Li Che directly chose to replace it. In half a year, he successfully replaced the Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Now, his Seven Emotions Divine Foundation, the main Divine Foundation, was the [Unsurpassed Thought-Defying Golden King].</p><p></p><p>"The Worry Divine Essence... it seems the Qin family cultivates it, but unfortunately, when I killed Qin Yuqing, I did not get to touch the corpse, and missed the opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed, and could only find a Nine Brilliance level Worry Divine Essence Technique in the Astronomical Observatory.</p><p></p><p>And now, he only lacked the Worry Divine Essence to complete the forging of the Divine Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Once forged...</p><p></p><p>The Seven Emotions Divine Foundation would be complete! Calming his mind, he took out a Corpse Qi Martial Elixir and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>This Corpse Qi Martial Elixir was the last of his stock, apart from this, he only had one precious Eight Extremes Martial Elixir left.</p><p></p><p>As the elixir entered his mouth, Li Che's blood qi immediately boiled, the powerful stomach wall peristalsis breaking the elixir shell.</p><p></p><p>The thick herbal medicinal properties mixed with the corpse qi burst out, refining Li Che's physique! At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, then opened them again, and with a quick circular motion of his hands around his body, countless arm shadows suddenly appeared, densely floating out!</p><p></p><p>A unique state of mind emerged, as if transforming into a thousand-armed Guanyin.</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>The countless palm shadows scattered from all directions, smashing the airflow in the courtyard into pieces!</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Armed Divine Sculpture Technique transmitted by the Astronomical Observatory, with the accompanying Divine Essence martial art, the Thousand-Armed Divine Sculpture... has reached the Transformation Realm! The ninth Transformation Realm martial art! The White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, Li's Eight Consecutive Bone-Shattering Spear, the Wrathful Crying Hundred Ghosts Wind Lightning Arrow, the Amitabha Golden Armor, the Python Dragon Cannon, the Cloud Hawk Stepping on Clouds Soar, the Corpse Spirit Death Smoke Finger, the Furious True Lord Three Blade Sword, and... the Thousand-Armed Divine Sculpture! Nine martial arts, finally... all have stepped into the Transformation Realm! Integrating the Transformation Realm state of the Thousand-Armed Divine Sculpture into his Divine Meridian.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, under Li Che's skin, it seemed as if countless snakes were wriggling, bulging up one small lump after another! Boom--! Li Che opened his mouth and exhaled a long breath.</p><p></p><p>The surging qi flow, like waves sweeping across the sea! "The Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian!"</p><p></p><p>"Accomplished!"</p><p></p><p>In half a year, he had mastered the Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian! Li Che had finally adjusted his own state to the optimal condition, relying on the powerful martial arts talent brought by the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>With the perfected state of the Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian, he was ready to assault the Patriarch Realm!</p><p></p><p>Standing in the courtyard, the air around Li Che seemed to have become thick and heavy, as if infused with a thousand-pound lead.</p><p></p><p>That was the oppressive aura brought by the Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Transformations of the Divine Meridian... it should be rare for someone to reach this level."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan only reached the Patriarch Realm with the Seven Transformations of the Divine Meridian, because he didn't have time to linger and cultivate another martial art to the Transformation Realm, fearing that with his age, his qi and blood would start to decline, and the gain would not outweigh the loss."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, who reached the Patriarch Realm with the Seven Transformations of the Divine Meridian, is invincible at the Patriarch Realm, then what about me?"</p><p></p><p>"How many Li Qingshans can I crush?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered with a gleam of light.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curled into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, pressing his fingertips together, tearing the air, and from the Qian Yuan Space, he took out a bottle of elixir, in which there was only one vermilion-red elixir pill.</p><p></p><p>It was an Eight Extremes Martial Elixir, obtained from Shangguan Zhenghen's family heritage, the highest quality elixir Li Che currently possessed.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the elixir pill, heavy as a lead ball sinking down.</p><p></p><p>Gulp--</p><p></p><p>Li Che's powerful stomach wall suddenly contracted, crushing the elixir, breaking the elixir shell, and the violent medicinal effects immediately gushed out!</p><p></p><p>The conditions to become a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Require the mastery of an ultimate skill, and the completion of at least the Third Transformation of the Divine Meridian...</p><p></p><p>And these two points, for Li Che, do not pose any problem at all.</p><p></p><p>He has learned three ultimate skills, and his Divine Meridian has completed the Nine Transformations...</p><p></p><p>It can be said that he is in the actual state of Divine Meridian perfection.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che today does not intend to drag it out.</p><p></p><p>In one go.</p><p></p><p>Achieve the Patriarch Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Golden Light Peak, in the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin led Xixibao into the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>This was Xixibao's second time stepping into the Divine Hall, and the little Huhu on her shoulder slightly unfurled its wings, as if it could smell a familiar scent, so it was very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo, dressed in white, with her hair scattered, looked kindly at Xixibao.</p><p></p><p>"Xixibao, in half a year, how have your cultivation results been? Because of the incident during the last monthly assessment, you have not participated in the monthly assessment of the sect disciples this half year..."</p><p></p><p>"But in this half-year period, I as your teacher must still assess you."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's voice was gentle.</p><p></p><p>Xixibao immediately stood up straight, puffing out her chest and little belly.</p><p></p><p>In half a year, Xixibao had grown a bit, the three-and-a-half-year-old... her little belly had gone down a bit.</p><p></p><p>The long legs inherited from Zhang Ya were gradually taking shape.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher! I'm ready!"</p><p></p><p>Xixibao was full of fighting spirit!</p><p></p><p>Because the sect had protectively not let her participate in the monthly assessment, she hadn't fought in half a year.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo shook her head helplessly, seeing through Xixibao's desire to fight.</p><p></p><p>"This half-year assessment is actually not really an assessment of you..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo pointed to the Seven Treasure Relic Pagoda of the Heavenly King, which was placed on the altar, the Heavenly King Tower.</p><p></p><p>Xixibao was completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I will open the Heavenly King Tower again, and the Heavenly King will assess your cultivation of the [Extreme Sorrow Wind Fire Subduing the Dragon Three Great Princes] Divine Physiognomy Technique, as well as the Divine Essence Secret Art [Purgatory Flame Lapis Lazuli Body]."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I forgot to tell you last time, every half a year, you will enter the Divine Sanctum of the Heavenly King Tower again..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the treatment that all the genius children who can enter the Divine Sanctum possess, until you reach the age of twelve."</p><p></p><p>"After you turn twelve, the Divine Sanctum of the Heavenly King Tower will no longer be accessible."</p><p></p><p>"You wanted to fight, didn't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Go, inside the Divine Sanctum... you should be able to fight to your heart's content."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo laughed.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a touch of mischievousness, she looked at Xixibao.</p><p></p><p>"Remember... don't cry."</p><p></p><p>Xixibao immediately put her hands on her hips, her eyebrows raised.</p><p></p><p>I, the Great Emperor Xixibao, how could I possibly cry?!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

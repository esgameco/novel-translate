        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That was... the aura of the dead! On Xu Jiuqing's body, there was actually the signature aura of the evil followers of the Corpse God Sect! In that instant, Nan Lihuos understood.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing, the Enforcement Hall Elder of the Jingang Division of the Qianxuan Immortal Sect...</p><p></p><p>was actually a hidden high-ranking evil follower of the Corpse God Sect within the Immortal Sect!</p><p></p><p>The evil one who had attacked his precious true disciple! "This is outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"He deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos' eyes seemed to ignite with golden flames, his fury surging like a great tide. </p><p></p><p>He was truly... angry!</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a grave humiliation.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else, Nan Lihuos would not be so furious, but Xu Jiuqing... was an Enforcement Hall Elder! He represented the authority of the Immortal Sect's judgments!</p><p></p><p>Now, that authority...</p><p></p><p>had been corrupted! Nan Lihuos' expression turned icy cold, and golden flames slowly began to leap out from his skin.</p><p></p><p>One spark, two sparks, three sparks...</p><p></p><p>Starting as small flames, they soon gathered into a raging divine fire!</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos took a step forward, instantly transforming into the ultimate radiance and shooting towards the direction of Liushuan Peak.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>after Nan Lihuos sensed the aura of the dead on Xu Jiuqing,</p><p></p><p>powerful divine auras also erupted from the other Elder Peaks, sweeping in!</p><p></p><p>From Liangxiu Peak, Zhang Qing in his shabby Confucian robe, with furrowed brows and a foul expression, was filled with indignation. "That bastard Xu Jiuqing!"</p><p>"How dare he!"</p><p></p><p>From Hongxun Peak, Zhu Hongdou summoned the divine aura of the Fire God, her eyes burning with red flames as she gripped her long spear and rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>From Nanshan Peak, an elderly man leaning on his cane shook his head.</p><p>"Before, everyone suspected me, making me afraid to speak up... Now the thunder has struck, huh."</p><p>Weng Wuyuwu sighed helplessly. He didn't really mind, as he was already half-buried in the earth, not caring about such matters anymore. He firmly planted his wooden cane, and a powerful divine aura burst forth as he strode towards Liushuan Peak!</p><p>This guy who had made him bear the suspicion for so long!</p><p>He should pay the price, right?...</p><p></p><p>At Zhenglie Peak,</p><p>Li Qingshan had just returned to the temple and entered the state of observing the divine aura, but his divine sense was still expanded outward.</p><p>The surging aura from Liushuan Peak was too intense, and Li Qingshan immediately understood what had happened.</p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"That brat Li Yue... hogging all the fun!"</p><p>"Why didn't he call me to capture the traitor, the evil follower of the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p>Li Qingshan beat his chest and stomped his feet, his heart torn apart. </p><p>He had missed such a big event! But he was helpless, as he couldn't hold back his urge. Feeling the restless divine aura, he could only calm himself down, not letting his emotions fluctuate wildly, and maintain composure.</p><p>Observing the divine aura was the priority!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon?!"</p><p>Seeing the raging Ox Demon mask in the turbulent wind, Xu Jiuqing immediately recognized it - this was the signature of the Ox Demon, a cute ox-like mask! </p><p>But beneath this adorable mask hid an extremely ferocious face, one that had almost single-handedly overthrown the Fishermen's Alliance! Xu Jiuqing gripped the divine sword he had nurtured, and his heart was now in a tumultuous state!</p><p>He was certain that Li Qingshan had investigated his identity and discovered that he was a member of the Corpse God Sect! So, he had hired the Ox Demon and the Horse Face, the two notorious figures who had risen to fame in the Jingang Prefecture!</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Xu Jiuqing was furious beyond measure!</p><p>Li Qingshan - ! The appearance of the Ox Demon did not worry Xu Jiuqing much.</p><p>Compared to the Horse Face, who lurked in the distance and unleashed his terrifying divine arrows that were hard to detect,</p><p>the straightforward martial artist Ox Demon was much easier to deal with.</p><p>After all, Xu Jiuqing had a body of bronze corpse that was almost as indestructible as a diamond!</p><p></p><p>Li Yue looked at Xu Jiuqing indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>In an instant, the extremely stimulating [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao fruit in his chest was activated and unleashed!</p><p>Wrathful Vajra!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, his already inhuman gigantic physique expanded and swelled even further, like a twisted rubber ball suddenly pulled apart!</p><p>Thick veins emerged from beneath his skin, pulsing and roaring like an enraged dragon!</p><p>His eyes shone with divine light, with wisps of golden sandalwood-like smoke swirling out.</p><p></p><p>Ascending the Tower!</p><p>His hair suddenly grew, cascading down to his waist, his qi and blood surging like a raging wind, just like a flying cape! Clenching his fingers, he crushed a three-eyed Wrathful True Lord Shrine Deity's divine essence, which turned into smoke and was instantly absorbed by the ascending Li Yue!</p><p></p><p>The furnace of his qi and blood exploded open!</p><p>The ultimate technique, the Dragon Elephant True Might, struck out in an instant, aiming for Xu Jiuqing's head, who had turned back to glance at him, trying to crush his skull in a single blow!</p><p></p><p>Clang - ! A terrifying collision sound that could pierce eardrums erupted!</p><p></p><p>The scorching flesh collided with the cold corpse body!</p><p>Xu Jiuqing used his bronze corpse palm to hard-block the Ox Demon's ferocious Dragon Elephant True Might punch! The powerful and terrifying force instantly emerged from the Ox Demon's dragon and elephant shadows, pouring into this single punch! The Ox Demon's strength was immense!</p><p></p><p>Boom - ! The ground trembled, violently shaking, as if a giant dragon was turning over, the ground beneath Xu Jiuqing's feet instantly shattering, like hidden gunpowder ignited, sending up billowing smoke and scattered stones!</p><p>In an instant, countless shattered stones and bricks, shaken by the thunderous collision, flew in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's eyes narrowed...</p><p>His whole body was shot out like a cannonball by the unparalleled force, the powerful impact on his bronze corpse flesh resounding like the boom of a wooden mallet striking an ancient bell! Boom - ! The four walls of the room all exploded.</p><p>Then Xu Jiuqing, to the disbelieving eyes of the Liushuan Peak disciples, was blasted out, his body covered in a bronze hue and exuding a thick aura of the dead.</p><p>On the big platform, he tore out a horrifying gully!</p><p></p><p>"Furnace?!"</p><p>"Furnace!"</p><p>This Ox Demon, actually a Furnace Sect master! What terrifying power...</p><p>Xu Jiuqing stabilized his stance, looking down at the dented chest where he had been punched. Even his fully-cultivated bronze corpse flesh had been caved in!</p><p>"The Nine Transformations of the Divine Veins are required to become a Furnace Sect master..."</p><p>"Unbelievable!"</p><p>Xu Jiuqing's tall figure stood upright, a flash of astonishment in his eyes.</p><p>But just as he finished praising,</p><p>a suffocating aura suddenly erupted from the collapsed and overturned buildings.</p><p>The Ox Demon in his ascending tower state immediately charged out, roaring, and unleashed the Dragon Elephant True Might again, fusing the Eight Serpents Overturning the River and the Azure Thunder Body two ultimate techniques, tyrannical and unparalleled!</p><p>Such a punch, in the eyes of all the Liushuan Peak disciples, was like a towering mountain rising, a falling meteor!</p><p>Accompanied by the terrifying dragon roar and elephant screech, the surging airflow was like dragons! Many disciples turned pale, just by looking at it, feeling as if their souls had been stolen, wanting to vomit blood in distress!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment...</p><p>Xu Jiuqing had completely unleashed himself! A gigantic and clear divine aura appeared behind him, that of a sword-wielding sword immortal deity.</p><p>The divine aura slowly drew its sword, instantly unleashing countless surging sword qi rampaging across the Liushuan Peak platform!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing blocked the Ox Demon's terrifying punch.</p><p>That Ox Demon, raging like a mad bull, was truly terrifying, his fist techniques containing so much meaning! But what really caught Xu Jiuqing's attention was...</p><p>his divine aura's realm pressure did not seem to suppress the Ox Demon at all! Instead, he felt a slight sense of oppression from the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Shrine Deity?!"</p><p>Xu Jiuqing's pupils contracted, sensing something.</p><p></p><p>Boom - ! Like the earth splitting and mountains collapsing, the entire platform was engulfed in a blizzard of flying snow, like an inverted curtain!</p><p>"You... have the aura of a Shrine Deity?!"</p><p>Impossible! To borrow the power of a Shrine Deity...</p><p>One must first perform the ritual of worshiping the Shrine Deity!</p><p>This Ox Demon, didn't even have any such ritual!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's bronze corpse flesh flashed with brilliant copper light, ringing like a huge bell being struck.</p><p>Yet, he managed to block the Ox Demon's tyrannical attacks!</p><p>The terrifying force, like the collapse of a towering mountain, pressed down, and even the fully-cultivated bronze corpse of Xu Jiuqing felt a bit strained!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom -</p><p>Xu Jiuqing's expression was extremely unsightly, his hair flying.</p><p>As a divine aura realm cultivator and a late-stage sect master, </p><p>he had been suppressed from the start, first by the Dragon Tooth bullets from the Horse Face, and now continuously by their relentless attacks!</p><p>The Ox Demon and Horse Face's offensive was like endless waves, leaving him no chance to catch his breath!</p><p>Xu Jiuqing was furious beyond measure.</p><p>But his heart also grew a bit cold.</p><p>The Ox Demon could not kill him! The Ox Demon's strength was indeed not weak, with a cultivation likely at the initial divine aura realm. If Xu Jiuqing had not cultivated the nearly indestructible bronze corpse...</p><p>He would probably already be a corpse, attacked by both the Ox Demon and Horse Face!</p><p>The Ox Demon's initial goal was perhaps to kill him.</p><p>But upon discovering that he could not be killed, they decided to make a grand spectacle instead!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom -</p><p>The terrifying punching force, like surging waves, kept crashing down!</p><p>The Ox Demon's towering figure, with a demonic face on his back, every time his feet heavily stepped, he would swiftly charge towards Xu Jiuqing.</p><p>Engaging in a battle of flesh and blood! Engaging in close-quarters combat!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's heart was greatly alarmed, his bronze corpse's indestructible flesh, after exchanging dozens of blows with the Ox Demon...</p><p>seemed to be unable to withstand it anymore!</p><p>After all, </p><p>who has the true indestructible bronze corpse?!</p><p>How could the Ox Demon's flesh be so terrifying?!</p><p>Simply refining an undying golden vajra-like robust physique with his qi and blood alone!</p><p></p><p>Rumble - ! The two clashed in close combat again! The resonant sound of a thick ancient bell being struck, the sound waves dispersing and surging!</p><p>Like thunderous lightning striking a snowy mountain platform, in an instant, mud, sand, and flying snow swirled!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing was furious to the extreme! "Ah, my Qiankun Jade!"</p><p>"Ah, you shameless ox, horse, and dog scum!"</p><p></p><p>Another collision! Xu Jiuqing finally realized that his Qiankun Jade had been stolen by the Ox Demon during their physical clash!</p><p>How could he be so unlucky?! Xu Jiuqing was enraged beyond measure, unleashing the mighty divine aura of the divine aura realm, and his sword immortal divine aura finally drew its sword, unleashing a terrifying sword light!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's eyes behind the mask were unfathomable, unhesitatingly exploding backwards!</p><p>Cloud-stepping, like a falcon, he took a few steps and quickly distanced himself. But Xu Jiuqing's sword was not aimed at the Ox Demon!</p><p>His heart, however, was extremely anxious. Although his Qiankun Jade had been stolen, suffering a great humiliation, he did not wish to continue engaging the Ox Demon.</p><p>He had sensed an extremely terrifying aura rapidly approaching, as if the heavens were collapsing!</p><p>The dreadful pressure made his body almost stiffen!</p><p>"Nan Lihuos!"</p><p>The roar burst from his mouth!</p><p></p><p>His hair flying, the sword immortal divine aura that had drawn its sword behind him suddenly opened its eyes, its eyes turning an extremely ferocious crimson red.</p><p>Thick death qi and corpse qi swirled around it!</p><p>Savagery, cruelty, slaughter, terror...</p><p>All kinds of divine emotions, like storm ripples, surged towards the entire Liushuan Peak.</p><p>Almost all the Liushuan Peak disciples were enveloped by this divine aura.</p><p>One by one, they seemed to go mad, their eyes turning scarlet, and the weaker ones, unable to withstand this impact, directly vomited blood and fainted.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p>Nan Lihuos' voice had already erupted.</p><p>As soon as the voice reached, Nan Lihuos' figure swiftly followed.</p><p>"Nan Lihuos, stop!</p><p>If you dare to step foot on Liushuan Peak, I will kill all the disciples of Liushuan Peak!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A low roar came from the upright figure of Xu Jiuqing, whose body was a bronze color, with wild red hair and a ferocious expression.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand, which had been nurtured over many years, was now half drawn from its sheath.</p><p></p><p>The sharp and terrifying sword qi surged and raged across the vast plain.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly crazed disciples felt their bodies being slashed by the sword qi, with blood flowing incessantly - a cruel and merciless sight! Xu Jiuqing's sword qi... was actually connected to every single disciple of the Liushanjian Peak!</p><p></p><p>What he had nurtured was not just sword qi, but the very lives of thousands of Liushanjian Peak disciples!</p><p></p><p>Malicious! Ruthless!</p><p></p><p>Boom! A scorching heat exploded in the air.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo was enveloped in a brilliant golden flame. Then, it plummeted down without any hesitation, landing on the vast plain and instantly vaporizing all the accumulated snow with its terrifying golden divine fire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's eyes narrowed... He did not expect Nanlihuo to be so indifferent to his threat! Those were the lives of thousands of Liushanjian Peak disciples! As the sect master, how could you be so heartless?!</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes burned with golden flames as he glared coldly at Xu Jiuqing. With a sweep of his sleeve, he appeared behind Xu Jiuqing in just three steps, his white hair flying.</p><p></p><p>He then slammed his palm down, and Xu Jiuqing's indestructible bronze body was instantly ignited and consumed by the scorching golden flames from within.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Xu Jiuqing exclaimed in horror and rage.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding everything, he hastily drew his sword. In an instant, all the disciples within Liushanjian Peak were slashed by the sword qi, spewing blood and letting out agonizing cries.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes grew even colder. He placed his palm on Xu Jiuqing's chest, and the indestructible bronze body was directly dissolved and pierced through, with the internal organs reduced to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing, maintaining his sword-drawing posture, coughed up blood and let out a bitter laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, Nanlihuo... You truly are a heartless being!"</p><p></p><p>"You betrayed the Corpse Deity Sect, and you dare to call me heartless?" Nanlihuo said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing continued coughing up blood, his bronze-colored blood spilling from his mouth. "Do you not know why I betrayed the Corpse Deity Sect? Do you not understand my reasons?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing glared at Nanlihuo, baring his teeth. "Because... I know the truth!"</p><p></p><p>His expression became even more ferocious. "The esteemed Enforcement Hall Elder, betraying the sect and joining the Corpse Deity Sect - it is a disgrace to my Golden Light Sect! A great humiliation!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo remained cold and indifferent. "You should die!"</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his hand, his fingers not stained with a single drop of blood, and five small flames flickered on his fingertips. Forming a claw, he lunged towards Xu Jiuqing's brow.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing stared at Nanlihuo, silently laughing. With a loud bang, his head exploded.</p><p></p><p>A dense aura of death and decay burst forth, and a dark, smoky figure emerged from the shattered mind, its eyes glowing red, with the marks of the Seven-Element Corpse Curse occasionally visible.</p><p></p><p>The crimson figure stood in the sky, its gaze fixed on Nanlihuo, then shifting to the seemingly insignificant Niumo in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Niumo... You have a great secret... You can utilize the power of the temple gods so perfectly..."</p><p></p><p>"Niumo! My sect will grant you eternal bliss!"</p><p></p><p>"My sect needs you!"</p><p></p><p>The hoarse voice of the crimson figure echoed as it stepped into the swirling black smoke.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo instantly vanished in a golden light, and numerous golden flames transformed into terrifying fiery palms, exuding a suffocating aura of power.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Manifestation Strike! Attempting to crush the massive black smoke vortex.</p><p></p><p>The black smoke figure let out a scream, and from the dense, rolling black clouds, a massive, compressed balloon-like face emerged, sweeping down with a powerful nose like a celestial hammer.</p><p></p><p>This was a true battle between Primordial Manifestation cultivators, a terrifying display of power that illuminated the night sky.</p><p></p><p>"Pilu Nose Corpse Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes narrowed. However, he quickly formed a precious pagoda seal, and a towering pagoda phantom descended, colliding with the fearsome Pilu Nose Corpse Deity.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiuqing's soul had merged with the Corpse Curse seal, and if it were to leave, he could be reborn through the corpse. Therefore, Nanlihuo was unwilling to let the Corpse Curse seal depart unharmed.</p><p></p><p>While Nanlihuo and the Pilu Nose Corpse Deity of the Corpse Deity Sect were engaged in their divine battle, Zhang Qingzheng and Weng Wuyu, two Venerable Elders, had arrived at the vast plain of Liushanjian Peak.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qingzheng's face was filled with a murderous aura, while Weng Wuyu sighed with regret, "What a tragedy..."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, and their divine power erupted, calming the injuries of the wounded disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The sect master truly trusts us. If we fail to save them, it would be the lives of thousands of disciples..."</p><p></p><p>Weng Wuyu gripped his peach wood cane and took a deep breath. Zhang Qingzheng ignored him, his expression sour.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't be saved, it was Weng Wuyu's fault, not his concern.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the fleeting battle seemed to be approaching its conclusion. Nanlihuo's power was terrifying, and his precious pagoda seal was pushing the Pilu Nose Corpse Deity back, almost crushing its massive nose.</p><p></p><p>Just as Nanlihuo was about to reach out and shatter Xu Jiuqing's Corpse Curse seal, a horrifying sonic boom rolled in.</p><p></p><p>As the sound approached, a dazzling crimson arrow shot towards Nanlihuo's palm. Nanlihuo had to change the direction of his strike, slapping the terrifying celestial arrow.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Brilliant explosions rocked the night sky. Nanlihuo shattered the divine arrow with his fingers, his eyes burning with fiery rage.</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze towards the direction of the city lord's mansion, seemingly spotting a young man in elegant robes sitting leisurely in a pavilion, sipping from a porcelain cup. Beside him, a bow-wielding archer slowly lowered his gleaming divine bow.</p><p></p><p>"Su Huaili!"</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's lips moved, and his cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>But in the brief moment of distraction, Xu Jiuqing's soul, wrapped in the Seven-Element Corpse Curse seal, had already vanished into the swirling black smoke.</p><p></p><p>The black smoke vortex suddenly burst, and the massive Pilu Nose Corpse Deity also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The night fell silent, with a biting cold wind blowing, and large snowflakes drifting down.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's flames retreated back into his body, his white hair flying as he pulled his sleeves back, his gaze fixed on the direction of the city lord's mansion, his eyes filled with icy coldness and undisguised killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili, the lord of the Golden Light Manor! Nanlihuo did not expect Su Huaili to intervene at this moment, allowing Xu Jiuqing's soul, trapped in the Corpse Curse seal, to escape.</p><p></p><p>The young man in elegant robes sitting in the pavilion smiled and raised his cup.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Sect Master Lihuo, I'm truly sorry... I had just returned from seclusion and saw this Corpse Deity Sect disciple, and my anger flared up. I wanted my archer to kill this evil person, but alas, his archery skills are lacking, and the shot went astray."</p><p></p><p>His gentle voice was filled with sincere apology.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes grew cold. He slowly closed his eyes and then opened them again.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord, for your assistance. However, your archer's skills are indeed lacking, and he needs to practice more."</p><p></p><p>With that, Nanlihuo's words fell, and the archer beside the young lord raised his divine bow again, his eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Lord Su Huaili stood up and pressed down the archer's bow.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! How dare you aim a divine arrow at the Sect Master Lihuo! Go, you are fined ten taels, go find the general for punishment!"</p><p></p><p>The archer saluted and left, his armor clanking.</p><p></p><p>Su Huaili then smiled and bowed towards the direction of the sect, but his expression soon turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"That old fox, truly able to endure."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo closed his eyes. A fine of ten taels... truly a humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's powerful aura gradually dissipated as he floated down to the vast plain. His gaze swept across, finally resting on the seemingly inconspicuous Niumo.</p><p></p><p>His powerful, almost Primordial Manifestation-level divine sense then scanned the old tree trunk at the foot of Liushanjian Peak, where the masked Mamian stood, his machine gun aimed at the black vortex in the sky, a hint of regret on his face.</p><p></p><p>This Mamian was Li Che's painting projection, his main purpose being to provide long-range fire support with the South Wushan Immortal Barret.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Niumo... Mamian..."</p><p></p><p>He pondered these two names. He had certainly heard of their reputations.</p><p></p><p>Niumo, the hero of Feiluo City, who had come to the imperial capital and ruthlessly slaughtered all the hidden Corpse Deity Sect disciples within the Fishermen's Gang, truly hating evil with a passion.</p><p></p><p>And Mamian, who had collaborated with Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu to assassinate the Corpse Deity Sect's Shangguan Zhenghen, his divine archery skills rivaling the archer beside Su Huaili, the elite from the state capital's Divine Guard Army.</p><p></p><p>As for Niumo, his fleshly body was unparalleled, even reaching the level of a Furnace Master, able to contend with the Corpse Bronze Body cultivated by Xu Jiuqing.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, Niumo possessed Primordial Manifestation-level power, as he could even utilize the power of the temple gods to ignore the aura pressure of the Primordial Manifestation realm.</p><p></p><p>Truly a remarkable Niu-Ma duo.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo had initially suspected that Niumo and Mamian might be the same person, but now the truth was clear - they were two separate individuals, from the same organization.</p><p></p><p>What kind of power or organization were they from? The forces in the imperial capital were too numerous, with people coming from the nearby provinces and cities, a chaotic mix.</p><p></p><p>So Nanlihuo was not particularly concerned about Niumo and Mamian's origins.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's gaze flickered, and he thought of the archer beside Su Huaili...</p><p></p><p>Niumo, hidden in the darkness, seemed to sense Nanlihuo's sweeping gaze and felt the hair on his body stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Jiuqing, a Primordial Manifestation cultivator, was someone he couldn't kill. How could he, Li Che, even consider taking on Nanlihuo?</p><p></p><p>Li Che quickly decided to summon his Feiluo chess piece to teleport away.</p><p></p><p>However, Nanlihuo seemed to have also remembered Niumo's mysterious teleportation abilities, and he quickly raised his hand and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Niumo, please wait!"</p>

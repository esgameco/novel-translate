        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, where did you hear this from?" Li Che took a deep breath, his heart sinking, and hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar took a puff of his pipe, exhaling a hazy smoke, his brows furrowed: "At first, I didn't believe it either, but seeing that Xixia wasn't delivered by Granny Lei, so I specifically went to inquire about it..."</p><p></p><p>"It's true, the few families whose children died have all gone to the city authorities, and the authorities have also issued a wanted notice, currently searching for Granny Lei!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe it, you can go check the notice board at the authorities, the wanted notice is posted there."</p><p></p><p>The old scholar's voice also became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although he was regretful that Xixia didn't have a son, after all, she was the Li family's descendant. Upon hearing such news, the first thing he was concerned about was Xixia's safety.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this Granny Lei... worshipped the 'Spiritual Infant Dharma Master', believed in the Spiritual Infant teachings, and suddenly killed... Ah, it's truly a sin, they were just children."</p><p></p><p>The old scholar's voice even trembled a bit, sighing deeply, puffing on his pipe non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression was extremely grave, his heart hanging in suspense.</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Che, Xixia was the apple of his eye, his most precious daughter. If anything were to happen to her, Li Che would be heartbroken and filled with self-blame.</p><p></p><p>Protecting his daughter was the duty and responsibility of a father!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, uncle, I'll go investigate this, so I can prepare early." </p><p></p><p>Li Che said seriously, and the old scholar quickly nodded, then rubbed his hands: "Since you're here, I'll take the opportunity to go see Xixia as well..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was speechless, looking at the bashful old scholar, and didn't say anything, leading him into the house.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar saw Xixia, his old face beaming with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He may have complained that Xixia wasn't a boy, but his fondness for her was genuine.</p><p></p><p>"Your sister-in-law is also about to give birth, your aunt said her belly is pointed, so it should be a boy... Hehe, I hope the little one will be as cute as Xixia." The uncle laughed brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>His eldest son had married, and this year, the child would be born.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, during the time I'm not at home, you must keep the doors and windows locked, no matter who calls, don't open the door..."</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the old scholar, Li Che, before going to work, specifically reminded Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was stunned, but didn't ask anything, just obediently expressed that she would do as told.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Worried all the way, Li Che arrived at the notice board of the authorities, and sure enough, he saw the wanted notice for Granny Lei.</p><p></p><p>"Lei Chunlan, killed seven children, all of whom she had delivered a year ago..."</p><p></p><p>"Hm? A year ago... So, do these killed children all need to be at least one year old?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, looked at the notice, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to put his trust in his own speculation.</p><p></p><p>What if this Lei Chunlan would also choose to target infants just a month old? Li Che didn't dare to gamble... </p><p></p><p>And he couldn't afford to gamble.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I must become a wood carving master at Xu's Wood Carving Shop. As long as I have the protection of Xu's Shop, at least I'll be safe."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, adjusted his hat, and headed to Xu's Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived at the wood carving shop, he saw the white-haired and white-bearded Chen Shifu, sitting in a chair, humming a little tune while sipping from a gourd of wine.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, you're here? I heard you want to take the wood carving exam, haha, you're a bold one, self-studying for only a month and daring to take the exam." Chen Shifu saw Li Che and joked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shifu's full name was Chen Dabao, now 68 years old, and was a senior master at Xu's Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>It was said that Chen Dabao had long been qualified to enter the inner city Xu's, but he always refused to go, preferring to stay at the outer city wood carving shop.</p><p></p><p>Not only Chen Dabao, but the few other wood carving masters in the shop were the same. This left Li Che very puzzled, why didn't they go to the inner city? He had heard that the living environment and conditions in the inner city were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Anything is far better than the outer city.</p><p></p><p>"You, boy... While the inner city is good, it is equally dangerous. Nowadays, the world is in turmoil, with evil spirits and strange temples springing up everywhere, with various sects emerging one after another. The court is in upheaval, and the court's control over many cities has long since declined, so each city has fallen under the control of powerful families and nobles..."</p><p></p><p>"Between these powerful families, there is constant conflict and friction as they fight for control of the cities and the wealth they bring. An old man like me entering the inner city would be like entering a vortex, unable to withstand the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"Out here in the outer city... the conditions are worse, but with my inner strength, I can still live comfortably."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen took a sip of the old yellow wine in his gourd, smacking his lips.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, able to understand Master Chen's thinking.</p><p></p><p>"In the mountains, the monkey is king in the absence of tigers..." he muttered, emphasizing simplicity.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che thought of something and quietly asked, "Master Chen, have you heard of the 'Spiritual Infant Sect'?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen paused in his drinking, furrowing his brow and glancing at Li Che. "You've joined this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurriedly shook his head and recounted the news his uncle had told him that morning.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter was delivered by that Lei Chunlan... I'm afraid," Li Che said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Master Chen's expression also became serious. "It seems... another person who has fallen into the evil ways of this sect. Ever since the Spiritual Infant Sect, born from these strange temples, spread to Feilei City, the number of child deaths has greatly increased..."</p><p></p><p>"That midwife must have joined the Spiritual Infant Sect, her mind bewitched, using the children she has delivered as sacrifices to the Spiritual Infant."</p><p></p><p>"Delivering a child is like a ritual... Once you're targeted, it's hard to shake them off."</p><p></p><p>"That midwife... won't easily let go of your child."</p><p></p><p>Receiving confirmation from Master Chen, Li Che's expression immediately became grave and grim, his fingers clenching into a tight fist, his breathing heavier.</p><p></p><p>"However, you said the dead children were all from a year ago, so they must be at least a year old to be eligible for the sacrifice. So for this year, your child should be safe, but you still need to keep an eye out, prevent that midwife from secretly taking your child away until the time comes for the evil sacrifice!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen had seen many such cases, his tone somewhat indifferent. </p><p></p><p>He could only provide a warning. To actually help Li Che, not only was it uncertain whether he could, but their relationship also didn't warrant that. </p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che was just a laborer moving wood at the wood carving shop, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood this, and didn't ask for help.</p><p></p><p>If he did ask for help and was refused, the already tenuous relationship between them would be completely severed.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen... if I become a master wood carver at the shop, will the shop take care of me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath and asked.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen took a sip of wine and glanced at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"If you can become a master wood carver, all problems will be solved.</p><p></p><p>"The shop will provide housing for the master wood carvers. You can bring your wife and child, and they will be under the shop's protection, in the shop's courtyard... If that midwife dares to show her face, she'll be beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>"We master wood carvers have inner strength. Even if that midwife has the evil arts of the Spiritual Infant Sect to aid her, we won't fear her.</p><p></p><p>"If you truly become a master wood carver, even the lowest-ranking one, I'll be your neighbor. If that evil midwife dares to show her face, I'll slap her to death!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen wiped the wine stains from his beard, baring his yellow, jagged teeth in a grin, exuding a hint of malice.</p><p></p><p>However, the malice soon dissipated, his fingers tapping lightly on the wine gourd, looking at Li Che with a playful gaze.</p><p></p><p>"But the prerequisite is... you have to become a master wood carver."</p><p></p><p>"That's difficult..."</p><p></p><p>"What do you think qualifies you to surpass those apprentices who have spent a lot of money and have been learning wood carving since childhood, with just a few months of self-study out of the blue?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The raindrops on the ground seemed to be constantly jumping, as if being steamed by the scorching ground.</p><p></p><p>They were also like a string of pearls that had been yanked off, falling to the ground with a crisp and continuous sound, bursting forth without rest! Xue Dufu stood in place, the fierce wind blowing, ruffling his torn and fluttering sleeves.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Those fluttering arms gradually swelled and filled out, with the divine aura-woven arms emerging from within the sleeves.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the hatchet at his waist let out a humming sound!</p><p></p><p>Gripped by Xue Dufu's single hand.</p><p></p><p>"Kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to kill me?!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's gaze sharpened, his powerful martial will, like a storm, almost solidified into substance, radiating outward from his body.</p><p></p><p>The countless jumping raindrops were suppressed and unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth seemed to have fallen silent.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu took a step forward, and the hatchet gripped in his five fingers erupted with a sound like crashing thunder!</p><p></p><p>Silence, deathly stillness...</p><p></p><p>Still the same, no sound at all.</p><p></p><p>The martial will crashed against an invisible, transparent wall, unbreakable, bouncing his will back at him! Xue Dufu's expression couldn't help but turn grave.</p><p></p><p>The opponent...</p><p></p><p>Had sealed off the surroundings, sealing off the sounds, the aura, the wind, the rain, and... the sounds of the upcoming battle! They were planning to kill this grand master in complete silence! Who could it be?</p><p></p><p>Many names flashed through Xue Dufu's mind, but he couldn't pause and confirm.</p><p></p><p>However, daring to take such a stance, this was a must-kill situation.</p><p></p><p>The opponent dared to come and kill a grand master like him.</p><p></p><p>Definitely extraordinary! A grand master, with their five viscera and six organs refined and perfected, without any flaws or loopholes, their martial will and true qi fused and transformed into even more powerful divine aura! </p><p></p><p>Qi reaching three feet, aura breaking thirty feet! This is a grand master! A divine aura grand master! Although Xue Dufu was only just entering the grand master realm, being the weakest of grand masters, the supreme martial arts he possessed had certainly been pushed to the realm of refinement, beginning to cultivate the supreme martial arts of the martial saints! Even for the martial arts below the martial saint level, he had his own understanding and could be counted among the annotators and analysts of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Such an existence, before the development of the divine path, stood at the peak of the martial world!</p><p></p><p>Belonging to the true first-class experts! Even the peak experts among grand masters, those who had attained the Three Flowers, were martial saints before the divine path had become prevalent.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu, in the grand master realm, only belonged to the lower echelons, just entering this great realm.</p><p></p><p>But he also had a certain degree of confidence and arrogance! If it were in the Dao City, the Divine Capital, or cities with many experts, he would be more low-key.</p><p></p><p>But in the Golden Light Prefecture City, a prefecture-level place...</p><p></p><p>Who dares to kill him, the mighty grand master?! His powerful martial will, like ignited natural gas, burst forth with vigorous flames, striking outward in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! It struck ruthlessly against the invisible wall, like an intangible high wall forged by heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's face was ferocious, his steel-like physique continuously rising, his robes tearing apart to reveal his knotted muscle membrane! The hatchet divine weapon suddenly underwent a transformation, becoming a crescent moon blade with great force and power.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon's sharp edge gleamed with radiance! </p><p></p><p>Gripping it with one hand, Xue Dufu's gaze burned fiercely: "If you don't come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Then this old man will take action himself!"</p><p></p><p>Boom—! As the words fell.</p><p></p><p>Before the sound had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The ground Xue Dufu was standing on suddenly caved in and collapsed, countless water flows bursting open, white waves rolling, ready to shoot out like bullets at any moment! Xue Dufu instantly charged towards the high wall constructed by the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>He fiercely struck out with a single blade!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a cute cow mask, stood within the high wall, his black robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>The crack in the mask's brow revealed a golden-glowing eye, the divine Plucking Star Eye!</p><p></p><p>Combining with the heavenly and earthly chessboard, it directly manifested the chessboard between heaven and earth, isolating all exploration and perception.</p><p></p><p>Forming an excellent place to kill and cover up.</p><p></p><p>His blood and qi suddenly twisted, Li Che's entire body trembled and rang, his flesh swelling up to two and a half meters, with a triangular back, countless muscles and steel-like bones piling up together, resembling a demonic face!</p><p></p><p>He did not transform into the Divine Monkey to kill Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>Because, there was no need.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's killing intent today was extremely sharp, and to kill Xue Dufu, there was no need to change identities.</p><p></p><p>Directly in the form of the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>It would be better to just kill him.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon belonging to the Seven Primordial Arrow Master of Wendlong Mountain, the Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star Divine Bow, immediately fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>The spine roared like an angry dragon, with a twist, the power of a dragon and an elephant burst forth!</p><p></p><p>Resembling a true dragon and a giant elephant emerging and submerging!</p><p></p><p>The bowstring trembled and vibrated, like a thunderclap! The arrows nocked on the bow were actually ignited, with flowing fire coiling around them, seeming forged into a scarlet red! Sizzle sizzle sizzle...</p><p></p><p>Rolling heat, distorting the air! The Ox Demon drew the bow, the Seven Primordial Crimson Flame Flowing Fire Shattered Star Bow, pulled to its full extent, utilizing the divine archery art from Wendlong Mountain, unleashed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The divine archery art, although not yet reaching the refinement realm, had already reached the master level, the true meaning manifesting the true form! It was as if there were countless crimson flames and flowing fires appearing around!</p><p></p><p>And this divine archery art was not just a martial art, but also a divine martial art! The golden light in the brow's Mud Pill Palace Plucking Star Eye intensified.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Falling Flowers Alley, inside the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The many avatar divines meditating on the divine statues suddenly burst open, turning into dense ink mist! The Ox Demon, towering like a mountain, red-hot like a forge, with the roar of a furnace, the dragon and elephant cries from his muscular body behind!</p><p></p><p>Dyed in gold, his hair that fell to his waist whirled and danced wildly!</p><p></p><p>In an instant!</p><p></p><p>Like the rising moon over the sea! One wheel, two wheels, three wheels... six wheels, seven wheels! Consecutive seven divine foundations, blooming like a peacock's tail, unfolding behind the Ox Demon! Resembling seven suns in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Dazzling and eye-catching millstone divine foundations, radiating countless rays of light!</p><p></p><p>The seven divine natures were successively drawn out from the divine foundations, fusing and blending into the forged scarlet arrow! The seven streams of light intertwined and coiled, blooming into a seven-colored rainbow! This arrow! Driven by the seven divine foundations! Sizzle sizzle sizzle! At this moment, the air in front of the arrowhead seemed to shatter, unable to withstand the pressure!</p><p></p><p>Loosening the five fingers! Boom—!! Like the roar of a bomber engine suddenly igniting! </p><p></p><p>Akin to a thunderclap bursting in the heavens! The arrow exploded out from the Ox Demon's drawn bow, a large patch of sparks dancing like falling stars!</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the arrow was shot.</p><p></p><p>The sound was still rumbling!</p><p></p><p>The Xue Dufu trapped by the heavenly and earthly chessboard had just struck a blade on the chessboard's sealing wall, his entire body releasing aura and force...</p><p></p><p>Precisely in a power release vacuum period! The timing of this arrow was too exquisite! For a moment, the heavens and earth were silent, only the rainbow-colored arrow flying at high speed!</p><p></p><p>"This arrow..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's hackles rose, turning his head to look directly, his powerful and abundant martial will instantly sensed the arrival of this arrow!</p><p></p><p>Such an arrow! A terrifying arrow! With seven divine natures woven into it, and carrying the explosive dragon and elephant force of a seemingly heaven-born supreme master, it was a must-kill! Xue Dufu let out a long roar, one arm completely formed from gathered divine aura suddenly bursting open, countless divine auras rampaging, converging in this moment into the power he could mobilize! Numerous divine aura silver rays intertwined, gathering into a round shield-like plate!</p><p></p><p>Fiercely blocking this arrow! Boom—!!! At this moment, every bone in Xue Dufu's body stretched, countless veins on his body swelling up, abruptly raising the divine aura shield! And at this moment, through the divine aura shield, following the trajectory of the arrow! Xue Dufu finally saw the one who wanted to kill him! He saw a towering figure like a mountain, saw that cute cow mask!  "Ox Demon—?!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu only had time to flash this thought in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the arrow struck the divine aura shield.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the terrifying divine nature level pressure made him feel like he couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>The unique domain formed by the interweaving of the seven divine foundations actually made Xue Dufu lose control of his own divine nature!</p><p></p><p>"Seven divine natures?!"</p><p></p><p>"How can someone simultaneously wield an arrow containing seven divine natures?!"</p><p></p><p>The power of this arrow...</p><p></p><p>Comparable to a martial saint's supreme art! The divine aura shield shattered...</p><p></p><p>After all, it was only a hastily gathered divine aura shield, not gathering the majority of his divine aura power.</p><p></p><p>Being outmaneuvered by someone.</p><p></p><p>The breaking of the divine aura shield was within Xue Dufu's expectations! But his rich experience made Xue Dufu shift his body in the moment the divine aura shield broke.</p><p></p><p>But that was all. </p><p></p><p>Boom—! His shoulder suddenly exploded, even the grand master's formidable physique was shattered into blood and flesh powder at this moment! The powerful impact force, as well as the seven snake-like divine natures, intertwined and entangled, penetrating into his wound and body along the arrow!</p><p></p><p>The seven divine natures that could not coexist peacefully, colliding and interweaving!</p><p></p><p>Various divine natures assaulting Xue Dufu's mind!</p><p></p><p>Seeming to disturb his mentality, confusing his spirit!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's refined and unbreakable grand master martial will, at this moment, actually had an unstable feeling of dispersing!  "What a vicious arrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu coughed up a mouthful of blood, gripping the crescent moon blade with his single arm, rapidly retreating.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he is the most malicious of the Three Demons of the Underworld, the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xue Dufu retreated.</p><p></p><p>A sense of explosion, like a mountain crashing down from tens of thousands of feet in the sky, raising a terrible hurricane, suddenly appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon, in the moment Xue Dufu was hit by the arrow, swayed his body and unleashed the Cloud Leopard Stepping on Clouds technique, a realm of refinement martial art.</p><p></p><p>Landing behind Xue Dufu, close to the grand master!</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar! The tiger and leopard thunder sound burst open!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's arm covered in dragon-like veins ruthlessly thrust out a spear.</p><p></p><p>The spear twisted, instantly countless streams of light bloomed, speed surpassing, like a tyrannical king's twist, able to shatter the vacuum!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's gaze sharpened, his martial will suddenly stabilized, his face pale! He abandoned the divine nature power, choosing to forcefully suppress the seven strange and malicious divine natures within him, and then used the pure power of a grand master martial artist to confront the Ox Demon's spear thrust like a tyrannical king! The Tyrannical King Shattering Bone Spear! This was a supreme martial art refined and improved by Li Che! Now, it had also reached the master supreme art level!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's current understanding and comprehension of the Dao, after stepping into the LV4 level of the Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra, far surpassed the past! He could even deduce and perfect martial arts!</p><p></p><p>This Xu Family Eight Consecutive Shattering Bone Spear, has now been perfected by Li Che into the Tyrannical King Shattering Bone Spear!</p><p></p><p>Becoming a master supreme art!</p><p></p><p>Refinement realm!</p><p></p><p>Blood and qi, spirit, strength, true qi...</p><p></p><p>All converging into this single spear.</p><p></p><p>Like a tyrannical king thrusting his spear by the river bank, able to pierce through thousands of soldiers and horses!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's face flushed red, his temples throbbing, a grand master was no ordinary waste! Gripping the crescent moon blade with five fingers, he fiercely slashed! The crescent moon blade and the spear collided, causing an earth-shattering impact! Clang—!!! Terrifying ripples radiated and dissipated in the air! The entire area covered by the heavenly and earthly chessboard, the bluestone ground directly overturned, countless spider web-like cracks brutally appearing on the surface!</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of force impact.</p><p></p><p>The airflow, blue bricks, sand and gravel, raindrops, even the floating dust, were all shattered and exploded! In an instant! At the point of blade and spear collision.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten feet of the ground had been completely crushed and sunken by the force unleashed by the two! "Want to kill me?!"</p><p></p><p>"With just this ability... you're still not worthy!"</p><p></p><p>The wind howled, Xue Dufu's shoulder had a gaping hole, the wound extending to his neck, the seven-colored divine natures like spider webs clinging and corroding his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Dufu directly abandoned the divine nature power at the Primordial level, suppressing the Ox Demon's seven divine foundation power!</p><p></p><p>Seven divine foundations, comparable to Primordial!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu looked extremely disheveled.</p><p></p><p>His heart was pounding, feeling a great terror, this Ox Demon... was more terrifying than the Divine Monkey! The Divine Monkey, although recklessly flaunting, the martial arts he displayed were all upright and straightforward.</p><p></p><p>Only when he touched the Heavenly Jade did he become a little despicable.</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon, he felt sinister and malicious, ready to poison or attack from the shadows at any time, each move aiming to kill!</p><p></p><p>Battling the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu sensed a strong scent of death!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xue Dufu retreated with a single-handed blade, yet the Ox Demon actually blocked it!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-born strength? What a terrifying physical force!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu was horrified and appalled.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon's towering figure of two and a half meters was truly overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Staring at that cute cow mask...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mask, Xue Dufu's heart grew cold.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to distance himself, adjust his breathing, and then reorganize his attack.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's sneak attack was too sudden, and he was a bit thrown off rhythm!</p><p></p><p>As long as he remained steady and re-entered the rhythm of his great master, this Ox Demon... would definitely be unable to kill him! However...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's hackles rose, his pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Because after the Ox Demon Overlord's Bone-Shattering Spear was knocked away by the Crescent Moon Saber, the long spear that was sent flying through the air traced an extremely graceful arc.</p><p></p><p>In an instant...</p><p></p><p>A series of vibrating hums.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the thunderous roar of a tiger and a leopard!</p><p></p><p>Countless stick shadows, densely intertwined, emerged.</p><p></p><p>The martial saint's ultimate technique...</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Staff! This is...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes narrowed, and in the next moment, the Elixir of the Flesh in his dantian frantically pressed down!</p><p></p><p>Surging blood qi instantly gushed out from Xue Dufu's millions of pores!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Like a blazing sun crashing down, the vast sea of clouds was parted!</p><p></p><p>The full-power strike that Xue Dufu was unable to unleash in his previous battle with the Divine Monkey was now manifested!</p><p></p><p>He knew that if he did not go all-out,</p><p></p><p>Under this one strike of the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>He would die! Xue Dufu's heart was now shaken with terror! How could the Ox Demon also know this martial saint's ultimate staff technique?! Isn't this the Divine Monkey's ultimate skill?!</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were shaken, as if struck by a heavy hammer, caught off guard, completely unprepared!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes were about to burst. This battle... was so frustrating, so bizarre! The Elixir of the Flesh in the dantian of the great master was directly compressed!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! On the Crescent Moon Saber, it was as if dragon shadows were intertwined, and Xue Dufu's retreating steps suddenly halted, heavily stomping down.</p><p></p><p>The ground's ruins were shattered again, wild winds swirling, within a hundred-yard range, all shrouded in billowing dust! And the Crescent Moon Saber swung in an arc, flashing with the utmost brilliance, swinging madly down!</p><p></p><p>Like a blue dragon cleaving through everything!</p><p></p><p>Clang—</p><p></p><p>Countless stick shadows collided with this blue dragon blade!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying momentum exploded! Fearsome true qi and spirit qi ravaged and intersected, cutting the ground!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom—</p><p></p><p>The ground trembled, countless shattered stones slightly bouncing.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon held the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Spear, retreating several steps in succession.</p><p></p><p>Under the mask, Li Che's face revealed a trace of regret.</p><p></p><p>Was he still unable to kill him?</p><p></p><p>The great master... is truly tenacious and powerful!</p><p></p><p>But... </p><p></p><p>Enough.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Che had not used the Golden King Deity Chess Piece, and he was already able to suppress Xue Dufu, driving him to the limit! Xue Dufu has already reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>But he, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Is still far from it! Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the double pupils under the Ox Demon mask erupted with dazzling golden light, as if a golden armor emerged and covered the Ox Demon's towering figure like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>The golden armor clanged, like a true armor!  Gripping a staff with five fingers, taking a step.</p><p></p><p>The entire earth sank and collapsed again, ten feet deeper, and then another ten feet!  "Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's hackles rose, and his heart seemed to be tightly gripped.</p><p></p><p>This Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Can also use the power of the King Temple Deity?! What's going on with this King Deity? Can anyone use it?! The terrifying pressure was almost the same as when the Divine Monkey was covered by the King Deity power before.</p><p></p><p>It made him find it difficult to even move! At that time, he still had the Sage-Emperor level divine cultivation to resist.</p><p></p><p>But this time...</p><p></p><p>He no longer has it! His Sage-Emperor divine cultivation was all used up to resist and suppress that wild dog that had broken free of its leash, the seven kinds of divine power!  Without the divine Sage-Emperor cultivation to defend,</p><p></p><p>Facing the King Deity power at the Six Sages level...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's entire body was covered in bulging blue veins, like a dense net covering every inch of him.</p><p></p><p>His face was even flushed purple from the strain! "Ahhhhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>He roared continuously.</p><p></p><p>His powerful martial will rose up again! However,</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he seemed to see a golden and brilliant King Deity gently slapping down a pagoda towards him!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Xue Dufu's legs bent, slamming hard onto the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Countless shattered stones exploded!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's hair flew wildly, gripping the Crescent Moon Saber, roaring as he tried to stand up.</p><p></p><p>His martial will rose like clouds, wanting to raise the Golden King Deity's pagoda! Boom boom boom! The golden Ox Demon moved!</p><p></p><p>The Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Spear in his hand instantly whirled up layers of stick shadows.</p><p></p><p>Finally, countless stick shadows converged into one spear! The martial saint's ultimate killing move! The Primordial Oneness Spear! The long spear seemed to transcend time and space, tracing a terrifying arc, parting the raging winds.</p><p></p><p>It ruthlessly struck down towards Xue Dufu's forehead! Xue Dufu roared, gripping the Crescent Moon Saber with his single arm to block.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>That one spear, as if transcending time and space, for a moment seemed to freeze time.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Watching that terrifying Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Golden Spear pierce through his Crescent Moon Saber block.</p><p></p><p>Striking his forehead! Boom boom boom boom—! The air around Xue Dufu all exploded in an instant!</p><p></p><p>From his forehead, every inch of his flesh and blood uncontrollably trembled and shook.</p><p></p><p>The world grew silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the pounding rain brought a rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops falling to the ground were evaporated by the boiling hot energy between the two, rising as white mist shrouding the world! Everything seemed to have grown silent.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon maintained the posture of striking with the spear.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu maintained the posture of blocking with the saber.</p><p></p><p>The spear and the saber, like a misalignment of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Poof—</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu opened his mouth and coughed out a large glob of thick black blood.</p><p></p><p>Then, his eyes, nose, and ears all flowed with scorching hot blood like molten lava.</p><p></p><p>"A good spear technique..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's weak voice faintly floated up.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm only a newly ascended great master..."</p><p></p><p>"If I were a true Heavenly Immortal Great Master, I could kill you as easily as killing a chicken."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu gave a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!! Still smiling.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's entire head was then crushed like a squeezed watermelon by the Ox Demon's spear shaking and striking again.</p><p></p><p>"Chicken, your sister."</p><p></p><p>The great master's head exploded.</p><p></p><p>Even the formidable life force of a great master came to an abrupt end!</p><p></p><p>Only the lingering martial will left within the chess board's restricted area...</p><p></p><p>Indicated that a great master had once walked this world.</p><p></p><p>Clang—</p><p></p><p>The Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Spear hooked up.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Crescent Moon Saber turned into a cleaver and was retrieved into Li Che's spatial dimension.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xue Dufu's exploded head and headless corpse,</p><p></p><p>"If, if..."</p><p></p><p>"But how many 'ifs' are there in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Immortal Great Master... but you are not."</p><p></p><p>Under the Ox Demon mask, Li Che slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>The trump cards are all out...</p><p></p><p>He has finally killed a great master!</p><p></p><p>The calculated scheme after scheme, he has finally schemed Xue Dufu to death.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was using the seven divine power arrows driven by the seven cycles of divine foundation, completely restricting Xue Dufu's divine cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Then, relying on the terrifying power unleashed by the Golden King Deity Chess Piece, and the martial saint's ultimate killing move, he ruthlessly killed Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>After killing Xue Dufu, Li Che did not leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Xue Dufu's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he tapped on the forehead.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Eye suddenly tore open the flesh and blood and opened!</p><p></p><p>"Divine Technique Embryo: Bind the Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Underworld, the Divine Monkey! The Hell Fire Monkey!</p><p></p><p>A new mask, representing new emotions, a new attitude...</p><p></p><p>The moment he put on the mask, Li Che felt a slight change in his entire spirit and vitality. His eyes became lively, and his spirit became extremely active.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of recklessness and flamboyance, like a flower blooming in the darkness, constantly blossoming in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Different from the unbridled nature of the Ox Demon, the Ox Demon's unbridled nature was a kind of impetus without guilt, and a catharsis that would not make oneself regret.</p><p></p><p>But the recklessness and flamboyance of the Hell Monkey was like that of a king, with absolute confidence in his own strength, daring to challenge everything, confident that he could withstand it! So the flamboyance and recklessness had no restraint at all, nor did he want to restrain it! This was the difference between the Divine Monkey and the Ox Demon! His hair flew, and his eyes radiated golden flames.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were shining, and his heart was stirring.</p><p></p><p>"Now I... am no longer a weak one, I need this battle to break the shackles and break through to a new realm..."</p><p></p><p>"So, I don't need to be low-key, I need to be reckless!"</p><p></p><p>His five fingers covered the mask, and a low, obsessive voice burst forth from his throat.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the golden rift door in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Even though the aura of death emanating from the golden rift door was stronger than that of the Seventh Corpse Deity Emissary Monk Xuanli in the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was not afraid, but eager to challenge and defeat the opponent. However, although wearing the mask changed him slightly and released his reckless personality.</p><p></p><p>But the steadiness that was engraved in Li Che's bones would not change.</p><p></p><p>"Challenge or not, the things that need to be done cannot be less."</p><p></p><p>Under the Monkey Mask, Li Che smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly swept his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Painting Immortal clones he had already drawn were jumping out of the pure heart spirit painting paper!</p><p></p><p>Sixteen Ox Demons, carrying divine machine guns, opened fire coverage.</p><p></p><p>Horse Face in the distance, gripping the divine machine rifle, realized long-range attacks!</p><p></p><p>The Mechanical Cranes, like mechanical dogs, had been placed with self-destructing Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Bombs by Li Che in their bodies!</p><p></p><p>However, each Mechanical Crane could only carry fifty divine chess pieces worth of Avalanche Lotus Bombs.</p><p></p><p>It was a small-scale lotus bomb.</p><p></p><p>More, and the Mechanical Cranes couldn't bear it and couldn't move!</p><p></p><p>But for Li Che, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>With a light press of his palm, fifty divine chess pieces worth of Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Bombs.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh...</p><p></p><p>These figures disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Mechanical Cranes also began to run quickly, and the next moment, they spread their wings and flew towards the location of the Golden Rift Door at high speed!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom - ! ! ! After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Flames erupted, and the rumbling explosions kept bursting out from various places!</p><p></p><p>Although each Mechanical Crane could only carry a small amount of Avalanche Lotus Bombs, the damage from the explosions was not small! Under the Deity Manifestation, the cultivators were basically doomed under such explosions!</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to ambush the Golden Rift Door!" </p><p></p><p>A roar came from the Golden Rift Door.</p><p></p><p>Powerful deity manifestation aura surged, and a golden light attached to the long sword, whistling through the air, unleashing endless sharpness!</p><p></p><p>The entire night sky seemed to be illuminated!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door's ancestor's eyes were about to burst, looking at the fireworks constantly exploding at the gate of the Golden Rift Door, and a flash of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This method...</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon?!"</p><p></p><p>He roared.</p><p></p><p>Exposed?</p><p></p><p>Impossible...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door had been so low-key, and there had never been any abnormalities. All the powerful cultivators who had joined the Corpse Deity Sect had settled down.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they withdraw from the Golden Light Prefecture City, but they also almost sealed the Corpse Curse Seal...</p><p></p><p>They were waiting for the Deity Shrine Resonance Assembly to open and end.</p><p></p><p>But the Deity Manifestation Ancestor of the Golden Rift Door never thought that the Ox Demon... would still find them.</p><p></p><p>After annihilating the Heart Monkey Temple, the Ox Demon still came to them, the Golden Rift Door!</p><p></p><p>"If this Ox Demon is not eliminated, it will be a great obstacle to the work of the Corpse Deity Sect in the Golden Light Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door Ancestor's eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the endless flames.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door Ancestor also had an extremely dense death aura and corpse aura emanating from his body, and flashes of bronze and silver light were flickering in his flesh. He no longer hid.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the Ox Demon, he knew that the Golden Rift Door could no longer hide, and if he did not counterattack in time, he might end up like the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>Wiped out by the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Boom - ! From the Golden Rift Door, a figure wrapped in a white robe and wearing a bloody "Seven" mask, shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>This was the second Seventh Corpse Deity Emissary hidden within the Golden Rift Door! The two Seventh Corpse Deity Emissaries hovered in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door Ancestor took out a bloody seven-character mask from the Heavenly and Earthly Jade and covered his face. Their powerful divine senses surged outward.</p><p></p><p>Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Looking for death! The Golden Rift Door had two Corpse Deity Emissaries not weaker than Xuanli.</p><p></p><p>If the Ox Demon dared to come, he would stay here tonight! Amidst the rolling flames of the explosions, one wooden Mechanical Crane after another flew to the sky and then folded their wings.</p><p></p><p>The sharp beaks of the cranes, like spearheads, bombarded towards the gate of the Golden Rift Door!</p><p></p><p>The Mechanical Cranes fell and exploded instantly, mushroom clouds several meters high rose, and the shockwaves rippled...</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the agonizing screams of the hidden Corpse Deity Sect experts in the Golden Rift Door!</p><p></p><p>"Accurate without a doubt... too accurate..."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon is practically an insider of our Corpse Deity Sect, even more familiar with the locations of our sect members than these two Seventh Corpse Deity Emissaries..."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door Ancestor, Jinxingliet, said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The other Seventh Corpse Deity Emissary stared at the scene through the mask.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... we must report to the higher-ups of the Corpse Deity Sect, and this outpost of the Golden Rift Door must be abandoned... the location is exposed, the experts from the Shrine Guardians, the Heavenly Mandate Monitoring, and the Golden Light Branch Sect will probably all come smelling the scent and kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill that Ox Demon and then leave!" </p><p></p><p>"If we can kill the Ox Demon, it will be a great merit in the Sect in the Southern Continent!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door Ancestor's voice contained anger as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Let him just leave like that? He was not willing!</p><p></p><p>The other Seventh Corpse Deity Emissary hesitated for a while.</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon is skilled in traps and calculations, he won't fight us one-on-one." </p><p></p><p>He had studied the situation after the Heart Monkey Temple was annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Deduced the Ox Demon's way of breaking through the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he actually didn't want to fight the Ox Demon head-on, this kind of opponent was too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Can't kill him, can't catch him, if provoked, there would be occasional cold arrows.</p><p></p><p>Likes to use poisons, likes to use hidden traps...</p><p></p><p>This is not an Ox Demon at all, but a viper lurking in the darkness, biting whoever it wants!</p><p></p><p>But the Golden Rift Door Ancestor was a bit overexcited.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>The two of them were startled, and they quickly looked outside the gate of the Golden Rift Door.</p><p></p><p>In the thick rolling smoke and dust, there was a black figure, step by step, treading on the melted water after the hot waves.</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip...</p><p></p><p>The water being stepped on and exploding, the sound of it falling again was very ear-piercing.</p><p></p><p>The firelight illuminated the smoke and dust, and also illuminated that black figure.</p><p></p><p>It was a thin black figure, slowly walking out.</p><p></p><p>The figure was carrying a scarlet long spear.</p><p></p><p>The long spear was resting on the neck and shoulder, the hands hanging on it.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, swaying a bit, somewhat lazy, but hard to hide the recklessness and confidence!</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>The two Seventh Corpse Deity Emissaries frowned, staring at the figure slowly walking out.</p><p></p><p>Then, they were a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>What they saw was not the cute ox mask that had haunted their dreams.</p><p></p><p>But a monkey mask with a hairy mouth and thunderous face, the monkey face wearing a smile, confident and flamboyant!</p><p></p><p>"Monkey?"</p><p></p><p>"Not the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>The two were stunned and asked in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey wore a black tight shirt, and since he couldn't find a stick-shaped divine weapon, he temporarily used the Bloody Shocking Spear...</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's eyes, the difference between a spear and a stick was not great.</p><p></p><p>Just one has a blunt head and the other has a sharp head.</p><p></p><p>As long as the strength is strong enough and the speed is fast enough, a stick... can also kill people like a spear.</p><p></p><p>With each step, the black tight shirt fluttered in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the two Seventh Corpse Deity Emissaries floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>Deity Manifestation cultivation, and also had the power of the Silver Aura Curse and Bronze Corpse...</p><p></p><p>A bit stronger than Xuanli.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Deity Sect foundation of the Golden Rift Door... is really deep!</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld, the Divine Monkey..."</p><p></p><p>"Today, let's understand the extermination of evil."</p><p></p><p>Raising the carved monkey mask with flying fur, he narrowed his eyes and smiled recklessly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind moved.</p><p></p><p>A Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Monkey Deity's divine chess piece was suddenly grasped by his suspended divine sense in the Heaven and Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Crushed to pieces! Instantly, a surge of power rushed into Li Che's limbs and body.</p><p></p><p>Ascend the Tower!</p><p></p><p>His physical body rose slightly, but the muscles seemed to be tightened like screwed screws, each muscle line twisted and tangled like a braided rope.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power exploded along the twisted muscle fibers.</p><p></p><p>His hair grew, falling to his waist.</p><p></p><p>It flew up like a cape! The two Seventh Corpse Deity Emissaires were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon didn't show up, a monkey came out instead.</p><p></p><p>Wielding a long spear, he fearlessly charged towards them.</p><p></p><p>However, they soon became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Deity Shrine Divinity?!"</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be the Mysterious Shocking Monkey Deity's divinity from the Peculiar Shrine?!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them were greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, and their eyes were filled with the feeling that things had gone terribly wrong.</p><p></p><p>"This Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>"What is his background?!"</p><p></p><p>In the Heart Monkey Temple, Xuanli had been ordered by the higher-ups of the Corpse Deity Sect to capture the Deity of the Peculiar Shrine, the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Monkey...</p><p></p><p>But after being destroyed by the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Now a Underworld Monkey with Deity Shrine Divinity had appeared!</p><p></p><p>This Underworld...</p><p></p><p>Could it be competing with the Corpse Deity Sect for the Deity Shrines?!</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Monkey moved instantly, heavily stepping down on the ground -</p><p></p><p>The entire ground collapsed, with spider web-like cracks radiating out, and billowing clouds of dust and shockwaves spread out like a curtain! One was not enough...</p><p></p><p>On the Heaven and Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's divine sense seemed to smile wildly.</p><p></p><p>His fingertips flicked.</p><p></p><p>The second! The third! He continuously crushed three Fire-Eyed Mysterious Shocking Monkey Deity divine chess pieces! In an instant, the Deity Shrine Divinity suppressed in the Heaven and Earth became increasingly terrifying! Martial Saint Pinnacle Art!</p><p></p><p>Primordial Equalized Heaven Stick! ...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Rift Door was not far from the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>As the sound of the explosions spread, the various forces within the prefecture city all sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Manifestation and Deity Manifestation cultivators' divine senses swept over.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful ones rose into the air, looking far away.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Shrine Guardians, Heavenly Mandate Monitoring, Divine Guard Army, and Golden Light Branch Sect all had powerful auras sweeping across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, in a blue robe, strode through the void.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Deity Manifestation Realm, his flight had become even more light and at ease.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's aged face was filled with heartache, almost stomping his feet in public.</p><p></p><p>Based on his experience...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon was playing his fun games again, not letting him join in!</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu gave Li Qingshan a strange look, hinting with her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's heart immediately felt much better, at least the Ox Demon didn't bring Lin Xiu to play either, that was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, indicating he was not clear about the plan.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor of the Temple Guardians and the Commander of the Divine Guardians army suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>One was in plain clothes, the other in armor.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Divine Guardians army commander flickered as he swept a glance at Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Now, within the city of Jingang, there was a tacitly acknowledged fact circulating.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu, these two people, had joined the underworld where the Ox Demon and Horse-Face reside, and had become one of them.</p><p></p><p>The four powerful figures of the top factions in Jingang City looked at each other, the atmosphere was strange, and no one said anything. They each flew towards the camp of the Golden Rift Gate outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Before they arrived at the mountain gate of the Golden Rift Gate, the raging fire was still burning.</p><p></p><p>The four did not have time to pay attention to the situation inside the mountain gate, but their gaze fell on the distant, uneven battlefield...</p><p></p><p>There... </p><p></p><p>Two figures were kneeling on the ground, their clothes tattered, revealing their bronze-colored cursed copper corpse bodies.</p><p></p><p>But the cursed copper corpse bodies...</p><p>Were broken in their bones and sinews, their vitality extinguished!</p><p></p><p>Intense blood energy, intertwined and rampant, a wild surge of divine nature!</p><p></p><p>And beside those two Corpse Deity Sect experts,</p><p>A figure wearing a black tight shirt, wearing a monkey mask, tilting his head, carrying a scarlet divine spear on his neck and shoulders, his hands hanging loosely, was looking at them wildly.</p><p></p><p>Not the Ox Demon?! Even Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu were stunned.</p><p></p><p>This was not the Ox Demon's fighting style!</p><p></p><p>There was no divine nature crystal powder in the air, nor was there any sign of the hand's blue poison powder...</p><p></p><p>Those two Corpse Deity Sect Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoys were completely and violently smashed, killed on the spot by absolute powerful combat power and techniques!</p><p></p><p>They vaguely saw, even in the lingering air, a glimpse of that wild and reckless battle.</p><p></p><p>Facing two opponents, yet he had smashed the two Silver Gale Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoys!</p><p></p><p>"So domineering and reckless..."</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qingshan couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld, the Monkey Deity..."</p><p></p><p>The tilted-headed Monkey Deity chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Then with a tap of his toes,</p><p>Billowing smoke rolled behind him, and he plunged into the thick smoke.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the Divine Guardians army roared angrily and rushed forward, but found that in the dense smoke, the Monkey Deity's figure had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"He's gone..."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Ox Demon, appearing and disappearing mysteriously."</p><p></p><p>This commander gripped his long sword, his eyes flashing with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon and Horse-Face, and now this Monkey Deity has appeared...</p><p></p><p>Unknown, yet again unknown! Who is the Ox Demon? </p><p>Who is the Horse-Face?</p><p>This Monkey Deity... who is he?</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld... the Monkey Deity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu exchanged a glance, their eyes slightly brightening.</p><p></p><p>"A colleague from the Underworld, eh..."</p><p></p><p>The two of them were slightly stirred in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>So domineering, so reckless, so arrogant...</p><p>The Ox Demon was low-key and insidiously reckless, the Horse-Face was sly, mysterious and strange, this Monkey Deity... domineering, reckless and arrogant! Li Qingshan felt his own domineering aura... seemed to have been surpassed!</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu sighed in admiration, compared to the Ox Demon and Horse-Face, Lin Xiu preferred this domineering and arrogant Monkey Deity.</p><p></p><p>He even imitated the Monkey Deity's posture of tilting his head and carrying the divine spear...</p><p></p><p>In his casual and lazy manner, there was a kind of arrogance that did not care about the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor of the Temple Guardians, the Spiritual Boundary Supervisor, looked at Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu.</p><p></p><p>He did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Although he was dissatisfied with the actions of the Monkey Deity, the Ox Demon and others from the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>But he had to admit that these Underworld experts had helped the Temple Guardians find the evil people the Corpse Deity Sect had planted in Jingang City, which was indeed a great help.</p><p></p><p>That time at the Heart Monkey Temple, the Temple Guardians were sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the evil people of the Corpse Deity Sect in the Heart Monkey Temple were probably planning to make a move on the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>And this time...</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Rift Gate... harboring the rebellious Corpse Deity Sect! They deserve to die a thousand deaths!"</p><p></p><p>This Supervisor spoke loudly, his powerful divine sense expanding.</p><p></p><p>He immediately condemned the Golden Rift Gate! Those who were bombed, exposed to the cursed corpse techniques, but did not die in the explosion, and were injured and unable to escape quickly, the evil people of the Corpse Deity Sect, were captured and suppressed in despair!</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoys who died are not the Seven Element High-Ranking Corpse Deity Envoy we investigated, Yuan Jingang."</p><p></p><p>"The tragic case of the entire city's sacrifice in Flashing Thunder City was orchestrated by Yuan Jingang in the background..."</p><p></p><p>"This Yuan Jingang, we don't know where he is hiding!"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor of the Temple Guardians shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Jingang?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhao, can you tell us more specifically."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu was quite familiar with this Supervisor Zhao Yang and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Supervisor Zhao Yang briefly introduced Yuan Jingang, but did not say too much.</p><p></p><p>"This Yuan Jingang is not weak in strength, not an ordinary Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoy, but the overall commander of the actions of the Corpse Deity Sect in Jingang City."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Infant Feast in Flashing Thunder City was instigated by him."</p><p></p><p>"This person's strength is not weak, if you encounter him, do not confront him head-on, it's best to find the Chief Supervisor, the Monitoring Supervisor or the South Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>"The strength of Yuan Jingang, the Chief Supervisor once clashed with him outside the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince on the Nine Dragon River... it seems he has already stepped one foot into the realm of the Cursed Silver Corpse, and his divine nature cultivation has also reached the Primal Boundary!"</p><p></p><p>Supervisor Zhao Yang was very serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Lin Xiu fell silent, such strength...</p><p></p><p>If they confronted him, they might risk being beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Eyed Mysterious Monkey Deity Temple.</p><p></p><p>The quietly burning white candle flames suddenly became restless and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>As if a violent wind had suddenly blown through.</p><p></p><p>In the calm temple interior,</p><p>A figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue, wearing the Monkey Deity mask, clenched and crushed a thunder chess piece, the chess piece exploding and dissipating, the wildness and ruthlessness in his eyes also gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The lingering, restless temple deity divine nature in his body began to gradually subside.</p><p></p><p>Stirring up the divine nature of the temple deities in the mysterious temple as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue removed the Monkey Deity mask, shook his head, and the temple deity divine nature in his body slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>His whole body was steaming hot, every pore was gushing with heat waves!</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue raised his face, his hair tips damp with glistening sweat, a smile hanging on the corner of his lips.</p><p></p><p>"The martial saint's ultimate skill... although it is incomplete, its power is truly formidable, with the stimulation of the divine nature of the Fire-Eyed Mysterious Monkey Deity Temple, its power is outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Shocking Stick Shadow, ah..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, the bloody shocking spear in his hand trembled, and suddenly it burst open like a peacock spreading its tail, with endless stick shadows.</p><p></p><p>The air currents surged, the air let out a cry of being unable to withstand the burden! The candle flames in the mysterious temple flickered restlessly, reflecting Li Yue's twisted and reckless shadow...</p><p></p><p>"The martial saint's ultimate skill, the Primordial Heavenly Stick... I've mastered it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue laughed.</p><p></p><p>He had just started learning this stick technique, but today he directly mastered it! It can only be said that this battle made him feel the true...</p><p></p><p>As if with divine assistance! As if the divine was helping him, infusing him, to unleash the stick technique!</p><p></p><p>Li Yue put away the bloody shocking spear.</p><p></p><p>There was a slight regret on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I didn't get a divine weapon stick."</p><p></p><p>"Not quite as handy."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the statue of the Mysterious Monkey Deity on the altar.</p><p></p><p>As he looked, vaguely, the statue of the Mysterious Monkey Deity seemed to have shuddered...</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm here..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue leaped onto the altar, landing in front of the statue of the Mysterious Monkey Deity, reaching out his hand and starting to rub the deity's head.</p><p></p><p>The Third Eye opened.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the temple deity's divine nature chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Yue can now remotely absorb them with the Third Eye, he still likes the hands-on feeling.</p><p></p><p>He plans to savor the touch of each temple deity.</p><p></p><p>After completing the absorption of the divine nature chess pieces,</p><p>Li Yue was very satisfied as he released his hand.</p><p></p><p>As if he heard the furious screams of a monkey.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue just thought the other party was crying out in an uncontrollable pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the altar,</p><p>Li Yue directly sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I didn't get to the treasure vault of the Golden Rift Gate, no time..."</p><p></p><p>"But the problem shouldn't be too big, since the Golden Rift Gate has become the stronghold of the Corpse Deity Sect, the treasure vault must have been emptied long ago."</p><p></p><p>"At least I've taken the Yin-Yang Jade of those two Seven Element Corpse Deity Envoys."</p><p></p><p>Li Yue took out two Yin-Yang Jades.</p><p></p><p>Although he changed from the Ox Demon to the Monkey Deity,</p><p>His personality changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>But... the instinct to loot corpses is still the same, no matter how many identities he takes on, this is a basic skill for walking the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that stealing everything may harm oneself, but... what needs to be stolen still needs to be stolen.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue did not rush to open the Yin-Yang Jades.</p><p></p><p>But threw the two Yin-Yang Jades into the Yin-Yang Space, planning to open them later.</p><p></p><p>He now has important matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>"Inhale... Exhale..."</p><p></p><p>With each inhalation and exhalation, the heavens and earth suddenly became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Only the thunderous pounding of the Dao Fruit in his chest cavity.</p><p></p><p>Exploding like thunderclaps in his ears! One Dao Fruit throbbed, as if driving the other Dao Fruits to also throb ceaselessly!</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, dazzling lights flashed in his eyes, like exploding fireworks, instantly appearing before him!</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (LV4, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>It's here!</p><p></p><p>Li Yue abruptly opened his eyes, and in his pupils, there seemed to be the shadow of a dragon!</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes underwent a earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>As if a huge suction force had suddenly pulled him into the vast heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The vast heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The divine tree rose up to the sky, towering above without limit!</p><p></p><p>Its branches spread out, lush and endless, the multicolored jade-like Dao Fruits hung on it, shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's gaze was immediately drawn to one of the dazzlingly beautiful Dao Fruits!</p><p></p><p>He saw that Dao Fruit seemed to be violently shaking!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>It erupted endless mists and clouds! The mists and clouds obscured the sky and sun, and in Li Yue's eyes, they transformed into a true dragon and a giant elephant! The two seemingly ancient and terrifying giant beasts, unleashing their terrifying might, made one's whole body hair stand on end, and their spirit seemed to be frozen!

        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming and intertwined aura surged and dispersed, forming raging waves of energy.</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable pressure made Lü Chi's body hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>What? Was the earlier joke about twisting a big head and it feeling good not just a joke? Was it really going to be put into practice tonight? Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Lü Chi's face trembled slightly, but the cultivated divinity was already poised and ready, with sparks jumping from his pupils.</p><p></p><p>If the Ox Demon really tried to kill him, Lü Chi could just summon the [Third Prince]! Li Che glanced at the tense Lü Chi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was not here to kill Lü Chi, the Ox Demon... Although he was not a good person, he was not one to indiscriminately slaughter the innocent.</p><p></p><p>"What is your relationship with that elder?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lü Chi immediately understood who Li Che was referring to, and his tense heart slightly relaxed, realizing that his master must have already informed Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"He is my master," Lü Chi said.</p><p></p><p>"Are you people from the Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at Lü Chi.</p><p></p><p>In the room, the airflow raged, and the wind and rain outside became more violent, the opened window rattling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi stiffened for a moment, but gradually relaxed, though he did not answer Li Che, as someone would provide the answer.</p><p></p><p>The eyes under Li Che's mask narrowed, his five fingers clenched, and a [Wood Raven] slid out of his sleeve into his fingers, while the other five fingers trembled, the extremely fine and sharp spider silk threads already tightened and ready.</p><p></p><p>Because in the room, a figure had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The old man with half-white hair, appearing no one knew when, had a weathered face but a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had not even noticed how this old man had entered the room!</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, there is no need to worry, if this old man wanted to deal with you, your resistance would be futile."</p><p></p><p>"But this old man is quite surprised, how did you kill Sī Mùbái?"</p><p></p><p>The old man chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The nine major tendons under Li Che's black elastic shirt tensed, every muscle in his body roaring like an angry dragon, the aura intertwined.</p><p></p><p>"Although Sī Mùbái was knocked down by Lü Chi's blow, he was also at the peak of 'cultivating nature like a stream'..."</p><p></p><p>"Logically speaking, your cultivation is not yet mature, so you shouldn't have had any chance of killing Sī Mùbái."</p><p></p><p>The old man examined Li Che with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's five fingers gripped the spider silk threads, alert to the extreme, the eyes under his mask narrowed: "It was just a sneak attack, nothing to be proud of."</p><p></p><p>"A sneak attack on a cultivator of divine nature? The perception of divine cultivators is so keen that they can sense your movements even ten meters away, how could you sneak attack him?"</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head, but there was a hint of concern in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Li Che could kill Sī Mùbái meant that his martial arts skills were worthy of praise throughout Fei Lei City.</p><p></p><p>Next, he wanted to seek the Spiritual Infant Sect's main altar, and there might be an opportunity to collaborate.</p><p></p><p>"Young Li, Lü Chi and I are indeed from the Divine Sect, we are the cultivators from the Divine Sect who have come down the mountain this time to select spiritual children, only we came down the mountain and entered the city earlier, without attracting the attention of the powerful families and the city lord."</p><p></p><p>So they were indeed from the Divine Sect! Li Che's heart trembled slightly, but he did not relax.</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled, brushed off the rain on his body, and glanced at the still alert Li Che, saying, "You don't need to be so tense either. As divine cultivators, we won't care about your martial arts secrets, your concealment and bone-hiding techniques may be good, but they are not very tempting to divine cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Divine arts, spiritual treasures, divine weapons, and so on, are what divine cultivators pursue."</p><p></p><p>"Anything related to divine nature far surpasses martial arts and inner qi."</p><p></p><p>"Let me introduce myself."</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Qingshan, a cultivator from the Qianyuan Divine Sect's Yunzhou branch, and this disciple is Lü Chi, who belongs to the inner sect, with the cultivation of 'cultivating nature like a river'."</p><p></p><p>The old man looked solemnly at Li Che, making a formal self-introduction.</p><p></p><p>The Qianyuan Divine Sect! </p><p></p><p>A truly formidable entity. Although this Li Qingshan was only from the Qianyuan Divine Sect's branch sect, he was already a towering figure in the entire Fei Lei City!</p><p></p><p>"The Great Jing Dynasty has eleven provinces, thirty-six states, and one hundred and twenty-six prefectures, with one sect in each province, one branch sect in each state, and they jointly guard the mysterious temple with the Great Jing Temple Bureau."</p><p></p><p>"Fei Lei City belongs to Jinguang Prefecture, Jinguang Prefecture is located in Yunzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Lingnan Province, and is governed by the Qianyuan Divine Sect's branch sect."</p><p></p><p>The old man Li Qingshan gave Li Che a brief geography lesson.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a vast and mighty presence approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia's talent is very good, extremely suitable for cultivating the lineage of our sect's Wrath Divine Nature, so I came to inquire if you would be willing to let Xixia..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xī has entered our Qiányuán Shénzōng sect..."</p><p></p><p>"With Xī's talent, if she can establish her divine foundation before the age of eighteen, there is still hope for her to enter the main sect of Qiányuán Shénzōng."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stroked his beard and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Establish her divine foundation by the age of eighteen?" Li Chè was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Establishing one's divine foundation by the age of eighteen is the most basic requirement for the branch sects to enter the main sect of the Shénzōng... Xī has hope, the elder has tested her divine nature, and she is an exceptional spiritual child!"</p><p></p><p>"An exceptional spiritual child? Didn't the Xu family say she was of the highest grade?"</p><p></p><p>"Those born with innate divine nature, accompanied by their initial divine nature, are not obtained through later cultivation, and can thus be called spiritual children..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan laughed heartily: "Our Qiányuán sect's 'Divination Art' can fully explore the source, which cannot be compared to the experience and eyesight of the common divine cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, are you willing to send Xī to our sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan asked again, and Lǚ Chì sitting on the bed also blinked his big eyes, looking curious.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè thought for a moment and asked, "Letting Xī enter the sect... it is not impossible, but I have a question I would like to ask."</p><p></p><p>"Ask."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the sect has a 'companion cultivation' system? I want to accompany Xī to enter the sect and cultivate together, is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Li Chè was not at ease with Xī going to the sect to cultivate alone, and if he could not accompany her... he would rather not let Xī go.</p><p></p><p>Xī was too far away from him, and he had no sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Qingshan was stunned for a moment, then gently shook his head and smiled: "Of course it is possible, not only possible... Although the elder's descent to Fēilèi City was a bit late, allowing the Lingying Sect to run rampant for a while, but a few good spiritual children have still been preserved."</p><p></p><p>"Xī is one of them, and several major aristocratic families have also selected a few, and there is one more..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan finished speaking, and the smile in his eyes became even more dense and brilliant, his gaze falling on the mighty Li Chè wearing a cute ox mask and activating the Dragon-Elephant Golden Armor.</p><p></p><p>"It's you."</p><p></p><p>"A twenty-one-year-old spiritual child."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by like sand between the fingers.</p><p></p><p>It passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time Li Qingshan confronted Li Chè, Li Chè's mind had been buzzing.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that not only did Li Qingshan have his eyes on his daughter, but he also had his sights set on Li Chè himself.</p><p></p><p>A twenty-one-year-old spiritual child?</p><p></p><p>This sounded a bit strange, just like a twenty-one-year-old virgin, low in harm but extremely insulting.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said that Li Chè had pure divine nature, and Li Chè understood that it was the fruit of the "Untainted Heart", naturally absorbing divine nature, which caught the attention of Li Qingshan's "Divination Art".</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the divine nature accumulated after the birth of the "Untainted Heart" could indeed be called "spiritual child".</p><p></p><p>In other words, Li Qingshan wanted both Li Chè and his daughter to enter the sect and cultivate together.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè thought about having to cultivate in the same courtyard as a group of little brats not even as tall as his knees...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel that the scene was somehow full of amusement.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, another half a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>After the divine foundation battle, the Sī family had fallen, completely becoming the object of division among the major aristocratic families. Of course, the Sī family had not yet perished, still clinging to life, but they had completely lost their status as a major family.</p><p></p><p>The good things in the clan had all been plundered, and the divine law had been lost, directly leading to the Sī family being completely devoid of substance.</p><p></p><p>After the fall of the Sī family, Fēilèi City actually entered a period of peace and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, the calmer it was, the greater the storm that was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Lǚ Chì had completely moved in with Li Chè, and he was also arranged by Li Qingshan to protect Xī. Li Qingshan was investigating the mysterious temple outside the city and the affairs of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>He told Li Chè that the Lingying Sect was allowing the mysterious temple outside the city to expand and transform.</p><p></p><p>So he was trying to secretly find the headquarters of the Lingying Sect, and also trying to suppress the temple god that was about to revive in the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Chè and Xī going to the Shénzōng to cultivate, Li Qingshan said they would have to wait until the day the Shénzōng officially recruited disciples before they could enter, and they could not violate the rules and enter in advance.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè was not particularly concerned about this.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, the days passed peacefully.</p><p></p><p>Time does not wait, the seasons flow.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, the chill spreading.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, another bitter winter with heavy snow had passed.</p><p></p><p>Xī, she was three years old now.</p><p></p><p>Seeking to be read, seeking to be read, seeking to be read, self-reflecting every day! Everyone, don't cultivate books! (This chapter ends)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit of the Chess Saint's Second Shedding...</p><p></p><p>Supernatural powers, boundless!</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's eyes, intersecting lines were jumping and dancing like countless flowing lights.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been looking forward to what kind of supernatural powers would emerge after the Chess Saint's Dao Fruit's second shedding. The embryonic form of the supernatural power, the Great Avalanche, had brought Li Che a tremendous boost in combat power.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, he was able to kill the Patriarch of the Hunting God Pavilion, kill a Sage Immortal Venerable, relying on the explosive divine power of the Great Avalanche.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Avalokitesvara Lotus Bullet or the Wrathful Blaze Serpent Cannon, the foundation was the embryonic form of the Chess Saint's Dao Fruit's supernatural power, the Great Avalanche.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Li Che was very much looking forward to the transformation of the Chess Saint's Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, Li Che's anticipation gradually became cold and silent.</p><p></p><p>He was still reminiscing about the scene he encountered in that vast and boundless space.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly chessboard was laid out, and someone placed a piece from outside the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a giant hand had covered the sky.</p><p></p><p>Who was the one who placed the piece? Was it a god? The owner of the Dao Tree?</p><p></p><p>Who was it?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind suddenly became a bit chaotic, with countless lines jumping, making his heartbeat resound in his ears like the heavy beating of a drum.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>His breathing became calm and steady, in and out, long and stable.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the prompt changed again.</p><p></p><p>【Boundless (Supernatural Power): Black and white pieces, yin and yang boundless, endless, reaching the ultimate of heaven】</p><p></p><p>【First Realm: Black and white collapse】</p><p></p><p>【One white piece, the black pieces repel, the yin and yang in the palm, the world is silent】</p><p></p><p>【Second Realm: ???】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared blankly at the flickering prompts in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling prompts, as if black and white flowing lights were constantly interweaving and appearing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was already used to it, after the Dao Fruit's second shedding, the embryonic form of the supernatural power had been upgraded to a supernatural power, and he could only open the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous supernatural powers of 【Pluck the Stars】, 【Raise the Dawn】, and the current 【Boundless】.</p><p></p><p>They could only be mastered starting from the First Realm! It was probably because the maturity of the Dao Fruit was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had also pondered how to master the supernatural power of the Second Realm, perhaps if the maturity of the Dao Fruit was further improved, it would be possible? He didn't think much about it.</p><p></p><p>The second shedding of the Dao Fruit would bring about considerable changes and baptism for Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous second shedding of the Dragon-Elephant Golden Armor, that kind of feedback of a complete transformation, made Li Che feel as if his entire being had received a brand new baptism.</p><p></p><p>His physical body became even stronger and more flawless!</p><p></p><p>The changes to the physical body brought about by 【Pluck the Stars】 were not obvious, but Li Che could feel that his Immortal Cultivation Talent had increased even more.</p><p></p><p>It should be a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>Not as intense as the Dragon-Elephant Golden Armor.</p><p></p><p>As for the supernatural power of 【Boundless】 this time, what kind of transformation it could bring, Li Che still had no idea.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, he sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious temple was extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, there seemed to be the sound of flowing water, bursting and thundering in his ears.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Palace in his brow suddenly started pounding incessantly, like an additional heart.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly chessboard expanded outward, centering on Li Che's body, instantly covering the entire mysterious temple!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom—</p><p></p><p>There were sounds like evening drums and morning bells, constantly impacting his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>A kind of wave that seemed to shake the soul was sweeping through his entire body.</p><p></p><p>His perception...</p><p></p><p>It was expanding at a speed he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>Including the Untainted Heart Spiritual Foundation, the eight spiritual foundations were all vibrating in the Nirvana Palace inner realm, emitting buzzing sounds, tearing open the surging air currents.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling—</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a faint glimmer of light was floating up from the spiritual foundations.</p><p></p><p>Then they gradually gathered in the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a form resembling Li Che took shape.</p><p></p><p>Flickering light, rising mist! Unlike the spiritual awareness that Li Che had previously outlined on the heavenly and earthly chessboard, it had a real form, more refined and stronger, able to be used like a real body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, with countless auspicious lights.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the seven emotional spiritual foundations all appeared, and in an instant, like a peacock spreading its tail, they were extremely dazzling and eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Primordial Spirit?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che was surprised and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators at the Primordial Realm could refine the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that... he had condensed it prematurely!</p><p></p><p>Was this the transformation brought about by the 【Boundless】 supernatural power? "Boundless, boundless, reaching the ultimate of heaven..."</p><p></p><p>"Can it ignore the limits? Treat them as boundless?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was his guess, after all, at the Spiritual Foundation Realm, he could only condense spiritual awareness, not the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>To condense the Primordial Spirit, one must at least be at the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>And when one reaches the Primordial Realm and condenses the Primordial Spirit, it is only the weakest Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the Sage Immortal Realm, the first shedding would be the Primordial Spirit shedding... That would be the lively time to play with the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But he was only at the Spiritual Foundation Realm...</p><p></p><p>Yet he had managed to bring out the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? The seven spiritual foundations... are supporting the Primordial Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>If it was only one spiritual foundation, it would absolutely not be able to support the existence of the Primordial Spirit, the Primordial Spirit would crush it, and then the spiritual foundation would explode.</p><p></p><p>Even if one has just entered the Primordial Realm, it wouldn't work, one must comprehend the Primordial Realm, refine it to perfection, reach the Primordial Realm level, in order to withstand the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"No, not only the seven spiritual foundations, but also the heavenly and earthly chessboard, so it can support the Primordial Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Spirit appeared, quietly floating in the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Primordial Spirit opened and closed, as if there were countless auspicious lights flowing on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The "Seven Corpse Curse Mother-Child Seal" that was suppressed on the heavenly and earthly chessboard suddenly vibrated intensely, becoming even more obedient.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Mythical Weapon 【Nezha's Face】 seemed to tremble slightly, but it only trembled once and then became calm again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's Primordial Spirit gaze swept over, glancing at 【Nezha's Face】.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had beaten the Purple Flame Snake Spear and the Fiery Spearhead, knowing that even if the Mythical Weapons were not wielded, they could still have simple consciousness. This Nezha's Face... did it have one? Or perhaps, this mask had been secretly peeking at him all along? Li Che didn't care much.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his brilliance surpassing the flickering of the white candles.</p><p></p><p>That dazzling brilliance, it was as if Li Che's entire being was glowing!</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpected."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered, unexpectedly condensing the Primordial Spirit, although it was limited, only able to exist within the heavenly and earthly chessboard.</p><p></p><p>But this means that in the aspect of divine power, he had unknowingly taken a solid step forward.</p><p></p><p>As long as he completes the Primordial Realm breakthrough, and then refines and polishes the Primordial Realm, when he enters the Primordial Realm, he may be one of the best among the Primordial Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even breaking through to the Sage Immortal Venerable realm would be smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>"An unexpected joy."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes burned with flames, as if the Primordial Spirit was manifesting in the real world.</p><p></p><p>"It has changed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were bright, after the birth of the Primordial Spirit, he could clearly capture the divine power floating and drifting in the heavens and earth, which had become extremely dense.</p><p></p><p>Even with a thought, he could guide the divine power in the heavens and earth to surge towards him, to manipulate it.</p><p></p><p>"My divine power talent... is indeed average, but after giving birth to the Primordial Spirit, it's as if a high school student has come to learn the knowledge of a middle school student... Perhaps the talent hasn't changed, but the difficulty has changed."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>Divine power talent has always been a pain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But now, it has also made up for a lot.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it is a different kind of compensation, but as long as it can increase the speed of divine power cultivation, isn't that good? Li Che stood up, stretching his muscles and bones, making crisp popping sounds like the thunder of a tiger or leopard.</p><p></p><p>The surging blood and qi in his meridians roared like a high-pressure water gun, brimming with mighty power.</p><p></p><p>The birth of the Primordial Spirit will also have an impact on the physical body, making Li Che's perception of his flesh and blood more acute.</p><p></p><p>His mind became clearer, and his martial dao and divine power cultivation seemed to be more thorough.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood still, and wind waves spontaneously rose around him, swaying.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, the five fingers were like hooks.</p><p></p><p>"The First Realm of the supernatural power..."</p><p></p><p>"Black and White Collapse!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's palm appeared an untainted heart chess piece.</p><p></p><p>The white chess piece was extremely dazzling, with glaring light, and then, accompanied by the movement of Li Che's thoughts, one black chess piece after another appeared and were dotted around the white untainted heart chess piece.</p><p></p><p>The black chess pieces were gradually drawn and gathered to the white piece, like the pull of magnetism.</p><p></p><p>The air began to distort, and the powerful and terrifying force of collapse and implosion intertwined at the center where the black and white pieces collided.</p><p></p><p>The endless light was all devoured by the darkness, like the implosion and explosion of a black hole!</p><p></p><p>Black and White Collapse!</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the rotating black ball that appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>It's terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Avalanche was to ignite the power by the violent collision between the divine chess pieces,</p><p></p><p>Then the Black and White Collapse...</p><p></p><p>It was to compress, collapse, and devour...</p><p></p><p>When the collapse and devouring reached the extreme, it would then explode in silence!</p><p></p><p>The power...</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying! Just feeling the power of the black ball in his palm, Li Che's entire body was covered in goosebumps, with a strong sense of threat filling his heart!</p><p></p><p>Even his Furnace Sect Master physique would probably not be able to withstand the distortion and annihilation of this black ball!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze became brighter and brighter!</p><p></p><p>"Black and White Collapse... if used properly, it is a powerful killing technique no weaker than the Avalokitesvara Lotus Bullet."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>The 【Immortal Cultivation】 Dao Fruit was pounding, and he had already started thinking and researching how to refine this "Black and White Collapse" power into a powerful killing technique.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Black and White Collapse dissipated with a boom.</p><p></p><p>Turning into divine chess pieces, they returned to the Chess Saint's chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a long sigh, and the oppressive sense of destruction immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The power is great, but it is also very difficult to control..."</p><p></p><p>"Danger and power coexist."</p><p></p><p>The unexpected condensation of the Primordial Spirit, Li Che's mood was actually quite good.</p><p></p><p>At least, the condensed Primordial Spirit could help with divine power cultivation, which was an excellent thing.</p><p></p><p>In a good mood, Li Che's gaze fell on the Monkey Deity Shrine Deity, and his smile gradually spread.</p><p></p><p>Tapping his toes, his figure appeared next to the Monkey Deity Shrine Deity statue, extending his shining palm towards the deity's bald head.</p><p></p><p>Although the 【Pluck the Stars Eye】 could also absorb the divine power of the shrine deity, Li Che still felt that using his hand would be more fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Ah—</p><p></p><p>You bastard! Get lost!</p><p></p><p>The Monkey Deity Shrine Deity seemed to be screaming.</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious temple, there seemed to be a formless, low-pitched rumbling sound echoing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Light Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The rain had not shown any signs of stopping, and the thick layer of accumulated water on the ground of the prefecture city kept growing.</p><p></p><p>The incident that occurred outside the Heavenly Mandate Observatory spread through the entire prefecture city at an extremely fast pace, the fall of a Sage Immortal Venerable, causing everyone to be almost terrified.</p><p></p><p>The fear and dread towards the Underworld Realm reached an unprecedented height.</p><p></p><p>However, the Prefect's Mansion did not take any action, only dispatching the Divine Guard Army to clean up the ground and the body of the Hunting God Pavilion Patriarch, and then suppressed the entire incident.</p><p></p><p>In the Prefect's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince Shi Hai was extremely frightened, his body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>He looked pleadingly at the Shadow Guard Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Venerable, although his entire person was merged into the darkness, had an extremely grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, rest assured, the Hunting God Pavilion Patriarch was killed by the Underworld Realm, but... I still have the confidence to protect your safety."</p><p></p><p>"If the Underworld Realm really dares to attack the Young Prince, I will immediately take the Young Prince and flee the Golden Light Prefecture City."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Venerable's words, although grave, were still relatively relaxed.</p><p></p><p>That was the confidence in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Hunting God Pavilion is only in the initial stage of establishing its business in the prefecture city, so the Patriarch they sent was not very strong, just a Sage Immortal Venerable in the early stage of Primordial Realm, only able to condense the Golden Elixir Golden Gauze, and not even having the slightest trace of the Golden Body."</p><p></p><p>"That's why he was killed by the various fiends of the Underworld Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just saying this to make the Young Prince relax.</p><p></p><p>The threat of the Underworld Realm, even the Shadow Guard Venerable felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Although he was in the late stage of the Primordial Realm, if the Underworld Realm really came up with various schemes to kill him, he would still suffer heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was...</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufei had died and revived, standing on the side of the Underworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was truly devastating.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were still six Black Armor Blood Guards, all top-tier Sect Masters, forming a killing formation that could at least block a Great Sect Master who had condensed twenty divine tribulations.</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince's face was bitter.</p><p></p><p>"Father suppressed his profile... but it has brought me suffering."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the Golden Light Prefecture City actually had such a force of the Underworld Realm that doesn't give Father any face at all."</p><p></p><p>The Young Prince's heart was extremely heavy.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guard Venerable frowned: "Young Prince, pull yourself together."</p><p></p><p>"I have already sent a message to the King..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After receiving the news, the Prince will surely dispatch powerful experts to provide assistance. For now, we must focus on the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>"According to the latest information, the convoy from the Dao City will arrive at the府 City tonight... It should be within a few days that the Temple God Resonance Assembly will commence."</p><p></p><p>"After the assembly ends, we must immediately depart the 府 City..."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is threatening the young Prince in this way..."</p><p></p><p>"The Prince will eventually come to settle the score!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, the young Prince's expression gradually became lively.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the small courtyard in Falling Flower Alley after satisfactorily absorbing the mysterious energy from the temple.</p><p></p><p>The avatars of [Painting Immortal] emerged from the scroll, one by one taking the divine essence crystals from Li Che's hands, sitting in meditation to cultivate their divine images.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che's seven major divine foundations have reached the divine foundation realm, and he is launching an assault on the divine image realm.</p><p></p><p>This is a gradual process, one cannot be impatient. Li Qingshan spent two and a half years just to establish one divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che has seven divine foundations, which is much more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The profound foundation of the seven divine foundations has brought Li Che tremendous potential. Not only can he ignore the pressure of divine image realms, but his divine essence outbursts and total divine power can even surpass ordinary divine images.</p><p></p><p>If he steps into the realm of seven divine images...</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that even in terms of cultivation attainment, he may not be inferior to an Primordial Immortal!</p><p></p><p>After arranging his cultivation, Li Che hesitated whether he should also prepare a set of Wrathful Blaze Spiritual Cannon for Xixie...</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, Li Che directly took out the sixth-grade Spiritual Wood Wrathful Blaze Spiritual Cannon and began manufacturing it.</p><p></p><p>Due to his previous experience, Li Che was able to make it much faster this time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Che even planned to dye this Xixie version of the Blaze Cannon in a soft, pale pink color.</p><p></p><p>For a girl...</p><p></p><p>Even when playing with fireworks, it should be soft and delicate.</p><p></p><p>That would be so cute.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even a miniature Blaze Spiritual Cannon is not easy to refine and manufacture, and it still requires a few days.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up the courtyard, Li Che felt greatly relieved. The demise of the Spiritual Immortal of the Hunting God Hall has eliminated the hidden threat.</p><p></p><p>The presence of a Spiritual Immortal poses an enormous threat, and now that it has been removed, Li Che feels refreshed and clear-minded.</p><p></p><p>"However, within the 府 City, in addition to the Patriarch of the Hunting God Hall, there is also a Seven-Element Chief Corpse Envoy of the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"This is what Li Qingshan told me. Apparently, this Seven-Element Chief Corpse Envoy has been behind many evil deeds in the vicinity of the 府 City. The incident where the City Lord of Flying Thunder City, Cao Guang, was bewitched to hold the Thousand Infant Feast, allowing the Infant Cult to run rampant, was related to this Seven-Element Chief Corpse Envoy."</p><p></p><p>"His name is Yuan Jingang, and he is said to be at the half-step Curse Silver Corpse cultivation, but according to the intelligence from the Temple Guardianship Bureau, this Yuan Jingang has already stepped into the Curse Silver Corpse realm."</p><p></p><p>Holding a paper umbrella, Li Che's ink-black robe billowed in the howling wind and rain as he made his way through the alleys.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at a small restaurant in the storm.</p><p></p><p>A big black dog lay at the entrance, tongue hanging out, gazing at the rain curtain with a touch of poetry.</p><p></p><p>Fragrant aromas wafted out from the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered.</p><p></p><p>The sound of a bell ringing echoed as the door was pushed open.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, bring me a plate of braised pork trotters, and some stir-fried beef with green peppers..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che ordered several hearty dishes.</p><p></p><p>A faint voice came from the kitchen, "Just a moment."</p><p></p><p>Li Che found a seat near the door and sat down, locking eyes with the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind whistled, driving the rain to tilt and splash onto the ground in a series of patter sounds.</p><p></p><p>The wind-borne mist brushed across Li Che's face, and he leaned against the door frame, closing his eyes contentedly.</p><p></p><p>His ink-black robe fluttered, his legs crossed, and he had never felt more relaxed in body and mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che actually doesn't enjoy all the fighting and killing.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, he has no choice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che just wants to use his own hands to create a peaceful life.</p><p></p><p>With the death of the Patriarch of the Hunting God Hall, his family should not face any danger in the short term.</p><p></p><p>That Spiritual Immortal Guardian should not make a move, as his purpose is to protect the young Prince.</p><p></p><p>The only remaining threat is likely that mysterious Corpse God Sect's Corpse Envoy, Yuan Jingang, whose identity Li Che has not yet discovered.</p><p></p><p>Li Che feels that the Corpse Curse Seal this Corpse Envoy possesses is most likely at the Six Bureaus level.</p><p></p><p>However, the Corpse God Sect has been repeatedly attacked by the Underworld, so they probably dare not make any moves.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly...</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Sage] Dao Fruit has been upgraded to Level 4, and the Flying Thunder Chess Pieces can move even faster.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a new ability has been unlocked...</p><p></p><p>The ability to teleport others along with him! Li Che raised his hand, and a chess piece glowing with white light was constantly bouncing on his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>Playing with this chess piece, Li Che felt content.</p><p></p><p>Being able to teleport others with him...</p><p></p><p>Xixie's safety will be even more guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>If he can't fight...</p><p></p><p>He can just run.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog lying on the ground glanced at Li Che playing with the chess piece, then let out a snort and lay back down.</p><p></p><p>The rich aroma of the dishes wafted out from the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Li Che tossed a gold leaf, smiling as he received the prepared hot dishes.</p><p></p><p>This meal was not worth a gold leaf, but Li Che was happy to give it.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the restaurant, Li Che clenched his fist, and in an instant, he reappeared on the mid-slopes of Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>Brushing off the raindrops on his body, Li Che smiled and entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! It's braised pork trotters! Xixie loves Daddy the most!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie's childish, sweet voice rang out from the hazy, lamp-lit courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell, deep and dark.</p><p></p><p>The speeding convoy broke through the thick rain, the dragon horses' blood and qi boiling, steaming the rainwater.</p><p></p><p>The hooves struck the ground, splashing water.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Chaoyang, the Supervisor of the Dao City Temple Guardianship Bureau, is escorting the Elder of the Primal Origin Sect to the 府 City! Open the city gates quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Even before reaching the gates, a majestic voice erupted from within the carriage.</p><p></p><p>It was a pure and domineering aura of blood and qi, an extremely skilled technique of Qi manipulation.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master! The commander of the city gate guards narrowed his eyes, without the slightest hesitation, immediately opening the city gates.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, the towering dragon horses pulled the carriage, speeding into the city, galloping down the wide main road of the 府 City! The wheels crushed the ground, splashing water.</p><p></p><p>The carriage moved at an extremely fast pace.</p><p></p><p>Within the 府 City, the various factions also sensed the arrival.</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion, the Guardian Immortal opened his eyes the moment the convoy entered the city, appearing beside the meditating young Prince.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Chaoyang, the Supervisor of the Dao City Temple Guardianship Bureau, and an Elder of the Primal Origin Sect... They are escorting the Four Divine Weapons - the Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels!"</p><p></p><p>The Guardian Immortal spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"I have not yet sensed which Elder of the Primal Origin Sect it is..."</p><p></p><p>"But any Elder of the Primal Origin Sect must at least be at the Spiritual Immortal realm, whether they have attained Primordial Spirit or Golden Immortal Transformation."</p><p></p><p>The young Prince opened his eyes, letting out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Their arrival is good news, it means the Temple God Resonance Assembly is about to begin..."</p><p></p><p>"After the assembly ends, I can finally leave this cursed place."</p><p></p><p>An expression of delight appeared on the young Prince's face.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian Immortal remained silent, not saying more.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young Prince snorted, "That Underworld Demon Ape even threatened us... saying he would eliminate one by one the people around me, to affect my participation in the Temple God Resonance."</p><p></p><p>"But it's too late for that now, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The young Prince smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Young Prince, that is not important. What's important is the Temple God Resonance, the old King has high hopes for you... You must give it your all."</p><p></p><p>"The Infernal Lotus of the Eight-Armed Underworld, the Mysterious Temple of the Troublesome Third Prince, among them lies the inheritance of the Four Divine Temples. If you can obtain it, your future may even surpass the other princes."</p><p></p><p>The Guardian Immortal spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you cannot obtain the inheritance, if you can get the other set of Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels hidden in the Mysterious Altar, that would also be acceptable."</p><p></p><p>The young Prince's expression became solemn, no longer smiling.</p><p></p><p>"I will not disappoint my father the King."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Atop the Golden Light Peak, the doors of the Divine Temple stood wide open.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo, with his white hair flying, walked out, hands behind his back. Wang Kuyu appeared at the temple gates, his Wang Shu Yun swaying.</p><p></p><p>"They have arrived, the true Elder has come."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"The other set of Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels has also arrived."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... It is precisely because of this other set of Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels that our Primal Origin Sect can open the Four Divine Mysterious Temple for the Temple God Resonance Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Monitor said... This Four Divine Mysterious Temple in the 府 City this time, the Temple God Resonance Assembly may yield an inheritance, but it is unknown... to whose household it will fall."</p><p></p><p>"All the factions have sent representatives."</p><p></p><p>"The son of Yimo Li, as well as scions from the great thousand-year families of Dao City, the Temple Guardianship Bureau has brought a divine prodigy from the Divine Capital, rumored to have a purple aura reaching a thousand feet!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, that Corpse God Sect's Yuan Jingang... has also brought a chosen Infant Corpse from the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"And the Imperial Clan as well..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Kuyu stopped speaking at this point.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuo's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Clan of the Great Xing...</p><p></p><p>He let out a breath, his eyes looking out towards the storm beyond.</p><p></p><p>"I believe in my disciple."</p><p></p><p>With these words, Nan Lihuo stepped out decisively.</p><p></p><p>His sleeves whipped, as if ancient bells were resonating.</p><p></p><p>The gates of the Golden Light Peak immediately opened wide.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the carriage that had been racing along the official road of the 府 City to enter the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>As the Primal Origin Sect, the main branch of the Golden Light Sect, Nan Lihuo naturally had to open the mountain gate to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>This grand display shook the entire Golden Light Sect!</p><p></p><p>On Zheng Lei Peak, after putting his wife and daughter to sleep, Li Che sat alone on the eaves, contemplating the rain curtain, quietly meditating, with a hot stove and tea beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Origin Sect, the main sect, has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the celestial chess board seemed to leap out from between his brows, expanding to encompass the entire 府 City.</p><p></p><p>Bringing everything into clear view.</p><p></p><p>In the unseen depths, as if he had opened a divine eye, everything became incredibly distinct.</p><p></p><p>His powerful Primordial Spirit sat on the chess board, like a divine being overlooking the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>He saw.</p><p></p><p>The galloping dragon horses on the official road of the city.</p><p></p><p>And also the Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels, suppressed and sealed within the carriage by an elder.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The carriage continued its long journey.</p><p></p><p>The dragon horses neighed, their nostrils rolling with hot air!</p><p></p><p>The torrential winter rain pounded relentlessly on the carriage roof, lashing the burly carriage driver.</p><p></p><p>The biting winter wind blew, occasionally lifting the curtain to reveal a glimpse of the ancient robe of the occupant within the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The old man inside the carriage, however, seemed unaffected by the storm.</p><p></p><p>His gnarled hand gripped a dull golden circular object, about the size of a palm, with ancient and profound engravings.</p><p></p><p>With his other hand, his thumb pressed between his index and middle fingers, constantly moving, sealing the divine energy that covered the golden wheel.</p><p></p><p>Eyes closed, he allowed the carriage to sway and jolt, as if in a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The golden wheel in the old man's palm, which was suppressing and sealing, suddenly flashed with golden light, the inner and outer wheels beginning to rotate with a ringing sound, sparks flying!</p><p></p><p>His eyes, though closed, rolled beneath the lids.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened them, tilting his head back, his withered hair whipping wildly.</p><p></p><p>As if trying to see through the carriage roof.</p><p></p><p>The rain curtain above the carriage seemed to be disturbed by some invisible force.</p><p></p><p>Torn open, as it were.</p><p></p><p>The old man tilted his head back, his hair flying, his gaze more solemn than ever before.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus, Wind and Fire, and Golden Light Wheels...</p><p></p><p>They nearly lost control just upon entering the 府 City!

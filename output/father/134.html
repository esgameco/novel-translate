        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, like a thunderclap bursting out from behind the clouds.</p><p></p><p>After the sudden sound, it returned to a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>It represented the extinguishing of a life force, the return journey of a lost soul.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's neck was twisted, his eyes still carrying a hint of shock and unbelief, as if he had seen the truth before his death.</p><p></p><p>In the depth of his pupils, there was also anger and a plea for mercy...</p><p></p><p>Before it could erupt, his life was ended.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that his killer... would be this person!</p><p></p><p>This person suddenly appeared, like a ghost, and took his life!</p><p></p><p>Li Nuanxi's father!</p><p></p><p>That gentle and elegant young man.</p><p></p><p>That man without any presence.</p><p></p><p>That commoner from Feilei City!</p><p></p><p>In Shangguan Qinglei's last moments, only one thought remained in his mind...</p><p></p><p>Is this... the old coming after the young?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the Shangguan Qinglei whose neck he had twisted, without a trace of sympathy or reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei was about to kill his daughter, so why should he be soft-hearted?</p><p></p><p>Does he have to wait until his daughter's corpse is in front of him, and he cries bitterly, before he can be ruthless?</p><p></p><p>Does he have to experience the pain before his heart becomes cold?</p><p></p><p>That is not Li Che's style.</p><p></p><p>His rule is...</p><p></p><p>Whoever wants to kill his daughter, he will kill them! From the highest to the lowest...</p><p></p><p>All must be killed! Even if he can't kill them now, when his daughter grows up, he will kill them!</p><p></p><p>He, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Has never been a good person.</p><p></p><p>Although Shangguan Qinglei was young, he was in league with the Corpse God Sect, becoming the hidden dagger of the Corpse God Sect experts within the Divine Sect, intending to harm Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>Li Che absolutely would not be soft-handed.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, if he had left Shangguan Qinglei's life this time, it might become a hidden time bomb later?</p><p></p><p>Not afraid of ten thousand, but afraid of the one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Those who have deep resentment towards Nuanxi have a high probability of becoming such a time bomb.</p><p></p><p>So the way to deal with this kind of time bomb is to make it dud before it explodes, to cut off its lifeline.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Shangguan Qinglei's eyes that could not close in death, Li Che flicked his finger on his brow, and instantly Shangguan Qinglei's internal organs violently shook and dissolved, and his eyes and viscera melted away like water.</p><p></p><p>Only the intact body remained.</p><p></p><p>But this was enough, even if the terrifying divine power tried to trace back, it would be difficult to find his arrival and action.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Che openly displayed his killing method, so he naturally wanted to do it cleanly.</p><p></p><p>After killing Shangguan Qinglei, Li Che took his Qiankun Jade, although he guessed that Shangguan Qinglei's Qiankun Jade didn't have much, but since he had killed him, he might as well take it.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine power, Li Che generously let it go, after all, it wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>After looting the body, Li Che swept his eyes around the empty surroundings, the expansive chessboard of heaven and earth, confirming that no one was spying, then with his thumb pressing against his index finger, he made a "ding" sound.</p><p></p><p>The white Feilei chess piece was flicked by him into the sky, tumbling and turning.</p><p></p><p>When it fell, the moment Li Che grasped it in his palm, he had already returned to the room prepared for him by Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Vanishing without a trace, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The quiet and tranquil Healing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow wrapped in a shielding black mist, silently appeared, walking without wind, as if floating in, even powerful divine senses could not detect its figure.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer gently landed at the quiet resting place of Shangguan Qinglei, and when he looked, Shangguan Qinglei seemed to be in a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>But the newcomer, wrapped in black smoke, suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly swept his sleeve, and instantly...</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinglei's corpse deflated like a leaking water balloon.</p><p></p><p>The pupils, viscera, and all were dissolved into bloody water, flowing out.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood permeated the Healing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Someone has beaten me to it and silenced him!"</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless, what a vicious method... dissolving the flesh and blood, even the divine power completely erased, not letting the terrifying divine power have a chance to trace back..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the work of which expert assassin in my sect? Truly perfect."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer murmured.</p><p></p><p>Then, he came back to his senses, why was he praising it?</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The other party did it too cleanly, he didn't know who it was...</p><p></p><p>In the moment he was pondering, bursts of surging divine power suddenly erupted outside the Healing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing the bloody aura of Shangguan Qinglei's death, they rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The figure wrapped in black smoke looked at the dead Shangguan Qinglei deeply, shook his head, and his figure directly turned into a wisp of black smoke "sizzling" and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After the black smoke figure left.</p><p></p><p>Several figures in white robes quickly rushed into the Healing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The villain of the Corpse God Sect... came to silence him!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go and summon the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the room.</p><p></p><p>His expression was as calm as usual, without any fluctuations after the killing.</p><p></p><p>Even if the one he killed was just a seven-year-old child, some children's malice is no less than that of adults.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the evil person has not grown up yet.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not relax at all, his brows furrowed, and the ruthless color in his eyes kept fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>Because Shangguan Qinglei was just a knife, a knife that could be discarded at any time.</p><p></p><p>The real culprit was the Corpse God Sect expert who instructed Shangguan Qinglei and gave him the Corpse God Wood Carving!</p><p></p><p>The other party's identity was hidden and had not been exposed so far.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that within the Divine Sect, there is the Sect Master Nan Liehuo, who has cultivated to the Primordial Realm, standing at the peak of divine power cultivation in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>But even such a powerful expert was hidden, unable to be discovered.</p><p></p><p>It shows that the Corpse Curse Seal of the other party is of an extremely high level! Because if it was Nan Liehuo or such a high-level expert, no matter if it was the Ten Extremes Corpse Curse Seal or the Nine Luminaries Corpse Curse Seal, as long as the imprinting person appeared in front of them, their divine sense would detect the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal, if the concealment was not good enough, and a trace of aura was leaked, it would immediately attract the attention of experts like Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>"Is the other party hidden among the high-level members of the Divine Sect? Or is it just an ordinary disciple? No... it should be a high-level member, the Seven Elements Corpse Curse Seal, without sufficient cultivation, it would be impossible to conceal it, and it would be immediately discovered..."</p><p></p><p>"So the other party's cultivation must be at least at the Void Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had previously guessed that there was a big fish within the Divine Sect, but even Li Qingshan could not know who it was specifically.</p><p></p><p>The other party's concealment was too good.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that it is indeed true.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect... truly permeates everywhere, even able to penetrate the inside of the Divine Sect!</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Elements Corpse Curse Seal, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"The one I suppressed before was only the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal, so it spread out and I couldn't discover the other party."</p><p></p><p>"But it's different now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual sense sank into the Heaven and Earth Chessboard within the Grandmaster of Chess Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The LV3 Grandmaster of Chess Dao Fruit had an even stronger suppressive power.</p><p></p><p>The white bone hand formed by the Seven Elements Corpse Curse Seal was suppressed in the center of the chessboard, and the chess pieces formed by the pure divine power surrounded and suppressed the white bone hand!</p><p></p><p>The dense corpse aura and death aura emanated from the bone hand, and even the pure divine power chess pieces were slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"It's very difficult to suppress... no wonder it's the Seven Elements Corpse Curse Seal, if this curse seal is implanted in Nuanxi, she will definitely suffer greatly, and may even be completely infected by the corpse aura and death aura, becoming neither human nor ghost."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Che thought of this, his anger was difficult to contain.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his daughter's tragic state in the future, Li Che's killing intent surged, feeling that he had gone easy on Shangguan Qinglei.</p><p></p><p>He should have let him taste the Thousand Spider Silk!</p><p></p><p>Li Che inwardly cursed!</p><p></p><p>However, what he hated and was more vigilant about was the hidden Corpse God Sect expert who instigated and deceived Shangguan Qinglei! Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's spiritual sense focused.</p><p></p><p>He saw the bone hand suppressed in the Heaven and Earth Chessboard suddenly start to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The five white bone fingers clicked and clacked, as if turning into five extremely sharp spears, trying to pierce through the void and tear apart the restraint of the Heaven and Earth Chessboard!</p><p></p><p>"Remote control? Trying to recall this Corpse Curse Seal?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't even dream about it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che became solemn, and then the cold intent surged in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense moved, controlling the pure divine power chess pieces to press down hard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a pitch-black and ink-like secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>A figure shrouded in black smoke suddenly shook.</p><p></p><p>In the black mist, a dim eye flashed with a trace of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Discovered?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it... actually able to suppress my 'Bone Bodhisattva Killing Claw Seal'."</p><p></p><p>The dim eyes flashed with a cold color.</p><p></p><p>"Then... let's fight it out!"</p><p></p><p>The black smoke figure shook out its hands from the black robe, and instantly the ten bronze-shining fingers wove a dense corpse aura and death aura, quickly forming a strange hand seal.</p><p></p><p>Around, countless ghost shadows suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack crack—</p><p></p><p>Countless bone claws slowly emerged from the dark ghost shadows, gradually reaching towards the black smoke vortex in front of the black smoke figure.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed white bones simultaneously emerged.</p><p></p><p>Like crossing the Bridge of Naihe in the underworld, countless white bone hands emerged from the Yellow Springs, filled with the unwillingness and wailing of the dead.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing towards the feet of the newcomer, wanting to pull him into the Yellow Springs.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's compete!"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black mist let out a low, somewhat crazy and twisted laugh.</p><p></p><p>"The mother and child Corpse Curse Seals, my mother seal is still here, how can you suppress the child seal?"</p><p></p><p>"Mother calls."</p><p></p><p>"Child returns—!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the Shangguan Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>A red cloud suddenly rolled in, with a majestic divine sense sweeping by, burning and distorting the air!</p><p></p><p>In the red cloud, Zhu Hongdou's eyes were burning with red flames, and behind her, a distorted divine figure emerged, its entire body burning with scorching flames, a beast body and a human face, very blurred, but not a void form, but the true divine form! Zhu Hongdou's black hair instantly hung upside down, turning scarlet red, her body covered in armor made of scarlet crystals, gripping a long spear, and there were two illusory dragon shadows spreading from under her feet.</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Emperor Divine Flame Deity Form! It was like a brilliant sun hanging in the sky above the Shangguan Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Old bastard Shangguan Jie, come out!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou roared: "Otherwise I'll kill my way in!"</p><p></p><p>In the Shangguan Mansion, after a moment of silence, Shangguan Jie's figure stepped into the air, his hair and beard all disheveled, extremely furious.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate terrifying divine power was spreading in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous! My son is already dead, Zhu Hongdou, what else do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Want to destroy the Shangguan family?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie's terrifying divine form rose, endless fear divine power surging, like black clouds rising, snatching people's souls.</p><p></p><p>His hair and beard were flying, coldly looking at Zhu Hongdou, even a little more powerful in aura than Zhu Hongdou.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine form law that Zhu Hongdou cultivated was the Six Deity Divine Form from the Golden Temple of the Golden Peak, although it was only a low-grade one, it was still higher than his divine form law.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the gap between their divine forms was not as large as one might imagine.</p><p></p><p>"You Shangguan family's offspring..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thunder Marquis Shangguan Qinglei used the wooden sculpture of the Corpse God from the Corpse God Sect in my Divine Ancestor's monthly assessment, intending to harm my Divine Ancestor's divine child. This matter is certainly related to your Shangguan family!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou's eyes burned red, like two blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, she clenched her five fingers, and a spear made of flames howled and rushed out.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to say more, just fight! Bullying my Xixing...</p><p></p><p>What's the point of more words? One word - fight!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shangguan Jie was stunned, but feeling Zhu Hongdou's unhesitating attack, he was enraged, his anger surging from his heart.</p><p></p><p>This crazy woman, once she gets going, she completely loses her mind! Fuck! Shangguan Jie roared and tried to explain, but...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Hongdou was like a woman covering her ears, refusing to listen. The spear tore through the air, and a sea of fire poured down.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jie was extremely frustrated!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly pulled the battlefield up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Shangguan mansion below might become a fiery ruin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The true disciple of the Sect Master, Xixing, was attacked by the Corpse God Sect's methods on the arena of the monthly assessment!</p><p></p><p>This news immediately swept through the Divine Ancestor Sect like a storm.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, it had spread throughout the entire Divine Ancestor Sect, even reaching the various forces in the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The five great families, except for the Shangguan family that was being beaten, the divine elders of the other great families all came out of seclusion, their expressions greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The Shangguan family has gone mad? They actually want to target the divine child of the Divine Ancestor Sect, that is a genius born once in a generation, the hope of the Southern离Fire... Has Shangguan Jie lost his mind?"</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Jie may have been framed. Perhaps a powerful expert of the Corpse God Sect found Shangguan Qinglei, a seven-year-old child is too easy to bewitch."</p><p></p><p>"It can only be said that the Shangguan family is really unfortunate. They just lost the family master Shangguan Zhenghen, and now they may lose another gifted disciple who entered the Divine Ancestor Sect..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts conversing across the distance all sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>They even began to suspect that the Divine Ancestor Sect was deliberately targeting the Shangguan family, wanting to suppress and weaken the strength of the five great families in the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>But Shangguan Zhenghen cultivated the Copper Corpse Curse, this matter cannot be faked. Once the crimes of the Corpse God Sect are exposed, the Divine Ancestor Sect's intervention would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>However, what everyone is more concerned about is the condition of that divine child of the Divine Ancestor Sect.</p><p></p><p>But it should be fine. </p><p></p><p>If something really happened, it would not just be Zhu Hongdou acting up now.</p><p></p><p>The elder Nan Liehuo, a Transcendent Sage of the Divine Ancestor Sect, would probably severely punish the Shangguan family.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the Nine Dragon River, in the Treasure Pavilion on the cliff.</p><p></p><p>The Treasure Pavilion's eaves and corners were shrouded in the mist of the rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor, there was a faint sound of a two-stringed instrument echoing endlessly, filled with desolation, sorrow, and an indescribable pain.</p><p></p><p>Deputy Supervisor Lin Xiuyi strode over, and even before approaching the top floor pavilion, she could hear the Supervisor's mournful music.</p><p></p><p>That sense of inner pain was silently stirred, almost making her eyes well up with tears. Lin Xiuyi quickly steeled her heart, blocking out the sound.</p><p></p><p>But the sound of the two-stringed instrument, so tragically sorrowful, still penetrated through.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the sound of the two-stringed instrument finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Supervisor, the Corpse God Sect's disciples have bewitched a seven-year-old child, and during the Divine Ancestor Sect's monthly assessment, they struck out with the Seven-Element Corpse Curse, intending to destroy the divine child."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiuyi respectfully clasped her hands.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor emerged, his hair and robes fluttering, an air of two-stringed instrument music still lingering around him.</p><p></p><p>"A divine child, which power would not be tempted? Looking around the prefecture city, they are all geniuses, a rare encounter. The Corpse God Sect encountered one in the prefecture city, how could they not be tempted?"</p><p></p><p>"The hidden character within the Divine Ancestor Sect has finally lost their patience..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Supervisor's words, Lin Xiuyi suddenly raised her head, her eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>"There is really a Corpse God Sect expert hidden within the Divine Ancestor Sect, as Li Qingshan said?"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor picked up a small stool and said indifferently, "Do not underestimate the Corpse God Sect. That is a sect that can destroy an entire Dao, turning Zheizhou into a living hell, even the Pacification King Madame Ji could not suppress them after repeated expeditions..."</p><p></p><p>"Any one of the Six Corpse Gods, just one of them... No one in our Golden Light Prefecture City can deal with them. Madame Ji alone held back the Corpse God Sect's Six Corpse Gods, otherwise... the situation in the Great Landscape would be even more severe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiuyi's body trembled, taking a deep breath: "The Corpse Gods of the Corpse God Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, intent... Six Corpse Gods, each one extremely terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of legacy does the mysterious temple where the Corpse God Sect originated harbor, to have created such a formidable sect."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>"However, the fact that Madame Ji alone can suppress the Six Corpse Gods, I actually have doubts about it. There are too many unfathomable things in this world."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor shook his head and uttered a thunderous voice that fell on Lin Xiuyi's ears.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiuyi was completely shaken...</p><p></p><p>"Teacher..."</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor shook his head: "Will divine nature not change, let alone human nature?"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, could this matter in the Divine Ancestor Sect be self-directed by Nan Liehuo?"</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiuyi trembled again.</p><p></p><p>Teacher, what are you saying?! </p><p></p><p>This world... is it so complex?!</p><p></p><p>The Supervisor smiled: "It shouldn't be... Nan Liehuo..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it shouldn't be..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Golden Peak, in the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin became a beam of light, rushing swiftly and landing in front of the Divine Hall.</p><p></p><p>But she was blocked by someone.</p><p></p><p>It was a hunched old servant, seemingly carrying a turtle shell on his back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this old servant, Sang Guanyin's heart couldn't help but sink.</p><p></p><p>Because every time the Master Nan Liehuo went into seclusion, this old servant was summoned as a protector. This old man had watched Nan Liehuo grow up, and was said to be from the same family as Nan Liehuo.</p><p></p><p>He was the person Nan Liehuo trusted the most, even more than any of their disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, Xixing was attacked. A Corpse God Sect expert bewitched an inner disciple, striking out the Seven-Element Corpse Curse... Xixing nearly fell victim!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter must be reported to the Master. There is a Corpse God Sect expert hidden within our Divine Ancestor Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin, wearing a pale yellow long dress, should have been filled with immortal elegance, but her expression was now cold and tinged with anxiousness.</p><p></p><p>The hunched old man, his back seemingly broken, sat at the door of the Divine Hall, slowly raising his cloudy eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xixing was attacked... This matter is indeed not small."</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice was extremely hoarse, and combined with his hunched, swollen back, he seemed like an aged tortoise.</p><p></p><p>"But the Young Master is in seclusion, and he instructed this old servant to be the protector. Young miss, this old servant cannot disturb the Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Elder had watched Sang Guanyin grow from a five-year-old girl to the graceful young woman she is now.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Xixing, it was just like back then with Sang Guanyin and the others...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but shake his head with a sigh, as the children were constantly growing up, which meant he was aging day by day.</p><p></p><p>How much longer could he protect the Young Master? Elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Elder!" Sang Guanyin couldn't help but raise her voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, young miss." Elder closed his eyes, looking very weary.</p><p></p><p>Sang Guanyin was anxious, looking at the tightly closed Divine Hall doors, but unable to do anything.</p><p></p><p>What could she do? Forcibly barge in?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's spiritual awareness floated, controlling thirty-six untainted spiritual chess pieces, pressing towards the constantly trembling, shaking white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to suppress that white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>But suppressing it was extremely difficult, this Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint hidden within the white bone hand seemed to have a life of its own.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also realized that the owner of this Corpse Curse imprint was manipulating it, wanting to retrieve this Corpse Curse imprint, probably knowing that the plan had failed, so they were trying to retrieve it.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart grew cold, the killing intent in his eyes becoming even more intense, his heart also somewhat shaken and fearful! The opponent could actually summon and retrieve this Corpse Curse imprint, if it were to enter Xixing's small body, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Xixing's young body would not be able to withstand it at all, she would be controlled by the opponent!</p><p></p><p>How vicious! How ruthless the methods!</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect... actually uses such malicious means to deal with a three-year-old child!</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect, they all deserve to die! Li Che's eyes were cold and fierce, his spiritual awareness shaking, the untainted spiritual chess pieces in the Nirvana Cinnabar Field flashed with brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a great river was surging, like a silver river cascading down.</p><p></p><p>Condensing into one untainted spiritual chess piece after another, continuously falling onto the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Clack!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Chessboard moved, rumbling sounds echoing, invisible spiritual ripples expanding in concentric circles.</p><p></p><p>Sixty-four pieces!</p><p></p><p>Falling another thirty-two untainted spiritual chess pieces, like sharp great swords swinging, slashing towards the white bone hand. The white bone hand "cracked, cracked, cracked" as it violently twisted, facing the descending chess pieces like blades of light, constantly struggling, dense black qi dissipating from it.</p><p></p><p>The untainted spiritual chess pieces were like shackles, entwining the white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's expression slightly changed! He saw the white bone hand, the aura of death and corpses suddenly becoming much more intense, as if countless white bone claws were trying to drag away the suppressed bone hand!</p><p></p><p>"Has it made its move?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was cold.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Corpse Curse imprint, that hidden Corpse God Sect expert within the Divine Ancestor Sect, was competing with him for this Seven-Element Corpse Curse imprint.</p><p></p><p>"I've drawn this Corpse Curse imprint into the Celestial Chessboard, yet they can still sense it... It should not be at the spiritual awareness level."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like a connection between the Corpse Curse imprints, a mother-child relationship?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes, then opened them again, extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>Once this imprint is obtained, Xixing might not recognize her parents, only recognizing this mother imprint! How dare they! </p><p></p><p>Bastards, they're trying to fight him for the custody of his daughter?! What kind of thing is this!

        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hurried footsteps came to an abrupt halt outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Rain mixed with light snow drifted down from the sky above. Li Che put away the page of the Tongluo Technique into the Qiankun Space, then turned to look towards the direction of the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>A light knocking sound echoed, and Li Che got up to open the door.</p><p></p><p>He saw a towering figure wearing a wide-brimmed hat outside the door, with a majestic aura that felt scorching hot, as if burning with inner fire. </p><p></p><p>Tousled black hair, knotted muscles, and sinews like an enraged giant python.</p><p></p><p>Standing there, it was as if he was silently raging, howling.</p><p></p><p>Yet the imposing figure knocked politely, which made Li Che's attitude a bit more amiable.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, I come from the Mansion of the City Lord, my name is Cao Qingyuan." The burly man's gaze flashed as he quickly glanced around the courtyard, not finding any other presence, causing his thick brows to furrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Cao Qingyuan..." Li Che was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He then cupped his hands in salute: "This humble one is Li Che, greetings to the Young City Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, there's no need to be so courteous. Since you have become a renowned wood carving master, you are an honored guest of our Mansion. My father has specially sent me to invite you to lend your skills."</p><p></p><p>The mighty Cao Qingyuan smiled and returned the greeting, his manner quite humble. </p><p></p><p>However, Cao Qingyuan's aura of fury exerted great pressure on Li Che, making him feel like facing an enraged Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The Young City Lord of Feiluo, Cao Qingyuan! A Spiritual Foundation Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>It was no secret that Cao Guang, the City Lord of Feiluo, had a son who had reached the Spiritual Foundation realm. In the past, he was known as one of the Four Young Masters of Feiluo, but now that Cao Qingyuan had cultivated to the Spiritual Foundation, that title no longer befitted him.</p><p></p><p>"Young City Lord, I apologize, but I am currently at a critical juncture in my Bone Tempering, about to break through the Blood Transformation Realm, so I may not be able to take on your task."</p><p></p><p>Li Che politely declined Cao Qingyuan's request.</p><p></p><p>But Cao Qingyuan didn't mind, smiling and saying, "No problem, Master Li can focus on your Blood Transformation. As long as you can complete this wood carving within a month."</p><p></p><p>"The design for the wood carving is here, and I've already paid a down payment of a hundred gold leaves. The remaining four hundred will be delivered once you've finished the work."</p><p></p><p>A Spiritual Foundation Cultivator visiting in person, with a relatively amiable attitude and not demanding an unreasonable deadline. </p><p></p><p>Li Che understood that this was a subtle way to block his refusal.</p><p></p><p>If he rejected again, it would seem ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Che no longer refused, taking the design and the hundred gold leaves.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cao Qingyuan's face broke into a smile. He pressed down his hat brim, took one last lingering look at the independent workshop, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the wood carving design in his hand, Li Che narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen Maiden Lotus Worshipping the Wrathful Mahayana Image..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan returned to the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Removing his hat, he slowly stepped into the room.</p><p></p><p>Though it was daytime, the entire room was shrouded in darkness. Rows of white candles were lit, forming a staircase-like arrangement, and beside each candle was a small wooden sculpture carved from red wood.</p><p></p><p>Illuminated by the flickering flames, each wooden sculpture seemed to be bleeding.</p><p></p><p>The eerie candlelight flickered, shifting between yellow and green.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's heart felt as if it was being gripped, and even as a Spiritual Foundation Cultivator, he dared not breathe freely.</p><p></p><p>"Has that Li Che accepted the commission?"</p><p></p><p>A faint, hoarse voice came from the depths of the mansion. Cao Qingyuan respectfully replied, "Yes, father, he has accepted."</p><p></p><p>"Good... The Xu family had already sold him to our Mansion. Since he has accepted the commission, it saves the trouble of having you capture him."</p><p></p><p>"As long as he completes the carving, that will be enough..."</p><p></p><p>"Father, what if he accepts the commission but doesn't carve it?"</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent for a moment, before the voice slowly responded, "He dares not..."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, for the Thousand Buddha Feast, we still lack three Spiritual Children. The An family has one, the Yang family lost theirs, but... the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery has two more..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family has two?"</p><p></p><p>"One is that Li Che's daughter, and the other is a powerful Spiritual Child... Hehe, a buy one get one free..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family has agreed?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual child in the city has already been noticed by the Divine Sect... It's better to use the Xu family and An family as bargaining chips, since we can't keep them."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family, An family, and Yang family all want to benefit... so they withdrew from Flying Thunder City... Therefore, they had no choice but to agree..."</p><p></p><p>"A group of foolish ones, coexisting with the temple gods... What an honor that is?" The hoarse voice echoed through the room, laced with a hint of disdain and scorn.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Who was ordered to kill Zhao Xuanhai?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiangyang or Zhou Ruoguan?"</p><p></p><p>After a long pause, Cao Qingyuan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>The silence in the room was broken.</p><p></p><p>The hoarse voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>"The Yang family."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan gave Li Che three days to break through his meridians.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it was too much time.</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che first used the [Chess Sage] Dao fruit to set up a spiritual chess board around him, sensing the situation and confirming that there were no issues, then he began to break through his meridians.</p><p></p><p>The "Qian Yuan Divine Sect Small Heaven Meridian Breakthrough Method" that Li Qingshan provided was not actually that complicated, no wonder he was generous with the time. It was mostly just theoretical content.</p><p></p><p>The specific operation still depended on the individual's own cultivation. Li Che had the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao fruit, his foundation was too solid. Although breaking through the meridians was difficult, for Li Che... it felt smooth and effortless.</p><p></p><p>Falling snow swirled above Li Che's head, only to be twisted and flung away by an invisible force.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat cross-legged in the courtyard, the invisible airflow circling around him in a spiral, constantly rotating.</p><p></p><p>The qi and internal force in his blood merged, circulating through the five zang organs, six fu organs, the extraordinary meridians, forming the fixed Small Heaven circulation of the Qian Yuan Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>The fourth-layer internal force, combined with the qi generated from the meridian breakthrough, became the "internal qi."</p><p></p><p>The internal qi enveloped the heart, surging out with the heart's rhythmic contraction and expansion, flowing through the delicate and complex Small Heaven meridian network under the skin.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, a bright glow seemed to flash in and out.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, his entire body resonating with a crisp sound, his blood and qi circulation becoming faster and more powerful, forming an even more terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>Inhaleâ€”</p><p></p><p>Exhale! With each breath, the heavenly winds and snow seemed to swirl, as if the qi was merging with the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The meridians, they're complete!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the meridians, Li Che used the remaining time to also cultivate the [Amitabha Golden Robe], reaching the minor success level.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuanhai's divine chess piece had now been refined by Li Che to a great extent. Within the Nirvana Inner Realm, the [Wrathful Amitabha] divine nature flowed like a gentle stream, nourishing his nature.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the sky, it was a rare clear day without snow.</p><p></p><p>The air was still bitterly cold, but there was a hint of warm sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Li Che put on an elastic suit, wore a straw hat, and sat under the eaves, leisurely carving a cute ox mask with a knife.</p><p></p><p>After the mask covered his face, he checked the poisoned sleeve crossbow, Avalokitesvara's Poison Lotus, Bodhi's Bloody Tears, and other hidden weapons, and counted the six thousand wooden Raven Crossbow bolts in the Qian Kun Military Armory, only then did he feel at ease and leave the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Li Che would never have dared to leave the city, so far away from Xixie. He was too worried about her safety.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the "Flying Thunder Chess Sage," as long as the divine chess piece was on Xixie, he could rest assured. At least if Xixie was in danger, he would be able to sense it and rush to her aid quickly.</p><p></p><p>With his daughter's safety guaranteed, the old father could finally go out and cause some trouble.</p><p></p><p>The "Sleeping Dragon Elephant's" concealment ability had become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>It almost completely erased his presence.</p><p></p><p>He easily passed through the inner city and the weakly guarded outer city.</p><p></p><p>Just as he left the outer city...</p><p></p><p>A hunched and short figure silently appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the newcomer, who was also dressed in black and wearing a cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan?" Li Che's muffled voice came from behind the ox mask.</p><p></p><p>"It's me." The response came from behind the cat mask.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>Why is the old man also wearing a mask now?</p><p></p><p>Everyone is wearing masks...</p><p></p><p>Is this a Mask Alliance?

        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The cold wind howled, the winter rain poured down! The icy rain was like an extremely sharp steel blade, pouring down from thousands of feet above, slicing through the air, landing on the body with bone-chilling coldness in an instant, as if it would tear the flesh and blood apart!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes narrowed, her long slender legs suddenly tensed, stepping onto the ground, stopping her steps that were about to enter the vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>Then, she quickly retreated!</p><p></p><p>After Li Che's tireless purification of her body with his pure spiritual nature, Zhang Ya also seemed to have a keen sense of danger in the depths of her mind! The vague sense of danger emanating from the vegetable market made her hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>There is danger! Zhang Ya unhesitatingly retreated. An old woman selling goods next to her, the moment Zhang Ya appeared with a vegetable basket, her gaze had already unconsciously turned away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhang Ya suddenly retreat, she was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>But years of assassination experience made her realize that this woman had already discovered her ambush.</p><p></p><p>She had originally planned to wait for Zhang Ya to come and inquire about the vegetable prices, then directly draw the knife and slash her neck, completing the assassination smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she was seen through by this woman in advance.</p><p></p><p>No wonder she is the mother of the genius child of the Jin Guang Mansion, she is indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence, this Zhang Ya is only a Tempering Bone realm warrior, basically just a flower vase.</p><p></p><p>But this sense of danger is worthy of praise.</p><p></p><p>The old woman no longer hid, her palm swept under the table where the vegetables were placed, and a dark blade of light fell into her hand.</p><p></p><p>She stomped her foot heavily on the ground, and the ground trembled and suddenly collapsed!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! It was like a thunderclap on the flat ground! The old woman's clothes fluttered, her qi and blood surged, and her figure, relying on the recoil force that made the ground collapse, shot out like an arrow released from the bowstring.</p><p></p><p>The knife was unsheathed! A true qi burst out from the sharp black knife, dazzling in brilliance! Her figure was like a ghost, continuously landing on the ground, kicking up rolling rocks! Like a raging wind sweeping away the leaves, she rushed towards Zhang Ya at high speed!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! The surging airflow was suddenly torn apart! A powerful and terrifying gale came straight at her! Zhang Ya's face turned deathly pale, but her eyes were sharper and more determined than ever before!</p><p></p><p>An assassin... is trying to kill her!</p><p></p><p>Although Zhang Ya did not understand why there was an assassin trying to kill an ordinary woman like her, she could more or less guess the reason.</p><p></p><p>It should be related to Xixie!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to affect Xixie's upcoming Temple God Resonance Assembly?!</p><p></p><p>Damn, is the husband also in danger of assassination?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Ya even thought of the safety of her husband.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—! The assassin's old woman's figure surged with qi and blood, the aura of a master suddenly pressing down!</p><p></p><p>A master, assassinating a Tempering Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>This is almost a foregone conclusion, too easy. Killing a chicken with a bull knife! As the first assassination task assigned to the Jin Guang Mansion by the Hunting God Pavilion, it can be said that they are quite attentive!</p><p></p><p>The assassin sent to kill Li Che is two realms higher than him in spiritual vein, a Master realm plus a Spiritual Foundation realm, basically a sure thing.</p><p></p><p>Assassinating this Tempering Bone realm Zhang Ya is even more so, sending a Master realm assassin to ensure the completion of this assassination task without a hitch!</p><p></p><p>It can be said that they have fully boosted the reputation of this couple.</p><p></p><p>The old woman took a step, her speed was too fast, moving with the wind, the howling airflow, the fluttering clothes, from bursting out to approaching Zhang Ya's side, it was only a few breaths! The black as ink, non-reflective black blade was suddenly drawn out, sweeping towards Zhang Ya's long, white neck.</p><p></p><p>To pluck off this beautiful head from that neck!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow suddenly burst out from Zhang Ya's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's sweeping black blade suddenly collided with that black shadow, emitting the sound of clashing metal!</p><p></p><p>The huge recoil force made the old woman's black blade feel like it was being blown away.</p><p></p><p>The qi surged, the true qi surged! The old woman's long knife turned, and she swept it out again, with a cold face killing towards Zhang Ya! In the blink of an eye, she also glimpsed what the black shadow that burst out from Zhang Ya's body was.</p><p></p><p>It was actually...</p><p></p><p>A snake!</p><p></p><p>A long mechanical snake made of material stronger than refined steel!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, it was the mechanical snake's lightning-fast charge that knocked down the old woman's fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>"A mechanical snake?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman's mind buzzed.</p><p></p><p>The black blade she swung out again was once again blocked by the mechanical snake! Clang clang clang clang clang—</p><p></p><p>After several consecutive strikes, this mechanical snake, agile as if it was not a mechanism at all, blocked all her blade techniques!</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>The old assassin's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>The Tong family's mechanical beast! Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's hair stood on end, sensing an unprecedented terrifying killing intent! It was as if while climbing a mountain, the entire mountain suddenly broke and began to collapse towards her eyes, plunging her vision into a pitch-black and oppressive darkness.</p><p></p><p>That was a towering figure like a huge wall, oppressive and unscalable!</p><p></p><p>The old woman's toes stepped on the ground, stomping the ground into sunken and exploded small pits, wanting to bounce and escape.</p><p></p><p>A black bead appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly crushed the black bead, and instantly black smoke exploded, completely enveloping her body. The black smoke could block spiritual perception and had a time-space technique similar to the Corpse God Sect's Corpse Burial Art! This was the escape skill possessed by the assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the safety of the assassins.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It was only once.</p><p></p><p>This old woman, wrapped in black smoke, wanted to escape and flee.</p><p></p><p>But she found that a big hand had precisely torn open the smoke that could block spiritual perception, and grabbed half of her body that had already drilled into the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>A palm as big as a fan grabbed her head.</p><p></p><p>Then, an irresistible force literally pulled her out of the transmission black mirror!</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>The old woman was pulled out of the black mist, and then she only saw a cute ox-masked face...</p><p></p><p>And then she lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Poof, the ox mask was splattered with the blood that spurted out when the old woman's head was crushed.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—!!! A bolt of lightning flashed in an instant, a thunderclap on the flat ground.</p><p></p><p>Falling to the ground with a thud.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, in a blue robe, his sleeves fluttering, had already appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was on the mountain top, meditating and strengthening the Thunder Slaying Demon Deity.</p><p></p><p>The moment he sensed that Zhang Ya was being assassinated in the small town halfway up the mountain, he immediately set out.</p><p></p><p>However, someone was faster than him.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming killing intent, as if it could never be dispelled, oppressive and surging, a violent wind suddenly arose, which was the terrible wind wave formed by the surging aura of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes narrowed, his heart slightly shaken!</p><p></p><p>So strong!</p><p></p><p>What a physique? What an extraordinary flesh and blood?!</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan even felt the Goat Horn Thunderclap Hammer hidden in his sleeve trembling slightly, reacting to the surging blood.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan knew that the Ox Demon was Li Che, but at this moment he did not reveal the Ox Demon's identity.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's face was deathly pale, the mechanical snake coiled around her slender waist, and she had only experienced a slight scare in this assassination attempt.</p><p></p><p>When the towering figure of the Ox Demon suddenly appeared, Zhang Ya's heart was put at ease.</p><p></p><p>She knew she was safe now!</p><p></p><p>Li Che casually threw the assassin's body down, and then wiped away the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>He came to Zhang Ya's side, scanned his gaze, and after seeing that his wife was unharmed, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical snake he specially made for his wife had indeed played a role when necessary.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even without the mechanical snake, Zhang Ya still had other protective measures left by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>The safety of his family is what Li Che values the most.</p><p></p><p>Although his wife Zhang Ya does not compete with others, he is afraid that others will come to cause trouble, just like today's assassination.</p><p></p><p>They, the husband and wife, have both been targeted for assassination.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's combat power is unparalleled, so he can easily deal with it, but Zhang Ya is only at the Tempering Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion actually sent an assassin of Master realm cultivation!</p><p></p><p>How ruthless! Hunting God Pavilion! The killing intent on Li Che's body was almost like a thick and undissolvable ink.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine," Zhang Ya shook her head lightly, her eyes as gentle as water.</p><p></p><p>That her husband could appear by her side at the first moment she was in danger, this unprecedented sense of security made her unable to help but indulge in it, and a sweet blush even appeared on her face, surpassing the sweet words between husband and wife.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan walked over, his eyes narrowing: "Hunting God Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's expression also became a little colder: "The Hunting God Pavilion has just entered the Jin Guang Mansion... I didn't expect the first assassination they would reveal would be against you two."</p><p></p><p>"No matter." The Ox Demon mask, Li Che spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Basically, I can guess who hired them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was very calm.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyes flickered, and he also understood.</p><p></p><p>It should only be that little Prince Xie Hai.</p><p></p><p>At this juncture, if Li Che and Zhang Ya were to die, then the four-year-old Xixie, no matter how mature and strong she is, her heart will still suffer an unprecedented impact.</p><p></p><p>In the Temple God Resonance Assembly, there is a possibility that she will not be able to perform normally.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this assassination that seems to be targeting Li Che and Zhang Ya, the real target is actually Li Che!</p><p></p><p>Li Che rotated his neck, a series of cracking sounds exploding along his spine.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qingshan, please."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded slightly with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon walked to Zhang Ya's side, reached out and patted her head.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Under Zhang Ya's concerned gaze,</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon slightly nodded, then clenched his fingers and disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Ox Demon's extraordinary teleportation technique with his own eyes, it was simply shocking to the point of making his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the assassin's corpse on the ground, his eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion was actually able to so easily infiltrate the Jin Guang Sect's sub-sect.</p><p></p><p>It seems...</p><p></p><p>It's time to thoroughly investigate and rectify the sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan did not let Zhang Ya go home alone, but took her to find Grandma Semu to ensure her safety.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Ox Demon was going to do and why he didn't take him along.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan didn't care about it this time.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion is going to be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>After all, their first assassination task chose the toughest target...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The gloomy clouds obscured the sky, the thunder snakes rolled away, crushing the thick clouds.</p><p></p><p>The rain became heavier and heavier, washing and flushing the entire Jin Guang Mansion City.</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the Nine Dragon River, there is a series of pavilions and towers.</p><p></p><p>A figure holding a paper umbrella, wearing a felt hat, was hurrying along the flooded streets of the city, washed by the downpour.</p><p></p><p>Entering the series of pavilions and towers, winding through the alleys between the towering buildings, he finally came to an inconspicuous small building among the pavilions.</p><p></p><p>The Observation Pavilion, as one of the five major sects in the Jin Guang Mansion City, has a considerable reputation.</p><p></p><p>Built along the riverside, located in the prosperous and valuable area of the city, with an extremely large land area, it is said to be involved in various industries and extremely wealthy.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure holding the umbrella, when he was about ten meters away from the small building, was blocked by someone.</p><p></p><p>A figure wearing a straw raincoat and hat suddenly stood in front of the door.</p><p></p><p>"Stop."</p><p></p><p>"The mission failed, reporting."</p><p></p><p>The figure let out a sigh, speaking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The first task assigned to the Hunting God Pavilion has all failed, Li Che and his wife, one was not killed, and the two assassins have all lost contact.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the straw hat and raincoat at the door frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He stepped aside to open the door, letting the person step into the small building.</p><p></p><p>The figure put away the umbrella and entered, shaking off the rainwater, placing the paper umbrella aside, and then walked towards the warm and spring-like interior of the small building.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he came to a tightly closed door and knocked on the door.</p><p></p><p>Entering the room, it was a completely different world.</p><p></p><p>The small door led to an extremely spacious secret realm, with various mechanisms arranged.</p><p></p><p>Many people wearing masks were sorting and categorizing the information brought back by the many spies of the Hunting God Pavilion branch in the Jin Guang Mansion City.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion not only accepts assassination missions, but is also one of the top intelligence forces in the world, and information can be purchased here.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer cupped his fist, coming to a desk.</p><p></p><p>A figure wearing a golden mask was reviewing the documents, summarizing the information.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, the mission has failed, our two assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion have all lost contact, most likely dead."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He was responsible for contacting the assassins, and the moment the two assassins died, he would receive the news.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che... his spiritual vein cultivation, Tempering the Spirit to reach the initial Spiritual Foundation realm... the intelligence on his cultivation was not wrong, so why did our assassins... die?"</p><p></p><p>"Experienced assassins, first use Spiritual Essence Powder to limit Li Che's Spiritual Foundation cultivation, and then use the overwhelming Master realm cultivation to assassinate him..."</p><p></p><p>"I can't think of a reason for the assassination to fail, unless... Li Che has hidden his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The figure wearing the golden mask tapped his fingers lightly.</p><p></p><p>"A poor start."</p><p></p><p>The golden mask shook his head: "Misinformation killed people... the importance of intelligence is self-evident."</p><p></p><p>"Accelerate the distribution of the Hunting God Pavilion's intelligence network in the Jin Guang Mansion City."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Also, contact the little Prince, just say... the price to kill Li Che and his wife has to be tripled."</p><p></p><p>"If the price is not increased, the Hunting God Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shadow figure retreated.</p><p></p><p>Gradually disappearing into the bustling crowd.</p><p></p><p>The golden mask man tapped his fingers lightly, and two black jade amulets cracked open, which were the life amulets of two Hunting God Pavilion Nine Luminaries assassins.</p><p></p><p>The assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion were carefully cultivated, with resources tilted towards them.</p><p></p><p>The death of each assassin was a loss for the Hunting God Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Could they not even trigger the minor teleportation technique in time?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems they discovered some great secret."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che walked in the pouring rain.</p><p></p><p>He wore a rain hat, his aura completely concealed, as if he had disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Walking in the darkness, bathing in the rain.</p><p></p><p>The rain curtain automatically separated from around him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart was pounding incessantly, the intense killing intent like thick ink spreading in the rain.</p><p></p><p>"Hunting God Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Although they were just doing a job for money, but... Li Che was still very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Family was Li Che's taboo.</p><p></p><p>If they came after him, Li Che would not be so angry and furious, but the Hunting God Pavilion's target was Zhang Ya...</p><p></p><p>That ignited the raging fire in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>With a step, Li Che's figure leapt onto the top of an ornate octagonal pavilion with a double-eaved roof.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the roof, Li Che activated the Sleeping Dragon Elephant of the Dragon Elephant Vajra to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The level 4 dao fruit would enhance all his abilities.</p><p></p><p>The concealment ability of the Sleeping Dragon Elephant also rose significantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was now almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>"Hunting God Pavilion, Prince Shi Haihui..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The familiar sense of crisis, like a storm, enveloped his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Just like the powerful crisis he had felt in Flying Thunder City, a deep-rooted unease and panic.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his little family being faced with the terrifying iceberg, then being smashed into pieces, torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Xixia tragically dying, Zhang Ya tragically dying... he himself would also die tragically...</p><p></p><p>The beautiful and happy family, disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head back, the rainwater sliding down the edge of the ox mask, then merging into the rain, splashing on the black eaves, shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he slapped it firmly on his brow.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Chess Saint dao fruit in his chest cavity pounded violently and intensely.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly earth chessboard, with Li Che's position as the center, intersected and delineated.</p><p></p><p>The Great Chess Saint... reemerging.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual awareness swept through like a storm.</p><p></p><p>Everything, whether people or events, in the city became clear and distinct in his perception.</p><p></p><p>In the teahouse below, the beautiful tea girl's tea-pouring movements froze.</p><p></p><p>The storyteller, whose words flowed like a river, had the spittle he sprayed congealed in the air.</p><p></p><p>The small vendor who had set up a shelter on the street, using a wooden basin to collect the leaking rainwater, had the water curtain mixed with clearly visible water droplets suspended in midair.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to have slowed down in Li Che's Chess Saint perception.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The raindrops exploded, the white hazy mist still lingering in the original place, while the towering Ox Demon had already pounced out like a hawk.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion were different from the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Che mastered the refining and activation of the Seven Element Corpse Curse, which allowed him to sense the experts of the Corpse God Sect through the aura of death and corpses.</p><p></p><p>However, the assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion were skilled in disguise and did not have the aura of death and corpses to expose them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for Li Che to pick out the assassins of the Hunting God Pavilion from the vast sea of people would be very difficult, extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Since Li Che had determined that it was Prince Shi Haihui who had hired the Hunting God Pavilion to kill him and his wife, the failure of the mission would definitely have the Hunting God Pavilion send someone to notify Prince Shi's forces.</p><p></p><p>And this... would give Li Che an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also very clear that even for him, killing Prince Shi would not be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>There was the Grand Martial Patriarch Xue Dufu guarding, and a mysterious Spiritual Immortal hidden in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>There were also six Black Armor Blood Guards, who could rival a Grand Martial Patriarch when combined...</p><p></p><p>With such a lineup.</p><p></p><p>Plus Prince Shi residing in the City Lord's Mansion, with the Divine Guard Army protecting him.</p><p></p><p>It would be very difficult for Li Che to kill Prince Shi, and although he was furious, the more furious he was, the calmer he became.</p><p></p><p>Even if he used Mian Face and the Immortal Craftsman Barrett, it would still be difficult to snipe Prince Shi.</p><p></p><p>Because of the spiritual perception and interception of the Spiritual Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Immortal... in terms of spiritual cultivation, possessed a powerful metamorphic spiritual awareness, even more troublesome and difficult to deal with than a Grand Martial Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>To kill Prince Shi...</p><p></p><p>He needed to make an extremely meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>Hunting...</p><p></p><p>Was a contest of patience.</p><p></p><p>The grudge of today, Li Che would remember.</p><p></p><p>The account could be settled slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Haihui..."</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to kill Xixia's father and mother, affecting Xixia's mentality..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes were icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Since it was so, he would repay them in kind.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che could not kill Prince Shi Haihui's parents.</p><p></p><p>But he had another way to shake Prince Shi's state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the Ox Mask, Li Che's body hugged the wall as he walked.</p><p></p><p>He monitored the situation outside the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he saw the familiar figure, the Grand Martial Patriarch Xue Dufu, wearing a rain hat and walking out of the City Lord's Mansion, getting on an ordinary carriage.</p><p></p><p>The carriage sped away, the wheels turning, crushing the flowing water on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's toes touched down, shattering the torrential rain, chasing after it in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu was in contact with members of the Hunting God Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Hunting God Pavilion member wearing an iron mask told the situation.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu's brows immediately furrowed: "Triple the price?!"</p><p></p><p>It was too high! Li Che's assassination price was two Seven Element Spiritual Crystals!</p><p></p><p>Triple the price... that would be six Seven Element Spiritual Crystals!</p><p></p><p>This price was too exorbitant!</p><p></p><p>The iron-masked black-robed man shook his head: "The Pavilion Master's quoted price is as such, we of the Hunting God Pavilion have already lost two Nine Luminaries assassins... If we are to assassinate Li Che again, we must mobilize an Eight Extremes assassin..."</p><p></p><p>"An Eight Extremes assassin is already expensive."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't accept, the mission is cancelled, and there will be no refund."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Six Seven Element Spiritual Crystals to kill one Li Che...</p><p></p><p>It's a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Even though the spiritual crystals were not his own, Xue Dufu still felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The airflow surged!</p><p></p><p>Li Che transformed into the towering Ox Demon, striding forward, his figure rising and falling, the surrounding scenery rapidly retreating behind him.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu was in front, and Li Che was in no hurry to strike.</p><p></p><p>He planned to slowly sever Prince Shi's left and right arms.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu, the six Black Armor Blood Guards, and the mysterious Spiritual Immortal...</p><p></p><p>They would all come one by one, and none of them could escape.</p><p></p><p>When the protective forces he was proud of were one by one removed, it would be like having his clothes forcibly stripped off.</p><p></p><p>The sense of security would disintegrate, shatter, and the fear would follow like a shadow, like a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it would also affect Prince Shi Haihui's state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Causing him to be unable to perform perfectly at the Temple God Resonance Assembly.</p><p></p><p>This was called repaying them in kind.</p><p></p><p>This was the consequence of angering a father.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped by the roadside, and the two inside were in conversation.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon quietly hung behind, following.</p><p></p><p>The Sleeping Dragon Elephant was activated, making him seem to have vanished from the world, completely isolated from it.</p><p></p><p>Although Xue Dufu was a Grand Martial Patriarch with a strong martial will, in terms of perception, he was ultimately weaker than the Spiritual Immortal.</p><p></p><p>And with the Ox Demon always maintaining a distance of ten zhang, not too close or too far, the Grand Martial Patriarch's physical senses could not perceive it.</p><p></p><p>And Li Che, with the heavenly earth chessboard expanded, completely observed the scene and conversation inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Six Seven Element Spiritual Crystals..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually this expensive?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the price, the expression on Li Che's ox mask face became rather strange.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his lips even curled up into a smile.</p><p></p><p>This Hunting God Pavilion, they really had an eye for it.</p><p></p><p>The carriage remained stationary for a long time, and under the pounding of the torrential rain, the entire carriage was shrouded in a hazy mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Che waited quietly in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu got out of the carriage, wearing a rain hat, letting the rain beat down on him.</p><p></p><p>The conversation had ended.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu chose to continue the mission, accepting the price of six Seven Element Spiritual Crystals!</p><p></p><p>However, he needed to go back and report to Prince Shi.</p><p></p><p>Whinny~ The spirited horse neighed, pulling the carriage gradually away.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced around, the heavenly earth chessboard expanded, locking onto the carriage's aura.</p><p></p><p>While keeping an eye on Xue Dufu.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's other spiritual awareness, through the heavenly earth chessboard, locked onto the carriage's movements within the Golden Light Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>The carriage was very cautious, constantly changing positions on the wide streets and alleys of the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Only after confirming that there was no one following, did it slowly drive into the Observing Tide Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Observing Tide Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The star-picking pupils on Li Che's brow emitted a slight warmth.</p><p></p><p>Using the divine ability of star-picking to deploy the heavenly earth chessboard's coverage and detection was extremely effective, almost like opening a third eye.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a North Star satellite hanging in the sky, becoming Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is the headquarters of the Hunting God Pavilion located within the Observing Tide Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather... the Hunting God Pavilion had long been preparing to establish a presence in the Golden Light Prefecture City, and the Observing Tide Pavilion was the force the Hunting God Pavilion had planted in the prefecture city, and now they have directly taken over."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as one of the five major sects of the Golden Light Prefecture, how could the Observing Tide Pavilion easily allow the Hunting God Pavilion to take up residence? If the Hunting God Pavilion had forcibly taken over, the various forces in the Golden Light Prefecture should have noticed it long ago.</p><p></p><p>Assassin organizations have always been focused on concealment.</p><p></p><p>If they become too conspicuous and ostentatious, they may become the target of many.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Hunting God Pavilion and the Corpse God Sect are not much different.</p><p></p><p>In Li Che's eyes...</p><p></p><p>They are just old rats in the sewers.</p><p></p><p>"Observing Tide Pavilion... now that I know the location, it will be easy."</p><p></p><p>"This is a dead object, it can't run away."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes opened and closed, as if there was a divine light flickering in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>In the Fallen Flowers Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside the independent workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Li Che clone, the "Painting Immortal", who was currently carving a wooden sculpture, suddenly had his eyes narrow.</p><p></p><p>Then, he raised his hand and shook his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>A pure heart painting paper fluttered out, and the Painting Immortal Li Che placed his finger on the scroll, and moments later, a huge mechanical spirit crane, over two meters tall, spread its wings and emerged from the scroll.</p><p></p><p>This mechanical spirit crane had an enormous belly, containing a Great Avalanche Guanyin Lotus Bomb with the equivalent of 150 spiritual chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>This was the maximum capacity the mechanical spirit crane could carry.</p><p></p><p>The Painting Immortal Li Che clone, with a hand seal, instantly imprinted three mechanical seals on the wooden spirit crane.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the wooden spirit crane suddenly lit up with light.</p><p></p><p>After accepting Li Che's will and purpose, it began to run around the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Then it spread its wings and soared into the clouds above!</p><p></p><p>Carrying the 150-piece Guanyin Lotus Bomb, it flew towards the direction of the Observing Tide Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a vast black cloud was piling up behind the mechanical spirit crane.</p><p></p><p>Like a usually mild-mannered father's towering wrath.</p><p></p><p>Brewing a crazy and furious heavenly storm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze retracted.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>He blinked his eyes, the swollen black robe slightly fluttering, shattering the raindrops.</p><p></p><p>His vision rotated, finally all focused on the two-armed Xue Dufu, whose sleeves were fluttering in the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu wore a rain hat, rushing through the sudden winter rain, the rain beating on the hat but not soaking his body.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Martial Patriarch...</p><p></p><p>The last time they fought, Li Che had blown off one of Xue Dufu's arms.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Although it had been less than six days!</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was different!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! With a flick of his finger, the Chess Saint dao fruit in his chest pounded violently.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the pouring rain, the heavenly earth chessboard suddenly expanded to envelop the entire area, as if it had been separated from the heavens and earth. Boom! As a Grand Martial Patriarch, Xue Dufu's perception was extremely acute.</p><p></p><p>He stomped his foot heavily, and the water flow on the long stone street suddenly exploded, forming a circle of ripples that quickly spread out.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly became silent.</p><p></p><p>"So quiet."</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu narrowed his eyes, only able to hear the sound of the rain.</p><p></p><p>This was not right!</p><p></p><p>The bustling sounds of peddlers, merchants, customers, and young servants in the brothels...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of mundane sounds, as if they had been abruptly severed and deprived!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu looked up, the rain beating on his face.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fierce, staring at the sky.</p><p></p><p>But he saw the rainwater falling from thousands of feet above, as if it was being distorted by an invisible force in midair.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, the accumulated water seemed to be boiling like water droplets on a hot pan, constantly bouncing and churning.</p><p></p><p>The temperature in the heavens and earth had suddenly become scorching hot! "A domain?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dufu murmured.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The intuition of a Grand Martial Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Made every single hair on his body stand on end, and his whole body shivered with a chill! "Someone wants to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to kill me?!"</p>

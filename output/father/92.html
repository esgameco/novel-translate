        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Heroes?</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo was slightly stunned: "In this world... heroes never live long."</p><p></p><p>The soft cushions in the carriage may have been bumpy, but it did not provide any comfort. Li Qingshan held Mu Popo's hand, even though her skin was no longer as smooth and delicate as a young girl's.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Qingshan could not bear to let go.</p><p></p><p>Gently playing with her long fingers.</p><p></p><p>"It's true that heroes never live long."</p><p></p><p>"But that guy is different... if we don't consider his ruthless killing methods, he can be considered a hero."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo immediately understood who Li Qingshan was referring to.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but recall the time when the Xu Family Spiritual Cultivation Monastery was attacked. When she was in endless despair and planned to perish together with theYang family members...</p><p></p><p>A burly figure stepped forward, shattering theYang family's plan to seize the spiritual children, and saving those innocent children.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo, a person with ruthless methods and a fierce appearance, an... hero.</p><p></p><p>At least, in Mu Popo's eyes, the Niu Mo who saved the children was a hero!</p><p></p><p>"Niu Mo? Does he... dare to get involved in this 'Thousand Buddha Feast'?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo frowned and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang had been preparing for the Thousand Buddha Feast for a long time, several years in fact, whether it was developing the Spiritual Infant Sect, plundering and capturing spiritual children, or spending a lot of money to invite wood carvers from various clans to create spiritual infant wood carvings...</p><p></p><p>Years of planning, all for the sake of this Thousand Buddha Feast.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo was not stupid, she was well aware that Cao Guang was definitely doing this for the sake of advancing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang was likely hoping to borrow the power to break through the divine realm from the temple gods during this Thousand Buddha Feast.</p><p></p><p>Sacrificial rituals were quite normal in this world.</p><p></p><p>When Mu Popo was young, she had traveled all over the country and seen too many sacrificial rituals.</p><p></p><p>The fishing villages by the river would use young girls or female children, along with three sacrificial animals and five livestock, to worship the river god.</p><p></p><p>The mountain villages would also worship the mountain lord and mountain gods.</p><p></p><p>The desert castles and oases also worshipped the desert gods.</p><p></p><p>And there were even more who worshipped the mysterious temples, even though the divine nature of these temples would influence various places and give birth to evil spirits that would wreak havoc.</p><p></p><p>But the temples still housed gods, dead gods, who were still gods.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful cultivators, through sacrificial rituals and worshipping the gods, had obtained power beyond their own and achieved breakthroughs in their cultivation, they didn't care whether the gods were strange or evil.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo knew that Cao Guang was also performing such sacrificial rituals.</p><p></p><p>But what could she do?</p><p></p><p>She couldn't stop him at all, she was just an old person with weakened divine nature and depleted vital energy, a mortal who had never established a divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan seemed to know about the situation Mu Popo had encountered, and smiled: "Why wouldn't he dare? You think he'll die? That kid's talent for staying alive... is quite strong."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan thought of Li Che's concealment techniques, and the endless Tang clan's hidden weapons that could kill divine foundation cultivators...</p><p></p><p>Even though the Thousand Buddha Feast was something Cao Guang had been preparing for years, and even though Cao Guang had prepared many backup plans.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo might not die.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo's methods, just a glance shows he's no good person, a calamity that lasts for a thousand years, how could he die easily? "Besides, don't I have the old man?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo looked at the arrogant and self-assured Li Qingshan of the past, and couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>"You know Niu Mo? Know his true identity?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Who is Niu Mo?</p><p></p><p>She was a bit curious, Li Qingshan seemed to know Niu Mo's true identity.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the spirited horses neighed, the hoofbeats on the muddy ground became more and more urgent, mixed with the sound of wind and rain beating on the carriage, continuous and uninterrupted! The leisurely Li Qingshan who was holding Mu Popo's hand did not answer her question.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly straightened up, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Here they come."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan lifted the curtain and looked out at the gloomy sky, smiling lightly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Popo was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>She saw Li Qingshan lift the carriage curtain and walk out, lightly stepping on the tip of his foot, and in the horrified gaze of the carriage driver, he floated and landed on top of the galloping horse.</p><p></p><p>Even though the spirited horse was bobbing its head up and down as it ran, its wet mane flying wildly.</p><p></p><p>It did not affect the old man standing on its head at all.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and rain, like the opening of a grand play, tore open in front of the old man standing on the horse's head.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo—</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth seemed to emit a heavy wail! Like a terrifying beast roaring and growling! Countless raindrops burst open, forming a white hazy wave.</p><p></p><p>On top of the waves, was a black ram's horn hammer! </p><p></p><p>The center of the ram's horn hammer protruded a sharp spike, like a short spear, wanting to pierce the sky! In the distance, on the rain-shrouded earth, a figure threw out this hammer, then far away cupped his hands in salute, then merged into the rain curtain like water.</p><p></p><p>The old man raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>The ram's horn hammer shot towards him, and was firmly grasped in his hand with a thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming divine nature surged out from the ram's horn hammer, like a furious beast charging against the heavens and earth! In an instant, the rain in the sky and earth seemed to have paused.</p><p></p><p>"The Ram's Horn Heaven-Shattering Hammer... only brings me a portion of divine nature, but it's enough."</p><p></p><p>"To deal with some rotten fruits... it's enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan gripped the ram's horn hammer, his blue robe fluttering, his hunched shoulders slowly straightening up.</p><p></p><p>As if filled with spirit, he stretched out a lazy yawn towards the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the carriage, Mu Popo's eyes were stunned.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, that hunched figure, seemed to have returned in her eyes to the past, when he rode a white horse and roamed the rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that vigorous and heroic young man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>That year.</p><p></p><p>The young man had spirit, and the beauty was like jade.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Flying Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>In the city lord's mansion, under the eight-cornered eaves.</p><p></p><p>Wind and rain, the heavens and earth were hazy, in the distance the cold mountains were shrouded in smoke, like ink splashes on a landscape painting.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang had changed into a clean brocade robe, adorned with gold and silver, standing with his hands behind his back on the city tower.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was deep, as if concealing sharp weapons.</p><p></p><p>A blurry figure appeared, its aura heavy and sunken, with a sword hanging at the waist, emanating a powerful sword qi, it was Cao Guang's son, Cao Qingyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Have you found your second uncle's body?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang looked out at the rain curtain in the sky and earth, speaking faintly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's face was icy cold, with a trace of grief flashing in his eyes, he shook his head: "No, the night rain washed away too many traces, your second uncle's body could not be found, only a few scattered and exploded pieces of flesh..."</p><p></p><p>"Scattered flesh..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's lips trembled, his face twitching.</p><p></p><p>Confirmed...</p><p></p><p>How ruthless! Li Qingshan! The Ram's Horn Heaven-Shattering Hammer... Li Qingshan!</p><p></p><p>Cao Hetu must have encountered Li Qingshan's deadly hand, instantly shattered and exploded into scattered flesh.</p><p></p><p>According to the rumors that had returned to the mansion, this Ram's Horn Heaven-Shattering Hammer Li Qingshan was extremely ruthless, his attacks were violent, the opponent either exploded or was smashed to pieces...</p><p></p><p>Cao Hetu... his bones were gone.</p><p></p><p>"Second uncle..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan was full of grief.</p><p></p><p>But Cao Guang turned around, his gaze icy cold, his face accompanied by the rolling thunder in the dark clouds, even appearing somewhat ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"What are you grieving for? Prepare the Thousand Buddha Feast, do you think Li Qingshan has been in Flying Thunder City for so long, and suddenly left for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>"He's giving us an opportunity to perform the sacrificial ritual, he must come back, once the ritual is one-fifth complete, he will come to kill!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's face was ice cold, the words that came out of his clenched teeth made Cao Qingyuan's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"He... is he feigning departure?"</p><p></p><p>"He knows, he's in the city, I won't perform the ritual, and moreover, he can only use his vital energy now, although he has the cultivation of a grandmaster, he can't hammer me to death."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"So, he must have drawn divine nature from the divine sect's mountain gate... he's just going outside the city to collect divine nature, while also giving us an opportunity to perform the ritual..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang closed his eyes, his body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't perform the ritual, the Li Qingshan who has obtained divine nature... I won't be able to withstand even one of his hammer blows, I'll be smashed to pieces, and everything will be over then."</p><p></p><p>"He's forcing me..."</p><p></p><p>"Openly and secretly... forcing me!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's words were like thunderous shocks in Cao Qingyuan's ears, making him tremble and involuntarily take two steps back.</p><p></p><p>"Does he know that if we perform the ritual, it will completely awaken the temple god..."</p><p></p><p>"Dare he face the fully awakened mysterious temple god?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's voice had become louder.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang let out a breath, his voice slightly bitter: "Perhaps... he never took us into account at all..."</p><p></p><p>"Is he aiming... at the temple god all along?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan paused.</p><p></p><p>"Is he so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang suddenly smiled bitterly, his gaze tinged with malice, as if he was unwilling to recall a long-buried scar.</p><p></p><p>"This is nothing compared to the arrogance I've seen..."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's thoughts returned, looking at Cao Qingyuan indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"I've already guessed his purpose, since Li Qingshan is so reckless... I'll go along with his recklessness."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll perform the ritual, as long as the ritual is one-fifth complete, if my cultivation breaks through... Li Qingshan may not be able to harm me."</p><p></p><p>"Although he is among the top ten in the divine foundation realm, most of his divine nature is left in the mysterious temple in the sect's mountain gate... the divine nature he can mobilize is not more than one-fifth."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A divine nature... what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's body exuded a fierce and angry divine nature, slowly twisting and flowing out, instantly filling the entire pavilion! "Moreover... since I know his purpose, how could I not prepare any surprises?"</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan, innate divine power... a martial arts master in the flesh."</p><p></p><p>"My school... is the one I like the most."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang bared his teeth in a chilling, almost cannibalistic smile. Cao Qingyuan was enveloped in a chill.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous voice like Cao Guang's soul-seizing sound reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Pass it down..."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Feast."</p><p></p><p>"Begin the ritual!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were slanting, pounding heavily on the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter, like hail falling to the earth.</p><p></p><p>In the warm carriage interior, Xixi had initially felt the novelty, but then fell asleep curled up in Zhang Ya's embrace as the monotonous journey rocked back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The charcoal stove burned, warming the carriage and dispelling the biting cold brought by the rain and snow.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi had his hair tied in a Nezha braid and was staring wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently covered the sleeping mother and daughter with a blanket, then looked at Lü Chi.</p><p></p><p>"Take care of them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi immediately understood what Li Che wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>"It's very dangerous..." Lü Chi said anxiously in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"My master should have had that ram's horn hammer that has killed countless people sent here... if he grips the hammer and strikes hard, one person would be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be a hero!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che gave Lü Chi a strange look: "A hero? I've never wanted to be a hero..."</p><p></p><p>"Then you..." Lü Chi still wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che slapped his big head, cutting off his words.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I just have some private matters to take care of. If there's really danger, I'll definitely run faster than your master. Even if your master dies, I won't die..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi was silent, silently thanking his master for you.</p><p></p><p>"My master is very powerful..."</p><p></p><p>He said resentfully in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently lifted the curtain and smiled: "Senior Qingshan is very powerful..."</p><p></p><p>"But when it comes to escaping, I'm better than him."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Che left the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the wind and rain howled, and the dark clouds were blown across the sky by the wind.</p><p></p><p>The slanting rain mixed with sleet, pattering loudly on the hat.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened the umbrella and stepped onto the carriage shaft. Qian He, the caravan leader, noticed and immediately pulled the reins over.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li... the weather is not very good today, and I don't know why it suddenly became so windy and rainy."</p><p></p><p>Qian He pulled the reins, his clothes already soaked by the rain.</p><p></p><p>But as a seasoned mercenary, he didn't mind the chill.</p><p></p><p>"The wind and rain are sudden, Master Li, you shouldn't come out, it's not good to get wet in the rain."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and said, "It's fine, I'm going to that carriage to carve some divine wooden sculptures, so I can sell them in the capital city. They say the capital city is difficult to live in, and I, with my family, had better prepare early."</p><p></p><p>"And also to practice my wood carving skills, which will be necessary for entering the Qianyuan Immortal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qian He immediately became respectful.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the master has not been in vain. In addition to talent, diligence and effort are also indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Li Che easily leapt onto another carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Qian Caravan Leader, when I'm making divine wooden sculptures, I don't want to be disturbed. If there's no urgent matter, you can tell Chen Shifu."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Qian He quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Che crawled into the carriage filled with wood.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly became quiet, and the sudden wind and rain were all blocked outside.</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>He did not directly use the anchor point of the flying thunder chess piece left in Feilei City to return to Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Leaning against the soft carriage chair, he tore open the air with his sword finger.</p><p></p><p>The Qiankun Jade he had obtained from killing Cao He last night slid out.</p><p></p><p>With a tap of his finger, the divine nature on the Qiankun Jade was crushed, and the contents hidden inside were fully revealed to Li Che's perception.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Yang Jing of the Yang family's divine foundation, the "Horse-faced Man" Cao He was much more humble.</p><p></p><p>The Qiankun Jade contained mostly ordinary weapons, only a few hundred taels of silver, and ten gold leaves, a rather meager fortune, completely inconsistent with the assets of an established divine foundation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In terms of martial arts, there was an unexpected surprise.</p><p></p><p>The "Supreme Jade Lotus Meridian Technique of the Great Jing Zhen Temple"! This is... a supreme jade meridian technique!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes brightened. Now that his qi and blood cultivation had already reached the peak of the qi meridian, he just lacked the jade meridian technique.</p><p></p><p>According to what Li Qingshan said, in order to pass on his jade meridian technique, he had to enter the Immortal Sect, which meant that Li Che had to hold out until the spring equinox next year.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>What a fortuitous gain!</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts of the Great Jing Zhen Temple... it seems this Horse-faced Man is indeed from the capital city's Mansion, the divine foundation cultivator of the Mansion... there are only a few of them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che guessed the identity of this person.</p><p></p><p>But he was not surprised, only more certain.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately cultivate this jade meridian technique.</p><p></p><p>After retrieving his Qiankun Space, he continued to inventory.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine nature techniques, there was only one "Great Jing Zhen Temple Nine Sun Wrathful Amitabha Divine Foundation Technique" that was worth mentioning, but for Li Che, who had already forged a divine foundation, this thing was just a trifle.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mind suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>A black jade bottle appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Pill? Only one?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Thousand Analyses Hand, his palm turned jade-colored.</p><p></p><p>He poured out the pill, which fell into his hand, the pungent medicinal smell mixed with a pungent stench immediately permeating the entire carriage.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, information about the pill was also immediately analyzed by the Thousand Analyses Hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Martial Pill (Grade 9 Low-Grade): Great Jing Heavenly Wrath Mysterious Bluegreen Serpent Martial Pill】</p><p></p><p>【Crafting: Take the mixed blood of the Grade 8 demonic creature Mysterious Bluegreen Serpent, mix it with ten kinds of herbs, and refine it according to the secret pill formula of the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion Alchemist for two hours, one furnace produces nine pills, the medicinal properties are extremely potent, pungent and foul-smelling, with a slightly sweet taste when consumed】</p><p></p><p>【Consumption: Qi Meridian Martial Artists and above】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing quickened slightly, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Wrath Pavilion's pill?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly understood why Cao He's Qiankun Jade had so little money, completely inconsistent with the assets of an established divine foundation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that most of it was spent on purchasing this pill.</p><p></p><p>A Grade 9 Low-Grade pill, worth no less than a thousand taels of gold! The most important thing is that it comes from the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion, with a guarantee of pill quality. Although Great Jing is no longer as prosperous as it was in its heyday, the name of the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion is still a guarantee of quality.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the pills, talismans, or divine wooden sculptures they produce, they are all unparalleled in Great Jing.</p><p></p><p>Rumor has it that the most talented group of wood carvers in the Great Jing Kingdom have been gathered in the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>And the once-prosperous Tao Family Mechanism Family, after their downfall, most of the mechanism masters were recruited into the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flickered, the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>It seems the capital city also has a branch of the Heavenly Wrath Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the capital city's Heavenly Wrath Pavilion might have complete and detailed Tao Family mechanism secrets."</p><p></p><p>Li Che thought.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pill in his hand, Li Che frowned slightly. He had originally thought his family's fortune was abundant, and he could live without worries from then on, but now it seems he was a bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>"To achieve pill freedom, I still need to earn more money."</p><p></p><p>"The Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes flashed slightly, fortunately the path to earning money is not too far.</p><p></p><p>Flipping his palm, he put the pill back into the black jade bottle and returned it to his Qiankun Space.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, a cute ox-faced mask slid into his hand, which he covered on his face.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist tightly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the air seemed to ripple slightly.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che opened his eyes, he had already returned to the study in the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Quiet and peaceful, the empty study.</p><p></p><p>Emanating a sense of desolation and loneliness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat down on the wooden chair, and under the cute ox-faced mask, his eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>Then he put on the elastic black robe and took the hat hanging on the door.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The door opened wide.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind and rain rushed in, blowing Li Che's black robe wildly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body suddenly swelled up with a bang, stretching the elastic black robe to a bulging state, the dragon veins on his back trembling, and countless raindrops were bounced back, bursting into a mist.</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds intertwined, and the lightning snakes rolled in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Li Che tilted his head back, the rain and snow hitting the mask.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the unique atmosphere of the entire city, his eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Feast, has it begun?"</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body trembled, the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] suddenly shook, and his entire qi and blood were completely restrained, not weaker than the supreme art of Turtle Breath Technique.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Lightly tapping the blue brick floor with his toes, a splash of water instantly burst up silently.</p><p></p><p>His figure had already shot towards the direction of the Xu Family's Mansion in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>The last day of the month, please vote for monthly tickets, please support reading, don't let the book down, the goal of quality works is arduous and long, please support, thank you Old Li!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

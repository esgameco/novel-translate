        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You are now a master woodcarver, so naturally you can... However, there are still some procedures that need to be taken care of. I've instructed someone to help you expedite the paperwork, so you can go check out the courtyard in a couple of days."</p><p></p><p>Manager Xu Yu was very appreciative of Li Che's talent.</p><p></p><p>The carved wooden figurines he created were deeply meaningful and full of artistic conception. Such talent... was extremely precious and coveted by any woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>Because with such talent, a woodcarver had the opportunity to grow into a master woodcarver! Therefore, Li Che's request would naturally not be refused, and was even something they eagerly sought.</p><p></p><p>Talents should be given the treatment they deserve.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manager." Li Che sincerely clasped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yu nodded, and together with Xu Beihu, they disappeared into the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a long breath of warm air, and a smile unconsciously appeared on his face. After moving into the woodcarving shop, the threat from the Lingying Sect would be much less.</p><p></p><p>Back in the shop, he took a bamboo hat and received his monthly salary as a woodcarver - five taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>The manager said that from now on, this day every month would be the time for the monthly salary distribution.</p><p></p><p>Amid the envious and awestruck gazes of the apprentices, Li Che packed his belongings, ready to go home and tell his wife and daughter the good news.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, he fawningly approached Master Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen, may I take some scrap materials back to practice with?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao, drinking from a gourd of wine, frowned: "Ah Che, from now on you are also a master woodcarver in this shop. No need for 'Master Chen' anymore, just call me Old Chen."</p><p></p><p>"These materials, you can take as you please. In fact, you can even go to the courtyard and pick out what you like, as long as they are not too large of pieces, you can take them back to practice."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dabao naturally saw Li Che's talent, so it was important to build a good relationship with him.</p><p></p><p>At his age, he was also considered a seasoned person, and would not easily offend others.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and when you go to the courtyard, call me over. I'll take a look for you, and we can be good neighbors."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When one encounters joyous events, the spirit is refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in an excellent mood. After becoming a woodcarver, his salary had increased, and his future had hope. The dream of his family living a prosperous life was no longer just a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Following the long street outside the city wall, stepping on the accumulated white snow, he returned to the shop, had two taels of wine, and then went to buy some pork and braised beef, heading back home.</p><p></p><p>The sky was growing dim, and the street lamps were sparse.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Li Che could see the faint glow of the oil lamp in his humble earthen house.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his beloved daughter Xixia's current babbling sounds, the corners of his lips couldn't help but curve upwards.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the earthen house, he reached out his hand, about to call out to his wife Zhang Ya to open the door.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught sight of something, his breath catching in his throat, as if the air around him had frozen.</p><p></p><p>His neck stiffened, slowly turning.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell to the lower left corner of the wooden door, where, on the thick snow, a small wooden figurine was quietly placed.</p><p></p><p>A three-headed, six-armed child sitting cross-legged on a lotus pedestal, with a faint smile on its lips, eyes blinking open and closed.</p><p></p><p>The longer he looked...</p><p></p><p>Li Che even seemed to hear the illusory sound of a child's laughter and crying in his ears! "The Lingying Sect's Patriarch?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face darkened, quickly scanning the surroundings, his glaring eyes filled with ferocity.</p><p></p><p>So... it has targeted him already? And Xixia has just turned one month old!</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlan! Where are you? Come out!</p><p></p><p>But the area was silent, only the sound of falling snow and Xixia's "ah ah" learning to speak inside the house.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed the wooden figurine, just an ordinary wooden carving...</p><p></p><p>Yet it gave off a different signal to Li Che, the joy in his heart instantly freezing over.</p><p></p><p>Just like a thief who would come to steal, they would first mark the spot as a sign.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the other party had the same purpose.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face darkened, and after thinking it over, he threw the Lingying wooden figurine into the firewood shed, planning to take it to the woodcarving shop the next day to inquire about the situation.</p><p></p><p>After taking care of everything, he finally restored the joyful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Returning home... should be to share the good news, not the worries.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, you're back?" Zhang Ya opened the door, the wind and snow rushing in. Seeing the wine and meat Li Che was carrying, a look of delighted surprise appeared in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The husband should have some good news to share with her.</p><p></p><p>When she learned that Li Che had become the master woodcarver at the Xu Family Woodcarving Shop, she couldn't help but cheer like a young girl, hugging Li Che's waist and bouncing up and down, rubbing against Li Che... making his heart restless.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, we must celebrate tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya raised her smooth chin, beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che embraced her, and the corners of his mouth couldn't help but curve into a mischievous smile: "How does my wife plan to celebrate?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's smile, Zhang Ya immediately understood his naughty intentions, and her pretty face flushed with a blush.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then took out the five taels of monthly salary he had just received, and also told Zhang Ya the news of his plan to move into the woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was momentarily stunned, though the matter of moving house puzzled her, she didn't ask much about it.</p><p></p><p>Wherever her husband goes, she and their daughter would naturally follow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhang Ya also understood that the woodcarving shop would definitely be much safer than here...</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Zhang Ya quickly put Xixie to bed, and the couple then carefully and passionately engaged in some intimate activities.</p><p></p><p>On the bed, Zhang Ya's dark hair was scattered, and she fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was clear-headed and refreshed, sitting in front of the lit oil lamp, taking out the "Treatise on Mechanical Devices of the Tang Dynasty" he had borrowed from Old Chen.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit [Immortal Craftsman] trembled once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed, and he began to flip through the pages, carefully studying them.</p><p></p><p>It recorded all kinds of ingenious mechanisms, some of which were even extremely lethal...</p><p></p><p>As Li Che read on, with the understanding brought by the Dao Fruit, he was instantly captivated, completely conquered by the ingenious designs and creative ideas.</p><p></p><p>However, the book only recorded a total of twelve mechanisms, nine of which required inner strength and spiritual power to manufacture.</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Che, this was not a concern.</p><p></p><p>He chose the remaining three mechanisms that could be made without the need for inner strength and spiritual power, namely the "Sleeve Crossbow", the "Avalokitesvara's Blood Lotus", and the "Thousand Silk Spider".</p><p></p><p>Taking out the wood scraps he had brought back from the shop, Li Che decided to make the Sleeve Crossbow.</p><p></p><p>Mainly, this was somewhat similar to his original crossbow design, so... he could just proceed with the manufacturing.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife sliced through the wood, the rustling sound of tearing wood fibers, one after another, all through the night...</p><p></p><p>When the first glimmer of light in the east broke through the gloom, and the snow-covered land was revealed,</p><p></p><p>Li Che had finally completed the exquisite and delicate Sleeve Crossbow! [Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (lv2, 19%)]</p><p></p><p>In the moment of its completion, a large amount of information about the usage techniques and introduction of the Sleeve Crossbow suddenly flooded Li Che's mind, and at the same time... a prompt appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes suddenly brightened, his spirit greatly enhanced. He didn't expect that the making of the Sleeve Crossbow would give him a 10% boost in Dao Fruit maturity!</p><p></p><p>Li Che referred to the percentage at the end as the Dao Fruit maturity, after all, once it was full, the Dao Fruit would be upgraded, which was similar but different from the Dao Fruit's maturity.</p><p></p><p>"Is it based on the difficulty of the mechanism?" Li Che couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Dao Fruit's advancement had become slow, making Li Che feel somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems he has found another way to promote the Dao Fruit's growth.</p><p></p><p>However, the number of mechanisms is a bit limited, and Li Che soon calmed down, feeling a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>"But this Treatise on Mechanical Devices records twelve mechanisms in detail, if I make them all, it should be enough to raise the Immortal Craftsman to level 3!" Li Che's eyes gleamed, his heart surging with excitement.</p><p></p><p>There's still a chance!</p><p></p><p>Since he had made the Sleeve Crossbow, Li Che had also simultaneously mastered the usage techniques of the Sleeve Crossbow, so he was a bit eager to try it out. If he could wield inner strength and vital energy to activate the Sleeve Crossbow, its power would be even greater!</p><p></p><p>But after glancing at his sleeping wife and daughter, he restrained his impulse.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and stretched, his whole body crackling and popping.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the Dao Fruit, after pulling an all-nighter, he was also clear-headed and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Hiding the Sleeve Crossbow in his sleeve, he used the wood materials to make the crossbow body and bolts. The durability was not great, but the sharpened wooden bolts were still quite powerful, and they were lightweight, allowing him to make them anytime.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the kitchen, Li Che prepared breakfast.</p><p></p><p>But his gaze couldn't help but fall on the Immortal Baby wood carving he had placed in the firewood shed.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed, and after a moment of contemplation, he shook his head decisively.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't leave Xixie and her mother in the mud hut... it's not safe anymore."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

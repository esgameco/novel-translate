        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I sliced a pound of braised beef and poured some old yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood was slightly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had killed someone, but his emotions... didn't have too strong of a reaction.</p><p></p><p>Born in this declining dynasty, with strange and rampant chaos, life was as worthless as grass. </p><p></p><p>Although the burly dark-skinned man was not the midwife Lei Chunlian, since he harbored ill intentions towards Xixia, Li Che naturally would not go easy on him.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to kill in front of Old Chen, so he made up an excuse to go back.</p><p></p><p>After all, killing in front of Old Chen... could leave him vulnerable.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Old Chen also not make the killing blow?</p><p></p><p>The main thing was, the words the burly dark-skinned man said before his death stuck in Li Che's throat...</p><p></p><p>Could the Xu Family really not control this Lingying Sect?! Li Che let out a breath, walking down the long street, passing by the government bulletin board, pausing his steps to look over.</p><p></p><p>But he found that the wanted poster for Lei Chunlian had been torn down at some point, replaced by a wanted poster for a flower thief.</p><p></p><p>"The wanted notice for Lei Chunlian has been canceled? Has she already died? Or... has someone from the Lingying Sect intervened to suppress the notice?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, his expression growing increasingly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Killing one of the Lingying Sect's burly dark-skinned men did not alleviate his worries much.</p><p></p><p>"Without moving into the workshop courtyard, I can't relax..."</p><p></p><p>Braving the wind and snow, he returned to the wood carving workshop, taking off his hat and cloak, as warmth enveloped him, along with the sound of Xixia's "ah ah" cries echoing without end.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart immediately softened, going to the workshop and seeing Old Chen holding Xixia, his face beaming with a smile as he playfully rocked her back and forth.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, Xixia, give Grandpa Chen a smile."  Old Chen chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Xixia cooed and called out, her chubby little hands grabbing and tugging on Old Chen's beard, making him laugh even louder.</p><p></p><p>Some of the older apprentices also stopped their work, gathering around with smiles, drawn by the rare presence of a baby in the workshop, a little joy-bringer.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che is back? Go to the back courtyard, the Second Manager is waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>"Xixia is here, I'll keep her company. Don't worry, the little miss has taken a liking to me. Whoever dares to lay a finger on her, this old man will slap them to death."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen spotted Li Che and quickly called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, putting down the beef and old yellow wine, first going to the workshop to say a few comforting words to his wife Zhang Ya who was waiting, then heading to the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The snowfall grew heavier, with large fluffy snowflakes drifting in the air.</p><p></p><p>On the training ground, there were already a few figures.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xuan and Wang Zhengpin, the wood carvers recruited along with Li Che, were already practicing skin polishing under the instruction of Second Manager Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hurried his steps, seeing the two managers, and cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Second Manager, Third Manager, Li Che has arrived late."</p><p></p><p>Third Manager Xu You, sitting under the eaves of the side building, was using tongs to place winter plums into the boiling stove, then sprinkling in some roasted tea leaves.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che, Xu You nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen told us, there were reasons, so it's understandable."</p><p></p><p>"Your daughter... has been targeted by the Lingying Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu You said gently, not blaming Li Che for being late.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingying Sect... is just full of mischief, strange temple rumors, can anything good come from that? And so many people worship their Sect Master, offering their divinity, even some powerful families in the city secretly support them... these fools, they will eventually cause a disastrous calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu, with his burly physique, snorted coldly, the powerful qi blasting the falling snowflakes into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Come learn skin polishing, personal strength is the true capital. Otherwise, in this world... you won't even have the ability to protect your wife and daughter."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu looked at Li Che, his voice booming.</p><p></p><p>"As for your moving matter, I've already arranged for people to take care of it. Tomorrow you can go with Old Chen to look at the courtyard."  Xu You said as he brewed the tea.</p><p></p><p>"Even in the outer city, the Lingying Sect doesn't dare to cause trouble. Inside the Xu Family workshop, it's safe and secure."</p><p></p><p>"When your daughter grows up, she can come to the inner city Xu Family estate, train together with the younger generation of the Xu Family, and lay a solid foundation..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che paused for a moment. Train together with the younger generation of the Xu Family in the inner city?</p><p></p><p>Is this a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After exchanging salutes, they came to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu reached out and patted Li Che's body, his brow relaxed: "Your innate talent is still good, though you are a bit older, it is not impossible to practice. With more hard work, there is still hope for you to step into the realm of bone tempering."</p><p></p><p>"Skin polishing is actually the initial method of circulating qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>"Qi originates from within the body, from the inside to the outside, from the outside to the inside, mutually supporting and stimulating each other. Polish the skin with blood, refine the muscles with qi!"</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Xu Beihu began to teach Li Che the cultivation method of skin polishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Che listened with utmost seriousness, not daring to slack off at all.</p><p></p><p>Although he had killed a person today, it was through the use of mechanical tricks. If he could be as powerful in personal martial arts as Old Chen...</p><p></p><p>Hmm, if the mechanism could kill... it would be more comfortable than killing with one's own hands.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Heavy snow was falling, the cold was biting.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Che was drenched in sweat, with a hazy heat haze rising. Beads of sweat the size of beans kept rolling down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>After a day of arduous practice, Li Che felt his skin membrane burning hot. Although he had not yet mastered skin polishing, he had grasped the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"I have imparted the skin polishing method to you all. In the future, you must diligently cultivate, never slack off. The martial way requires unremitting effort in all seasons to reap rewards and progress."</p><p></p><p>"Once your skin polishing is perfected, I will teach you the tendon opening method."</p><p></p><p>"However, to perfect skin polishing, you will need at least two years... Work hard. From now on, come to the practice field in the morning to polish your skin, and in the afternoon go to the workshop to carve. Every six months, there will be an assessment of your skin polishing results."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>His tiger-like eyes exuded a great sense of oppression as he swept his gaze across the three of them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che and the others immediately responded with cupped fists.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning from the practice field, the sky had already darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's skin membrane was burning and painful, but his mood was exceptionally refreshed, finally formally starting martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was carrying Xixia and wandering around the workshops of the various master craftsmen, as if showing off Xixia and letting her get to know them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che could feel that Old Chen truly loved Xixia.</p><p></p><p>He heard that Old Chen was a solitary person, without a wife or children... He had dedicated his whole life to Xu's woodcarving shop.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other master craftsmen, they all had a harem of wives and numerous offspring.</p><p></p><p>A single woodcarving master could support an entire clan, although not yet a grandmaster, but their woodcarvings were highly sought after and not difficult to earn money.</p><p></p><p>Like Old Chen, the last time he carved a "Nine Children Embracing Lotus", he directly earned 150 taels!</p><p></p><p>"Training is over? Have you started skin polishing?" Old Chen saw Li Che and came over, carrying Xixia and smiling.</p><p></p><p>Xixia saw Li Che and stretched out her hands wanting to be held.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, the ungrateful little thing, I, Chen Grandpa, have been holding you all day, not the least bit reluctant!" Old Chen, seeing himself so easily abandoned by Xixia, even pouted like a naughty child.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and took Xixia, the month-old Xixia, even more chubby and cute, with big bright eyes and long lashes, blinking like a little fairy.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, there's one more thing... I want to ask you a favor."</p><p></p><p>While playing with Xixia, Old Chen waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I know what you want to say, you want me to watch over Xixia tonight, right? Without moving into the shop's courtyard, your heart just can't let go."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not at all embarrassed. In this chaotic world, being afraid of death was not something to be embarrassed about.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he did have such concerns.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Xixia and I get along very well, I'll definitely watch over her. Tomorrow I'll even take Xixia to the courtyard."  Old Chen took Xixia back from Li Che's hands: "Okay, you've held her for a long time, Xixia, come to Chen Grandpa~"</p><p></p><p>Li Che chuckled helplessly, when had he held her for a long time? He had just passed her over!</p><p></p><p>Back in the workshop, he saw his wife Zhang Ya had tidied the workshop spotlessly, his face immediately blossomed with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Wife and child, a warm home...</p><p></p><p>This was what he pursued, only hoping for his wife and daughter to be safe and sound.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to watch his daughter grow up...</p><p></p><p>So, the Lingying Sect, don't force him!</p><p></p><p>If they push him too hard...</p><p></p><p>Today he killed one person, tomorrow...</p><p></p><p>He would not hesitate to slaughter the entire Lingying Sect!

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the wood carving shop, and the sky had gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>During the heavy snowfall, the sky would turn dark much earlier.</p><p></p><p>Back in his own small courtyard, the courtyard was brightly lit, and Xixi was playing with Old Chen in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen doted on Xixi quite a bit, and whenever they came out to play, he would use his inner strength to warm up a dry area, dispelling the bitter cold of the heavy snow, so the little girl could play happily without freezing.</p><p></p><p>"You're back? How were the sights in the inner city? Did it broaden your horizons?" Old Chen asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The inner city is indeed far more prosperous than I could have imagined, vastly different from the outer city. It's incomparable," Li Che nodded, having to admit the prosperity of the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen snorted, "Those living in the inner city are all from prestigious clans or at least small family groups. Of course, they would arrange their living environment to be better."</p><p></p><p>"As for the outer city, it's a mixed bag - refugees, disaster victims from other places, as well as locals, all jumbled together. Those big shots from the inner city, who cares if you live or die, they can't even manage it all."</p><p></p><p>The topic had turned rather heavy, and Li Che, knowing that Old Chen had also fled to Feilei City, did not continue the conversation.</p><p></p><p>He handed Old Chen a jar of fine wine he had brought back from the inner city.</p><p></p><p>"This is the exquisite wine from the Golden Brilliance Pavilion in the inner city. I specially brought a jar for you, and it's not cheap - this jar alone costs five taels of silver!"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's face immediately lit up with a smile: "I didn't misjudge you, you're a good kid!"</p><p></p><p>He eagerly broke the seal on the jar of wine and took a big gulp, the rich aroma of the wine filling the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen gulped down a large mouthful, his face flushed with delight.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this wine from the Golden Brilliance Pavilion is truly delicious!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa... Xixi wants to drink too." Just as Old Chen finished drinking, he felt his sleeve being tugged, and saw the little girl Xixi looking at him with her innocent, curious eyes.</p><p></p><p>Children have a strong curiosity and want to try everything.</p><p></p><p>Li Che laughed and scooped up Xixi, taking her back into the house.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Zhang Ya reheated the delicious dishes Li Che had brought back from the restaurants in the inner city, and invited Old Chen to join them for dinner. Even Old Chen ended up eating two more bowls of white rice, the flavors from the inner city whetting his appetite.</p><p></p><p>"My wife, I earned five golden leaves from selling the wood carvings today. Here, I'm giving you four, and I'll keep one for our daily expenses," Li Che said with a smile as he shared his earnings with his wife.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pressed her crimson lips together, looking at her husband in the lamplight, her heart fluttering with contentment and joy. Their life was truly getting better and better.</p><p></p><p>Earning five golden leaves in a single day was something they could only have dreamed of before.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, they put the tired Xixi who had played all day to bed.</p><p></p><p>In the still of the night, the exhausted Zhang Ya fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a thin robe, tucked the blankets tighter around his wife and daughter, then slowly walked out to the study.</p><p></p><p>He did not begin researching and creating the other mechanisms from the "Tong Family Mechanical Treatise."</p><p></p><p>Instead, he raised his hand, and under the oil lamp, his arm, as smooth as jade, began to emit a jade-colored mist.</p><p></p><p>Within the mist, there seemed to be fiery red snakes slithering about.</p><p></p><p>If he had not suppressed it with the Thousand Separation Hand, this divine nature would have instantly drilled into his head, eroding his consciousness and causing him to descend into frenzied madness.</p><p></p><p>"It's so domineering, so terrifying... so eerie," Li Che's expression became extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>His heart grew slightly heavy. This was just a wisp of the divine nature stored in the wood carving by the Spiritual Infant Demonic Monarch, a glimpse of the autumn. It was difficult to imagine how powerful the Spiritual Infant Demonic Monarch itself must be! This was a blade hanging over his head, more formidable than Lei Chunlian. He could only continue to grow stronger, constantly becoming stronger, in order to protect Xixi from the threat of the Spiritual Infant Demonic Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"And the Shi family... Lei Chunlian's appearance at the Shi family, does that mean... those children under a year old who died, are they related to the Shi family?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be for the purpose of cultivating the divine nature?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che furrowed his brow, his expression extremely grave. This world was far dirtier and darker than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Che calmed himself and continued his research.</p><p></p><p>"This wrathful divine nature, now concentrated in my arm, if I were to unleash the martial technique 'White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist', perhaps I could activate the power of the divine nature and use it for myself!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed with insight, immediately analyzing how to utilize the divine nature that had been extracted and analyzed by the Thousand Separation Hand.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, he focused his mind to sense the divine nature within the Thousand Separation Hand, like jade...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's eyes snapped open, and he felt his Dao fruit 'Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra' pulsing violently in his chest!</p><p></p><p>The roar of a dragon and the cry of an elephant resounded in his ears!</p><p></p><p>The divine nature within the Thousand Separation Hand was being absorbed like a hot flow, being completely drained from the pulsing Dao fruit!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Before him, a notification appeared...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Diamond (Lv.1, 60%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che's breathing paused, his eyes shining brightly, flashing with intense excitement! The Dragon Elephant Diamond Dao Fruit can actually be consumed to nurture the divine nature?!</p><p></p><p>Divine nature...</p><p></p><p>It is actually such a great tonic! <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Li Che went to the training ground of the Xu Family's estate early.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation he now displayed had formally reached the Skin Refining realm, and he was working hard to advance to the Tendon Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>The training ground was as lively as ever.</p><p></p><p>After training for a while, Elder Xu Beihu arrived, striding through the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, come with me for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's gaze fell on Li Che, and he spoke in a deep voice, then entered the inner room.</p><p></p><p>Li Che understood why Xu Beihu had come, but his expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>In the inner room, a charcoal stove was burning, the boiling water "woo-woo" howling, the tea leaves rolling and surging in the water.</p><p></p><p>The water was boiled, the tea steeped three times, filling the air with a rich fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu pinched his fingers together, pushing the teacup towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li... Lei Chunlian is dead."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu sipped the tea while speaking in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had just taken a sip of tea, but suddenly it felt as if he had scalded his mouth, becoming flustered, then his eyes revealed a look of surprise: "What? Lei Chunlian... is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"She was fine just yesterday... how could she have died?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu kept his gaze fixed on Li Che, seeing his sincere and heartfelt reaction, he furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>The death of Sun Changbiao was related to Li Che, as it was said that he had set his sights on his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chunlian's death was also related to Li Che, but the murderer was the burly villain Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>That Niu Mo could easily kill the Tendon Refining realm guard, indicating that his strength was at the Marrow Cleansing level, and it was absolutely impossible for the plain, steady, and honest Li Che to be the one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his voice and looked around cautiously before speaking: "Elder, could it be that Young Master Si killed Lei Chunlian?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Lei Chunlian had done many evil deeds, killing many infants just over a year old... This Young Master Si cultivates the Sorrow-Crying Divine Nature..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense! </p><p></p><p>This matter, do not spread it around outside, Young Master Si has no reason to kill Lei Chunlian."</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu was truly at a loss for words. He had wanted to test Li Che, but he didn't expect Li Che to directly suspect the Si family.</p><p></p><p>The Si family definitely would not do such things, but...</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu fell silent. After this diversion, he felt a chill down his spine. The Si family wouldn't... the Xu family wouldn't... but it couldn't be guaranteed that other powerful families wouldn't make a move.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu shook his head, his expression becoming more serious. This matter, he should discuss it further with the elders in the inner city and the family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu had come today mainly because Li Che had broken through to the Skin Refining realm, so he was going to pass on the Tendon Refining technique to him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder!" Li Che's face showed excitement as he accepted the Tendon Refining technique and the Inner Qi technique from Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>They were all mid-grade rank, not much different from what Li Che had bought in the market. As Old Chen had said, unless one was willing to enter the inner city of the Xu Family, it would be difficult to obtain high-quality martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The unexpected surprise was that in addition to the Tendon Refining technique and the Inner Qi technique, Xu Beihu also passed on a martial art.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family's Eight Bone-Shattering Spear!"</p><p></p><p>It was a spear technique that required the use of a weapon, but if one's physical body was strong enough, it could also be executed with the bare arms.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at it with great delight, reading through it again and again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's joyful expression, Xu Beihu smiled and patted Li Che's shoulder, encouraging him to diligently improve his wood carving skills and prepare to become a master wood carver in the future.</p><p></p><p>After Elder Xu Beihu left.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then practiced the Xu Family's Eight Bone-Shattering Spear in the training ground. Due to the enhancement from the [Dragon Elephant Diamond], Li Che's martial arts comprehension had become even higher. Just with a morning of arduous practice, he had already mastered the mid-grade spear technique.</p><p></p><p>Back in the workshop, he first took on a wood carving commission, then went to the courtyard to select the wood materials.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was accustomed to personally selecting the appropriate wood for his carving projects, then having the workers carry them, as he didn't want to take away the livelihood of these workers.</p><p></p><p>The wind and snow were falling from the sky, swaying and swirling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was directing the workers to carry the wood when he suddenly saw the scholar Li Liang, dressed in a Confucian robe and a large coat, being led by the gatekeeper, hurriedly and anxiously approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che called out upon seeing the visitor.</p><p></p><p>The old scholar suddenly lifted his head at the call, his eyes sunken and bloodshot, his spirit seemingly on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che, the old man could not hold back his tears.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Che, please help your uncle..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding letting Xixia enter the inner city's Xu Family's Shenxiu Academy, Li Che did not have as much resistance as one might have imagined.</p><p></p><p>The child has grown up, it's not possible to keep her confined forever.</p><p></p><p>That would not be good for the child's growth.</p><p></p><p>The Shenxiu Academy... it's just like when the child in the previous life went to Miaomiao's class.</p><p></p><p>"Ache, so you've agreed to it?" </p><p></p><p>Xu You saw Li Che's agreement, and couldn't help but feel a bit delighted.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen, who was sitting on the rattan chair beside them, also nodded his head: "Nowadays, the environment outside the inner city has changed greatly from the past, it has indeed become much more perilous. The Lingying Sect is stirring, the spirit children in the outer city have already dwindled to almost nothing, they have even started targeting ordinary children..."</p><p></p><p>"The inner city will indeed be much safer than the outer city, and although Xixia is a bit young, her spiritual attainments are extremely high. It would be good for her to start cultivating her spiritual nature earlier."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had always avoided entering the inner city, just wanting to live peacefully in the outer city. But now, he had spoken up to express his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then called over Zhang Ya and informed her of the idea.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you and Master Xu can decide this matter... it's just that Xixia is so young, I'm still quite worried about her."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya had some concerns. After all, Xixia was only two and a half years old.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, although I can't enter the Shenxiu Academy, I can, I will go with her and keep an eye on her, ensuring Xixia's safety."</p><p></p><p>Xu You spoke up proactively. Since this was his suggestion, naturally he had to pay attention to Xixia's safety.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was going to the Shenxiu Academy now.</p><p></p><p>The whole family was busy with the preparations, even Li Che, who had a somewhat wistful and nervous feeling about it.</p><p></p><p>He made a small wooden book box for Xixia, using extremely light wood materials, so that it wouldn't feel heavy when she carried it on her back.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was busy sewing new clothes for Xixia, planning to dress her up beautifully before she went to the Shenxiu Academy, so that she wouldn't lose face there.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>A light drizzle, a chilly breeze blowing, early spring had just arrived, still carrying a bit of a cold edge.</p><p></p><p>Xu You personally summoned the Xu Family's carriage, and together with Li Che, they got into the carriage while carrying Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, mother! Wait until I kick the Shenxiu Academy's butt!" </p><p></p><p>Xixia, carrying the small book box that Li Che made for her, leaned out of the carriage window, waving goodbye to the tight-lipped, full of reluctance Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>This was Xixia's first time leaving her mother to go on a trip. Zhang Ya was indeed very reluctant to part with her.</p><p></p><p>As the carriage wheels crushed the puddles on the ground and gradually drove away,</p><p></p><p>Xixia looked at her mother, who was shrinking in her large eyes, her little mouth puckered, and she started to wail loudly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che hugged her and comforted her, taking out a sugar-coated hawthorn, and the little girl's longing for her mother dissipated in less than three seconds.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Chen said that when Xixia goes to the Shenxiu Academy, she has to use her little fists to protect herself, so that no one will bully Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia clenched her little fists, licking the sugar-coated hawthorn while still having unshed tears in her eyes, speaking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and ruffled her hair.</p><p></p><p>"If anyone bullies you, remember to tell dad..."</p><p></p><p>"Dad is best at persuading with reason."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the gates of the Shenxiu Academy, Li Che was prohibited from entering. After entrusting Xixia to Xu You's care, Li Che went to the independent workshop that Xu You had arranged for him in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>This place was well-equipped, Li Che could work here during the day, and then go pick up Xixia from the Shenxiu Academy after school.</p><p></p><p>The independent workshop was not very large, after all, the inner city was precious land. The workshop Xu You arranged for him was a single-courtyard building, with some stone locks and wooden stakes, where he could practice martial arts in his free time.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Li Che's life became somewhat regimented - waking up in the morning to send Xixia to the Shenxiu Academy, working and practicing martial arts in the inner city workshop during the day, and then going to the Shenxiu Academy gate in the evening to pick up Xixia and return home.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in between, Li Che would still occasionally don his cute cow-faced mask and straw hat, going out in the cold, drizzling rain to hunt for experience babies of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, Li Che also quietly started paying attention to and inquiring about the situation of Simo Bai.</p><p></p><p>"He's been holed up and not come out for over two months, staying in the deep courtyard of the Simo family... It seems his injuries are not light."</p><p></p><p>Inside the workshop, Li Che held a carving knife, carving on the wood he had gathered, the wood chips falling to the floor like drifting snow.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Picking up the assembled components, Li Che closed his eyes and took a careful look before finally being satisfied and putting them away.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai did not go out, and Li Che was in no hurry. Hunting... the key was patience.</p><p></p><p>Storming the Simo family mansion to kill Simo Bai... Li Che was not stupid, he wouldn't go get himself killed.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait for Simo Bai to go out, then he might have a chance.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't linger in battle, couldn't drag it on too long, after all, the inner city was different from the outer city, with powerful experts arriving in support quickly.</p><p></p><p>After packing up the assembled components, the maturity of the "Immortal Craftsman" skill was constantly increasing, and Li Che's craftsmanship was getting better and better, allowing him to gradually realize what he had in mind and designed.</p><p></p><p>He was currently improving the "Wood Raven", planning to enhance its power.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was also studying a new mechanism called "Bodhi Tears of Blood", but the difficulty was extremely high, and it would take some time, because the main material needed was a precious pine wood called "Blood Flesh Red", which was said to be a spiritual wood and not easy to find.</p><p></p><p>Li Che placed an order in the market, asking an old acquaintance to find it, and the other party was only willing to take the order at a price of one tael of silver and one gold leaf, and whether he could find it would depend on fate.</p><p></p><p>In the inner city, on South Ming Lane, in an independent workshop, Li Che sat cross-legged on the ground, and with each inhalation and exhalation, the wood chips around him were swept away like waves, rubbing against the ground and piling up in the corners.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, it was as if an ancient bell was colliding, rumbling endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Exhale..."</p><p>"Exhale..."</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood in his whole body seemed to flow out from under his skin like a huge python, accompanied by invisible shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>This python coiled and twisted all over his body, transporting the qi and blood, one cycle, two cycles, three cycles... six cycles! The strength was constantly accumulating, accumulating...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! When his eyes opened, it was as if he had cut the air with an extremely sharp sword.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, clenched his fist, and pressed it down with a thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>Within the courtyard, a raging wind blew wildly! It seemed as if a white tiger roared out from within, with form, spirit, and intention, gathering some divine nature from heaven and earth, transforming into a white tiger phantom that undulated and rushed forward for half a meter before dissipating! Transformation Realm... White Tiger Raging Wind Fist!</p><p></p><p>He had finally mastered the martial art technique of the Transformation Realm! Li Che lowered his fist, his eyes flickering, exhaling a turbid breath, and his whole body's qi and blood receded, the hot sweat evaporating.</p><p></p><p>"Six cycles of blood exchange, blood replenishment complete... But this is only the perfection of the middle-stage six cycles blood exchange method."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not entirely satisfied with this, he needed a nine cycles blood exchange technique.</p><p></p><p>[Immortal Craftsman (Lv3, 10%), Dragon-Elephant Vajra (Lv2, 20%), Untainted Heart (Lv1, 7%)]</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>The average growth was not bad, in just over a month, the increase was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>The maturity of Immortal Craftsman had reached 10%, which was the increased maturity from the improved "Wood Raven" he had made, which pleasantly surprised him.</p><p></p><p>With the completion of the six cycles blood exchange, the maturity of Dragon-Elephant Vajra had crossed into 20%, making Li Che's tempering even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he activated the "Vajra Transformation", and Li Che's entire skeleton started to twist and turn, his bone structure and skin membrane undergoing changes.</p><p></p><p>From a young man, he instantly transformed into a robust middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>After reaching Lv2, the active ability of the [Dragon-Elephant Vajra] cultivation had obtained more refined changes, allowing him to modify his flesh and bones almost like molding.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when activating Vajra Transformation, it would only mindlessly expand, instantly enlarging the body into a muscular and burly Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could control the size of each part of his body at will, more in tune with his heart.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! In the sky above Flying Thunder City, a vast expanse of dark storm clouds rolled in, like a pressing siege.</p><p></p><p>Oppressive and confined.</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not revert his appearance back to his original form, still maintaining the robust middle-aged man look.</p><p></p><p>He took a straw hat, put it on his head, stuffed the just-carved smiling cow mask into his chest, walked into the workshop, and wrapped the improved "Wood Raven" in a black cloth, placing it in a backpack.</p><p></p><p>After putting on an enhanced black elastic shirt, he looked up at the dark clouds in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's going to rain."</p><p></p><p>"Go early, come back early..."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to pick up Xixia from school."</p><p></p><p>PS: Please keep reading! These next few days are crucial, let's go! (End of this chapter)</p>

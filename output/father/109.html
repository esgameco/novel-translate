        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>*Crack!*</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds rolled, electric snakes slithered! The moment Zhang Lianhao sensed the aura of the Ox Demon bursting forth, he shot out from the Zhen Temple Bureau building, unleashing the power of his illusory form and dashing across the path.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived, he saw the towering figure, its eyes flowing with golden mist, casting a cold gaze at him.</p><p></p><p>As if his appearance did not make it the least bit nervous or afraid.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was an official, the Ox Demon... was a thief! Yet it did not fear him, even releasing its aura, as if it had been waiting for his arrival!</p><p></p><p>After he appeared, it immediately plunged into the darkness and fled, clearly not taking the Zhen Temple Bureau seriously, more like a provocation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ox Demon's eyes, oozing with golden mist, were devoid of emotion.</p><p></p><p>But its actions and behavior were undoubtedly a provocation.</p><p></p><p>"It knows the Zhen Temple Bureau is investigating it... so it's displaying this attitude, showing it has no fear? After killing someone, it still wants to provoke further, truly a lawless rogue..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao's expression was neither joyful nor sorrowful, his toes lightly tapping the ground, his figure then darting out like a falcon, soaring over the hellish courtyard scene below.</p><p></p><p>Landing on the long street, he gave chase.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon... since it dared to appear and even provoke the Zhen Temple Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao naturally would not let this opportunity to track down the Ox Demon slip away.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the cultivation of illusory form, and his own martial dao had reached the level of a late-stage sect master, both his martial dao and spiritual nature were not weak. Although he was not as strong as the elders of the five great families and sects in the Jin Guang Prefecture, he was still a towering figure at the peak.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The spring wind suddenly became scorching, the powerful blood and qi seemed to be burning like a furnace within his body, the true qi raging and surging, leaving countless afterimages on the long street.</p><p></p><p>But he soon stopped in his tracks, for he had lost track of the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Such a masterful concealment technique!"</p><p></p><p>"I can only lock onto it with my physical eyes, even if I release my spiritual sense, I cannot perceive its whereabouts. In the end, it slipped away at a street corner, and I lost sight of it."</p><p></p><p>Standing on the long street, the spring wind blowing, the willow trees swaying.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Lianhao, gripping the silver-gilded tiger-head spear, had a sense of frustration and anger bursting forth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>He slightly lowered his head, deeply imprinting the adorable ox-faced mask in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He did not continue the pursuit, for he could no longer catch up.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Million Gambling Hall, the Zhen Temple Bureau's divine envoys had already arrived and sealed off the gambling hall.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the roof of the black-tiled houses, Zhang Lianhao looked towards the distant end of the long street, the sound of hooves echoing on the wide stone street.</p><p></p><p>A troop clad in dazzling golden armor was rushing over, the two leading figures riding on horses, followed by around forty to fifty armored soldiers.</p><p></p><p>"The Jin Guang Prefecture Divine Guard Army..."</p><p></p><p>"Their speed is quite swift, not usually this efficient."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao glanced over, let out a cold laugh, and gestured to the divine envoys below before leaping into the blood-scented courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His gaze immediately fell on the corpse of the nailed Curse Iron Zombie.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect's Tenth Corpse Deity Envoy, who had refined the Curse Iron Zombie, undefeatable by masters below the Sect Master level, yet... was brutally killed."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao put away the silver-gilded tiger-head spear.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he scanned the area, the dense death aura mixed with the scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>He walked to the headless corpse of Lan Da, recognizing the identity of the Million Gambling Hall's second-in-command.</p><p></p><p>"They had the Corpse Seal of the Tenth Envoy imprinted on them, all the warriors in the courtyard were empowered by the Corpse Seal... they couldn't resist the temptation."</p><p></p><p>"The infiltration of the Corpse Deity Sect is truly ubiquitous, the Corpse Seal can help people break through their bottlenecks, the temptation was too great..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao sighed.</p><p></p><p>Even many renowned grand masters had succumbed to this temptation and joined the Corpse Deity Sect, these warriors who had long lost hope for breakthroughs, how could they not be seduced?</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... is indeed ruthless and malicious, its methods are strong enough, to single-handedly kill this entire array, including a Curse Iron Zombie..."</p><p></p><p>"The Curse Iron Zombie, even if encountered by grand master warriors, is extremely troublesome, as its iron body is as tough as refined steel."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao observed the corpse of the Corpse Deity Envoy, his eyes slightly narrowing, for... this Corpse Deity Envoy was simply shattered by a terrifying, unparalleled force!</p><p></p><p>That power...</p><p></p><p>Likely already at the initial Sect Master level!</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... has become a Sect Master?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao took a deep breath, according to the information provided by Zhang Xiangyang, this Ox Demon... when it first appeared in Fei Lei City three years ago, its cultivation was only at the Meridian Tempering and Bone Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Three years... and it has become a Sect Master?!</p><p></p><p>"No, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a Sect Master, it just possesses the power of a Sect Master level, combined with its spiritual nature..."</p><p></p><p>After a series of investigations, Zhang Lianhao basically confirmed the Ox Demon's method of attack.</p><p></p><p>"It used spiritual crystal powder to suppress the Corpse Deity Envoy's spiritual nature, forcing it to rely solely on its physical strength, achieving a crushing and explosive kill..."</p><p></p><p>"This shows that in terms of spiritual nature, the Ox Demon is relatively weak... being able to come up with the idea of using spiritual crystal powder as a countermeasure, it is indeed as treacherous and cunning as Zhang Xiangyang described."</p><p></p><p>"But to be able to envelop the entire small courtyard with spiritual crystal powder... this method is quite rare."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao couldn't help but think of the mechanism that killed Qin Yuqing from dozens of miles away, this Ox Demon... also seems to possess such a technique.</p><p></p><p>Both of them are so reckless in their killings...</p><p></p><p>They are truly lawless rogues.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, how interesting." Zhang Lianhao smiled, after all, the headache is not his, although the Zhen Temple Bureau also deals with these trivial matters, they focus more on the three mysterious temples outside the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But for these lawless rogues, recklessly killing people, the ones who have to deal with the headache are the Divine Guard Army responsible for maintaining order in the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... is a talented individual, such a talent should join my Zhen Temple Bureau."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the identity of this Ox Demon can be confirmed, it's not Li Che... Stone Lei and Hong Yong just reported back, they saw Li Che entering the Qin Tian Observatory and working there from 3 o'clock every day."</p><p></p><p>"The Qin Tian Observatory is more than ten miles away from this Million Gambling Hall, and Li Che also has a solid alibi... a person can't just teleport, can they?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lianhao completely dismissed the suspicion of Li Che being the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang said Li Che was the Ox Demon, but that was just a guess, and he naturally didn't take it at face value, relying on his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has figured it out...</p><p></p><p>Li Che absolutely cannot be the Ox Demon! A person cannot be in two places ten miles apart at the same time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p>Cliff-top Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che removed his wide-brimmed hat and black robe, putting on the neat robe of a Qin Tian Observatory guest official, smoothing the wrinkles on his clothes, grasping the Flying Thunder Chess Piece, and shifting to the anchor point he had left in the Qin Tian Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Even when returning to the Qin Tian Observatory, Li Che also activated the concealment effect of the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] Dao Fruit to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are also strong cultivators in the Qin Tian Observatory, and if he comes and goes without concealing his aura, he might be noticed by those with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Like the Gong Yun Li and Gongyang Chengcheng who were responsible for the guest official assessments, they were both virtual form cultivators no weaker than the Zhen Temple Bureau's Chief Envoy Zhang Lianhao.</p><p></p><p>The virtual form realm is a blurry boundary between the Spirit Foundation and Spirit Manifestation realms. Strictly speaking, it can be considered Spirit Manifestation, as they have condensed spiritual manifestations, only that the power is a bit vague, not as strong as true Spirit Manifestation in terms of aura pressure.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Qin Tian Observatory also has a Supervisor and two Deputy Supervisors, who must be true Spirit Manifestation Venerable Ancestors! Although those Spirit Manifestation experts are unlikely to casually sweep their spiritual senses, Li Che still thinks it's better to be safe.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining the concealed state of the Sleeping Dragon Elephant, even if spiritual senses sweep over, it would be difficult to detect him, and he can enter the Qin Tian Observatory without attracting attention, maintaining his alibi.</p><p></p><p>"The [Suspended Willow Wood Body] I obtained from Elder Xu's hands can be learned, allowing me to create a willow wood clone, which can also better fabricate an alibi."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, his eyes gleaming, thinking of a spiritual secret art.</p><p></p><p>He cultivates spiritual secret arts relatively slowly, so he has not delved into this technique.</p><p></p><p>Dispersing the Sleeping Dragon Elephant, Li Che quietly stepped into the warm and comfortable pavilion interior heated by the furnace.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was still barefoot, squatting on the chair, holding a piece of braised chicken claw, nibbling on it while reading a romance novel.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li is back?" Shangguan Qinghong suddenly looked up, her nose twitching.</p><p></p><p>"There's a scent of blood? Brother Li, where did you go?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart skipped a beat, she could even smell that? You, Shangguan Qinghong, are you part dog?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I went to the Zhen Temple Bureau, about the affairs in Fei Lei City... you should have heard about it."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong's brow smoothed out, so he went to the Zhen Temple Bureau...</p><p></p><p>In that case, it's normal to be covered in the scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Qingong, the task I took last time, I've finished carving the wooden sculpture, you can contact the customer, he can come and get the spiritual wooden sculpture."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingong nodded, giving Li Che a strange look: "Brother Li, this wooden sculpture took you a bit long, half a month to complete, a bit time-consuming."</p><p></p><p>"For the first business, I have to establish a good reputation, afterwards I'll speed up."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled and explained briefly.</p><p></p><p>He then bid farewell to Shangguan Qingong and headed towards his own work cubicle.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Tian Observatory has arranged a work cubicle for each guest official.</p><p></p><p>There are even higher-quality professional cubicles on the upper floors, for alchemy, wood carving, weapon forging, talisman making, and so on, renting them requires spiritual crystals.</p><p></p><p>Li Che is currently dirt poor... but can't afford this money.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the cubicle area, he could see other guest officials, Li Che saw a forging master who had rented the weapon forging cubicle, wearing a short jacket, revealing a muscular physique.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to meet Li Che's gaze, the forging master slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>There was also a cubicle for talisman making, where a bearded guest official was sipping tea, seeing Li Che's gaze, he smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The relationships between guest officials are not too bad, as they may all be potential clients.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered his own cubicle, closing the door and locking it, the sky...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The chessboard was shrouded, isolating any probing. </p><p></p><p>Although it was said that within the private box of the Qin Observatory, no one would release their spiritual sense to investigate, caution was the most basic quality for survival in this world - fear not a myriad, but the unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, Li Che let out a breath, his gaze gradually turning icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect... " </p><p></p><p>How malicious! They were clearly targeting his daughter Xixia.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Corpse Curse Seal, the one I suppressed with the Chessmaster Dao Fruit, is actually at the Eighth Extreme level... No wonder it couldn't be erased."</p><p></p><p>Li Che let out a sigh, his heart sinking slightly. Being targeted by a behemoth like the Corpse God Sect was certainly not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect was not like the aristocratic sects of the Golden Light Prefecture City, they would not fear the deterrence of the Divine Sect's branch sects.</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse God Sect has people in the Bai Wan Casino, and the Black Snake Gang monitoring my family in that alley?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be their superiors, the Fishermen Gang, one of the three major gangs of the prefecture city?"</p><p></p><p>"And the boss of the Bai Wan Casino... he's not here today, I need to find an opportunity to eliminate him, to cut the weed at the root."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was extremely icy, slowly closing his eyes, emanating a dense aura of malice.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he gradually opened his eyes, the killing intent gradually receding.</p><p></p><p>Since these forces had their sights set on his daughter, then he, Li Che, would set his sights on them.</p><p></p><p>As long as he eliminated them before they made a move on Xixia, her safety would be guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>"There's not much Daddy can do... I can only help you get rid of some maggot-like things."</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Two Qian-Kun Jade appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>One was from the Corpse God Sect's Ten Extreme Corpse God Envoy, the other was from the second-in-command of the Bai Wan Casino.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since I've received such generous gifts."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the prefecture city, he had indeed behaved himself more, not having the opportunity to receive gifts from those he had killed before, such as the Qin Family's gray-faced spy and Qin Yuqing, which had pained his heart greatly.</p><p></p><p>Killing without looting the bodies, he always felt like ants were crawling on him.</p><p></p><p>Calming his emotions, Li Che began to count his gains, breaking the restrictions of the Qian-Kun Jade, and everything within was revealed to his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Li Che first counted the assets of the casino's second-in-command.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand taels of silver notes, a hundred gold leaves, and a pile of scattered silver, which Li Che was too lazy to count in detail.</p><p></p><p>Next, there was a copy of the Tenth Extreme Divine Foundation Technique, and a Transcendent Divine Vein Technique...</p><p></p><p>Various weapons, but they were all just ordinary refined iron weapons, not very attractive to Li Che, who had used divine weapons before.</p><p></p><p>No Martial Elixirs, which was quite regrettable.</p><p></p><p>But what truly stirred Li Che's emotions was...</p><p></p><p>In this second-in-command's collection, there were actually two Tenth Extreme Divine Essence Crystals!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not as poor as I had imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Che finally revealed a satisfied smile, the two Tenth Extreme Divine Essence Crystals, while not many, were at least a harvest.</p><p></p><p>In terms of assets, this second-in-command was not even comparable to the Divine Foundation Elder of the Flying Thunder City's aristocratic family, but the two Divine Essence Crystals made up for the difference.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to count the gains, this time he opened the Corpse God Envoy's Qian-Kun Jade.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the wealthy second-in-command, the Corpse Envoy's Qian-Kun Jade did not contain much money, and the first thing Li Che searched for was Divine Essence Crystals...</p><p></p><p>"Bingo!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes shone slightly, and with a thought, he poured out ten gleaming white Divine Essence Crystals!</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was one Divine Essence Crystal the size of a palm, emanating a pressure of position that almost made the Shrine God-level Li Che feel suffocated!</p><p></p><p>"An Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>This Tenth Extreme Corpse God Envoy actually possessed an Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal?! No, wait...</p><p></p><p>A Tenth Extreme Envoy, actually had such assets?!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... this Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal has great use for the Corpse God Envoy?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what great use it had, now...</p><p></p><p>This Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal belonged to the Li family!</p><p></p><p>Thank you, great Envoy, for your generosity! Adding the two from the second-in-command, a total of eleven Tenth Extreme Divine Essence Crystals, and one Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal!</p><p></p><p>Not counting the Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal, it's almost more than four months of his salary! Indeed, working for a living can't make you rich!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood was explosively good, the Divine Essence Crystals could save him a lot of time in maturing his [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit!</p><p></p><p>As long as the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit matures to level 3, he can awaken the embryonic form of the [Untainted Heart] divine ability, which would be the third divine ability he has mastered!</p><p></p><p>"These cultivators from the major sects, their assets are indeed not comparable to the ordinary gang leaders under the Fishermen Gang..."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, this Corpse God Envoy should have just infiltrated the Bai Wan Casino, these Divine Essence Crystals are likely his operational resources, especially that Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal... it may be related to the Corpse God Sect's plan."</p><p></p><p>"An Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal, eleven Tenth Extreme Divine Essence Crystals, can they help me raise [Untainted Heart] to level 3?"</p><p></p><p>"If it's still not enough, within the Golden Light Prefecture City, the Corpse God Sect's Corpse God Envoys should have more..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che lowered his eyelids, playing with the Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal that emanated a dense divine aura and a suffocating pressure, letting out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect was not a good thing...</p><p></p><p>Might as well eliminate the harm for the people.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Divine Essence Crystals, the Corpse Envoy's collection was relatively simple.</p><p></p><p>A divine weapon, a long sword, emanating an extremely icy cold aura.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon (Tenth Extreme Top-Grade): Icy Bone-Corroding Sword]</p><p>[Craftsmanship: Forged from a hundred-year-old Icy Iron, mixed with the blood of the "Bone-Corroding" demonic insects and the divine nature of the Six Desires, then tempered in the icy spring water, can unleash the "Divine Nature of Body Contact", the sword strike can corrode the flesh and bones!]</p><p>[Wielding: Requires the "Divine Nature of Body Contact" Technique of the Six Desires, Cultivating Temperament like a River and above]</p><p></p><p>A Tenth Extreme Top-Grade divine weapon, but unfortunately it requires the cultivation of the "Divine Nature of Body Contact" of the Six Desires, which was useless to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"I'll sell it at the black market later to exchange for Divine Essence Crystals." Li Che was not polite, after all, it was a divine weapon, not a cheap item, and he directly stored it in his Qian-Kun space.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the divine weapon, there were also some pills, a pitch-black pill that emanated a dense aura of death.</p><p></p><p>Li Che directly used his Thousand Analyses to identify it.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-Grade Top-Grade Martial Pill... Corpse God Myriad Ghost Death Qi Condensed Martial Pill! After consuming it, the death qi will corrode the flesh, refining through the agony, breaking through the shackles, can be consumed."</p><p></p><p>"This is for the cultivators of the Corpse God Sect who have cultivated the Corpse Puppet technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned, the Thousand Analyses identified the pill, and the medicinal properties were not much different from ordinary Martial Pills, it was just that the pill nature might be different from normal Martial Pills.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the pill, Li Che's gaze fell on the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>[Six Desires Body Contact Corpse Tempering Technique], [Six Desires Body Contact Corpse Divine Foundation Technique], these were two techniques related to divine nature.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced through them and stored them away, the Six Desires divine nature... he did not want to cultivate it for now.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he had not yet perfected the Seven Emotions divine nature, if he were to delve into the Six Desires as well, it would be a case of biting off more than he could chew.</p><p></p><p>And the evil nature of the Six Desires divine nature... was even greater than the Seven Emotions, Li Che preferred to be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was also a divine martial art! [Corpse God Death Smoke Finger], a Nine Yang Divine Nature Martial Art! Cultivated to the end, the fingers would be shrouded in death qi, comparable to deadly poison!</p><p></p><p>What a vicious martial art!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed slightly, but he flipped through it without making a sound.</p><p></p><p>After a while, with the [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] Dao Fruit's enhancement of his martial arts talent, he had already begun to grasp the basics of the Death Smoke Finger.</p><p></p><p>Except for the difficulty in condensing the death qi, it was not a big problem, Li Che had the Death Qi Martial Pill, so this martial art... he could still practice it.</p><p></p><p>Without continuing to cultivate the martial art, Li Che's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Flowing light emanated from his pupils.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra (Lv3, 15%), Untainted Heart (Lv2, 24%), Chessmaster (Lv2, 12%)]</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Dao Fruits had all increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra had increased by 2% due to a fierce battle, not much, but at least there was an increase.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Untainted Heart had not changed much, but the Chessmaster Dao Fruit had grown a lot...</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was because he had once absorbed and consolidated a large amount of the divine nature of the deceased chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>But the increase could only be described as average, to reach level 3, it was still a long way off.</p><p></p><p>"If I could go to the Mysterious Temple and draw the divine nature of the Shrine Gods, consolidating the Shrine God divine nature chess pieces... the speed of advancement should increase significantly."</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, I consumed one Shrine God chess piece to achieve a quick victory, now there are only six left..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Shrine God chess pieces... losing one was a loss, but to activate the Ascending Pavilion state, divine nature chess pieces were needed as fuel.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find an opportunity to go to the Mysterious Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Mysterious Temples in the prefecture city all have Shrine Guardians' experts stationed to guard them, and there are Mysterious Obelisks blocking the way, it's not easy to enter..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly missed the Shrine God statue outside Flying Thunder City that he had rubbed bald.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the old won't go, the new won't come, there will be new Shrine Gods waiting for me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>After clearing his mind, he took out the Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal.</p><p></p><p>In his chest, the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit suddenly pounded violently, a mighty suction force abruptly erupting from it.</p><p></p><p>The faint white divine nature contained in the Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal was frantically being devoured by the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly opened his eyes, a slight tremor of shock in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>He saw the maturity of the [Untainted Heart] Dao Fruit rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>2%, 2%, 2%...</p><p></p><p>Almost in a single breath, the maturity increased by 2%, a speed that was far faster than Li Che had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Li Che realized...</p><p></p><p>He might have underestimated the divine nature contained in the Eighth Extreme Divine Essence Crystal!</p>

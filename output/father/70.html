        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind outside the city seemed to be much colder, blowing through the body and taking away the warmth, piercing into the spine.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wore a cute ox-faced mask, silently looking at Li Qingshan who wore a cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Mask-wearing person looked at mask-wearing person, the atmosphere seemed to have a touch of peace.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? Learned from you, this old man was once an upright person too..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan stood with his hands behind his back, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the mask, he seemed to have become much colder, his emotions a bit unruly.</p><p></p><p>The mask isolated the facial features, giving people a sense of releasing the hidden emotions in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Just like Li Che, every time he wore the cute ox mask, his body and mind would feel incredibly relaxed, doing anything, killing anyone... everything became uninhibited, without any restrictions.</p><p></p><p>"The meridians are unblocked? In three days' time... not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, let's go take a look at the Mysterious Temple, I should have some chance now."</p><p></p><p>"Go quickly and come back before dark, you must leave the temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said in a deep voice, the next moment, with a tap of his toes, a surging force erupted from his feet, and the small old man's body turned into a straight black line, shooting out rapidly on the white snowy official road.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body swayed, the inner qi that broke through the meridians surged through his legs, quickly following.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh - </p><p></p><p>The howling wind rushed by, the airflow rushing past the sides of the mask!</p><p></p><p>The scenery outside the city flashed by in the eyes like lightning.</p><p></p><p>The old man's speed was extremely fast, and Li Che found it quite difficult to keep up, after all, he had not used the peerless tempering of the "Dragon Elephant Golden Armor", just silently following like this.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the fleeing Li Qingshan in front was already greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation is extremely stable, he has entered the qi meridians, his inner qi is vast and long-lasting... indeed not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan praised inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This is really a good seedling, just with such martial arts talent, even if Li Che is not a 22-year-old spiritual child, Li Qingshan would be willing to guide him into the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>The two rushed for about a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan then slowed down his speed.</p><p></p><p>His body paused, gracefully landing on the branches of an old pine tree covered in snow, the cat-faced mask, his two eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che followed closely, also controlling his inner qi, imitating Li Qingshan's posture to land on the old pine.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan looked at Li Che and said, "You have entered the Qianyuan Divine Sect, most likely you will be under my tutelage, so... since you've come to the Mysterious Temple, let me take you to experience it first."</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not say much, just nodded, looking up and seeing the temple obscured by the dense forest, only a corner of the eaves visible, the vermilion lacquer color, almost like freshly smeared blood.</p><p></p><p>"This Mysterious Temple is a Tenth-Grade one, it's best to enter during the day, at night the temple deity will become restless, and if you wake up the temple deity, it won't be easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"I was once constrained by the awakened temple deity for two months... quite annoying."</p><p></p><p>"When the temple deity awakens, it will release its divine nature, and this divine nature will invade the surrounding living beings, causing them to mutate into evil spirits under its control. The evil spirits of a Tenth-Grade Mysterious Temple won't have divine foundation-level power, the problem is not big, you should be able to try clearing them."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity for you to consolidate your qi meridians and qi blood."</p><p></p><p>Li Che listened and did not speak further, his body flashed and rushed towards the front dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Controlling his inner qi, leaving no trace in the snow.</p><p></p><p>As if parting the obstructing forest, a lonely temple suddenly came into Li Che's view.</p><p></p><p>The temple had carved beams and painted eaves, upturned corners, the black tiles were dotted with white snow, slightly dilapidated, the vermilion lacquer covering the walls and eaves seemed to emanate a pungent bloody smell.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze fell on the main gate of the temple, shifting slightly upwards, he saw a plaque.</p><p></p><p>Inscribed: Mysterious Temple of the Angry Three-Eyed True Lord Spiritual Child Branch.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance, Li Che felt the wrathful divine nature in his Nirvana Aperture start to become restless, as if it wanted to break free from his control and drift towards that Mysterious Temple!</p><p></p><p>However, after operating the divine nature technique, Li Che regained control of the divine nature, and with the "Untainted Heart" pounding in his chest, he was able to break free from this constraint.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment of breaking free, Li Che's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had already appeared at the door of the Mysterious Temple, and one foot had even been lifted, almost stepping into the temple! Countless black qi spread out from the temple, wrapping around his feet, ice-cold and bone-piercing!</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The small old man wearing the cat-faced mask, standing on the pine branch and preparing to take action, uttered a surprised sound.</p><p></p><p>"The first time encountering the Mysterious Temple, he was actually able to break free from the temple deity's attraction to the divine nature by relying on himself... such strong willpower!"</p><p></p><p>In front of the temple.</p><p></p><p>After breaking free from the temple deity's spiritual attraction in the Mysterious Temple, the black qi wrapped around his legs was washed away by his qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Then, evil spirits emerged from the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>They were a group of corpses with black membranes and black spider webs covering their bodies, their eyeballs rolled back.</p><p></p><p>Their speed was extremely fast, their defense was extremely strong, but now that Li Che's meridians were unblocked and his inner qi was consolidated, his combat power had become even stronger, and he mastered the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist at the Transformation Realm, easily defeating these evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>After turning these evil spirits into a pile of rotten flesh, the small old man Li Qingshan floated over to his side.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, these evil spirits are the elite guards of the temple. The evil spirit corpses of the Tenth-Grade Mysterious Temple all have Replacement Blood Realm strength, their flesh bodies are stronger than Replacement Blood, and they know no pain, they are not easy to deal with..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the martial artist who had explored the temple died, his body was infected and transformed by the temple deity.</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan briefly introduced this, he raised his head to look at the sky and told Li Che to follow him.</p><p></p><p>The two of them stepped into the temple.</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple, it was extremely dark, with not a single ray of light visible. However, there were rows of red candles lining the sides, burning dimly and illuminating the temple.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Che's scalp tingle was the fact that the temple was filled with wooden sculptures. They were all sculptures of children, in various poses - some holding lotus flowers, some holding plum blossoms, some with both hands cupping a wrathful Buddha statue, some surrounding a smiling Guanyin statue in a contemplative pose...</p><p></p><p>The expressions on these children's wooden sculptures were lifelike - some were laughing heartily, some were filled with fear and sorrow, some were angrily screaming, some were clutching their throats in agonizing vomiting poses, some were intertwined in male and female poses...</p><p></p><p>The seven emotions and six desires were all vividly depicted in the multitude of wooden sculptures.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, immediately thinking of the wood carvers summoned by the city lord to carve these sculptures.</p><p></p><p>"It's for worshipping the temple deity," Li Qingshan said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"The old man said that the time left for Feiluo City is not much... and this is how it is done..."</p><p></p><p>"Someone is worshipping the temple deity, paying the price of the spiritual essence of the entire city, while others can take advantage of it."</p><p></p><p>"The temple caretakers, the 'temple breakers' - in reality, sometimes what is guarded or broken is the human heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed. Although he didn't fully understand, he knew that this worship was not a good thing. It benefited a small number of people while sacrificing the majority.</p><p></p><p>Li Che clenched his fists, the tendons on his hands trembling as his inner energy swirled in his palms.</p><p></p><p>"You want to destroy these wooden sculptures? I advise you not to... these sculptures are all connected to the temple deity. If you destroy one, you will awaken the slumbering temple deity. I've just managed to lull it to sleep, and if you wake it up again..."</p><p></p><p>"The old man can leave, but you... you'll probably be beaten to death by the temple deity and become a loyal guardian zombie of the temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately retracted the inner energy he was about to unleash.</p><p></p><p>The old man with the cat-faced mask glanced at Li Che: "Don't act rashly in this eerie temple... anything connected to the temple deity cannot be easily destroyed. If you provoke the temple deity, it's very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Especially this temple deity is not ordinary... it's a branch temple of the Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Child, a branch deity temple..."</p><p></p><p>"A branch deity temple?" </p><p></p><p>"It means this temple deity is most likely formed from a branch of the spiritual essence of a high-ranking deity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, being from the Divine Sect, had some knowledge of the eerie temple and explained it to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Three-Eyed True Lord' temple title is truly frightening, making one think of the Four-Guarded Eerie Temple that the Sovereign of the Qian Yuan Divine Sect suppressed, with that temple deity holding a three-bladed sword and leading a long-legged spirit hound!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan softly said, "When dealing with temple deities, one must be very careful..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's pupils constricted upon hearing this description - why did it feel so familiar? "Forget it, no need to say more. Aren't you now a master wood carver of the Ten Districts? You have about two hours left, you should carefully observe the temple deity... wood carving masters need to observe the divine aura of the deity statues in order to advance, but it's an extremely risky profession."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... will the temple deity awaken? Is it... still alive?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were dim behind the cat-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>"They are all dead."</p><p></p><p>"Only dead deities can awaken from these eerie temples."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the old man's figure floated away towards the exit of the temple.</p><p></p><p>"I'll come back for you in two hours..."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, don't damage the sacrificial wooden sculptures around here, remember it well!"</p><p></p><p>The eerie temple fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan left, Li Che stood as straight as a spear, a nameless sense of dread assailing him from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The [Untainted Heart] pounded, its pure and flawless divine essence surging to dispel the dread.</p><p></p><p>Li Che calmed down, his eyes shining brightly behind the cow-faced mask as he gazed at the deity statue placed on the altar.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Eyed Wrathful True Lord Spiritual Child! The spiritual child deity had a vertical eye on its forehead, glaring furiously, its robes and hair billowing, barefoot stepping on a lotus, its fists clenched...</p><p></p><p>Li Che stared at the deity statue, observing it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The [Untainted Heart] in his chest was beating faster and faster...</p><p></p><p>But Li Che did not try to capture the divine aura of the deity.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a bold idea flashed.</p><p></p><p>"The [Chess Sage] skill can be combined with the [Immortal Craftsman] divine art to extract spiritual essence from the dead, and refine it into spiritual chess pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity... a dead deity, is also a dead being."</p><p></p><p>"Can I extract its spiritual essence?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the thought arose, Li Che immediately acted, silently leaping onto the altar with the two large red candles.</p><p></p><p>Standing on his tiptoes, he crouched in front of the Spiritual Child deity statue, his eyes shining brightly behind the cow-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>Towards the head of the Spiritual Child deity...</p><p></p><p>He slowly extended his hand.</p>

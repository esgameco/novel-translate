        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che had never thought of letting Lei Chunlan off the hook. It was a rare encounter, and if he didn't kill her, his heart would not be at ease.</p><p></p><p>He twisted his neck, and the large tendons on his back tensed and rang.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Tendons of the Xu Family, Li Che had opened all nine major tendons, and his cultivation had already reached the level of Tendon Perfection, just one step away from Bone Tempering.</p><p></p><p>In one month's time, Li Che's transformation was tremendous. Now, with the activation of the [Dragon Elephant Dao Fruit] Golden Vajra Transformation, he was absolutely confident in killing Zhao Chuanxiong and his companion wielding the Eight Trigrams Staff! He had originally planned to seek out Zhao Chuanxiong after this matter was resolved and eliminate this threat.</p><p></p><p>However, he never expected that during his trip to the inner city... he would encounter Lei Chunlan.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in the inner city, no wonder Li Che's disguised search for Lei Chunlan had been fruitless all this time.</p><p></p><p>He shook his sleeves, the hidden crossbow and thousand spider silk were already prepared, and a glimmer of cold and murderous intent flashed in his eyes behind the mask.</p><p></p><p>With a stomp of his foot, his figure suddenly darted out of the alley.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The curtain fluttered lightly.</p><p></p><p>Rising and falling, as if moving with the rhythm of someone's breathing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu sat in the chair, the water stove boiling, the hot flow surging, the gurgling sound echoing endlessly, as he brewed tea for himself, the rich aroma spreading.</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai stood in front of the "Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping and Subduing Ghosts Statue" carved by Li Che. At this moment, the wooden sculpture had already lost its original appearance, as if weathered by the passage of time, its features completely changed.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they could see that there were countless tiny holes under the wooden sculpture, as if it had been corroded and devoured by wood worms, leaving behind only a decaying remnant.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Simu Bai shuddered, took a step back, and two streams of hot tears flowed down, as if laughing and crying at the same time. He then slapped the wooden sculpture that had become rotten wood, and in an instant, the entire sculpture "boomed" and crumbled into fragments.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the taste is really good."</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai stuck out his tongue and licked his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Although it doesn't have the divine nature contained in the Master's wood carvings, and fails to capture the fleeting divinity between heaven and earth... it's already quite good. This sense of meaning, if accumulated a few more times, can form a wisp of divine nature, which would be of great help to my [Weeping and Subduing Ghosts]."</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai sat back down in the yellow sandalwood armchair and accepted the well-brewed premium Pu'er tea handed to him by Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>"Your Xu family has really struck gold, this is undoubtedly a budding wood carving master. As long as you are willing to nurture him, he will become the next wood carving master."</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai said with some envy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's rugged face blossomed with a smile: "The eight characters haven't even been written yet, how can it be so easy to become a wood carving master? And it also requires loyalty... In the two hundred-plus years of the Xu family, we've trained so many wood carving masters, but the ones who have truly become masters can be counted on one hand."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want him, let me have him for the Simons." Simu Bai put down the tea cup, with a hint of a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Was that old woman from your Simon family? Seems like she's from the Lingying Sect, you're involved with the Lingying Sect, and the Simon family doesn't care about you?" Xu Beihu's smile suddenly faded, and he spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai put down the tea cup: "You don't have to be so resistant to the Lingying Sect, the things that come out of the Mysterious Temples aren't all evil. The court uses martial force to subdue the temples, and Emperor Shenong destroyed the mountains and temples, isn't it because there are good things in the Mysterious Temples?"</p><p></p><p>"Divinity, divine arts, martial techniques, martial arts... all kinds of inheritances... they all come from the Mysterious Temples, why be so resistant to them?" Simu Bai said with a smile as he drank his tea.</p><p></p><p>"The court has asked us to recruit divine nature children and cultivate them, so that we can explore those Mysterious Temples that they cannot spare the manpower to explore. I've heard from my friends in the capital that the great divine masters of the court are all focusing on exploring the new 'Three Pure Ones' Mysterious Temple that has just emerged outside the capital."</p><p></p><p>"The court is exploring, accepting, and integrating, why should we resist?"</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu's face was solemn: "The Mysterious Temples are Mysterious Temples, and the Lingying Sect is the Lingying Sect, don't mix them up."</p><p></p><p>"But let's not talk about that, I have my own discretion. Feiluo City is jointly governed by us great families, how can I not pay attention to it?"</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai waved his hand, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"As for this Li Che, he's quite sensible and stable. I heard that Lei Chunlan has set her sights on his daughter, but he actually managed to restrain himself and not make a move... his courage is really small."</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai said.</p><p></p><p>"This is being sensible, although he has the backing of my Xu family, he cannot be certain that the Xu family will stand up for him. He must hate Lei Chunlan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But he is very rational, knowing that your司 family is protecting Léi Chūnlán, and his own strength is not strong. If he causes a commotion, it will be uncontrollable, and the two families' reputations will not look good. He is unable to do anything, so he can only choose to take a step back and seek a period of peace."</p><p></p><p>Xú Běihǔ said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"In summary, this person... is stable, timid, and not to be feared."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Golden Pavilion. Li Chè transformed into a black shadow and quietly approached. Now that he has activated the "Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra", his strength can probably exert the perfected power of the Tempering Bone, opening nine major meridians, with the explosive power reaching ten thousand catties.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he has only opened the meridians to their full potential. The Dragon-Elephant Golden Vajra can allow him to obtain the power of a leap across a major realm.</p><p></p><p>The major meridians on his back tightened, the released force bouncing on the ground, silently kicking up the accumulated snow, and Li Chè's body floated away.</p><p></p><p>He crawled along the wall and entered the Golden Pavilion, because he had been there once before, so he was very familiar with the route.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Pavilion is very large, vast and spacious, like a grand ancestral estate, with intersecting alleys and criss-crossing paths. </p><p></p><p>There are also guards patrolling, and these guards are not weak, all having the cultivation of opened meridians.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè hid in the darkness, indifferently observing.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Golden Pavilion stand several powerful aristocratic families, as it is a jointly-owned business, so few dare to cause trouble in the Golden Pavilion, so the defensive forces, although present, seem a bit lazy.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè easily evaded the defensive forces, and based on his memory, recalled the direction Léi Chūnlán went after going downstairs.</p><p></p><p>His body rose and fell, the full power of the Tempering Bone allowing him to reach extreme speeds, so that ordinary people couldn't even see his afterimage.</p><p></p><p>Li Chè doesn't know what relationship Sī Mùbái has with Léi Chūnlán, nor does he know what transactions the Sī family has with the Spiritual Infant Sect...</p><p></p><p>But he doesn't care about these things. Since this Léi Chūnlán wants to harm his daughter Xī Xī, Li Chè has only one purpose:</p><p></p><p>To kill her!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a luxurious courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Artificial hills and lush trees.</p><p></p><p>Léi Chūnlán changed into a clean brocade robe, leaning on the railing, looking at the Sī family guard stationed in her courtyard, then looking at the scenery in the courtyard, a smile appearing on her wrinkled old face.</p><p></p><p>"Truly the most luxurious and extravagant Golden Pavilion in the inner city, this is really a good place to enjoy life. I, the old lady, have suffered all my life, and now I can finally live such a life."</p><p></p><p>"This is how one should live."</p><p></p><p>Léi Chūnlán smiled brilliantly, like an old chrysanthemum blooming.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Infant Sect has given her things she had never enjoyed before.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Sī family agrees to the transaction with the Patriarch, I, the old lady, will become a distinguished guest of the Sī family... enjoying boundless glory and wealth."</p><p></p><p>Léi Chūnlán's body trembled slightly with excitement.</p><p></p><p>She has been introducing those infants into this world, exchanging them for her own glory and wealth... isn't that right? "Unfortunately, that Li Chè is really stable and steady, knowing that I am related to the Spiritual Infant Sect, so he moved into Xú's Woodcarving Shop... he got lucky, this ordinary worker actually became Xú's woodcarving master."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, that spiritual infant had such divine nature... if I could offer it to the Patriarch, I might even be able to obtain the Patriarch's divine nature inheritance! Then I would become a superior among people!"</p><p></p><p>Léi Chūnlán clenched her fists, her old eyes glaring round, somewhat resentful.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, I have now hitched my wagon to the Sī family, and I will eventually get that spiritual infant into my hands..."</p><p></p><p>"A mere woodcarving master of Xú's Woodcarving Shop is nothing but an ant before the mighty Sī family."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The sky, which had been resting for a while, as if sensing the coldness in the world, began to snow heavily.</p><p></p><p>Flakes of snow, blurring the vision.</p><p></p><p>Léi Chūnlán rubbed her hands and exhaled a puff of hot air: "This damned weather."</p><p></p><p>She turned around and started to operate the stove, adding more charcoal.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her movements stiffened slightly, and her neck stiffly raised.</p><p></p><p>She saw on top of one of the artificial hills in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure, wearing a bamboo hat and a bovine mask, standing like a giant halberd about to pierce the heavens, amid the raging wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were burning, like the hellish soul-devouring ox-headed deity.</p><p></p><p>Emanating an icy and murderous aura towards her.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The drizzling winter rain, mixed with icy snow, kept pouring down without stopping.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard of the An family.</p><p></p><p>Quiet as usual.</p><p></p><p>As the most low-key aristocratic family among the four great families of Feilei City, the An family's presence was not prominent, whether it was the venerable ancestor Shen Ji or the one known as the third young master of Feilei, the direct descendant An Ruosu, they all maintained a low profile.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the low profile, there were not many forces that dared to ignore the An family.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the true eldest son of the An family was once highly valued by the emissaries of the Divine Emperor, and was taken to cultivate within the Divine Emperor's inner circle, possessing extraordinary talents. He followed the high-level cultivators of the Divine Emperor and gained great attention.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of the An family.</p><p></p><p>Having someone within the Divine Emperor's inner circle, this was an extraordinary foundation, one that the Yang family, the Xu family, and the former Si family could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the courtyard of the An family, the old patriarch of the An family, the only Shen Ji cultivator in the family, with white hair and white robes, was seated cross-legged on the couch, the suddenly ignited furnace emanating warmth, dispelling the damp cold brought by the winter rain.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Jing and the Ox Demon... fought on the main street."</p><p></p><p>"Daring to fight against a Shen Ji cultivator, how bold."</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the An family stroked his beard and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon, his actions are so unruly and violent, without any reason at all. Fortunately... we in the An family did not agree to the city lord's request to raid the Xu family's Shen Xiu Academy and abduct the spirit children."</p><p></p><p>Under the old patriarch of the An, one of the three young masters of Feilei, An Ruosu, frowned and said, "That Ox Demon has strange methods, proficient in the way of mechanisms. Perhaps this is the foundation of his daring to fight against a Shen Ji cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't the once renowned Tang family of mechanism masters able to surpass their cultivation level and fight through their mastery of mechanisms?"</p><p></p><p>"Could this Ox Demon... be a remnant of the Tang family?"</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the An family looked at An Ruosu solemnly, "Be careful with your words."</p><p></p><p>"Such topics, do not casually discuss them. Be cautious with your words and actions, steady, judicious, and vigilant, this is the key to the long-term prosperity of the family."</p><p></p><p>"No matter who this Ox Demon is... we must not provoke him, we in the An family cannot afford to offend this plague."</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch of the An family said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"We have sent the spirit children the city lord's office wanted, and we will not participate in the city lord's Thousand Buddha Feast. We have also handled the family's affairs well, in a few days we will migrate the entire family out of Feilei City and go to the Jin Guang Prefecture to join your elder brother."</p><p></p><p>An Ruosu let out a breath, somewhat unwilling, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The elegantly seated old patriarch of the An family, his eyebrows raised, his gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a white mist began to emanate from his body, slowly coalescing into a blurry figure that floated up to the roof, like a figure emerging from a dream.</p><p></p><p>This was the An family's divine ability, [Hundred Transformations Troubled Dream]! With a sound like sucking in a breath, the mist that had floated up to the roof instantly returned to the old patriarch's body.</p><p></p><p>After a shudder, the old patriarch's face was filled with worry: "The Ox... the Ox..."</p><p></p><p>"Old Yang... is gone."</p><p></p><p>An Ruosu heard this and his whole body trembled.</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>However, the old patriarch raised his head, his worried expression deepening: "This Ox Demon... what kind of thing is it!"</p><p></p><p>"The Si family, the Yang family... is it our turn next, the An family?!"</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>"Can't wait until three days from now."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly notify the clan members, the day after tomorrow, no... tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, the entire clan will leave the city!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The cold rainwater accumulated on the edge of the hat, then overflowed, forming a curtain of water, dripping endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's eyes narrowed, the hand knocking on the door suspended in midair, frozen.</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to have fallen into a state of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Li Che who opened the door, at that refined and gentle countenance...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Cao Qingyuan felt dizzy and confused.</p><p></p><p>Li Che... how could he be here? Wasn't he the Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he supposed to be fighting with Yang Jing on the main street, and then be killed by the rampaging Shen Ji cultivator Yang Jing?! But why... was Li Che appearing here?</p><p></p><p>In a leisurely and refined manner, without a trace of having been in a life-and-death battle.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>That he was wrong?!</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan felt his head buzzing, the previous resolute conviction now seemed like a joke.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang, who was following him, also had a bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>No... the one who opened the door was Li Che?</p><p></p><p>According to the young city lord's speculation, the possibility of Li Che being the Ox Demon was as high as 90%! But since Li Che appeared here...</p><p></p><p>Then who was the Ox Demon who fought with Yang Jing?</p><p></p><p>Everything was in chaos, all the guesses were in disarray...</p><p></p><p>"Master Li... haha, at home?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan quickly regained his composure, his gaze flickering with a somewhat forced smile as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was surprised and said in a strange tone: "Young city lord, what do you mean by that? Now that even the Xu family's Shen Xiu Academy has been plundered, I'm worried about my daughter's safety, how can I not be at home?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't just wander around, I have to stay by my daughter's side at all times..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan smiled and said, "That's true, but the evil ones who attacked the Xu family's Shen Xiu Academy have all been eliminated. Master Li can rest assured now."</p><p></p><p>"That won't do... that Ox Demon is still out there, how terrifying, that Ox Demon... killed so many people, truly frightening."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, his expression full of fear.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan paused.</p><p></p><p>He felt something was off...</p><p></p><p>Very strange!</p><p></p><p>He raised his gaze, looking into the courtyard, and immediately saw Xixia riding a scooter under the eaves.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what brings the young city lord here today?" Li Che asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's gaze fell back on Li Che. "The commission I entrusted to Master Li the other day... has Master Li started the carving?"</p><p></p><p>"My father greatly admires Master Li, so..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che apologetically shook his head and took out the gold leaf, returning it to Cao Qingyuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, young city lord, I'm not taking on this wood carving commission. I haven't started carving yet, and my daughter has encountered a great evil, nearly being abducted, my heart... cannot settle down to carve. Imperfect works, I cannot accept them, so..."</p><p></p><p>"Please convey my apologies to the city lord on my behalf."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's expression suddenly became cold.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, this is a bit too much, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"After all this time, you've accepted the commission, and with your mastery, you could have completed the wood carving long ago. My father said, he doesn't require divine wood carving, just your craftsmanship is enough. It's not a difficult task for you, just a small favor, but Master Li seems to be looking down on our city lord's manor."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, Master Li has been busy with other matters these days, and had no time for the wood carving?"</p><p></p><p>The air suddenly became ominous, the falling rain and snow seeming to be imbued with the divine energy emanating from Cao Qingyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, you are actually that..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's voice thundered like lightning.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che did not buy into his act at all, his face full of fearful expression: "Young city lord, this is slander... you are slandering me!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Shen Pu!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan remained cold-faced.</p><p></p><p>The rain suddenly seemed to pause.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang, the Shen Pu behind him, his expression hardening, reluctantly took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>"[Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light], seek his fear, I want to see if this Master Li has truly been fearing the Ox Demon and worrying about his daughter's safety these days!"</p><p></p><p>With a hat on, Zhang Xiangyang tilted his head back, his rugged face, his hair and beard flying, his eyes seeming to emit a bluish glow.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Li Che, and a river-like divine energy surged out from Zhang Xiangyang's body!</p><p></p><p>[Awe-Inspiring Tracing Light]! To trace back the fragments of Li Che's past!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Frowning.</p><p></p><p>This is too much...</p><p></p><p>This Cao Qingyuan is so aggressive, making him want to...</p><p></p><p>Wear a mask! However, just as he was about to take action, a raindrop suddenly shot out from the courtyard with a whistling sound.</p><p></p><p>With a snap, it shattered the divinity that was dispersing from Zhang Xiangyang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang's whole body trembled, and the straw hat was directly split in two from the center by the shooting raindrop, generating a powerful force that caused Zhang Xiangyang to plummet directly onto the rain-soaked cobblestone alley.</p><p></p><p>A strong vital energy was slowly dissipating in the raindrop.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang's face was pale, feeling as if he had just taken a stroll at the gates of the King of Hell.</p><p></p><p>If that raindrop had wanted to kill him, it could have pierced through his head and divinity in an instant, making him completely done for.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked towards the courtyard behind Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Cao Qingyuan finally noticed the old man in blue robes sitting under the eaves, a wooden chessboard in front of him, holding a black chess piece and deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Marquis' Mansion are so overbearing, casually using divinity to pry into others' privacy. Don't you know that using [Awe-Inspiring Retrospective Light] will have a negative impact on one's spirit?"</p><p></p><p>The old man glanced at Cao Qingyuan, causing Cao Qingyuan's hairs to stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Just a single glance made him feel a sense of mortal danger.</p><p></p><p>As if facing a great terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you are..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan released his grip on the hilt of his knife and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, there was a sound of something piercing the air.</p><p></p><p>A tall figure appeared beside Cao Qingyuan, wearing a black and red official robe, with a gentle and scholarly appearance, sporting a beautiful beard and mustache, smiling as he looked at the old man sitting across the chessboard in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Father..." Cao Qingyuan respectfully cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the senior from the Divine Sect... My son has offended you, senior, please do not blame him."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Cao Guang, however, did not pay attention to Cao Qingyuan, only looking deeply at the old man under the eaves.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan, holding a chess piece, stared at the chess board.</p><p></p><p>Ignored, Cao Guang didn't seem to mind much, as if it was a very normal thing.</p><p></p><p>He still wore a smile as he looked at Li Che.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li... Are you really unwilling to carve wooden sculptures for this official? Not even divine nature wood carvings?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Marquis Cao Guang, feeling an extremely strong sense of crisis for the first time, especially...</p><p></p><p>The black chess pieces that absorbed the divinity of the temple gods in the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit seemed to be shaking the chessboard, making them restless.</p><p></p><p>"I have been worried about my daughter's safety these days, my heart is still uneasy, and I truly have no energy to carve, Marquis, please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>Li Che cupped his hands, neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, Master Li is truly a good father..."</p><p></p><p>"Since Master Li is unwilling, then let it be..."</p><p></p><p>"As for my son's speculation, Master Li need not take it to heart. The refined and amiable Master Li, how could he be the ruthless and murderous Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Cao Guang shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked at the old man under the eaves.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you must have come from the Divine Sect to test the spiritual child, right? May I know which esteemed one from the Divine Sect the senior is? Can this Cao pay his respects?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang asked.</p><p></p><p>The old man holding the black chess piece gently placed the chess piece on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of Cao has quite an appetite, worthy of knowing this old man's name..."</p><p></p><p>"This old man, from the Qianyuan Branch Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang paused for a moment upon hearing this, and the next instant, his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan?!</p><p></p><p>So it was him!</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that the martial artist who had reached the Sect Master realm and wore a cat-faced mask, whom he had fought with a few times, would actually be Li Qingshan! In Cao Guang's narrowed eyes, a sense of tension and urgency suddenly burst forth...</p><p></p><p>"So it's Senior Li, the name of Senior Qingshan is renowned throughout the jianghu..."</p><p></p><p>"This one takes his leave."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang said, then pulled Cao Qingyuan and quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only the lone Spiritual Constable Zhang Xiangyang, lying on the wet ground, beaten by the rain, remained.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang struggled to get up, only to meet Li Che's lingering gaze.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of greed and longing in that gaze.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang hurriedly crawled and ran away in the rain.</p><p></p><p>As he turned his back to Li Che...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiangyang's hairs stood on end, this familiar feeling, just like when he was frantically fleeing after Zhou Ruoguan was killed, the feeling that his head could be crushed at any moment! Li Che... must be the Ox Demon!</p><p></p><p>Must be! Li Che regretfully withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>But he also looked at Li Qingshan, who was sitting under the eaves playing chess, with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Cao Guang's reaction, Li Che sensed it very clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>"Is he that famous?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help murmuring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>And while Li Che was surprised by Li Qingshan, Li Qingshan was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised that Li Che had actually killed the divine foundation of the Yang family! Cultivating and killing a divine foundation...</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the difference in cultivation level?! Li Che... was actually able to do this? His cultivation of divine nature was not even that high, nor was it like Lü Chi's [Wrathful Prince], a Fourth Divine level divine nature!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after Li Che killed Yang Jingzhi, when did he return to the study room? When Li Che walked out of the study room with a scholarly demeanor, Li Qingshan was quite startled, thinking that the Ox Demon must be someone else.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection, it could only be attributed to Li Che's skill in concealing his vital energy, able to evade the divine foundation's perception, such a remarkable skill.</p><p></p><p>"How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan asked, of course, he meant how Li Che killed the divine foundation.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled gently and shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Honest, but not fully revealing.</p><p></p><p>"Mechanisms."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Li Qingshan left, Li Che comforted his wife Zhang Ya, who had a worried expression, and then came to the study.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit trembled slightly, expanding the chessboard network to cover the surroundings, confirming that there were no powerful ones prying, everything was safe and sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then sat down on the wooden chair, his whole body relaxing, letting out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>In the room, the charcoal brazier burned quietly, releasing heat to dispel the biting cold.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's entire body, every muscle and bone, let out a sound of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fighting the divine foundation was so refreshing! "The divine foundation cultivators are indeed very strong, the fusion of two divine natures is still not as good as the divine foundation, but... the power of 'Bodhi Tears of Blood' far exceeds my expectations, the penetrating power, explosive power, and lethality are far superior to the Crow of Wood Passage!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that 'Namo Barret' has some potential..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>But what made his heart more stirred was...</p><p></p><p>His mind moved.</p><p></p><p>A prompt flashed by like a ray of light.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (LV2, 97%)]</p><p></p><p>"High-intensity stimulation has greatly catalyzed the maturity of [Dragon Elephant Vajra], it's only 3% away."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>Without any further hesitation, he utilized the complementary nature of the Dao Fruits, mobilizing the divine nature of the [Unsullied Heart] Dao Fruit to supplement the [Dragon Elephant Vajra], completing the Dao Fruit! The next moment, Li Che only felt his entire body's blood boiling beneath the skin.</p><p></p><p>A golden light suddenly flashed before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (LV3, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit LV3, next evolution, obtain the divine ability embryo "Dragon Elephant Vajra: Ascending the Tower"]</p><p></p><p>The first two chapters are presented, and these two chapters were written until 3:30 am last night, there will be more in the afternoon, please support the first order, the first order is needed for recommendation after the book is shelved!

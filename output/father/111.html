        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Li Che heard this name, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Associating it with the Monkey King Temple, an image of the legendary Monkey King who shook the heavens and made all celestial beings bow down before him immediately surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King?! Li Che took a deep breath, every inch of his flesh and blood seemed to be trembling. It was just a name, yet it made his very soul quiver.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince, the True Lord of the Three Eyes, and now... the Equaling Heaven...</p><p></p><p>The overlapping mythologies from his two lives crashed against each other in his mind like dark clouds, accompanied by the rolling electric snakes and roaring thunders.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Che finally let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Equaling Heaven Temple... truly disintegrated and perished?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Shangguan Qinghong, this girl knew many things, like a treasure trove of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>If there was something he didn't understand, he could just ask her.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong shook her head as she munched on melon seeds. "Although the ancient Divine Ancestor Temple has fallen into ruin and its lineage has fractured, it cannot be said to have completely perished..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Three Pure Ones' temple that the Equaling Heaven Temple once suppressed still remains. The sudden outburst of the temple deity's rampage five hundred years ago caught the already weakened Equaling Heaven Temple off guard..."</p><p></p><p>"The area occupied by that eerie temple has now become a place of great calamity, with the mysterious pagoda expanding for thousands of miles, a desolate wilderness. The former Equaling City has also become a carnival for demons and evil spirits."</p><p></p><p>"However, the three major lineages that branched out from the Equaling Heaven Temple all aspire to retake Equaling City - the Ruyi Sect, the Heavenly Dipper Tower, and our own Heart Monkey Temple in the Golden Light Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"I think reviving the Equaling Heaven Temple would be an exaggeration. After all, it's a thing of the past. Most likely, it's just for the sake of the Equaling Heaven legacy and that Three Pure Ones-grade divine weapon."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong shook her head and rambled on. Five hundred years had passed, an eternity. What was once a matter of lineage and sentiment had become mere fleeting clouds, with only interests remaining.</p><p></p><p>"A Three Pure Ones-grade divine weapon?" Li Che's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>"The Ruyi Cudgel?" he blurted out unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? You know about it? You've heard of it before?" Shangguan Qinghong was a bit surprised, not expecting Li Che to be able to mention this name, as the information about the Equaling Heaven Temple was too ancient, and most ordinary cultivators were unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>"That divine weapon of the Three Pure Ones is called the 'Equaling Heaven Ruyi Cudgel'! It is ranked seventh in the 'Great Celestial Divine Weapon Catalog' compiled by the Great Monitor Zheng!"</p><p></p><p>"Only seventh?" Li Che was dissatisfied. How could the weapon of the Great Sage be so low? Shangguan Qinghong covered her mouth and chuckled, "But it's not low either. The Great Monitor Zheng said on the frontispiece of the Divine Weapon Catalog that the top ten divine weapons have no distinction of strength or rank, it mainly depends on the power of the wielder at the time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck him: "So... the Equaling Heaven Cudgel still has no master?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong gave Li Che a strange look. "Yes, the Equaling Heaven Eerie Temple is located in Stone State. Now, Stone State has basically become the domain of demons and evil spirits due to the rampage of the Three Pure Ones-grade mysterious pagoda. That ancient Equaling City has even been occupied by a demonic king comparable to the Celestial Embryo Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The Equaling Heaven Cudgel, after the death of the cultivator of the Equaling Heaven Temple during the divine calamity, has retreated back into the Equaling Eerie Pagoda and is waiting to reemerge, not yet claimed by anyone."</p><p></p><p>"Li Ge, you're not coveting this cudgel, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, naturally he had ambitions... but Shangguan Qinghong quickly dissuaded him, "Your cultivation is too weak now. You can't even get close to the Equaling Ancient City, let alone enter it. You'd be torn apart by the demons and evil spirits..."</p><p></p><p>"And a Three Pure Ones-grade divine weapon, without sufficient cultivation, you wouldn't be wielding it, but rather being controlled by it."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong wanted to discourage Li Che from harboring such thoughts. Li Che did have the confidence of his ambitions, but he still needed some time to develop further.</p><p></p><p>He just smiled and didn't delve deeper into this topic.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong sighed wistfully, "Every time I read the ancient records, learning about the Equaling Heaven Temple's heyday, its unparalleled supremacy and its division of the world with the court, how mighty and tyrannical it was, the pinnacle of the Divine Ancestor, yet it still could not escape the ravages of time and suffered a great calamity..."</p><p></p><p>"Disintegrating and fracturing in a single day and night, now it can only become a relic of the past to be nostalgically remembered in history."</p><p></p><p>"So this world... is too dangerous. No one can be sure of surviving safely. Even when the Equaling Heaven Temple was at its peak, it had 'Divine Calamity' experts beyond the Celestial Embryo Realm guarding it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yet it still fell into ruin and became mere dust."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong sighed and continued munching on her melon seeds.</p><p></p><p>Li Che also couldn't help but feel solemn. Indeed, this world was too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, those deceased temple deities in the eerie temples seemed to overlap with the mythologies in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It made an inexplicable anxiety arise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I'm too weak now, thinking about these is meaningless. I'll just focus on living my own life well."</p><p></p><p>"I just want to accompany my wife and daughter, and live well in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said softly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong's gaze flickered, as if she was touched by Li Che's words. Her long lashes trembled, and she looked at Li Che with a hint of wistfulness, biting her red lips.</p><p></p><p>"Li Ge..."</p><p></p><p>She called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at her questioningly.</p><p></p><p>"I wish you were my father." Shangguan Qinghong bit her lip, her voice unusually gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned, then felt a bit at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>This girl, when they first met, was completely on the marriage-seeking track, coveting his body. </p><p></p><p>Now, she wanted to be his daughter? Women... truly fickle!</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Shangguan Qinghong also seemed to come to her senses, feeling a bit embarrassed. Her pretty face instantly turned as red as a scorching iron block. She stuffed a handful of melon seeds into Li Che's hand and quickly scurried away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon has appeared! When Qin Haonan, who was still keeping an eye on Li Che in the Lingering Fragrance Pavilion, heard this news, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon? Appeared?" </p><p></p><p>He stared at the gray-faced spy who brought the news, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan had actually also thought that Li Che was the Ox Demon, mainly based on Zhang Xiangyang's hint, so he had subconsciously felt that Li Che fit the identity of the Ox Demon too well.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a gap in strength, Li Che's displayed power did not match the Ox Demon at all. But as a member of the Qin family, Qin Haonan knew that simply looking at surface-level strength was not accurate.</p><p></p><p>Some obscure concealment techniques could hide one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Qin Haonan had never dispelled his suspicion of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But when the message from the gray-faced spy came today, and Qin Haonan saw Li Che enter the Celestial Monitor's residence with his own eyes, he had to admit a fact.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Li Che is not the Ox Demon after all..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan plopped down in the chair, poured himself a cup of wine, and downed it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Then who the hell is the Ox Demon? </p><p></p><p>The one who killed Jade Qing... who could it be?</p><p></p><p>That person who could shoot and kill the Sect Master-level Qin Yuqing from dozens of miles away was truly nightmarish, making him feel uneasy and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch also went to that remnant of the Tang clan, but that Tang remnant firmly denied it was not his doing, no enmity or grudge, and someone of his stature indeed could not have brazenly assassinated a woman like that."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Cao Guang... is not dead?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan felt an intense headache. With the might of the Qin family in this vast city, how could they not be able to find a person? "The Hundred Million Gambling Den... colluding with the Corpse God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>As the gray-faced spy continued to report, Qin Haonan narrowed his eyes, but his expression did not change much.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the surface, the Golden Light Prefecture seemed peaceful.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, there were undercurrents surging beneath.</p><p></p><p>For the infiltration of the Corpse God Sect's forces, the major clans and families of the prefecture were more accepting than one might imagine, because the benefits they obtained were tangible.</p><p></p><p>And the temptation of being able to break through the bottleneck of their cultivation was truly too great.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect possessed formidable power, and although the court had been suppressing the Corpse God Sect, the failure of Prince Yimo Li's suppression of the rebellion had allowed the Corpse God Sect's forces to become even more rampant.</p><p></p><p>It was not just the Golden Light Prefecture, the various prefectures of Cloud State seemed to have the infiltration of the Corpse God Sect's forces.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect's power had already expanded beyond its original base of development, gradually encroaching on the territory of the Great Celestial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>They even wanted to emulate the once-prosperous Equaling Heaven Temple from three thousand years ago, occupying the Twelve Prefectures and sharing the world with the court! The families and the court were not on the same page, and perhaps during the prosperous times of the Great Celestial, the families in the various prefectures still did not dare to have any dissenting thoughts, obediently loyal.</p><p></p><p>But when the mighty tiger began to decline, the various factions might harbor other intentions.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying... that the Ten Corpse God Envoy of the Corpse God Sect was killed? The Ten Corpse God Envoy, with their Cursed Iron Corpse Physique, is invincible below the Sect Master level, even a Celestial Embryo would find it difficult to kill them!"</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon... actually managed to do it?!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Cursed Iron Corpse was known to be extremely foul and tough, able to withstand injuries and escape even when facing Sect Master-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Yet a mere Ten Corpse God Envoy was killed outright.</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless, dozens of Qi Vein martial artists at the Hundred Million Gambling Den all reduced to shreds?"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the description of the Hundred Million Gambling Den massacre, Qin Haonan couldn't help but let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was even more certain that the Ox Demon had nothing to do with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the alibi, just from observing Li Che these past few days, this simple-living, family-oriented wood carving master,</p><p></p><p>how could he be the terrifyingly cruel and ruthless Ox Demon who massacred people and reduced them to shreds?</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan stood up and walked to the window, looking at the Celestial Monitor's Treasure Pavilion standing on the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Haonan ultimately chose to abandon his surveillance of Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Such an honest and upright person,</p><p></p><p>it's not worth wasting time monitoring him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you allowed to manage the Ox Demon either?" </p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>Without lingering, he stepped over the notice board, bathed in the swaying spring breeze, and arrived at the small workshop courtyard he had purchased in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Closing the door, bolting the lock.</p><p></p><p>The [Chess Saint] Dao Guo shook, and the celestial chessboard suddenly appeared before him, spreading across the entire small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Flashing light, in the very center of the celestial chessboard, there was a "Corpse Curse Seal", emanating an extremely pungent corpse aura.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was icy cold. If it weren't for the mention of that Corpse Deity Envoy, he wouldn't have known that this Corpse Curse Seal was of such a high grade.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the powerful figure from the Corpse Deity Sect that Cao Guang had contacted in the capital city must not be of low status either.</p><p></p><p>To be able to use the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal as a connection, the powerful figure from the Corpse Deity Sect that Cao Guang wanted to sell to must certainly possess the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Che was puzzled as to why one of the three major factions, the Fishing Faction, would be keeping an eye on him. </p><p></p><p>Now it seems that it has a lot to do with this Corpse Curse Seal, and the other party is obviously not sensing the Corpse Curse Seal because Li Che has been sealing it with the celestial chessboard, making it undetectable.</p><p></p><p>The other party must have sent their subordinate Black Snake Faction to keep an eye on him, most likely because Cao Guang originally planned to imprint this Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal on Xixia.</p><p></p><p>So they are keeping an eye on Xixia.</p><p></p><p>To find out who took the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal...</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect, the Corpse Curse Seal..." </p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was indifferent, with unrestrained killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for me... but I'm also looking for you..."</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he pointed at the Corpse Curse Seal.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it was as if ink-black corpse aura was released in concentric circles, spreading across the entire chessboard.</p><p></p><p>After several expansions, two black pieces emitting a corpse aura suddenly appeared on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his head, looking towards the outside of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Snake Faction..."</p><p></p><p>Those two warriors possessing the Corpse Curse Seal were the ones from the Black Snake Faction who had come to keep an eye on him from outside the small workshop courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they are within ten meters of me, the Eight Extremes Corpse Curse Seal can reveal those who possess the Corpse Curse Seal..."</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Corpse Deity Sect are exposed before my eyes, with nowhere to hide."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze was icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Corpse Deity Sect, he had no goodwill, only killing intent.</p><p></p><p>After all, they coveted his daughter, and had instigated the heinous act of the Thousand Infant Sacrifice, utterly evil...</p><p></p><p>They must be killed!</p><p></p><p>Killed without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>He would not show the slightest mercy.</p><p></p><p>While the Temple Guard and Divine Guard were casting a wide net to catch the big fish, Li Che couldn't be bothered with that.</p><p></p><p>It was the Corpse Deity Sect that acted without honor, wanting to use the Corpse Curse Seal implanted in Li Zhengran's body to infect Xixia through such despicable means.</p><p></p><p>Then he, Li Che...</p><p></p><p>What martial ethics did he need to uphold?</p><p></p><p>"It's you who forced me into this..."</p><p></p><p>Madness and savagery surged in Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a casual sweep, the celestial chessboard expanded, enveloping the surroundings and shielding the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, his blood and qi suddenly boiling, his black hair flying wildly, his bones and sinews resonating with a crisp sound!</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—!"</p><p>"Exhale—!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his mouth, inhaling and exhaling, stirring the airflow in the courtyard, accompanied by a wailing howl, like a long dragon sweeping through.</p><p></p><p>The sound of blood rushing and flowing incessantly filled his ears!</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Che's blood and qi were surging, his mysterious meridians reaching their peak, his breath connected from his crown to his feet, as if he had completely merged with heaven and earth! Li Che seemed to have entered a state of selflessness, with the internal qi circulating in his body, forming a complete cycle, as if he had opened up all the acupoints on his body.</p><p></p><p>His mind seemed to have soared out, sensing every change on his physical body, the contraction and expansion of his pores, the peristalsis and vibration of his internal organs.</p><p></p><p>Every scene was reflected in his mind as if he had divine assistance!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Suddenly, Li Che took a step forward, his five fingers clenched like hooks, gathering five streaks of light into a fist, and struck out with great force, as if a magnificent tiger was roaring out from behind him.</p><p></p><p>This was the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist that he had refined into a superior martial art!</p><p></p><p>The white tiger seemed lifelike, condensed from the internal qi bursting out of his body! </p><p></p><p>Roar! The white tiger roared towards the sky, and in an instant, it became vividly alive, as if imbued with vital energy, becoming a true living being. This was the realm of the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist!</p><p></p><p>A divine martial artist needs to cultivate a martial art to the realm of embodiment, fusing it with their own vital essence and spirit.</p><p></p><p>And this step was no problem at all for Li Che, who possessed the [Dragon Elephant Golden Armor] talent that could greatly enhance his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>From his flesh and blood, it was as if there was a tiger's roar, and his bones and sinews all let out crisp sounds, the speed of his internal qi circulation became even faster, and the bursting force also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>His five senses and six consciousnesses were all comprehensively enhanced, vaguely seeming to want to break out of his physical body, forming a kind of sensing power similar to divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Che stood with his work completed, his entire being like a mighty and fierce tiger crouching, and as his eyes opened, the blood and qi burst forth from his body, almost becoming a substantial blood qi, blooming like a lotus flower.</p><p></p><p>Prison Lotus! </p><p></p><p>The Great Scenery Temple Prison Lotus Divine Meridian Technique! This was the divine meridian cultivation method that Li Che obtained from Cao Guang!</p><p></p><p>Now, he had taken a firm step forward, his martial dao had stepped into the divine meridian realm, and he could aspire to the Grandmaster realm! But Li Che did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>His finger sliced through the air, and the Shocking Spear shot out from his grip, dancing with the spear shadow like a blade of light! A surging wave of qi rushed howling through the courtyard!</p><p></p><p>The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Three-Blade Sword, this divine martial art that Li Che had mastered had become even more proficient, completely solidifying into a great accomplishment! He stood with the sword sheathed, and countless sword lights were slowly dissipating around him, the wooden chips on the ground shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Divine meridian, accomplished!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As one of the three major factions in the capital city of Jin Guang, the Fishing Faction had an extremely vast sphere of influence, almost the entire area along the Nine Dragon River.</p><p></p><p>The capital city was vast, with a large population, and there were many commoners who had come from the towns and lower-level cities outside the capital. They would all come to the Fishing Faction by the Nine Dragon River to seek work.</p><p></p><p>Because it was near the great river, the fish in the river were abundant, and the task of hauling and netting the fish and aquatic products was very labor-intensive, so there were a large number of workers coming here.</p><p></p><p>The Fishing Faction was the dominant force in this area, and even the Black Serpent Faction and the Beggar Faction could not match the Fishing Faction in this region.</p><p></p><p>The power structure in the capital city was always hierarchical, with the Fishing Faction being under the Five Great Families and Five Great Sects, and above the Fishing Faction were the Temple Guard, the Celestial Observatory, the Prefect's Office, and the Sect of the Divine. Above them was the Orthodox Sect of the Divine!</p><p></p><p>And below the Fishing Faction, there were also many small factions, such as the Black Snake Faction and the Hundred Million Gambling Den, all of which were subordinate to the Fishing Faction.</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall was the Fishing Faction's controlling force on the docks, not weaker than the Hundred Million Gambling Den, and even a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the grand courtyard where the White Wave Hall's hall master and many executives were located.</p><p></p><p>A piercing, agonizing scream echoed, and a thick bloody stench permeated and spread.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a middle-aged man with a hunched back walked out from the inner room, grabbing a woman by the hair and dragging her out, her entire body stripped of flesh and blood, already lifeless.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man threw the woman's body to the ground after dragging her out, took out a cloth to wipe the fresh blood on his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Old Mo, throw this woman's corpse into the Nine Dragon River to feed the fish."</p><p></p><p>The hunched middle-aged man said with a smile, revealing a mouthful of scarlet teeth.</p><p></p><p>An executive bowed respectfully and silently dragged the woman's corpse away.</p><p></p><p>"The necromancy of the Corpse Deity Sect is truly remarkable, I'm one step closer to the Grandmaster realm, and once I break through to the Grandmaster, I'll be able to squeeze into the upper echelons of the Fishing Faction."</p><p></p><p>The hunched middle-aged man sat in the armchair, picked up a cup of hot tea, and took a light sip.</p><p></p><p>The two deputy hall masters below began to congratulate him.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, hall master, recently... a lot of people under the Fishing Faction's control have died. The other day, the Hall Master of the Flowing Sand Hall was nailed to death in his house, and more than a dozen high-level warriors of the Flowing Sand Hall were all shredded to pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, the Pavilion Master of the Long Sea Pavilion had his head crushed..."</p><p></p><p>"Should we... be a little more restrained?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall masters said with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall's hall master drank some tea, chewed on the tea leaves to freshen his mouth, and sneered, "That Ox Demon, it's all that Ox Demon's doing... that self-proclaimed hero, the Ox Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"A dog-like thing, relying on his ability to appear and disappear, recklessly committing crimes..."</p><p></p><p>"According to intelligence, when this Ox Demon first appeared in Fei Lei City, he already proclaimed himself a hero..."</p><p></p><p>"In a small city he can still act like a hero, but in the capital city wanting to be a hero, what good result can he get?"</p><p></p><p>"In this era, if I don't kill these commoners, these commoners will also encounter other people, can this Ox Demon kill all of them? The evils in this era are countless, if he, the Ox Demon, doesn't like it, can he eliminate them all?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with me eating a person?!"</p><p></p><p>"If I don't eat, there are plenty of people who will!"</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall's hall master sneered.</p><p></p><p>"He thinks he's a hero by killing people recklessly? The Divine Guard and Temple Guard don't recognize him at all, the bounty on the notice board for him is even higher than the notorious pirate Gao Yang!"</p><p></p><p>The deputy hall masters became even more fearful: "Hall master, what you say is true..."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall's hall master narrowed his eyes: "What are you afraid of? Do you really think the Fishing Faction is a pushover? After killing so many high-level warriors under the Fishing Faction, the Grandmasters of the Fishing Faction have long been keeping an eye on him..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Guard and the powerful figures of the Temple Guard have also been chasing him."</p><p></p><p>"If he, the Ox Demon, dares to come and kill me, I only need to fight to the death to hold him back, and he, the Ox Demon, will not be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>The White Wave Hall's hall master had just eaten a woman, and the necromancy had a breakthrough, feeling that he was almost invincible.</p><p></p><p>He was in a state of breakthrough arrogance, where he felt that whoever came would be an even match.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he didn't get a response from the deputy hall masters beside him, and paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head...</p><p></p><p>But he seemed to have suddenly grown taller, able to overlook the crown of the deputy hall master's head.</p><p></p><p>His eyes rolled around, and he also saw a hunched figure with its head twisted off, a fountain of blood gushing from the neck.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this his own body?</p><p></p><p>Ah—! The White Wave Hall's hall master wanted to scream, but found that he couldn't make a sound, as if the heavens and earth had suddenly collapsed, turning into pitch black darkness.</p><p></p><p>Before he completely lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He only saw a cute ox-faced mask.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon?</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon!!!</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A golden monkey mask, with its fur flying wildly.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the face carried a touch of evil, arrogance, and domineering. The surge of emotions hitting one's face was enough to make one's mind reel.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the mask floating in the celestial chessboard in a daze.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene that appeared was almost like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The Flower Fruit Mountain... the divine ape facing the black clouds above the army of immortals and demons...</p><p></p><p>All the scenes seemed to be constantly overlapping and interweaving, like the mythological memories of the two realms.</p><p></p><p>What was real? What was false? Li Che found it hard to distinguish, for the scenes he had just witnessed would be considered mythological in this world.</p><p></p><p>Yet the inexplicable familiarity and overlap made his heart feel as if it was being gripped by an invisible hand.</p><p></p><p>What had befallen the temple gods of this world? Li Che took a deep breath and then exhaled, trying to calm himself down.</p><p></p><p>These were not matters he could concern himself with now.</p><p></p><p>His mind returned to the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he tried to manipulate the monkey mask, just as he would control the chess pieces on the board.</p><p></p><p>In the celestial chessboard of the [Chess Saint] Dao Guo, there were two extraordinary objects that were not chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>One was the Seven Element Corpse Curse Talisman, and the other was this monkey mask.</p><p></p><p>This mask... Li Che was quite familiar with it!</p><p></p><p>"Huh? It's not a temple god chess piece, but has become a 'temple god mask'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>He guided his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he felt an extremely terrifying suction force, trying to completely drain his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual awareness, which was eight times stronger than that of ordinary spiritual cultivators due to the eight great spiritual foundations he possessed, was on the verge of being sucked dry.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and touched his face, only to find that a furry mask was slowly forming and covering his face - it was the very monkey mask that had originally existed in the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>A sense of craziness, brutality, unwillingness, and anger... wave after wave of emotions seemed to be surging and gushing out from the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>"Qitian!"</p><p></p><p>A roar suddenly exploded in Li Che's ears, as if an ancient bell a thousand years old was suspended beside him and struck down heavily, the waves of its sound constantly echoing and assaulting him. Li Che abruptly cut off the spiritual input to the mask and forcefully suppressed the monkey mask that had emerged on his face, as if the fur had been pressed back into the pores.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Li Che found himself drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Divine Weapon: Qitian Mask]</p><p>[Craftsmanship: ???]</p><p>[Introduction: The remnant of a mythological weapon, the will of Qitian, an unyielding heart]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shimmering lights flashed before his eyes. The Plucking Star Pupils briefly introduced this mask.</p><p></p><p>The introduction was simple, not even mentioning the rank or grade of this mask, leaving Li Che quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But just from the name, Li Che knew that this mask was no ordinary thing - the Qitian Mask!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed, his heart stirring. However, having experienced many things, his inner self had become strong, allowing him to calm down.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because this Qitian Mask, in his current state, he could not control it, nor could he fully unleash its power. Just now, his spiritual awareness had almost been drained dry, and he could only barely activate this mask.</p><p></p><p>Yet the terrifying will transmitted from the mask in that fleeting moment had almost made Li Che's consciousness slip into slumber.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Che couldn't help but think about the hint in the introduction.</p><p></p><p>The remnant of a mythological weapon...</p><p></p><p>Indicating that this mask was not complete.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that there are other masks as well?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up at the mysterious temple's deity statues.</p><p></p><p>"Is it related to the division of the Qitian Temple's dao lineage into three?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered.</p><p></p><p>To gather the complete [Qitian Mask], he might need to visit the other two major dao lineages of the Qitian Temple besides the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that this [Fire-Eye Mysterious Awakening Ape God Temple] had appeared after the Heart Monkey Temple migrated from the Jinguang Prefecture, and the original Jinguang Prefecture only had that mysterious [Eight Extremes Guanyin Temple].</p><p></p><p>So Li Che had reason to guess that the remnant Qitian Mask should be related to the other two split dao lineages of the Qitian Temple - the Ruyi Sect and the Tiangang Tower, which were originally called the Ruyi Temple and the Tiangang Temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che made a mental note of this, and when he had the opportunity, he would go and take a look.</p><p></p><p>However, these two major powers were about as declining as the Heart Monkey Temple, incomparable to the prosperous Qitian Temple of the past.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was somewhat surprised that he had obtained such an opportunity in this mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>The mythological weapon...</p><p></p><p>Although it was only one of the remnant masks...</p><p></p><p>At least it gave him the chance to gather the complete mythological weapon! To revive the true mythological weapon!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is the reason for the decline of the Heart Monkey Temple - no one could wield and find this mask... The dao lineage may still exist, but it could not be sustained."</p><p></p><p>Li Che speculated.</p><p></p><p>And he, with the divine ability of the Plucking Star Pupils that could penetrate illusions and return to the truth, had precisely seen the will imprint left by the temple deity...</p><p></p><p>So he obtained this [Qitian Mask].</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his hand and touched the scorching hot Plucking Star Pupils on his brow.</p><p></p><p>Indeed...</p><p></p><p>Those who have connections can do as they please.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head and continued to look at the temple deity statue.</p><p></p><p>The main task was not done yet! Although he had obtained the Qitian Mask, the real purpose of his visit to the Mysterious Temple was to accumulate temple god chess pieces for himself! Under the gaze of the Plucking Star Pupils, there was no illusion this time.</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, Li Che looked at the situation outside, seeing that the incense burner was still burning, but the mysterious mist had become rampant, shrouding the temple entrance in the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at it briefly and then turned his attention to the incense burner, where three sticks of incense were burning.</p><p></p><p>During the time of the three sticks of incense, he had extracted nine temple god chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>Not a small number! After all, the current Li Che was far more powerful than when he faced the Lingying Temple outside Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>And with his divine ability having evolved into a spiritual form...</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Pupils' speed in extracting the temple god divine chess pieces was much faster than Qianxi's.</p><p></p><p>The nine black temple god chess pieces, with a few scarlet markings, appeared on the celestial chessboard and were a bit restless at first. But as if sensing something, they did not need Li Che to use the Undefiled Heart chess pieces to suppress them, and instead gathered obediently next to the [Qitian Mask].</p><p></p><p>Docile...</p><p></p><p>"Nine Eight Extremes Temple God Divine Chess Pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"It feels good to have the chess piece collection enriched like this."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, he sent out a Feilei chess piece, embedding it in the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the coordinates for easy access.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Che stood up and stretched.</p><p></p><p>Many of the wood carving masters who had been attracted by the temple deity statues snapped out of their trance as Li Che covered the celestial chessboard and cut off their line of sight.</p><p></p><p>The wood carving masters were still dazed and confused. </p><p></p><p>What had they just experienced? Weren't they just admiring the temple deity? Carefully examining the techniques, patterns, and craftsmanship on the deity statues, how did they suddenly feel like they had been tormented by countless monkeys?</p><p></p><p>Some wood carving masters felt like their spirits had been ravaged, and they were dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the wood carving masters regained his senses and noticed the mysterious mist shrouding the exit outside, and he couldn't help but scream in alarm.</p><p></p><p>The three sticks of incense had not yet burned out, how could the mist have blocked the way out?</p><p></p><p>How were they supposed to return?</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Pavilion... that was not something these third-rate guests could easily venture through.</p><p></p><p>If they really tried to break out, they might end up dead in droves.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the wood carving masters who were revealing their despair.</p><p></p><p>Most of these third-rate guests were at the spiritual foundation realm, with martial dao cultivation not even reaching the Grandmaster level, only at the Mysterious Vein.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in such an extremely dangerous place, they naturally felt hopeless.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up and walked towards the incense burner at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Since the abnormalities of this Mysterious Temple were related to him, he naturally had to step up and provide a way out for these wood carving masters.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che grabbed the incense burner as a cover.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he communicated with a temple god chess piece on the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>The simple communication was enough.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a razor-sharp blade had suddenly appeared in the heavens and earth, slicing horizontally, like cutting water with a drawn sword, parting the Mysterious Pavilion mist.</p><p></p><p>The mist and the Mysterious Pavilion slowly parted to the left and right.</p><p></p><p>The cursed temple guardians, whose bodies were covered in markings from the temple god's divine power, let out roars as they rushed from the mist, but before they could approach Li Che within ten zhang, they were repelled by the temple god's divine power.</p><p></p><p>A wide and spacious path reappeared before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... it seems this incense burner is still useful, hurry and leave, the incense is about to burn out."</p><p></p><p>Li Che said urgently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the wood carving masters were overjoyed, and in the face of a reprieve from a desperate situation, they all rushed out.</p><p></p><p>Following the path, they escaped the Mysterious Pavilion area.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli's face looked extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>"Qiyang Hao, you need to give us an explanation! You didn't take the summoning incense and go in, so why did you come out without it? If you knew the Mysterious Pavilion would erupt, why didn't you bring our guests from the Qintianjian out?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli was furious.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Pavilion was shrouded, and there was no way out.</p><p></p><p>Those guests... unless they fought their way out, they would be torn apart and transformed into temple guardians by the creatures spawned by the Mysterious Temple!</p><p></p><p>And those guests' strength, how could they possibly fight their way out? In her anger, Gong Yunli's face turned a little pale. Li Che was still inside! How was she going to report this to the Supervisor? This temple deity observation trip was mainly prepared for Li Che, but this happened.</p><p></p><p>Gongyang Chengcheng's expression was also difficult, but he did not voice any accusations.</p><p></p><p>He knew that at this moment, questioning would be futile.</p><p></p><p>And the eruption of the Mysterious Temple must have been sudden.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Qiyang Hao wouldn't have had to do this, as the relationship between the Temple Guard Office and the Qintianjian was quite good.</p><p></p><p>Qiyang Hao had already gathered a team of temple guards, and he himself was also checking the weapons and equipment, preparing to enter the Mysterious Pavilion and bring people back.</p><p></p><p>But how many people he could bring back was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>He didn't explain, because there was no need to.</p><p></p><p>He had taken the summoning incense to enter the Mysterious Pavilion, but the incense time was not up, yet the Mysterious Pavilion had shrouded and cut off the return path, and he had failed to warn those guests to leave.</p><p></p><p>He definitely had a share of the blame.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to shirk it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qiyang Hao's eyes narrowed as he was about to lead the temple guard team to enter the Mysterious Pavilion, but their movements also paused.</p><p></p><p>For they found that the Mysterious Pavilion had parted in two, revealing a wide and spacious passage.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw a stream of figures emerging from the passage.</p><p></p><p>They were the guests from the Qintianjian.</p><p></p><p>Qiyang Hao was stunned, but inwardly he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw Li Che, holding the summoning incense burner, walking at the end of the group.</p><p></p><p>After Li Che walked out, the Mysterious Pavilion closed again, and the howling cries of the temple guardians inside could be heard echoing back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli and Gongyang Chengcheng, seeing this scene, also couldn't help but feel relieved.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che come out safely, holding the summoning incense burner, their expressions also relaxed considerably.</p><p></p><p>They could guess the reason - Li Che had mustered the courage to pick up the summoning incense burner and reopened the path to get out.</p><p></p><p>Qiyang Hao's eyes flickered as he looked at Li Che holding the incense burner.</p><p></p><p>This summoning incense was not something anyone could just pick up.</p><p></p><p>This guest from the Qintianjian was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Due to the sudden accident, many guests were still shaken and did not dare to continue entering the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity observation was considered complete, and although most guests did not gain much, there were some who had observed the temple deity's spirit and gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Li Che, their gains were basically negligible.</p><p></p><p>The group bid farewell to Qiyang Hao and the other temple guards who were stationed at the Mysterious Temple in the icy and snowy land, and returned to the Heart Monkey Temple.</p><p></p><p>They were still blocked from entering the temple, but they didn't mind. After a brief rest, they headed back towards the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Che and Gong Yunli boarded the same carriage again.</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli brewed some hot tea and handed it to Li Che to help calm him down.</p><p></p><p>"Ache, have you gained anything? The harvest from observing the temple deity will help improve your wood carving skills."</p><p></p><p>"After you return to the capital city, it should be time for you to start the assessment for the second-rank guest official, which will be personally supervised by the personnel from the Qingtian Observatory in the provincial capital."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said, "During this period, you must practice your wood carving skills well and master the technique of carving the Thousand-Hand Deity."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rested his chin on his hand, looking out at the swirling snow outside the window, listening to Gong Yunli's chatter, but his mood was quite pleasant.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the mysterious temple had yielded too great a harvest.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he discover the stronghold of the Corpse God Cult, but he also obtained the "Face of the Sage of the Heavens", a mythical weapon, although it was only a fragment.</p><p></p><p>The complete mythical weapon was still waiting for him to assemble.</p><p></p><p>And it was related to the mysterious Qitian Temple Dao lineage, but the problem was not too big.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he would certainly have the opportunity to collect the complete set.</p><p></p><p>Li Che even looked forward to the complete Face of the Sage of the Heavens, wondering if it could... reproduce that figure's glory.</p><p></p><p>The carriage bumped and shook, tearing through the curtain of wind and snow, galloping on the snow-covered official road.</p><p></p><p>"The snow this year is a bit heavy, bordering on a snow disaster. I don't know how many more people will freeze to death and become refugees in this harsh winter," Gong Yunli sighed.</p><p></p><p>"In the face of nature, the power of humans is pitifully small."</p><p></p><p>Li Che also fell silent and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"This heavy snowfall this year is a bit abnormal."</p><p></p><p>"Is it related to the mysterious temple of the Third Prince?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli leaned his broad chest on the table, relieving some of the pressure, crossing his hands in front of him, as if he was beginning to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Supervisor, why do you say so?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said, "The Grand Supervisor of the Divine Capital has calculated the results, saying that the lineage of the mysterious temple of the Third Prince of Jingguan Prefecture will emerge this year, so there will be a big move this year. Many divine children have come to the Dao City, and even the Prince of Pacification has sent his son..."</p><p></p><p>"They are all trying to obtain the lineage of the Third Prince in this temple deity resonance event."</p><p></p><p>"This is the lineage of the mysterious temple of the Four Lords, which is absolutely extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, so it was related to the Grand Supervisor.</p><p></p><p>He just said that the mysterious temple of the Four Lords in Jingguan Prefecture had been standing for so many years, and the temple deity resonance had been opened so many times, but why was it so grand this time.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the mysterious temple of the Third Prince is at the level of the Four Lords, and there have always been many powerful figures paying attention to it. It's not that there is no divine embryo-level great deity guarding it, but because the mysterious temple of the Four Lords' Third Prince is still peaceful."</p><p></p><p>"Any mysterious temple of the Four Lords, the Grand Supervisor of the Divine Capital Observatory will be responsible for monitoring it, ensuring that strong experts can be dispatched to guard it at the first sign of any abnormality. If necessary, they may even dispatch great deities at the divine embryo realm."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli revealed a secret.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a secret.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled. The Grand Supervisor of the Observatory could actually monitor the mysterious temples from such a distant place?</p><p></p><p>After all, Jingguan Prefecture was more than ten thousand miles away from the Divine Capital.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was quite curious about how they could achieve such long-distance monitoring.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the carriage finally reached the city gate of Jingguan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, the carriage was blocked.</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored divine guards were deployed, lining up neatly, blocking all the carriages.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Che and the others, but even many passing caravan teams were blocked outside, temporarily unable to enter the city.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, through the wind and snow, a group of majestic demon-blood warhorses galloped over, with black-armored guards riding on their backs, escorting an ordinary carriage. The carriage driver, who had only one arm, sat quietly on the carriage, holding the reins.</p><p></p><p>"That is the carriage of the son of Prince of Pacification."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli leaned out the window, seeing the scene at the city gate.</p><p></p><p>"The prince's heir is indeed overbearing, just like the Prince of Pacification himself."</p><p></p><p>Gong Yunli said unhappily. To just enter the city, they were actually blocked, when the city gate was wide enough for ten carriages to pass through side by side.</p><p></p><p>But this young prince insisted on some special privilege and treatment.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, looking at the prince's carriage team.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the terrifying aura that had rushed through the dense forest, that crushing pressure like a collapsing mountain, the roar of a ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart sank slightly.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master! Very strong!</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, Li Che's hairs stood on end subconsciously.</p><p></p><p>He quickly mobilized the Dragon Elephant Golden Armor to suppress his aura.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the city gate, the Prefect Overseer Su Huai personally came out of the city to welcome the young prince, the son of the Prince of Pacification. Dressed in the Prefect's robe, he led the officials of Jingguan Prefecture to welcome the young prince.</p><p></p><p>For a prince's son to travel, it actually caused the officials of an entire prefecture to come out to welcome him, this was quite a grand scene.</p><p></p><p>But Su Huai was the junior disciple of Prince of Pacification Ye Molei, so many people could understand this.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Su Huai, but could not see any trace of the grief of having killed Fenglong Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He could only sigh that these people were inherently cold-blooded.</p><p></p><p>After much commotion, more and more carriages and horses gathered outside the city gate. Jingguan Prefecture was, after all, a prefectural city, with constant flow of merchant caravans and escort teams.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to complain, as they knew the one being welcomed was the famous and mighty Prince of Pacification's son, so everyone remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked out the window, through the hazy snow curtain, and saw the five-year-old boy in golden silk brocade clothes step out of the carriage.</p><p></p><p>The young boy had his hands behind his back, his youthful face carrying a hint of disdain and majesty, with a cold and arrogant aura.</p><p></p><p>Prefect Overseer Su Huai smiled and was followed by the heads of the major families in the prefecture, all coming forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>The young prince was very cold and indifferent towards everything.</p><p></p><p>His purple pupils flashed with light as he swept his gaze around, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there no divine children coming to welcome me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Huai smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>This young prince was just as domineering and overbearing as his teacher, having a deep obsession with suppressing his peers.</p><p></p><p>"The orthodox sect of Qianyan Immortal Sect has dispatched three divine children, who are currently on Jinguang Peak, sparring with the divine children and spirit children of the Jinguang Branch Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That's why they haven't come to welcome you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the young prince's brow gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I'll have a chance to go to Jinguang Peak later. I heard that Jingguan Prefecture has produced a four-year-old divine child this year, with extraordinary martial talent, having undergone blood refinement at the age of four... quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>"For a small Jingguan Prefecture to give birth to such a divine child is indeed not easy."</p><p></p><p>The young prince nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go to Jinguang Peak in a few days to recruit this girl."</p><p></p><p>"Since I've just arrived in Jingguan Prefecture, I don't have many divine children under my command, which is quite inconvenient for me."</p><p></p><p>Su Huai: "..."</p><p></p><p>The young prince was already used to being a 'divine child king', huh...</p><p></p><p>Wanting to become the 'divine child king' even after coming to Jingguan Prefecture? Su Huai couldn't help but smile, not even trying to oppose his intentions, his gaze flashing with a hint of amusement.</p><p></p><p>The young prince obviously knew that the Prince of Pacification didn't like Nanlihuo, so... this was just provoking him.</p><p></p><p>The carriage entered the city.</p><p></p><p>The commotion at the city gate gradually dissipated, and order began to return.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the carriage, with a gentle smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The little brat, daring to speak such arrogant words."</p><p></p><p>"Recruit my daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che's face was calm, in his heart he had already marked this young prince as "having a way to die" in his little notebook, and made a note.</p><p></p><p>The previous one recorded in his notebook was Fenglong Mountain...</p><p></p><p>Now he was already cold.</p><p></p><p>This young prince, congratulations, you're also on the list.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the small courtyard in Luohua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Phew—</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind howled like a tiger.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che returned, he began to practice, diligently cultivating every day, as diligence was the foundation of becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the cultivation of his qi and blood, after a long time, Li Che opened his eyes, his five fingers like hooks. He suddenly clenched them tightly, then released them, striking out towards the front, scattering all the snowflakes in the courtyard with the bursts of airflow! On his back, the qi and blood piled up and undulated, the great tendons trembling, as if there were the sounds of mountains collapsing and the earth cracking, like a furious dragon about to be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>His entire body trembled with his bones and muscles, each tremor bursting with airflow.</p><p></p><p>"Inhale—"</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath, his gaze sharp.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Coiling Dragons, the third qi and blood dragon is about to take shape."</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his pores, the hot air like the flow of a high-pressure cooker, gushing out with a hissing sound.</p><p></p><p>"But compared to the Grand Master, I'm still far behind."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>At the Grandmaster realm, refining the five viscera and six bowels, Li Che was cultivating one of the five viscera and six bowels with an unparalleled supreme art.</p><p></p><p>Forging an unprecedented and formidable true essence body.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his already incredibly powerful Furnace Grandmaster physique.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a clear direction for his future path to becoming a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Dragon Elephant, integrating various supreme arts, but when dispersed, each supreme art can be used to refine the five viscera and six bowels, and when gathered, it can unleash the power of the Dragon Elephant."</p><p></p><p>Li Che sat in the courtyard for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky had completely darkened, and Li Che's mood was quite good, having swept away the unpleasant emotions brought by that young prince coveting his daughter.</p><p></p><p>He followed the alley deeper, went to the small restaurant, packed some food, and then went straight back to Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned to the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>he saw the courtyard was brightly lit, and there were many children playing and frolicking.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Why was it so lively today?</p><p></p><p>Had Xixia lured another group of children back again?</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>many children's gazes immediately turned to him.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia's flushed little face was next to a stunningly beautiful little girl.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che, Xixia immediately let out a shrill scream, her little short legs stomping quickly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she leapt up like a cannon shell, flying towards Li Che.</p><p></p><p>However, she was easily caught by the collar of her clothes by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Then, the whole little girl was obediently held in Li Che's arms.</p><p></p><p>Xixia hugged Li Che's neck: "Father, you didn't come to see Xixia's great exploits today, it's really a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"Xixia was so powerful today!"</p><p></p><p>"I set off so many beautiful fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>"Father, you must come and see Xixia set off fireworks next time."</p><p></p><p>Xixia was very excited, gesturing wildly as she described her grand emperor-like deeds on the Jinguang Peak today.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Father, let me introduce my new boyfriend!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia shouted.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>Pinching Xixia's little chubby cheeks: "What boyfriend? Who taught you that?"</p><p></p><p>Who was it?

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wood materials were the leftover scraps he had brought back from the wood carving shop, just a small piece, and no one paid much attention when he brought it back.</p><p></p><p>The carving knife was the one he had specially made by the craftsman at the ironsmith's shop in the west of the city when he wanted to learn wood carving on his own years ago. It wasn't cheap to get the whole set, but now it was finally put to use.</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Guo pulsed with vitality, and a feeling as if aided by divine forces surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since this was just a trial run, Li Che did not choose to outline the form with ink lines, but directly started carving. With Dao Guo's assistance, Li Che felt that the sculpting of the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva Statue" was completely engraved in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had carved hundreds or thousands of Six-Eyed Bodhisattva wood carvings with Master Chen, becoming skillful through practice.</p><p></p><p>The control over every position of the wood material to be carved, the grasp of the spatial form from the outside to the inside, and the strength applied when striking the knife, all had their own mastery.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was his first time personally doing it, there was still some clumsiness. But this clumsiness between his fingers, the knife, and the wood gradually smoothed out as the carving progressed and his proficiency increased.</p><p></p><p>The knife techniques gradually became more graceful, even producing a unique charm, which was a manifestation of the maturity of the craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>Mature knife technique skills require continuous accumulation of experience.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che seemed to have, through [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Guo, touched the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva" and absorbed the knife technique experience that Master Chen had accumulated over the years, like a sponge.</p><p></p><p>The crisp sound of the sharp knife rubbing against the wood echoed.</p><p></p><p>The flickering oil lamp, the falling debris and scraps, in Li Che's palm, a palm-sized, angular "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva Statue" gradually took shape.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not polished, the edges and lines were extremely rough, but the form had already emerged in a divine, supernatural manner!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, who had just put Xixing to sleep, looked at Li Che, who had carved out the rough sculpture in just a moment, and was greatly amazed in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che immersed in the carving, Zhang Ya did not dare to disturb him, and could only suppress the curiosity in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She didn't sleep either, sitting by the bed, quietly watching Li Che focus on the carving under the oil lamp.</p><p></p><p>As she watched, her eyes became slightly dazed, the corners of her mouth curled up, and a joyful smile blossomed.</p><p></p><p>She thought her husband might have long since given up on wood carving, but she never imagined...</p><p></p><p>Her husband had never given up, he had been working hard to learn, and now... he was secretly giving her a surprise!</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if my husband can become a master wood carver, or at least an apprentice... then he won't have to work so hard every day to transport the heavy wood materials and carvings."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's wish was simple and down-to-earth, she just hoped her husband could earn the money to support the family without too much hardship.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, immersed in the carving, soon snapped out of it, because the Six-Eyed Bodhisattva statue had taken shape and no longer needed further carving, although it was not polished and not a finished product.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have a sense of awareness, his mind stirring.</p><p></p><p>[Immortal Craftsman (Lv1, 10%)]</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up, discovering that the [Immortal Craftsman] suffix on Dao Guo had increased slightly, like an experience gain.</p><p></p><p>"Does carving a wood sculpture increase my experience? Like a proficiency level?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, by touching the 'Six-Eyed Bodhisattva' wood carving, I've learned the sculpting technique of the Six-Eyed Bodhisattva statue, and successfully carving it has given me a 10% increase?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, this Dao Guo... can actually be understood as just a newly formed, but not yet mature fruit.</p><p></p><p>As he slowly nurtures it, he may be able to unlock the true power of the Dao Guo.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't bring any wood materials back, so he couldn't try it out immediately.</p><p></p><p>He could only suppress his curiosity, stand up and stretch, and then saw his wife Zhang Ya leaning against the bed, eyes closed in a light nap.</p><p></p><p>Li Che knew his wife was waiting for him to sleep together, and his heart warmed.</p><p></p><p>It was so cold outside, so he quickly blew out the oil lamp, pulled the startled wife into the quilt, and they snuggled in.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the heavy snow was falling, dropping onto the thick layer accumulated on the roof, making a soft sound.</p><p></p><p>It was perfect for falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Che went to Xu's Wood Carving Shop to work as usual.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen, can I take this scrap piece to practice with?"</p><p></p><p>During the break, Li Che approached Master Chen, looking at the "Flower Curve Willow" edge scraps that had been carved, and couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen, with wood chips clinging to his beard, glanced at Li Che: "Want to learn wood carving? You have a good heart, this is a good piece of material, but a bit old in age. However, it's good that you have this intention. The scraps I carve, you can just take them."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had been helping out at Master Chen's for a few years, so Master Chen's attitude towards him was naturally more lenient.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Delighted Li Che hurriedly thanked him, then began to select the waste materials that could be used for practice. Master Chen glanced over, let out a wry laugh, shook his head, and continued to focus on carving the "Nine Children Embracing Lotus" sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Li Che carefully packed the selected waste materials, wrapped them in a cloth, and placed them at his workstation. He then ran to the courtyard, using the excuse of adjusting the carved wooden sculpture to touch it.</p><p></p><p>The [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit trembled slightly. This time, he was touching a wood carving called "Spring Fills the Cosmos", which required extremely delicate carving skills and patience to depict the lifelike leaves and the essence of spring.</p><p></p><p>After touching it, a familiar feeling welled up in Li Che's heart.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he saw a female wood carver, holding a carving knife, engraving the vast world, her fingers controlling the cosmos, and the essence of spring blossoming vividly from the wood.</p><p></p><p>A flood of information about the techniques and skills of the "Spring Fills the Cosmos" wood carving surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was delighted, just like when he touched the "Six-Eyed Bodhisattva" statue, he had learned another wood carving technique.</p><p></p><p>However, when he touched other wood carvings, the Dao Fruit no longer reacted, indicating that there was a limit to the number of times he could learn per day.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Li Che studied the [Immortal Craftsman] Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Craftsman, with divine hands, had unparalleled skills! By touching the sculptures, he could learn wood carving techniques and skills, and each time he carved a new sculpture, his experience would increase by 10%. However, each sculpture could only provide one experience, which meant that Li Che needed to learn and carve ten different wood carvings to upgrade the Dao Fruit to level 2...</p><p></p><p>After understanding the use of the Dao Fruit, Li Che felt that the future held great promise!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Days passed by. </p><p></p><p>A month had quickly gone by.</p><p></p><p>Xixia had turned a month old, her lively eyes blinking curiously as she waved her chubby little hands in her swaddling clothes, observing the world.</p><p></p><p>Li Che held a rattle he had made himself, teasing Xixia, making the little girl giggle uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Xixia loved to laugh, and when she did, she had dimples just like her mother.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Zhang Ya was mending old clothes, watching the father-daughter interaction with tenderness and contentment in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, how is the matter of you wanting to become a master wood carver at the wood carving shop going?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Over the past month, Li Che had been carving all kinds of wood sculptures every night, leaving Zhang Ya dazzled and in awe, knowing her husband's skills were so exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Under her blind admiration, she even felt that her husband was far superior to the apprentices, and perhaps even the master carvers themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The shop owner said... I have to follow the rules and go through the wood carving skill assessment together with the students who paid to learn, and only if I pass can I join the shop and become a master carver," Li Che replied while entertaining Xixia, causing the little girl to reach out her hands to grab the rattle.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya nodded, firmly resolving, "I'm sure my husband can do it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, full of confidence and pride shining in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsman (Lv2, 8%)]</p><p></p><p>After a month of tireless touching of various wood carvings and carving late into the night, he had finally upgraded the Dao Fruit to level 2.</p><p></p><p>At level 2, the Immortal Craftsman Dao Fruit enhanced Li Che's artistic expression, allowing him to infuse his own strong artistic conception into the wood carvings he created.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Che's hand skills had become extremely proficient, with his five fingers becoming highly dexterous. Not only was he skilled in woodworking, but he also had the confidence to easily set up some intricate mechanical devices.</p><p></p><p>After playing with Xixia for a while, Li Che went out to work.</p><p></p><p>The snow had lessened, and winter was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>But the air was still bitterly cold and chilling.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out of the earthen house, a familiar figure approached in the distance, clenching a pipe between his teeth, brows furrowed, wearing a tattered scholar's robe over a large coat, hurrying along.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Li Che called out.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Xixia was a girl, under the influence of the male-biased thinking, the uncle had not come to see Xixia at all this past month, though the aunt had come once to bring some eggs for Zhang Ya to nourish herself.</p><p></p><p>"Che'er, you're going to work? That's good timing." The old scholar uncle's brows remained furrowed as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded, and then the old scholar uncle, still puffing on his pipe, hesitated for a moment before speaking, "Che'er, have you heard?"</p><p></p><p>"That midwife Lao Ah-po who helped with the delivery..."</p><p></p><p>"She's killed several babies..."</p><p></p><p>"They say... all the babies she's delivered, she's killed them!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

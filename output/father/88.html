        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Morning.</p><p></p><p>The warm sun of the winter day, rarely breaking through the dark clouds, sheds a fine and gentle light.</p><p></p><p>Under the eaves, the icicles formed by the winter rain begin to melt slightly in the sunlight, leaving only small ones the size of a little finger.</p><p></p><p>Ten miles outside Flashing Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>A bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the bamboo forest, there is a bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>This is a residence that Li Che found outside the city, relatively quiet and undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>At least, it should be enough for this period.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wore a black tight-fitting outfit, his clothes bulging with muscles, the dense veins like a python clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>The surging blood and qi formed rolling hot waves in the courtyard of the bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>Like a living, breathing blood python, it coiled and hissed.</p><p></p><p>The stomach churned, crushing and refining the Serpent Blood Warrior Pill he had swallowed, extracting the powerful medicinal power and refining it into true qi, circulating it through the small heavenly circulation meridians.</p><p></p><p>The five fingers clenched like hooks, and a sudden gust of wind arose, as if a white tiger was roaring behind Li Che!</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger Raging Wind Fist! This martial art technique, refined by Li Che to the Transformation Realm, has been further improved by him, becoming an excellent martial art with formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Each move is filled with the ferocious and murderous aura of the white tiger! The Eight-linked Bone-shattering Spear he obtained from the Xu family has also been refined by Li Che to the Transformation Realm, becoming an excellent martial art as well!</p><p></p><p>The LV3 [Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra] has greatly enhanced his martial arts talent! Not only can he refine peerless martial arts, but he also has a unique understanding of martial arts, as if he can grasp the essence after just a glance, and can basically master any martial art in a single day! This is the power of the LV3 Refining Talent! A martial art or skill goes through the stages of Mastery, Great Mastery, Grandmaster, and Transformation Realm, which can be understood as the degree of proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Transformation Realm, the power of the martial art reaches its peak. Beyond the Transformation Realm lies the true essence of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>This is what Li Qingshan told Li Che.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the true essence of the Martial Dao, the martial art must reach the "Pinnacle Martial Art" level.</p><p></p><p>Although the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist and the Xu family's Eight-linked Bone-shattering Spear have been refined by him to the level of excellent martial arts, they still lack the hope of cultivating the true essence of the Martial Dao and reaching the Pinnacle level.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, divine martial arts cannot cultivate the true essence of the Martial Dao, only pure blood qi martial arts can give rise to the true essence of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi gradually subsided, the crushed Warrior Pill slowly being digested.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into a surging energy, it strengthened Li Che's internal organs and gave rise to a dragon-like inner qi.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As Li Che practiced the martial arts, the movement of the qi and blood accelerated the release of the medicinal power of the Warrior Pill.</p><p></p><p>After completing the White Tiger Raging Wind Fist, Li Che clenched his five fingers, and the air silently tore apart, spitting out a strange long spear with blood-colored patterns engraved on it, the Nine Suns Pinnacle divine weapon, the Bloody Shocking Spear! With the divine weapon in hand, the swinging motion scattered fierce winds and surging qi! Amid the wailing, there seemed to be a piercing roar echoing through the mountains and forests! Even without divine power, the divine weapon's hardness, toughness, and sharpness far surpassed ordinary weapons.</p><p></p><p>As a blood python roared and burst out, the air rang out with eight consecutive shattering sounds, and Li Che put away the Bloody Shocking Spear.</p><p></p><p>"The last Serpent Blood Warrior Pill... should be enough. My Martial Dao cultivation has reached the peak of the Qi Vein Realm, my inner qi as mighty as a dragon. I only need the Mysterious Vein Technique to break through the next realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a turbid breath.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he opened his mouth and swallowed the last Serpent Blood Warrior Pill.</p><p></p><p>At this point, all the Warrior Pills obtained from the Yang family's treasure trove had been consumed, using up a fortune of tens of thousands of taels of resources, successfully pushing his cultivation to the peak of the Qi Vein Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the medicinal power of the last Warrior Pill was completely refined and absorbed by his physical body, the entire courtyard was filled with scorching qi and surging heat waves.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, his gaze shining.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of my physical body is now solid. Even without activating the Wrathful Golden Vajra, I can easily defeat ordinary Mysterious Vein martial artists..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can now attempt to forge the Three-eyed Wrathful True Lord Divine Foundation..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>To forge the divine foundation, it ultimately requires more than just a passionate heart.</p><p></p><p>According to the divine foundation technique imparted by the temple deity, many things need to be prepared. It is more akin to a ritual.</p><p></p><p>Li Che compared the Shocking Forceful Divine Foundation technique he obtained from the Yang family's ancestor, and aside from the different preparation materials, the ritual is the same.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is the need to prepare three divine objects, such as wooden carvings, jade carvings, or scrolls. But it is recommended to use wooden carvings, preferably from spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>In the Yang family ancestor's collection, there is a wooden block made of a spiritual wood called "Spiritual Flower Willow", which, although not as valuable as the "Blood Flesh Red", is much cheaper in price.</p><p></p><p>As for the design of the wooden carving, the divine foundation technique also provides a template.</p><p></p><p>Li Che himself is a master wood carver, so this is not a difficult task. As for the other three sacrificial animals and their blood, it only requires time to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Gathering his blood qi and only revealing his refined and perfected Tempering Bone cultivation, Li Che changed into a clean black outfit, graceful and gentle, grasped the Flashing Thunder chess piece, and returned to the set anchor point, the study in his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Today is a big event in Flashing Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>It is the day when City Lord Cao Guang holds a banquet at the Golden Brilliance Pavilion for the Divine Sect's Recruitment Envoy. All the major families and clans of Flashing Thunder City will bring their spiritual children to be evaluated by the Divine Sect's Recruitment Envoy, hoping they can be recruited into the sect.</p><p></p><p>In previous years, in addition to the Divine Sect's recruitment of spiritual children, the Great Scenery Dynasty's official authorities would also recruit them. However, with the expansion of the Mysterious Temple's calamity, the court has abandoned the recruitment of spiritual children in various places, leaving it to the major families and clans to cultivate them on their own. The Divine Sect, on the other hand, has not given up and often sends recruitment envoys.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful families may even hide their talented spiritual children, but most of the smaller families and common households are hoping their children can enter the Divine Sect and change their fate.</p><p></p><p>The status of the Divine Sect in the hearts of the Great Scenery commoners is truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, how many spiritual children Flashing Thunder City will have this year is unknown.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the inner room, his wife Zhang Ya was braiding Xixia's hair.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, Li Che, along with his wife Zhang Ya, who had finished dressing up, took Xixia and went out.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and LÃ¼ Chi had already gone to the Golden Brilliance Pavilion, as they were representatives of the Divine Sect and naturally could not travel with Li Che's family.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was not idling either, carrying his large wine gourd, following behind, intending to join the lively crowd as well.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the alley, the elder brother's family, who had also moved to the inner city, was already waiting in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother was still wearing his scholar's robe, with a cotton-padded jacket over it, puffing on a dry tobacco pipe.</p><p></p><p>Cousin Li Zhengran's family was waiting nearby. Li Che's nephew Li Chengzhou was already three years old, more tranquil than Xixia, with a fair and delicate appearance, already showing signs of handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che's family, Cousin Li Zhengran immediately showed a smile. Thanks to Li Che's help, his family was living extremely well in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xixia came out of the alley, she broke free from Li Che's hand and ran to Li Chengzhou's side.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Chengzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia familiarly took Li Chengzhou's hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Chengzhou's fair face instantly turned bright red, and he was a little flustered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you look so good." Xixia stared at Li Chengzhou.</p><p></p><p>Li Chengzhou instinctively struggled a bit, retreating towards his mother-in-law Liu Chunmeng.</p><p></p><p>"Chengzhou, don't be afraid. Sister is just playing with you." Liu Chunmeng quickly comforted him.</p><p></p><p>Xixia didn't mind, smiling and approaching.</p><p></p><p>Li Che paused for a moment, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>This girl... She's already a face-ist at such a young age? The way she treats LÃ¼ Daitou is not like this at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Che pursed his lips, suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute, could it be that the blonde one is my daughter? Along the way, the originally frightened inner city residents, who had not dared to go out much due to the Yang family's extermination, were now gathering, all carrying children and heading towards the Golden Brilliance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the Golden Brilliance Pavilion, the outside was crowded with people.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan had already arranged for LÃ¼ Chi to wait outside, and when he saw Li Che's group, he led them into the Golden Brilliance Pavilion and seated them at a table covered in red cloth.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there so many people?" Li Che was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The number of children in Flashing Thunder City... seems to be more than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Che had originally thought that after the Spiritual Infant Calamity incident, the number of children in Flashing Thunder City would have decreased greatly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xixia holding Li Chengzhou's hand, LÃ¼ Chi's expression was not very good. He seemed to have never received such treatment before.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Che's words, LÃ¼ Chi shook his head with his Nezha-style hairstyle and said, "Don't be fooled by the large number of children. There are actually very few spiritual children..."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Infant Calamity only wants spiritual children. If they are not spiritual children, the Spiritual Infant Calamity won't even look at them."</p><p></p><p>LÃ¼ Chi's words were simple and direct.</p><p></p><p>The group sat down to eat the banquet, which was set up by City Lord Cao Guang using public funds, so Li Che ate quite happily. Although he had amassed a huge fortune from the Yang family, there is a different kind of joy in freeloading.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet was half over, City Lord Cao Guang gave a brief speech, and then Li Qingshan stood up, his gaze sweeping across the Golden Brilliance Pavilion and the bustling crowd outside.</p><p></p><p>He saw many curious children blinking their eyes, and some even brought their infants in swaddling clothes, hoping to try their luck.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingshan remained impassive and said calmly, "Next year, in the second month during the Spring Equinox, the Qianyuan Divine Sect will open its doors to recruit spiritual children. All children under the jurisdiction of the Jinhuang Prefecture who are three years old or above, and are tested to be spiritual children, can enter our Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In the second month of the Spring Equinox next year, the recruitment examination will be held in the Jinhuang Prefecture cities, divided into outer and inner disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's voice, though not loud, resounded throughout the Golden Brilliance Pavilion and beyond, reaching the ears of almost everyone.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the crowd began to stir.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, in addition to spiritual children, those with good martial arts aptitude can also obtain the opportunity to go to the prefecture city and participate in the recruitment examination."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan added.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan slightly shook his head. He glanced at the smiling city lord Cao Guang, whose expression remained unchanged as he continued to smile.</p><p></p><p>"Children aged three and above can enter the Golden Brilliance Pavilion. This old man will take a look and assess whether they are spiritual children and have the innate talent. Those who do not meet the requirements should not enter the pavilion," Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, City Lord Cao Guang waved his hand, and the divine constable Zhang Xiangyang immediately went to arrange for the children who met the requirements to enter the Golden Brilliance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings grew quiet.</p><p></p><p>"This old man will use the 'Observing Nature' technique of the Divine Ancestor to observe them. Those with the spiritual nature of a spiritual child will emit purple light. One purple light is low-grade, three purple lights are mid-grade, six purple lights are high-grade, and nine purple lights are the supreme spiritual children," Li Qingshan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Dear parents, please pay attention. The Divine Ancestor's selection of spiritual children is fair and just."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Qingshan's words fell, Cao Guang's expression changed slightly, and the smile on his face stiffened, becoming somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan was obviously doing this on purpose. Historically, the Divine Ancestor's selectors would secretly choose the spiritual children using the Observing Nature technique, but Li Qingshan insisted on making a big fuss, clearly wanting to embarrass Cao Guang.</p><p></p><p>After all, most of the spiritual children in Feilei City had been taken away by the Spiritual Infant Sect. The remaining ones were not true spiritual children. When the Observing Nature technique was used, the result would likely be only one or two spiritual children, which would be embarrassing and awkward for the city lord Cao Guang.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingshan did not pay attention to Cao Guang's expression. "Since you dare to do it, what face do you have left?" he said. "Everyone, please watch carefully."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Li Qingshan formed a hand seal, and his eyes were instantly filled with a purple glow. A surging spiritual aura swept out, permeating the entire Golden Brilliance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked around in amazement.</p><p></p><p>However, only four faint purple lights flickered in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>How could there be so few? There were at least hundreds, if not thousands, of children present, but only four purple lights appeared? Although Cao Guang knew the result, he still unconsciously looked towards the places where the purple lights had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the four purple lights all converged on one table.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's expression changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>First, he saw Xixie, with nine brilliant purple lights, the aura of a supreme spiritual child.</p><p></p><p>A supreme spiritual child?! Cao Guang had always thought Xixie was only high-grade, but he was mistaken.</p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier that Li Wanxie, Li Qingshan's daughter, was a supreme spiritual child, he would have certainly taken action before Li Qingshan's arrival!</p><p></p><p>A supreme spiritual child... is the best sacrifice!</p><p></p><p>And beside Li Wanxie, there was also an extremely dazzling light, not weaker than the nine purple lights.</p><p></p><p>Another supreme spiritual child?!</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's expression darkened. Under his very nose, he had missed two supreme spiritual children?</p><p></p><p>However, his gaze shifted.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang's expression stiffened as he saw the nine flickering purple lights under which Li Yue was heartily eating.</p><p></p><p>This twenty-two-year-old old man... can also be considered a spiritual child?!</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere of the scene seemed a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Many people had also noticed the purple lights flickering around Li Yue.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Observing Nature technique make a mistake? How can Master Li also have the purple lights that only spiritual children possess, and nine of them at that?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, doesn't the spiritual nature have to be newly nurtured? After someone reaches adulthood, the spiritual nature originally from heaven and earth is assimilated, so they can no longer be considered spiritual children."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Master Li just became a master woodcarver, and his newly born spiritual nature...?"</p><p></p><p>The murmurs and discussions around them were endless.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue had a somewhat helpless expression on his face. His identity as a twenty-two-year-old spiritual child had finally been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan hadn't mentioned this part, had he?</p><p></p><p>Regarding the doubts raised by many present, Li Qingshan said with absolute confidence that the Divine Ancestor's Observing Nature technique could not be wrong.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Li Yue truly possessed the spiritual nature of a spiritual child.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Xu family and Xu Heli and the others looked at Li Yue with strange expressions. A twenty-two-year-old spiritual child... this was as difficult as a twenty-two-year-old virgin!</p><p></p><p>However, their gaze was more focused on Li Wanxie.</p><p></p><p>A supreme spiritual child...</p><p></p><p>The Xu family had misjudged!</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier that Xixie was a supreme spiritual child...</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Xu family's breathing became slightly heavier, and his gaze grew more intense.</p><p></p><p>The difference between a supreme and high-grade spiritual child was almost heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Li Yue and Xixie, the other two purple lights came from LÃ¼ Chi and Li Chengzhou.</p><p></p><p>LÃ¼ Chi was a high-grade spiritual child, while Li Chengzhou... had only one purple light, a low-grade spiritual child, but still a spiritual child.</p><p></p><p>A fish that had slipped through the net under the city lord's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This made City Lord Cao Guang unable to resist glancing at Li Chengzhou a few more times, surprised that he was also related to Li Yue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, City Lord Cao Guang felt a sense of bad luck.</p><p></p><p>"You who possess the spiritual nature of a spiritual child can definitely enter the gates of our Divine Ancestor. In February next year during the Spring Equinox, the Golden Light Prefecture City will hold an entry examination. As spiritual children, you must enter the Divine Ancestor, and this examination will be more about the assignment of your disciple status."</p><p></p><p>"As for the others who only meet the requirements of martial dao talent, they will need to stand out in the entry examination to be selected, and there is a possibility of being eliminated."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan gathered the selected spiritual children together and briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Qiankun Jade shook, and jade tokens floated out, falling towards the chosen spiritual children.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue also happily received one.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at him but did not say much. He had to accept the spiritual children he had painstakingly selected.</p><p></p><p>"This is the low-grade Qiankun Jade, which contains the essence of heaven and earth and can be used to store and retrieve items, but it requires a certain guidance period. It is the proof of your identity as a spiritual child of our Divine Ancestor. When you enter the Golden Light Prefecture, you can use this token to participate in the entry examination."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there is also a 'Nurturing Pill' bottle with ten pills. Take one every five days to accelerate your cultivation, and a Turtle Dragon Martial Pill, to stabilize your foundation and nourish your qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Yue's eyes lit up. Spiritual children... also have these benefits?</p><p></p><p>He happily scanned the contents of the Qiankun Jade.</p><p></p><p>Li Yue's smile grew even more radiant.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people looked at him strangely, but Li Yue was very calm. He had earned these things through his own merits, so why should he feel guilty?</p><p></p><p>As for those who only passed the martial dao talent requirement, Li Qingshan was not as generous, only giving them the identity token and then sending them away. After all, among these children, he did not find any exceptional talents that caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>The banquet ended.</p><p></p><p>Many of the familiar woodcarvers from the Xu Woodcarving Shop came over.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Master Li! Your daughter and you are both certified as spiritual children!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, congratulations, congratulations! Now that you have entered the Divine Ancestor, you will soar to new heights!"</p><p></p><p>"A family of two geniuses, two supreme spiritual children, truly a wonderful story!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yue greeted these former colleagues who had come to congratulate him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand and announced that tonight at the Golden Brilliance Pavilion, he would be hosting a banquet of one hundred tables for his daughter, with no red packets required, and all guests were welcome.</p><p></p><p>Celebrating his daughter Li Wanxie's entry into the Divine Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, under the eight-cornered eaves of the city lord's mansion, Cao Guang stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the brightly lit and lively Golden Brilliance Pavilion. The darkness of the night had swallowed the light, making his expression uncertain and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, light footsteps sounded from behind him. It was Cao Qingyuan and Cao He.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yue's daughter... actually turned out to be a supreme spiritual child! We misjudged... we trusted the Xu family's assessment too much."</p><p></p><p>"It's normal. It's very difficult to distinguish a supreme spiritual child from a high-grade one without the Divine Ancestor's Observing Nature technique. Relying only on experience to judge, it's easy to get confused."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Cao He, the second young master of the Cao family, narrowed his eyes, and a ruthless glint flashed across his aged face. "Do you need me to take action? Personally go and abduct that Li Wanxie?"</p><p></p><p>"I know Li Qingshan is there, but I'll only abduct the spiritual children. If it doesn't work, I'll just leave."</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang was somewhat tempted. The allure of a supreme spiritual child was truly too great. As for Li Yue, the twenty-two-year-old supreme spiritual child, Cao Guang still had doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What man's shelf life could be this long?</p><p></p><p>So the one who attracted him more was Li Wanxie.</p><p></p><p>But he still held back.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, with Li Qingshan there, even if his martial dao is not at its peak, he is still a martial dao master... There's no need to provoke him."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan won't stay in Feilei City for long. He still needs to go to other cities to recruit spiritual children."</p><p></p><p>"The Li family will certainly follow him."</p><p></p><p>"For now, don't create any trouble. Be steady, the smooth holding of the Thousand Buddha Carving Feast is the most important. Wait until they leave... If I miss the supreme spiritual child, so be it. No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Qingyuan, how is the task I gave you?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Qingyuan respectfully cupped his fists. "Father, I have successfully brought back two mid-grade spiritual children from the neighboring city. The spiritual children's blood and bones have been gathered..."</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Since the spiritual children's blood and bones have been gathered, when Li Qingshan leaves Feilei City, the Thousand Buddha Carving Feast can begin..."</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Cao Guang's eyes gleamed with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, heavy breathing, mixed with greed, ambition, and anticipation, rose and fell between the eight-cornered eaves.</p>

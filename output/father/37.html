        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having just obtained the third Dao fruit, the capital for establishing his position in this world has increased further, naturally making his mood extremely pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Snow drifted along the long street.</p><p></p><p>Because Xixis birthday fell in the depths of winter, every time Xixi's birthday approached, there would be heavy snow accompanying it.</p><p></p><p>The biting cold pierced the bones, but now Li Che, having attained the great accomplishment, with his robust qi and blood, naturally had no fear of the cold.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Che's scalp tingled, and the Dao fruit [Untainted Heart] he had just obtained throbbed in his chest.</p><p></p><p>Li Che halted his step, his brows furrowing.</p><p></p><p>That was a feeling... of being watched.</p><p></p><p>The face under the wide-brimmed hat suddenly looked up, and in the distance on the snowy street, he saw an old man leading a child with a Nezha braid, staring fixatedly at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che immediately felt puzzled, as there were people coming and going on the street, why would this old man be staring solely at him, it couldn't be that he had his eyes on the pork in Li Che's hand, right?</p><p></p><p>Li Che also looked back, and saw the old man leading the Nezha-braided child shift his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Finding this strange, Li Che's heart immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Che only felt alert, and apart from avoiding the old man and continuing on his way until he was far away, the old man did not make any move.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then relaxed, feeling that he had been too cautious, almost making a note of this old man.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master? What's wrong?" LÃ¼ Chi noticed his master's unusual behavior and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The old man closed his eyes, dispersing the [Observing Nature Technique], shaking his head with a deep sense of regret and pain.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity... truly a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Flawless and untainted, pure as water, like a blank white paper..."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there is actually such a pure and pristine newborn divine nature..."</p><p></p><p>"This divine nature has extremely strong plasticity, but alas... the one who possesses such divine nature is a young man, and he is merely an opening-meridian martial artist, his age is ultimately too old."</p><p></p><p>"A spiritual child in his twenties? How strange."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual children and infants cultivate divine nature differently from ordinary martial artists. They are naturally endowed with divine nature, so from the very beginning they can step into [Nurturing Nature], nourishing their own divine nature. By the time they reach adulthood, most of them can attain the level of 'nurturing nature like a lantern', and then have the possibility of breaking through to the divine foundation before the age of thirty, with the hope of condensing the divine form before the age of sixty..."</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head, he had used the Observing Nature Technique to see the pure white divine nature in Li Che, and it had truly stirred his heart.</p><p></p><p>But alas, the divine nature was not in the body of a young child, but in that of a rough-looking man.</p><p></p><p>"He's a bit too old, and his martial cultivation is only at the opening-meridian level, far from a blood transformation. Before the age of thirty... it will be a bit difficult for him to forge the divine foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Such divine nature, what a waste."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back at the Xu Family Woodcarving Workshop, Li Che's mind was still pondering that old man.</p><p></p><p>It was very strange, vaguely giving him a strong sense of crisis, the warning from the Dao fruit was certainly not without reason.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately... Li Che had always been one to prioritize peace in his dealings with others, and nothing chaotic had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Feiluo City is becoming increasingly chaotic, with various forces and all kinds of experts... emerging one after another."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, Xixi was under Xu You's guidance, nurturing her divine nature.</p><p></p><p>"Xixi is a spiritual child, with abundant divine nature. Learning to nurture it early and laying a good foundation will benefit her future. For divine cultivators, the age nodes are crucial."</p><p></p><p>Xu You, dressed in white robes with a sword at his waist, saw Li Che returning and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Ahe, the workshop has organized a defense squad, all composed of the woodcarving masters. You also need to participate in the patrols. I've arranged the shifts for each woodcarving master, separating yours and Old Chen's, so as to ensure Xixi's safety."</p><p></p><p>If both Li Che and Old Chen were to leave at the same time, there would be no guarantee of Xixi's safety, which was why Xu You had made this arrangement.</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>Xu You and Li Che walked side by side, patrolling the snow-covered alleys of the Xu Family Estate, safeguarding and protecting the safety of the families of the many woodcarving masters living within.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had a long spear on his back, the martial art he openly cultivated being the "Xu Family Eight Shattering Bone Spear". Now that he had appropriately displayed his cultivation, reaching the opening-meridian level and mastering the spear technique, he had earned the reputation of a "prodigy" in the Xu Family.</p><p></p><p>Two years of martial arts training, from polishing hides to reaching the opening-meridian level, his achievements were indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, the Yang Family's estate in the outer city, set up by the Yang Family in the inner city woodcarving workshop, was breached by the ruffians of the Spiritual Infant Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, gazing at the dark sky and speaking in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart trembled, this news was actually unknown to him.</p><p></p><p>"The ruffians of the Spiritual Infant Sect... so rampant?" Li Che asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"There are many experts in the Spiritual Infant Sect. After being driven out of the inner city, they have been stationed in the outer city, and now they have set their sights on the spiritual children of the various families in the outer city... Several woodcarving masters in the Yang Family estate were killed, and a spiritual child in the estate was plundered and taken away."</p><p></p><p>Xu You's five fingers tightened, the veins on his hand standing out.</p><p></p><p>"Because... there is news that a cultivator from the Divine Sect has descended to Feiluo City."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Infant Sect must act before the cultivator from the Divine Sect sets foot in Feiluo City, otherwise... the truly good seedlings will certainly be taken away by the Divine Sect cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"So, in these days, the Spiritual Infant Sect... has completely gone mad."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu Family in the inner city... will not dispatch strong</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to defend the outer city?" Li Che frowned and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Xu You fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family shop in the inner city..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big problem, we can fend them off on our own..." Xu You forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che saw a hint of indignation and helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inner city of Feilei, at the Golden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew through the hall, causing the curtains to sway.</p><p></p><p>A figure bent over, walking respectfully along the corridor, and soon arrived at a suspended pavilion within the Golden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the pavilion, a brazier was boiling water.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai sat in a chair, and beside him was a beautiful woman in light makeup, gracefully brewing tea and displaying her tea art.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, Zhao Chuanxiong has arrived."</p><p></p><p>A low voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Zhao Chuanxiong, dressed in casual clothes with a sword at his waist, stepped into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Simo, I don't know what you have summoned me for?" Zhao Chuanxiong said with a fawning smile, appearing rather subservient.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a court official, he was only the captain of the outer city guards, and naturally had little confidence when facing the young master of the Simo family's main branch.</p><p></p><p>"I heard... you've fought with the Ox Demon and survived?" Simo Bai said indifferently as he sipped the tea brewed by the beautiful tea artist.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong was taken aback upon hearing this, never expecting Simo Bai to summon him to discuss this topic.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he had originally approached the Ox Demon in the identity of the vice-sect leader of the Spirit Infant Sect, and fought alongside the Eight Trigrams Staff expert against the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Did Simo Bai know his identity? Zhao Chuanxiong was startled, his face twitching.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, your identity is no longer a secret, not just yours... I know the identities of many within the Spirit Infant Sect," Simo Bai said with a faint smile as he played with the jade tea cup.</p><p></p><p>"I have a cooperation with your sect leader, and I have shown sincerity, so your sect leader should also show sincerity. He has promised to give me a second-tier [Spiritual Carving], but I need a spirit child as the medium..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's expression darkened: "Young Master Simo, are you asking me to find another spirit child from the outer city to bring here?"</p><p></p><p>"But Young Master, the spirit infants and spirit children in the outer city have basically been depleted these past two years. The remaining children have very poor spiritual aptitude, completely ordinary and useless."</p><p></p><p>"Just recently, even the spirit child from the Yang family manor was taken away..."</p><p></p><p>"So to find another spirit child would take some time, or even wait for a new batch of infants to be born before I can confirm one."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai: "Isn't there still a top-grade spirit child in the Xu family woodcarving shop?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Chuanxiong immediately thought of Li Che, and how a sect disciple had died because of the top-grade spirit child who had the three-headed, six-armed, fierce-eyed spirit statue carved by the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... the daughter of the woodcarver Li Che from the Xu family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong tentatively said.</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai played with the tea cup, his expression cold and indifferent: "Are there any other top-grade spirit children?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's face twitched: "I suspect that the villain Ox Demon may be related to the Xu family."</p><p></p><p>"I..." </p><p></p><p>Simo Bai waved his hand: "You don't need to say more, I know what you're afraid of..."</p><p></p><p>"This past year, you've been reclusive and never go out alone, all to avoid the Ox Demon, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, you used the widow of that Sun Zhangbiao as bait to lure the Ox Demon to kill, so you've also fought with the Ox Demon. After the Eight Trigrams Staff expert died, you were frightened..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong wasn't embarrassed, as for the sake of survival, what was there to be embarrassed about? And look at that Eight Trigrams Staff expert, now he no longer had the capital to be embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the Ox Demon's multiple attacks, he seems to have a grudge against the Spirit Infant Sect. Moreover, he also has some connection to the Xu family."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon, most likely came from within the Xu family."</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai leaned back in the yellow pear wood armchair, tapping his long fingers on the table.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also curious... who in the Xu family is this Ox Demon? </p><p></p><p>"Able to freely come and go between the inner and outer cities, and has reached the realm of Bone Refining Perfection... It can't be Xu Heli, nor Xu Beihu, and as for the third young master of the Xu family, it's even less likely..."</p><p></p><p>"Whoever it is, except for him."</p><p></p><p>Simo Bai's gaze was both sorrowful and mocking as he looked at Zhao Chuanxiong.</p><p></p><p>"You take care of this matter, and I'll eliminate the Ox Demon for you."</p><p></p><p>"Since that Ox Demon is so eager to kill you... then let him come and kill you."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong's face darkened, his heart somewhat tempted! If he could really get rid of the Ox Demon, he would indeed be able to live without constantly worrying.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon must die, otherwise he would truly have no peace, the gruesome death of the Eight Trigrams Staff expert was still vividly imprinted in his mind, like a nightmare! Zhao Chuanxiong's gaze flickered...</p><p></p><p>But he still had some trepidation...</p><p></p><p>After all, Simo Bai's so-called "eliminating the Ox Demon"...</p><p></p><p>Was essentially using him as bait! No, it was using him to fish the Ox Demon! He had hidden for so long, and now he was afraid that...</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't catch the Ox Demon, he, the bait, would be the one eaten first!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

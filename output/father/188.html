        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kill her!</p><p></p><p>Kill her!!</p><p></p><p>The voice grew louder, exploding thunderously in his ears. Young Master Ji Haiwei's whole body trembled, and the icy and frenzied killing intent burst forth from his dragon-like purple eyes! Kill her...</p><p></p><p>Then I can inherit the legacy! I won't disappoint my father the king!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's mind was buzzing incessantly, his body shaking uncontrollably as he gripped the Four Divine Weapons - his trump card to suppress the various divine children at this temple deity resonance assembly.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Divine Sword of the Infernal Lotus...</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Weapons!</p><p></p><p>The Yin Divine Sword and the Yang Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>The Yin Divine Sword was obtained by his father from another mysterious temple of the Four Divine Weapons, and he was informed that the Yang Divine Sword was hidden in the "Furious Three-Headed Infernal Lotus Prince" temple within the Golden Light Manor!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's other purpose in coming here was to use the Yin Divine Sword to attract the Yang Divine Sword, to achieve the merger of the Yin-Yang Divine Swords! To gather the complete Infernal Lotus Yin-Yang Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>Gripping this sword, there was no response at all - this Four Divine Weapon seemed to completely disregard him, not exhibiting any divine power.</p><p></p><p>When Ji Haiwei first obtained this sword, he had harbored ambitions.</p><p></p><p>He had fantasized that perhaps he could gain the recognition of this Four Divine Weapon and become its master.</p><p></p><p>Then his future would be secure. </p><p></p><p>He would even be qualified to inherit the position of the Pacifying King, replacing his father.</p><p></p><p>Alas, this Yin Divine Sword was indifferent to him.</p><p></p><p>Even... somewhat disdainful.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Everything has taken a turn! Ji Haiwei gripped the Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword tightly, the resounding voice in his ears making his mind tremble, greatly stirring him.</p><p></p><p>It seems...</p><p></p><p>He has gained the favor of the temple deity!</p><p></p><p>"Kill her..."</p><p></p><p>"Kill Li Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the temple deity's test for me!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei couldn't help but let the corners of his lips curl up.</p><p></p><p>The temple deity... is completely in line with his wishes.</p><p></p><p>Because Ji Haiwei harbors the intent to kill Nuanxi, he will show her no mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the temple deity's resonance?"</p><p></p><p>"The temple deity wants me to kill Li Nuanxi, and I... also want to kill Li Nuanxi."</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental."</p><p></p><p>"A resonance on the spiritual level!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei held the Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword diagonally, as the sword was too long and he had to tilt it up to ensure the tip wouldn't tear the ground as he walked.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, the mysterious mist rolled. Footsteps echoing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was hugging the gold brick, eyes shining with delight! Nuanxi didn't understand why a huge gold brick had appeared in front of this mysterious temple - this big gold brick could buy so much braised pork trotters!</p><p></p><p>Believing that anything appearing in this mysterious temple was her destiny,</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi didn't hesitate.</p><p></p><p>The gold brick was very heavy, and at first Nuanxi used all her strength but couldn't budge it.</p><p></p><p>However, the little gun in her arm suddenly trembled, and a purple flame coalesced, wrapping around her arm.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi then found that she could pick up the gold brick!</p><p></p><p>Although it was still very heavy, at least she could lift it.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The purple flame continuously wrapped around, as if burning the gold brick.</p><p></p><p>Slowly...</p><p></p><p>The gold brick began to melt.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was still happily playing, when she was suddenly surprised to find that the gold brick was melting like ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>The flowing golden liquid actually wrapped around Nuanxi's arm...</p><p></p><p>Turning her other arm into a shimmering golden color! "Aiya - my golden brick!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"Nuanxi's braised pork trotters!"</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi panicked.</p><p></p><p>All those braised pork trotters, it seemed they would be gone!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's mood became extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Looking at her arm that had turned golden, Nuanxi puffed out her cheeks - she couldn't very well just chop off her golden arm to buy the braised pork trotters, right? Nuanxi spread out her hands.</p><p></p><p>The little gun was hidden in her left hand, and the little brick in her right.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's brain exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him..."</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Nuanxi closed her eyes, shaking her head repeatedly, as if trying to shake the noisy voice out of her mind.</p><p></p><p>Clear footsteps resounded.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi turned around and saw Ji Haiwei in the distance, gripping a black as ink divine sword, stepping towards her.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi glared: "Little servant!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's mouth twitched slightly, the killing intent in his purple eyes growing even more intense!</p><p></p><p>He didn't respond, just staring at Nuanxi with only murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The voice in his mind gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei couldn't help but feel anxious, as if the temple deity was moving away from him, and he was about to lose the deity's resonance.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>A majestic aura suddenly burst forth from Ji Haiwei's chest, as if it would explode, letting out a furious roar!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to obtain the temple deity's legacy! He wanted to find the Infernal Lotus Yang Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Li Nuanxi! Die!</p><p></p><p>You were destined to die!</p><p></p><p>He must kill Li Nuanxi! Crackle crackle!</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's body began to writhe, his powerful blood and qi surging, the large veins on his back bulging, trembling like a roaring dragon!</p><p></p><p>In his body, the blood was boiling, as if the dragon god's bloodline was awakening!</p><p></p><p>Purple light intertwined, forming a dragon god illusion outside his body! Boom - Ji Haiwei's eyes were filled with dense and icy killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The dragon god illusion coiled around him, gripping the Yin Divine Sword, his foot slamming down heavily, the mysterious mist suddenly parting.</p><p></p><p>He surged forth like a swimming dragon!</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword in his hand swung up violently.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't activate this Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword, relying on the sharpness and positional pressure inherent in the Four Divine Weapons...</p><p></p><p>It was absolutely enough to kill Li Nuanxi! Ji Haiwei naturally knew Nuanxi's abilities, as he had been defeated by her once before. Although she had been diligently cultivating these past days, her strength had not increased much.</p><p></p><p>But this time is different. Previously on Golden Peak, he dared not take out the Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword...</p><p></p><p>Nor could he take it out.</p><p></p><p>Because when he left Jeju, his father had warned him that this Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword could only be drawn out during the temple deity's resonance.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei listened carefully, so on Golden Peak, even when he was in a state of frenzy, he never took out this sword to suppress Li Nuanxi.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>In the temple deity resonance assembly, within the mysterious temple, he no longer needed to be wary, no longer needed to suppress himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! Like a purple electric snake, he surged forth, the sword light swirling! Myriad Dragons Prostrate to the Deity!</p><p></p><p>In a state where his dragon god bloodline was fully activated, Ji Haiwei went all out, unleashing a martial saint's ultimate technique with his first strike!</p><p></p><p>Myriad Dragons Prostrate to the Deity was a martial saint's ultimate technique, which could be integrated into all methods!</p><p></p><p>The opening move was the martial saint's ultimate technique! Lethal!</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless dragons were simultaneously diving down, enveloped in countless swirling sword lights, like a myriad of dragon shadows descending!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom boom -</p><p></p><p>Vortexes began to violently spin within the mysterious mist, stirred up by the sword qi! Fierce winds blew, as if dark clouds were pressing down heavily!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi had just retrieved the gold brick and turned around, the tiny figure swaying in the howling winds. Nuanxi's chubby cheeks were trembling!</p><p></p><p>"Aiya-!"</p><p></p><p>She was both angry and alarmed! Sensing the strong aura of death!</p><p></p><p>This little servant, he was coming to kill Nuanxi! If Nuanxi died, how heartbroken would her father and mother be!</p><p></p><p>How bad!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was angry, but also extremely vigilant, not daring to underestimate anything.</p><p></p><p>The danger, it was so dangerous!</p><p></p><p>The sword in this little servant's hand exuded an overwhelming murderous aura!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Facing Ji Haiwei's suddenly attacking terrifying onslaught,</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi's arms suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Tempered and forged by the purple flame spear and the fire tip spear, her little feet stomped, as if igniting thunder!</p><p></p><p>Her chubby fists clenched, purple light swirling, purple flames bursting forth!</p><p></p><p>Boom!! The surging purple flames coalesced into a huge purple cat!</p><p></p><p>These past days, Li Yue had been specially training Nuanxi - not only in pounding the purple flame spear and fire tip spear, but also in refining her understanding of the martial dao, subtly imparting it to Nuanxi!</p><p></p><p>Now Nuanxi's White Tiger Raging Wind Fist had already reached the realm of transformation! One punch unleashed, it was stunningly brilliant!</p><p></p><p>The purple fierce tiger, roaring with open jaws, the energy shaking the heavens, as if about to pounce on the stars!</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable that this was a punch unleashed by a four-year-old girl!</p><p></p><p>Sword light like a dragon, fist light like a tiger! The roaring dragon and tiger collided! Ji Haiwei's pupils, like a purple mirror, reflected the light, his killing intent surging!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Nuanxi actually dared to meet his one sword strike with a fist, it was truly audacious to the extreme!</p><p></p><p>"Your hand... can be discarded!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei sneered coldly! Confident and assured!</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't wield the Four Divine Weapons, the sharpness of the Four Divine Weapons alone would be enough to turn this girl into mincemeat!</p><p></p><p>Even if her physical body was comparable to a master, so what?</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei no longer restricted his martial dao cultivation! His primordial vein trembling, his blood and qi surging, the powerful force enveloped in the sword light, unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>The reason he was previously defeated by Li Nuanxi was because he had sealed his cultivation, only displaying his blood transformation cultivation. If he had displayed his primordial vein cultivation, how could Li Nuanxi be his opponent? How could he have failed the mountain trial and become a laughingstock!</p><p></p><p>All his fury was unleashed at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Clang!! The tiger fist momentum collided with the dragon-shaped sword qi! Like rumbling thunder, the entire earth trembled!</p><p></p><p>Countless mysterious mists surged up!</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to become rippling waves, the concentric circles of ripples radiating out from the two of them. Ji Haiwei's expression kept changing! "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>He cried out in shock and near loss of control!</p><p></p><p>This girl...</p><p></p><p>Actually managed to block with her bare hands the sword strike he infused with Myriad Dragons Prostrate to the Deity!</p><p></p><p>Although...</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei had just learned the Myriad Dragons Prostrate to the Deity martial saint's ultimate technique, and had not yet mastered it!</p><p></p><p>But the momentum was not weak!</p><p></p><p>Plus the sharpness of the Four Divine Weapon material...</p><p></p><p>How could it be blocked like this?! Squelch - the sound of metal clashing echoed, as if sparks were bursting forth! Nuanxi clenched her fist, her gaze dazzlingly brilliant.</p><p></p><p>She stared at her right hand, the golden luster shining, unexpectedly tough and unyielding, directly withstanding Ji Haiwei's sword strike! Although Ji Haiwei's primordial vein realm strength pushed Nuanxi back several steps,</p><p></p><p>this was enough to greatly satisfy Nuanxi! Clenching her golden fist, Nuanxi's expression was filled with exhilaration! "Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Boom -</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi stepped down heavily.</p><p></p><p>In her small figure, it was as if a terrifying monster was hidden, her spine like a dragon, one arm purple and one golden! Dazzlingly brilliant!</p><p></p><p>The mist swirled, the airflow turbulent, Nuanxi threw another punch! Ji Haiwei's hair flew, the purple dragon illusion around him seeming to tilt its head and let out a long roar.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flickered, the Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword trembling again, countless brilliant sword lights bursting forth!</p><p></p><p>"Die-!!!"</p><p></p><p>Clang!! The crisp sound exploded again!</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi crossed her arms, resisting fiercely, pushing and striking out!</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill Nuanxi!"</p><p></p><p>"Nuanxi will-"</p><p></p><p>"Beat you to death!"</p><p></p><p>Daddy said that if someone bullies Nuanxi, Nuanxi can't be afraid, but must bravely fight back! Daddy said, when you're in the rivers and lakes...</p><p></p><p>If someone wants to use a knife, let them use the knife!</p><p></p><p>The blood transformation Nuanxi did not retreat, angrily shouting, then swinging her golden fist again.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei's dragon god illusion exerted its full power, the dragon god bloodline in his body almost burning to the extreme! A furious long roar, seeming to become a dragon's cry.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand, trembling slightly...</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It seems...</p><p></p><p>There was a reaction, this Four Divine Weapon, has it finally been moved by him?</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ji Haiwei's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Li Nuanxi, her left and right hands erupting with purple and golden light!</p><p></p><p>A long spear with purple flames gushing forth appeared, towering.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, a dazzlingly golden brick! Ji Haiwei's gaze was instantly drawn to the long spear.</p><p></p><p>His whole body couldn't stop trembling...</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A Four Divine Weapon?!"</p><p></p><p>"The Three-Headed Prince's Fire Tip Spear?!"</p><p></p><p>"How can you have the Fire Tip Spear?!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei cried out! Boom!! The Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword that already disliked him was almost completely suppressed by the Fire Tip Spear without any resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>Then the positional pressure of the Four Divine Weapons, like the roaring waves of a river, nearly suffocated Ji Haiwei.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi had somehow already approached his side.</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei reacted, eyes bulging with fury.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a roar, the purple dragon illusion exploded!</p><p></p><p>His primordial vein energy burst forth to the max, his five fingers spreading, the air seeming to be torn and shattered! </p><p></p><p>Without the sword, he struck out Myriad Dragons Prostrate to the Deity with his bare hands! No wonder he had never been able to suppress Li Nuanxi while wielding the Infernal Lotus Yin Divine Sword before.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Li Nuanxi also had a Four Divine Weapon! But now...</p><p></p><p>Neither of them had a Four Divine Weapon! In terms of pure strength...</p><p></p><p>The advantage was with him, Ji Haiwei! "Die-!!!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Haiwei let out a long roar.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, a dazzling golden light almost blinded his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Nuanxi was excitedly swinging a gold brick in her right hand! Ji Haiwei only realized that his dragon god illusion was rendered completely ineffective!</p><p></p><p>That gold brick kept getting bigger in front of his eyes! Ignoring his protective dragon god, ignoring his primordial vein inner qi, ignoring his mighty divine nature...</p><p></p><p>It was as if immune to everything.</p><p></p><p>An</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Mist</p><p></p><p>Invisible waves swept and spread out.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu sat cross-legged under the Wheel of the Jade Lotus Fire, like a bright lamp illuminating the surrounding area, preventing the mysterious fog from approaching.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo woo—</p><p></p><p>Terrifying figures passed through the mysterious fog, their powerful and horrifying auras faintly leaking out. Even ferocious faces peeked out from the other side of the fog.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu sat cross-legged, eyes closed, reciting scriptures, his hand making mudras, his thumb constantly tapping on the joints of his index and middle fingers.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A formless wave of energy, thick with vital energy, came rushing and struck his face.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The scent of blood?"</p><p></p><p>"The temple gods are resonating... How come there are also situations of mutual confrontation and fighting?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mysterious Pavilion, the scent of blood was not easily detected, because those guardian cursed corpses had long lost their blood, and those demonic creatures, with their tough skin and thick flesh, could only be injured when the temple was destroyed, causing them to bleed.</p><p></p><p>Normally, these demonic creatures would not bleed! This bloody scent, without a doubt, came from the children participating in the temple god resonance!  "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the temple god's trial... is to make the children kill each other?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of seriousness and worry flashed in Jiao Shaoqiu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, it seems that trouble is about to happen.</p><p></p><p>It's best to keep it under control.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once this Four-Guarded Mysterious Temple completely goes berserk, allowing those terrifying guardian cursed corpses and demonic creatures to break out...</p><p></p><p>That would truly be a great disaster! </p><p></p><p>The current Jin Guang Prefecture could not withstand the complete loss of control of a Four-Guarded Mysterious Temple! Feeling the lingering aftershocks of the confrontation spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Shaoqiu slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>He now only hopes that this temple god resonance can be completed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Without causing any more trouble.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious fog, the aftershocks swept in.</p><p></p><p>Every child participating in the temple god resonance had a change in their expression.</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai's eyes, mouth, and nose were all spewing flames, distorting the surrounding fog, dispersing a patch of reality.</p><p></p><p>He felt the impact wave mixed with thick bloody scent.</p><p></p><p>His flaming eyes suddenly burst into dazzling brilliance.</p><p></p><p>He raised his five fingers, feeling the passing impact wave of the mysterious fog, just like the invisible ripples in the water waves.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Javelin!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Monitor really is a divine calculator!"</p><p></p><p>"He predicted this so accurately?!"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai was delighted.</p><p></p><p>His Qiankun Jade flashed with light, and the next moment, a palm-sized green banana fan fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly waved it towards the fog in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It directly swept out a straight path, and Tie Shancai swayed his body, walking along the path opened by the iron fan, fanning wherever it was not right! Relying on his keen perception, Tie Shancai was rapidly approaching the area where Xixia and Jishi were confronting.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Monitor said that the Fire Javelin is the most suitable divine weapon for me, and my mother carefully calculated that only the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince of Jin Guang Prefecture has the Fire Javelin!"</p><p></p><p>Tie Shancai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickened his pace! He must get the Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Javelin in his hands!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mysterious Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Xixia and Jishi meeting.</p><p></p><p>The other children were all engaged in normal temple god resonance.</p><p></p><p>They felt the temple god's piercing voice, and their expressions all changed.</p><p></p><p>Little Fatty Zhou Peng's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Carve the bones to return the father, cut the flesh to return the mother?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't do it!"</p><p></p><p>Little Fatty Zhou Peng had a look of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>When this resonance trial came out, Little Fatty Zhou Peng knew that the rewards of this temple god resonance might have nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>Because he couldn't carve the bones to return the father and cut the flesh to return the mother, not to mention how cruel it was, Zhou Peng felt that he would be at a disadvantage... because he was fat, with more flesh and bones...</p><p></p><p>Doing this would only make him more disadvantaged! So Zhou Peng chose to give up.</p><p></p><p>Yun'e was in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>Carving the bones and cutting the flesh... she couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>She just came to try, to see if she could obtain a little bit of the temple god's inheritance, not much, just a little bit would be enough.</p><p></p><p>However, to cut the flesh and carve the bones, Yun'e gave up.</p><p></p><p>Because now she had no father or mother.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо tilted his head.</p><p></p><p>Chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Carve the bones to return the father, cut the flesh to return the mother?"</p><p></p><p>"That's because they did something wrong, your parents have the world's suffering in their eyes, not you! You caused trouble, and you want the world's suffering to perish with you, they can only abandon you and choose the world's suffering!"</p><p></p><p>"The mistake is theirs, the mistake is this world, what does it have to do with you?"</p><p></p><p>"You're just a child!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо had one hand hanging in the pocket of his tight-fitting clothes, chuckling.</p><p></p><p>He scratched his face, and the skin was distorted, revealing a face with dark circles.</p><p></p><p>His two buns were like rockets, and he hopped and skipped towards the "Qin Fenghuо" sitting in front of the Mysterious Temple.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his hand, with an indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>"The fault is with your parents, the mistake is with the world... why do you have to carve the bones and cut the flesh?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to do this!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Fenghuо with dark circles, smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Come on! A wisp of the temple god's divine soul, come on! Let's leave this place together, I'll take you to be unrestrained, take you to be unruly!"</p><p></p><p>"This world needs you, the wrong world, it should be cleansed properly, not you going to carve the bones and cut the flesh for them."</p><p></p><p>"You're just a child, you're just naturally true!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, come with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go cut the flesh of this world, carve the bones."</p><p></p><p>"Come on..."</p><p></p><p>"My god!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi was trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>On the steps of the Mysterious Temple in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi" was smiling evilly, slashing blood and flesh one sword after another, spraying blood.</p><p></p><p>"Carve the bones to return the father."</p><p></p><p>"Cut the flesh to return the mother."</p><p></p><p>"Come on—!"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi" chuckled darkly, dripping with blood, his eyes flowing with blood, staring fixatedly at Lu Chi.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi's body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Tears kept flowing.</p><p></p><p>He slowly took a step, step by step, as if it was extremely difficult and painful...</p><p></p><p>"I know... I feel... I understand... your pain, resentment, anger and suffering."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi's legs were trembling.</p><p></p><p>With each step he took, it was as if a dull knife was cutting a piece of flesh from his body.</p><p></p><p>The creaking sound of cutting flesh echoed in his ears, as if it was slicing away his soul.</p><p></p><p>His soul was trembling.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were flowing with thick tears.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"I empathize!"</p><p></p><p>"From a young age, anything I do is wrong, in my father's eyes, I'm wrong about everything!"</p><p></p><p>"Father punished me, Mother scolded me..."</p><p></p><p>"Why can't they understand me?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, I'm their child."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi took ten steps, drenched in sweat, his large head distorted, tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>"I want power..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi said.</p><p></p><p>"Many aristocratic families train their children, from birth they seal a temple god within their bodies, growing up with them, so that after growing up they can obtain the temple god's inheritance and become invincible existences of the same realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The imperial clan is even more so."</p><p></p><p>"But in the Divine Capital, not a single temple god chose me."</p><p></p><p>"Because I don't have a temple god in my body, Father doesn't like me, Mother also dislikes me, no matter what I do, I only have mistakes, even if it's right, they still say it's wrong..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm so unwilling..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi finally walked up to "Lu Chi". His complexion was deathly pale, as if he had exhausted all his strength.</p><p></p><p>His power was too small in front of this "Lu Chi".</p><p></p><p>So small that it was like a grain of sand facing a star! But he still stood there.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi" laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Come."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Chi" handed over the sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi tremblingly took the sword, tears flowing continuously.</p><p></p><p>Too many scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Flashed through the image of his teacher Li Qingshan in a blue robe, hunched over, thinking of the kind and amiable Aunt Su who mended his clothes at night... </p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Xixia he played the twist car with, his eyes full of Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the cold and stern Uncle Li Mu.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the warm and gentle Zhang Ayi who cooked delicious food.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi cried.</p><p></p><p>But being in the imperial family, he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>He had to seize this last opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The Great Monitor told him, this was his only chance.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Grabbed the sword "Lu Chi" handed over.</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!! Instantly.</p><p></p><p>A black lotus appeared, and on the black lotus, "Lu Chi" transformed into a child wearing a black midriff top, sitting on it in an evil manner.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was scorching.</p><p></p><p>"Come on."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi gripped the bloodied sword.</p><p></p><p>Plop—! The sword light flowed, slicing off a piece of flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Chi's face was flushed red, biting his teeth tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Come on."</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>Shhh shhh shhh shhh—</p><p></p><p>Blood beads fell.</p><p></p><p>Falling on the rolling mysterious fog, bursting and exploding, like a blood lotus blooming in hell.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixia gripped the golden brick.</p><p></p><p>The brick was flowing with golden light, extremely dazzling.</p><p></p><p>She hummed, excitedly raising her head.</p><p></p><p>"Little slave! Do you submit?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Jishi's head was almost about to explode, flesh and blood mangled, blood constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>He staggered to his feet.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon God phantom surged up, a patch of lifelike dragon scales spreading out, the tail coiling and undulating.</p><p></p><p>The whipping mysterious fog kept surging.</p><p></p><p>"Submit?"</p><p></p><p>Jishi grinned, cold and resentful...</p><p></p><p>"Why should I submit?"</p><p></p><p>"I am the son of the Pacification King, the son of the Dragon God Clan Princess! Why should I submit to you, a wild girl?"</p><p></p><p>"I will kill you! Peel off your skin, tear out your tendons!"</p><p></p><p>"I will order my father the King to wipe out the entire Jin Guang Branch, wipe out your whole family!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill your mother, kill your father!"</p><p></p><p>Jishi was filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gradually became tinged with anger and redness, he didn't know why he would say such words.</p><p></p><p>But this was actually what was in his heart! His status and identity, how could they be compared to this wild girl?</p><p></p><p>The Dragon God bloodline started to go mad again, invading Jishi's will.</p><p></p><p>But Jishi no longer cared, completely relaxing his mind.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the power to surge out from his body.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to kill this wild girl! </p><p></p><p>He wanted to tear this wild girl to shreds!</p><p></p><p>"You dare to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"If you kill me... my father the King's Black Armor Iron Cavalry will trample the Jin Guang Branch flat, and everyone will have their heads chopped off!"</p><p></p><p>"Your father and mother will also be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Behead them!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare to kill me?!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia clenched the golden brick, her whole body trembling, which was caused by anger.</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, when had she ever heard such malicious words.</p><p></p><p>When had she ever encountered such a malicious person!</p><p></p><p>Not only wanting to kill Xixia,</p><p></p><p>But also wipe out the entire Jin Guang Branch together.</p><p></p><p>And kill her mother and father!</p><p></p><p>Too cruel!</p><p></p><p>Xixia was very angry, very furious! With one hand gripping the golden brick, the other clenched into a fist, her face flushed red, her whole body trembling with anger.</p><p></p><p>Boom—!!! In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Javelin.</p><p></p><p>Ding.</p><p></p><p>Struck the Jail Lotus Yin God Sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword suddenly fell to the ground, "playing dead" very decisively.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Flame Snake Spear Fire Javelin shot over.</p><p></p><p>Xixia raised her hand, clenching her five fingers, and the Fire Javelin was grasped in Xixia's hand! Purple flames spewed out from the Fire Javelin, instantly wrapping and binding Xixia's body like a purple silk ribbon, lifting Xixia's figure to float in the air! Her brows were furrowed.</p><p></p><p>But Xixia was trembling all over, her eyes reddened, almost about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Because Jishi's words had still affected her.</p><p></p><p>Kill Jishi...</p><p></p><p>Jishi's father would then lead the army to destroy Jin Guang Peak, would kill Sect Master Teacher, would kill Sister Yinyin...</p><p></p><p>Would kill Father and Mother!</p><p></p><p>What should Xixia do?!</p><p></p><p>"Kill him..."</p><p></p><p>"Then, carve the bones to return the father, cut the flesh to return the mother... you alone will bear all the mistakes..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, your father will resent your stubbornness, will think you are reckless, because your stubbornness has caused so many deaths in the Jin Guang Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Your mother will be disappointed in you, no longer liking you..."</p><p></p><p>A sudden voice rang out in Xixia's ears.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Tears were welling up in her eyes, pouting her mouth...</p><p></p><p>Xixia was so heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>Xixia really wanted to kill the little slave.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter..."</p><p></p><p>"Go, kill him, devour all his divine talents..."</p><p></p><p>"Go wild, and after everything is done, you alone will bear the mistakes, after all, your father won't understand you, your mother won't like you anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Become the true Xixia!"</p><p></p><p>The tempting voice kept echoing.</p><p></p><p>Xixia's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gentle voice rang out, suppressing the tempting voice in Xixia's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Naughty child, shut up."</p><p></p><p>Xixia's body stopped trembling.</p><p></p><p>She blinked her eyes, looking at the white chess piece floating in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The smooth white chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Emanating a faint white light.</p><p></p><p>Then, the familiar and gentle voice echoed in Xixia's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Xixia darling, don't be afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Whoever hits you, you hit him back, whoever wants to kill you, you kill him, don't be wronged..."</p><p></p><p>"What great righteousness, what great situation, you don't need to worry about it."</p><p></p><p>"Daddy is here."</p><p></p><p>8,000 words!

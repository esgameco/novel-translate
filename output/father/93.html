        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For Li Che, the Xu family was a family that had helped him.</p><p></p><p>Although the one who had helped him was Xu You, it was still related to the Xu family's system.</p><p></p><p>When he was weak in the past, he had also relied on the Xu family's power to fight against the Lingying Sect and prevent Xixia from being taken away by the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che was actually grateful to the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, from the time when Xu Beihu set his sights on Xixia, Li Che might have already put on the Ox Demon mask in the middle of the night and sneaked into Xu Beihu's room.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Li Che was concerned about after returning to Feilei City was the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet had obviously been initiated.</p><p></p><p>One could clearly perceive the changes in the divine nature between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Li Che of today, who had forged the divine foundation of the Three-Eyed Furious True Lord, had a refined divine consciousness and increasingly acute perception of power.</p><p></p><p>Even without using the power of the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit, he could clearly capture the fluctuations of the divine nature.</p><p></p><p>However, the Thousand Buddha Carving Banquet was ultimately something that the city lord Cao Guangzhun had been preparing for many years. It had started from the appearance of the Lingying Sect.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che could not intervene, unless he directly rushed to the city lord's mansion and killed Cao Guangzhun.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, after forging the divine foundation, Li Che had indeed had such thoughts, but he soon suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>Because he was not sure.</p><p></p><p>Without being completely sure, if he rushed over, he might easily put himself in a passive position.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Cao Guangzhun had another identity, which was a disciple of the Corpse God Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse God Sect was not something that Cao Guangzhun had concocted like the Lingying Sect, but a truly terrifying sect that had swept across the entire Great Scenery, making the Temple Guardians and the Divine Ancestor feel troubled.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qingshan said that the Corpse God Sect's power deployment in Yunzhou was not much, the Corpse God Sect's experts and main attention were not in Yunzhou.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the "Desire to Observe Corpse Buddha" wooden sculpture that was killed last night, the Corpse God Sect... might have already begun to infiltrate Yunzhou.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guangzhun might have the means of the Corpse God Sect, so Li Che did not dare to rush over.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he could not kill with one strike, he might end up alarming the snake.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Che had decided to act, he did not want to fail.</p><p></p><p>"Before that, let's deal with the Xu family's matter first."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's body seemed to melt into the rain and water of heaven and earth, without any sense of existence, as if he had turned transparent.</p><p></p><p>The concealment ability of the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" made Li Che's body temperature, breathing rate, and pulse almost disappear, completely merging with the natural earth.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was no worse than the supreme skill of the Turtle Breath Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Our family is leaving for the capital city today, and Xu You has even promised Xixia that he will come to see us off... But he has not shown up today, and given Xu You's personality of keeping his promises, something must have happened."</p><p></p><p>"But the divine nature chess piece placed on Xu You has not given any warning, indicating that it does not involve Xu You's life..."</p><p></p><p>"It must be something serious to prevent Xu You from coming to see us off."</p><p></p><p>Li Che silently glided through the long street.</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside the high walls of the Xu family's mansion, a place he had walked through several times, he was already familiar with it. With a single leap, he soared into the courtyard like a falcon spreading its wings.</p><p></p><p>His body rose and fell, without the slightest trace of blood flow, and he had already darted into the gardens of the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>With towering rockeries and winding corridors, Li Che's cultivation of blood and qi had already reached the peak of the meridian realm, and with the level 3 "Sleeping Dragon Elephant", his concealment ability had become even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Even if he walked in front of ordinary people, they might not notice him.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a Xu family elder at the divine foundation realm within the Xu family mansion.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine consciousness perception of the divine foundation realm only has a range of ten meters, and if it is extended further, it will become very vague and blurred, completely unable to penetrate the concealment of the Sleeping Dragon Elephant.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che's movements were completely free, just like returning to his own home.</p><p></p><p>Walking in the rain, like merging into the wind and rain, the guards who sensed something amiss would look around, but see no one.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Xu family mansion, the table was laden with delicacies, and fine wines were displayed, with the fragrance of alcohol permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Outside, there was lightning and thunder, but inside the Xu family mansion, a family banquet was being held.</p><p></p><p>Xu You sat in the chair with an extremely gloomy expression, his fists clenched and his lips pursed.</p><p></p><p>He had gotten up early today, intending to see Li Che's family off, as this might be the last time they could meet. After all, Li Che's family would most likely not return to Feilei City, and Xu You wanted to bid them farewell.</p><p></p><p>Although he was reluctant in his heart, he understood that the capital city was the most suitable place for Xixia's development. Xixia was about to enter the Divine Ancestor's cultivation, and she had the opportunity to become a great divine cultivator in the future. He should be happy about it.</p><p></p><p>He had even prepared a parting gift.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could even leave the courtyard, he was summoned by his father in person.</p><p></p><p>Xu You thought his father just wanted to say a few words to him because he had just returned from handling some evil spirits outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Xu You didn't think much of it and went, but he never expected that his father, Xu Nanming, had actually prepared a lavish banquet.</p><p></p><p>At the table, he saw the old master, the pillar of the Xu family and the only divine foundation cultivator, whom he had not seen for years.</p><p></p><p>Next, there was also his elder brother, Xu Heli.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled him was that he did not see his second brother, Xu Beihu.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the second brother?" Xu You asked with confusion.</p><p></p><p>A trace of gloom flashed in Xu Heli's eyes, but his face revealed a smile as he poured a cup of wine and drank it down, then said softly, "Your second brother went to the capital city... He said he had some business to do there."</p><p></p><p>Business in the capital city? How could that be? The capital city was not close to Feilei City, and the Xu family's main business was in woodcarving shops, which had nothing to do with the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli did not say more, his eyes cold and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Beihu... That thick-headed and seemingly simple-minded second brother, his sense of smell was actually so keen that he had fled in advance, even taking his family with him.</p><p></p><p>He was really decisive.</p><p></p><p>But it's good...</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli glanced at Xu You, slowly drinking his wine.</p><p></p><p>When all the dishes and wine were served, the old master of the Xu family raised his cup and coughed lightly, his expression somewhat unpleasant. "The Xu family has been rooted in Feilei City for more than two hundred years. Now in Feilei City, the Si family has declined, the Yang family has collapsed, and the An family has migrated. The four great aristocratic families have dwindled, and only the Xu family remains."</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family has also completely occupied the majority, controlling all the woodcarving business in Feilei City, making a fortune, which is gratifying."</p><p></p><p>The old master spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>The others poured wine and congratulated him.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's heart was extremely anxious, and he was already thinking of a way to escape the banquet and catch up with Li Che's family to see them off.</p><p></p><p>After taking a sip of the wine, Xu You didn't think too much.</p><p></p><p>"Ah You, your mother passed away early, and I didn't pay much attention to you. Have you ever resented your father?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming poured Xu You a cup of wine, the rich and potent liquid a transparent red, like diluted blood.</p><p></p><p>Xu You hurriedly picked up the wine cup, "How could I resent my father? As the head of the Xu family, Father has too many things to handle."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xu You had some resentment towards Xu Nanming in his heart. Xu Nanming's attention and care for Xu Heli and Xu Beihu were far greater than for him.</p><p></p><p>Xu You knew it was because his mother was only a refugee who had fled here, without any distinguished family background. And his mother had passed away early, so Xu Nanming didn't have much emotional attachment.</p><p></p><p>So Xu You had long since resigned himself to his fate.</p><p></p><p>But the Xu family had cultivated him and raised him, and this nurturing grace was enough for Xu You to work hard for the Xu family and repay them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Nanming smiled and looked at Xu You, his eyes somewhat wistful.</p><p></p><p>Xu You's temperament... really didn't resemble him at all.</p><p></p><p>It was more like his mother, that woman who had fled here but was noticed by him, gentle and serene, unfortunately... she died early.</p><p></p><p>If Xu You's mother had not died, perhaps Xu Nanming would not have ignored Xu You so much.</p><p></p><p>"Drink the wine," Xu Nanming said gently.</p><p></p><p>Together, they drained the cups.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he reached out and patted Xu You's shoulder, a rare gesture that made Xu You's heart inexplicably flutter.</p><p></p><p>"Little You, in the blink of an eye, you've grown up so much..."</p><p></p><p>"Come, have a drink with Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>The frail old master of the Xu family, leaning on a cane in the chair, also raised his cloudy gaze and focused it on Xu You.</p><p></p><p>Xu You hurriedly stood up in trepidation, holding the wine cup with both hands.</p><p></p><p>The two of them drained the cups in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Xu Heli also poured a cup of wine, walked over to him, patted Xu You's shoulder, clinked cups, and drained it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Xu You did not refuse, and after three cups of wine, the rich and potent alcohol sensation surged.</p><p></p><p>Although the attitudes of the old master and his father were somewhat unusual today, Xu You didn't think much of it. It was probably just some dangerous task they wanted to assign him.</p><p></p><p>He was already used to such situations.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu You's brow furrowed, and a burp rose uncontrollably from his chest, surging up his throat.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the burp came out, and an extremely pungent bloody taste filled his throat, replacing the taste of wine and making Xu You's whole body shudder slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This wine..."</p><p></p><p>Xu You's eyes narrowed as he stared intently.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, he saw that Xu Nanming, Xu Heli, and Grandpa Xu had all put down their cups of wine.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes were fixed on him, piercing straight through him.</p><p></p><p>A sudden chill rose from the top of his head, instantly spreading throughout his entire body and limbs, as if it was about to freeze him solid.</p><p></p><p>Hum—</p><p></p><p>A buzzing sound reverberated in his eardrums, shrill and piercing, assaulting his mind.</p><p></p><p>"You all..." </p><p></p><p>Xu You could taste the intense bloodiness in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have understood something - this so-called familial love, this so-called brotherly affection, were nothing but an illusion! He stared at the wine that was the color of blood, his face twitching uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Have you all gone mad?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu You rose unsteadily, knocking over the chair beneath him with a thud.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! A muffled bell toll suddenly shattered the wind and rain, ringing out from the direction of the Marquis' Mansion. The piercing sound of the bell formed sound waves that rippled in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Xu You felt his head splitting with pain, a chill spreading through his body.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Xu slowly looked outside, listening to the bell's chime, and let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Infant Carving Feast has begun..."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Infant Carving Feast? </p><p></p><p>Xu You's mind was in a haze. Wasn't it supposed to be the Thousand Buddha Carving Feast? Xu Nanming walked to the dark corner and abruptly yanked off the black cloth, revealing flickering candles behind it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the scene inside the room was illuminated.</p><p></p><p>There were numerous wooden carvings of infant spirits, each with a different expression - some Buddhas, some infant spirits, some boys, some girls, displaying joy, anger, sorrow, and thought, the seven emotions.</p><p></p><p>Xu You felt the world spinning, accompanied by the deafening buzzing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if the lit candles were bringing the infant spirits and Buddha statues to life, their laughter, cries, and angry shouts echoing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Strands of spirituality, twisted and distorted, seeped out from these wooden carvings, like venomous snakes sticking out their forked tongues, crawling down from the carvings and contorting their bodies as they slithered across the floor.</p><p></p><p>Hissing, hissing, hissing...</p><p></p><p>They kept approaching Xu You.</p><p></p><p>Xu You felt his heart being gripped by an invisible hand.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely seemed to see an ancient and dilapidated temple, its blue bricks cracked and overgrown, from which emerged a furiously enraged infant spirit, its eyes wide open, a vertical eye suddenly appearing on its brow, its mouth opening in a silent scream! Then...</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual essences, like venomous snakes, burrowed into Xu You's body.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>The ancient bell tolls, like the ebb and flow of the tides for three thousand years, the hanging evening bell being struck repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The torrent of time, the dust of the ages, all boiling in the sound of the bell.</p><p></p><p>A stooped figure, wearing a cat-faced mask, a nondescript ram's horn hammer hanging at his waist, floated over the high walls of Feilei City.</p><p></p><p>Stepping onto the blue brick ground of the outer city.</p><p></p><p>The entire city fell into a deathly silence, the sky above roiling with dark clouds, thunderous roars, and intertwining lightning snakes.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the cat-faced mask narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite decisive. If I had been any later, I wouldn't have been able to play with you all..."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice came from under the mask.</p><p></p><p>Cao Guang had accurately grasped the opportunity and immediately started the ritual to acquire power.</p><p></p><p>"The Three-Eyed Furious True Lord Infant Spirit Bizarre Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Capital Bizarre Temples."</p><p></p><p>"You, Cao Guang, are using the 'Thousand Buddha Carving Feast' to sacrifice the lives and blood of a thousand infant spirits to elevate this Bizarre Temple to the Nine Luminaries level..."</p><p></p><p>"A Nine Luminaries level temple deity..."</p><p></p><p>"Old me is quite looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>"Temple deities are said to be unrivaled within their realm. To kill a temple deity of the same realm, it would take at least five or more cultivators of the same realm to slay the deity."</p><p></p><p>"Old me... is curious to see if this humble ram's horn hammer can smash a temple deity!"</p><p></p><p>Rumbling thunder roared, the dark clouds in the sky instantly brightening.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were fierce, ice and snow falling, as if the heavens were furious, countless raindrops mixed with hail crashing down to the mortal realm! The figure wearing the cat-faced mask, Li Qingshan, swayed his body, like a straight arrow, and shot out, creating a white wave in the rainy curtain as he charged directly towards the inner city!</p><p></p><p>With a few bounds, he had already crossed the outer city and entered the inner city.</p><p></p><p>This lightning-fast speed caught the city defenders completely off guard!</p><p></p><p>Conceal? </p><p></p><p>Hide?</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's face under the mask was filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Now, he no longer needed...</p><p></p><p>The weak need to conceal and hide.</p><p></p><p>The strong... with a reason, just need to push forward!</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Buddha Carving Feast, should actually be called the Thousand Infant Carving Feast! Using the lives of a thousand infant spirits as a sacrifice to awaken the temple deity, to feed the temple deity! Vile beasts - they must be killed!</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Li Qingshan took a heavy step, his entire body trembling, his spine suddenly straightening, a scorching blood energy like a soaring dragon coiling around him, roaring furiously.</p><p></p><p>This was the aura of a Grandmaster, releasing his qi without any restraint, from his five viscera to his great dragon spine, forged like a thousand hammers.</p><p></p><p>The domineering and intense true qi gushed out from his body. In the distance, dozens of guards who had already received orders from Marquis Cao Guang, possessing the ability to exchange blood, came rushing with long howls, their sabers trembling, shattering the raindrops.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qingqing didn't even glance at them, flicking his finger, and the ram's horn hammer at his waist suddenly flew out with a whistling sound.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang! Dozens of blood flowers bloomed in the rain curtain, the dozens of blood-exchanging warriors unable to even resist before their heads were smashed open by the hammer, becoming cold corpses.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, with a snap, the ram's horn hammer was gripped by the old man in the cat mask.</p><p></p><p>Dripping with blood mixed with rainwater from the hammer head.</p><p></p><p>Striding leisurely, as if parting the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>Unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu Family Estate.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood on the artificial hill, his aura blending with heaven and earth, completely undetectable.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was like lightning, clearly seeing the scene inside the hall.</p><p></p><p>The wine Xu You drank had obviously been laced with a drug that would make him fall unconscious. Since it did not involve a threat to his life, the spiritual chess piece did not give any warning.</p><p></p><p>So Li Che had not intervened for now, wanting to figure out what the Xu family members were planning to do.</p><p></p><p>Why would they target Xu You?</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw Xu Nanming pull away the cloth, revealing the hundreds of various infant spirit wooden carvings.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family also wants a share in the Thousand Buddha Carving Feast..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they have already tacitly approved the Marquis' Mansion taking away the infant spirits."</p><p></p><p>The expression on Li Che's bull-masked face was ice-cold, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps at first, the Xu family was still resisting the Infant Spirit Cult's intentions, but in the end... they chose to cooperate, offering up the infant spirits.</p><p></p><p>Those infant spirits... how innocent? They had just been born, but simply because of their good natural talents, they had become the objects of calculation and competition between these powers.</p><p></p><p>Life and death were in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyelids lowered, unable to help but think of Xixia. If he had not attained the Dao...</p><p></p><p>What would Xixia's fate be? </p><p></p><p>Likely the same as those kidnapped and sacrificed infant spirits.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater falling from the heavens was bone-chillingly cold.</p><p></p><p>When Li Che stood on the artificial hill, seeing in the hall a large iron cauldron set up, the boiling water bubbling, various herbs being thrown into it...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Heli trembling as he held a shiny bone-carving knife and approached the unconscious Xu You...</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Li Che's bull mask suddenly showed a trace of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"They've truly gone mad."</p><p></p><p>"The great families, the cannibalistic great families, this is a world of cannibalism."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head, exhaling the icy air, murmuring softly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the towering figure on the artificial hill blurred and distorted, vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the hall.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, leaning on a cane, staring at Xu Heli's trembling steps towards Xu You.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>His narrowed eyes suddenly widened! But he found that in the dark corner of the hall, less than ten steps away... a figure wearing a cute bull mask had emerged from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>A muffled "thump" as if a bloody silk banner was swirling around the body.</p><p></p><p>The bull demon's form suddenly expanded, his back forming an inverted triangle, the knotted and coiled dragon-like sinews on his back pulsing, like a roaring dragon!</p><p></p><p>"Your bull grandpa has come to kill!"</p><p></p><p>A roar burning with fury, accompanied by a whistling sound like lightning!  The crimson glass-like blood-stained spear appeared like a bloody lightning bolt.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly crossing the ten steps.</p><p></p><p>Sneak attack and strike out!</p><p></p><p>Poof—! In an instant, the blood-stained spear pierced through the old master of the Xu family's skull, impaling him to the ground!</p>

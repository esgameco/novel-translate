            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King and the Monkey King...</p><p></p><p>They locked eyes!</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not expect that touching the golden statue of the Heavenly King would trigger such an unexpected event! The mythical soldier [The Face of the Monkey King] placed on the celestial chessboard was automatically triggered, like a guardian, and directly covered his face!</p><p></p><p>Countless monkey hairs sprouted, and a mighty, majestic will, as if the Monkey King had descended, surged forth in an instant.</p><p></p><p>On the celestial chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che watched as the [Face of the Monkey King] was shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>Then, it swelled up like a balloon, transforming from a mask into a true simian figure.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual energy rippled through the celestial chessboard, causing the many pure-hearted chess pieces to rattle.</p><p></p><p>The suppressed Seven-Element Corpse Curse seal, in particular, trembled in fear, and the speed of its refinement was suddenly accelerated, being completely refined by Li Che.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Che couldn't be bothered to pay attention to this minor detail.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fixed on the scene unfolding before him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Golden Palace.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless clouds surged, winds and clouds churned, and the vast expanse of mist, as if an endless sea!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Heavenly King stood like a towering celestial tree in the sea of clouds, golden and magnificent, like a great sun.</p><p></p><p>The countless golden rays he cast down were like countless sharp sword beams, spanning the sea of clouds, tearing the heavens asunder!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King bent down, glaring angrily, holding a pagoda, as if glaring at a presumptuous intruder! And Li Che, with the [Face of the Monkey King] covering him, had countless golden monkey hairs sprouting on his face, his black robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to be emitting golden light, and he defiantly looked up, locking eyes with the Heavenly King! "Unruly monkey!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Heavenly King gripped the golden pagoda and let out a furious roar.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the palace trembled, rumbling, constantly shaking and vibrating, with countless clouds bursting open, like towering waves rising from the vast sea!</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in the Chessmaster's Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was intense.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Heavenly King roar, and with the Face of the Monkey King, as if transforming into the Monkey King, his legs suddenly bent, and he sprang up, grabbing with his five fingers, as if a golden treasure staff was being drawn out from the churning clouds!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, unruly monkey..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King, seeing the figure that had sprung up in front of him, wielding the giant staff, sighed from afar.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Seven-Treasure Relic Pagoda in his hand vibrated, and in an instant, it flew out.</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light poured down from the pagoda, fiercely enveloping the Monkey King's staff.</p><p></p><p>"Even in death, you can't be at peace, it's just a mask after all, yet you dare to unleash such a commotion."</p><p></p><p>"Unruly monkey is unruly monkey..."</p><p></p><p>"Wield the Monkey King's staff, fight to the end, spill the last drop of blood..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Can the gods..."</p><p></p><p>"Return or not?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! The sea of clouds raged and burst open.</p><p></p><p>Li Che only felt the world spinning, and when he opened his eyes next, everything seemed like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>His palm was resting on the shoe of the Golden Heavenly King statue, as if it were a wall.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King statue had not leaned down, nor had it unleashed the Golden Heavenly King Pagoda to strike down the countless golden rays.</p><p></p><p>It was as if everything had just been his imagination.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che was certain that what he had just witnessed was not false.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had truly seen the two temple gods, gazing at each other from afar, clashing from afar.</p><p></p><p>As if the clash between the Face of the Monkey King and the Golden Heavenly King Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Li Che released his hand and took two steps back, his expression extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>These temple gods...</p><p></p><p>Were they really dead?</p><p></p><p>If these temple gods had truly died, then why did they die?</p><p></p><p>And why did the mysterious temples suddenly sprout like bamboo shoots after the rain, bringing strangeness and cultivation to the world?</p><p></p><p>Li Che did not understand, and now he was still too far from grasping the true nature of this world.</p><p></p><p>In the presence of the true temple gods, he was as weak as an ant.</p><p></p><p>Even a Furnace Sect Master, in the eyes of the temple gods, was nothing more than a mortal ant.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, these are not things I can manage."</p><p></p><p>"I only need to become stronger, enhance my foundation, protect the safety of my wife and daughter, watch my daughter grow up, and pursue immortality."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward again, his five fingers once more resting on the Golden Heavenly King statue.</p><p></p><p>A dark golden Heavenly King chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he refined and absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>It fell with a thunderous sound onto the celestial chessboard of the Chessmaster's Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The criss-crossing lines on the chessboard were bent, as if the space-time had sunken, and the lines of space-time flowed around the dark golden chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked up, vigilantly sensing the situation around him.</p><p></p><p>Based on his experience, the moment he finished absorbing the temple god's chess piece, the Heavenly King would have angrily kicked down.</p><p></p><p>But this time, there was no such thing! The Heavenly King's temper had improved?!</p><p></p><p>Could he act freely now?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The encounter between the Monkey King and the Heavenly King seemed to have... made the Heavenly King more favorably inclined towards him.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was in a great mood, his palm pressing on the Heavenly King statue, once again absorbing the temple god's chess piece! When the second dark golden Heavenly King chess piece was absorbed by him.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King then moved.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound reverberated throughout the entire temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, without hesitation, he grasped the Flying Thunder chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Time to beat a hasty retreat!</p><p></p><p>Well, it seems the so-called favorability was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, this trip has allowed him to absorb two dark golden Heavenly King chess pieces, which is enough!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Golden Palace.</p><p></p><p>It returned to a lifeless silence.</p><p></p><p>No vitality, no movement, as quiet as an ancient sealed tomb.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>There was a faint laughter echoing.</p><p></p><p>"This stealthy skill..."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite similar."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Falling Flower Alley, inside the independent workshop.</p><p></p><p>The winter rain was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned, the icy cold rainwater lashing his neck, seeping into his clothes. But it was instantly evaporated by his powerful blood energy!</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the dry ground in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che slowly opened his eyes, his eyes seeming to emit countless golden rays.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled, still deeply moved by the scene in the Golden Palace.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, no longer thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly King is indeed the Heavenly King, not tolerating the slightest bit..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up, stretching, and his tense bones and muscles let out a series of crackling sounds, rumbling one after another.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body... has become stronger!"</p><p></p><p>"The [Face of the Monkey King] has been stimulated, the mythical soldier has tempered my flesh... just like how Xixia's Fire Spear was stimulated by the Dragon God bloodline of the Sea Meeting Hall, assisting in body tempering."</p><p></p><p>"Once the mythical soldier has been adapted, I may be able to wield the divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his sleeves, Li Che felt refreshed.</p><p></p><p>This body tempering was an unexpected gain, making his Furnace Sect Master physique even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>After adapting to the slightly enhanced physique in the courtyard, Li Che put on a hat, wore a black robe, and went to the Cliff Observatory Treasure Pavilion to work.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, the [Immortal in the Painting] clones were diligently cultivating, their divine foundation reaching perfection, beginning to observe the divine physiognomy.</p><p></p><p>As a wood carver, Li Che could naturally be self-sufficient when it came to divine statues.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine physiognomy he was preparing was the Seven-Element Divine Sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Currently, for Li Che to carve the Seven-Element Divine Sculpture was still quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>Every time he carved a Seven-Element Divine Sculpture, his divine sense would weaken. However, the problem was not significant, as he could recover and then carve again.</p><p></p><p>And he infused the impressions of mythological figures from his past life into them.</p><p></p><p>The carved divine statues were lifelike and filled with divinity.</p><p></p><p>Observing the divine physiognomy, the efficiency was extremely high!</p><p></p><p>He let the clones observe the divine physiognomy, while he himself went to complete his daily tasks.</p><p></p><p>Clocking in at the Cliff Observatory.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Cliff Observatory Treasure Pavilion, the charcoal fire was burning, warm as spring, extremely comfortable, allowing one's spirit to relax slightly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong had taken off her shoes and was squatting on a chair, reading a romance novel, snacking on melon seeds, engrossed.</p><p></p><p>Li Che greeted Shangguan Qinghong and then headed upstairs to the Cliff Observatory Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He was now a Second-Class Guest Retainer, his status different from the past, with an independent office area.</p><p></p><p>The area was extremely large, allowing him to cultivate, carve, and seclude himself, among other things.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he reached the second floor, he saw the Deputy Supervisor of the Cliff Observatory, Lu Yao, coming down from upstairs, accompanied by Tao Ren.</p><p></p><p>Tao Ren's eyes suddenly lit up when he saw Li Che: "Uncle Che, we're going to visit Old Master Tao Sangjia, do you want to come with us?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>His Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Chariot had not yet been fully forged, so he would not go visit Tao Sangjia.</p><p></p><p>Tao Sangjia had instructed him to come see him once he had completed the Guanyin Lotus Main Battle Chariot mechanism.</p><p></p><p>For now, the mechanism was not yet complete, so he was in no hurry.</p><p></p><p>These days, Li Che had also been cultivating that profound mechanism technique, the Nine Mechanism Seals.</p><p></p><p>This Nine Mechanism Seals was not a Sect Master's technique, nor was it a Grand Sect Master or Martial Saint's technique.</p><p></p><p>But its power was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, with the help of the [Immortal Craftsman] LV4 Dao Fruit, Li Che had barely grasped two Mechanism Seals.</p><p></p><p>These two Mechanism Seals, when imprinted into a mechanism beast, could make the mechanism beast more agile.</p><p></p><p>Although Tao Sangjia had something he wanted Li Che's help with.</p><p></p><p>But it was not now, as Li Che had no need for spiritual wood, so he would not go to the Divine Sculpture Ridge for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Tao Ren was a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He just simply wanted to get on good terms with Xixia's father, to gain some favor and goodwill.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to be like Gong Yuanliang, Hai Chaosheng, and Gongyangxiu, constantly circling around Xixia!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take a different path! First, conquer Xixia's father! Li Che looked at Tao Ren indifferently, this little rascal had impure intentions.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao smiled and looked at Li Che, he was very satisfied with Li Che.</p><p></p><p>His wood carving talent was excellent, and he was not arrogant or reckless, coming to the Cliff Observatory to work every day, carving wood sculptures and honing his skills.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that his cultivation was a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Warrior with a Mysterious Vein, at the Divine Foundation Realm...</p><p></p><p>As the father of a genius like Xixia, this level of cultivation was indeed a stark contrast.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Ah Che, I've received news that in the City of the Dao, the Garrison Temple Supervisor, a Grand Sect Master realm Supervisor, is accompanying a Garrison Temple precious talent, escorting the Four Divine Weapons [Prison Lotus Fire-Wind Golden Light Wheel] with the Divine Element True Man of the Qianyuan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"When the Fire-Wind Golden Light Wheel arrives at the Golden Light Prefecture, it will be time to open the Mysterious Temple of the Third Prince and initiate the Temple God Resonance."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao reminded Li Che.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's brow furrowed, so it has finally arrived? "Your daughter Xixia has excellent talent, she should be affected by the temple god's divinity, and may even undergo a bloodline mutation, gaining an extraordinary bloodline talent!"</p><p></p><p>"So this Temple God Resonance is a great opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao, who highly valued Li Che, reminded him: "These days, have her imitate the image of the Third Prince's temple god..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing... Recently, traces of the Hunting God Pavilion have been discovered in the Golden Light Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao said.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's footsteps paused, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"That notorious assassin organization, the Hunting God Pavilion, which is famous in the Divine Capital and the City of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao nodded: "Be careful, the Hunting God Pavilion is an assassin organization... They are willing to assassinate for money, it seems the Hunting God Pavilion is expanding its business to the prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>"The Young Prince may contact the Hunting God Pavilion to make a move against Xixia, Xixia defeating the Young Prince of the Sea Meeting Hall is one thing, but if the Young Prince wants to eliminate a rival, it's another matter..."</p><p></p><p>"These days, have Xixia pay attention to her safety."</p><p></p><p>If Lu Yao didn't value Li Che, he wouldn't have given him such a reminder.</p><p></p><p>Li Che solemnly clasped his hands in gratitude to Lu Yao.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yao waved his hand and, with young Tao Ren, left the Cliff Observatory Treasure Pavilion, getting into a carriage and heading towards the Divine Sculpture Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood there, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion had never interfered in business outside the Divine Capital and the City of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>But now, they seemed to have expanded to the prefecture...</p><p></p><p>The Hunting God Pavilion's assassins were still adept at the art of assassination.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to assassination, Li Che believed he was not inferior to anyone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned home from work, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>He first went to the alleys of Falling Flower Alley, packed some food, and then directly returned to Zheng Leifeng.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya was practicing martial arts in the drizzling rain, her bones just recently tempered. Although she had undergone Li Che's Untainted Heart refinement and her martial talent had improved, her foundation was still too poor, and it was unlikely she would be able to break through the Bone Tempering realm in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't mind, cultivating very diligently, each punch and stance precise and well-executed, no matter how tedious, she would not complain at all.</p><p></p><p>Because she knew that only by diligently cultivating could she have the slightest chance of catching up to her daughter and husband!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya even felt a bit dejected, feeling that it was she, as the mother, who was holding back Xixia's talent.</p><p></p><p>It was she, as the mother,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There is no such thing as innate talent.</p><p></p><p>My husband is the Ox Demon, and he definitely has the innate talent for cultivation. Xixia must have inherited her husband's cultivation talent.</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya's eyes flickered with excitement, just thinking about her husband when he returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Che entered the courtyard and saw Zhang Ya practicing her punches. He immediately smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>After pointing out a few things to Zhang Ya, Li Che saw that it was about time, so he took Zhang Ya's hand, and the couple went together to Golden Peak to pick up Xixia from school.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother!" Xixia was on the big platform, practicing punches with many other children.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Che arrived at Golden Peak, he almost went dizzy.</p><p></p><p>Because the attire of these children was really...</p><p></p><p>Each child had their hair tied up in horns, wearing red belly bands, and their bodies were wrapped in red silk.</p><p></p><p>Imitating the appearance of the Third Prince!</p><p></p><p>Even the chubby Zhou Peng had this same attire, becoming a meat ball version of the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>The red belly band could not even cover his sagging belly button, which was truly an eyesore! As for the dazzlingly beautiful Yun'e, even this attire could not conceal her natural beauty.</p><p></p><p>Xixia was also dressed this way, barefoot, wearing a red belly band and little shorts, seeing Li Che and Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Excitedly, she jumped up, her little feet moving rapidly.</p><p></p><p>She rushed towards Li Che, the red silk fluttering wildly behind her. "Father!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia let out a loud cheer, shooting like a bullet towards Li Che, and colliding into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>Li Che helplessly hugged his overly lively daughter.</p><p></p><p>The other children also ran over following their big sister.</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at the group of "Third Princes" with dizzying eyes, feeling a bit amused and distressed.</p><p></p><p>They had already started preparing for the Temple God Resonance early.</p><p></p><p>But this scene, how could it be so ridiculous?</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo and Wang Kuyu floated over, the rain parting beside them, making them appear quite transcendent.</p><p></p><p>"For the Temple God Resonance... it's like this."</p><p></p><p>"It's always been this way, most of them will dress according to the Third Prince's appearance, to increase their resonance with the Temple God."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Little San, Yanguan... even when they were young, they all experienced this. Even I did the same."</p><p></p><p>"Red belly bands, horns, red silk wrapped around the body... the spiritual children of Golden Palace have mostly had such attire."</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but laugh: "What about Elder Qingshan? Does he also have this kind of dark history?"</p><p></p><p>"Dark history?" Nan Liehuo was taken aback at the words.</p><p></p><p>This description... was quite apt.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qingshan didn't have this, he was one who revealed his talent halfway and was accepted as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo explained.</p><p></p><p>"Ahe, these days, why don't you leave Xixia at Golden Peak?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that there are traces of assassins from the Hunting God Chamber in the capital city, I'm afraid that Prince Jie Haihui will hire Hunting God Chamber assassins to target Xixia."</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo said.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time Xu Jiuqing plotted to target Xixia, Nan Liehuo realized that Li Che no longer had as much trust in their methods of protecting Xixia.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Nan Liehuo smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dwell on it too much.</p><p></p><p>"With Elder Qingshan at Zheng Lei Peak, and the protective item I prepared for Xixia, she should be able to hold out until Elder Qingshan intervenes."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, in the upcoming days, don't change Xixia's image... maintain this image to the bone, it will be beneficial for the Temple God Resonance."</p><p></p><p>"This is from experience."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving Golden Peak, Nan Liehuo reminded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Che and Zhang Ya carried Xixia and left Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, Sect Master Shifu! Goodbye, Taoist Grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>Xixia enthusiastically bid farewell to Nan Liehuo and Wang Kuyu.</p><p></p><p>Towards familiar people, Xixia would always show enough enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Golden Palace, the winter rain was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>The fine rain was sprinkling on the land.</p><p></p><p>Bringing the clear and bright color to the capital city, which had been covered in heavy snow for the entire winter.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu wore a wide-brimmed hat, his sleeves supported by the arms condensed with true qi.</p><p></p><p>He sat in an inconspicuous tavern, holding a wine cup, slowly drinking it down.</p><p></p><p>The wine entered his throat, without any delicious wine taste.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just the owner's homemade wine.</p><p></p><p>But it had a simple and homely atmosphere, which Xue Daofu quite liked.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a figure wearing a drooping veil hat, wrapped in a black robe, and wearing a black iron mask, sat across from Xue Daofu.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao is in decline."</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God is about to strike."</p><p></p><p>They exchanged the passwords, confirming each other's identities.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu did not pour any wine for the newcomer, still pouring and drinking for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Why has the young prince invited a great master to meet? Do you have any assassination tasks to issue?"</p><p></p><p>"We of the Hunting God Chamber are like this, even if you are the target of assassination, you also have the right to issue assassination tasks, as long as the price is high enough."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Hunting God Chamber has entered the capital city, it seems the young prince will become the Chamber's first employer."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu glanced at the figure in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe leaned back in the chair and said, "Young prince... who do you want to kill?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu took a sip of the yellow wine and put down the cup.</p><p></p><p>He said indifferently, "The Underworld... the Ox Demon, Horse-Face, and the Monkey King."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe paused in their movements and shook their head.</p><p></p><p>"I won't accept."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Xue Daofu frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon, Horse-Face of the Underworld, and the Monkey King, their whereabouts are uncertain, the difficulty of assassination is extremely high, and the failure rate is also extremely high... and that Monkey King, even has the strength of a great master."</p><p></p><p>"For the Hunting God Chamber's first task in the capital city, we cannot accept one with an extremely high failure rate."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"And the denizens of the Underworld... their origins are mysterious, suspected to be related to the ancient destroyed Qitian Monastery, so the price for assassinating the denizens of the Underworld will be double the normal price."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu sneered, "The Hunting God Chamber that claims it can even hunt down Temple Gods... is just this much."</p><p></p><p>"You're actually afraid to accept any tasks?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Underworld really that scary?"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe shook their head and smiled lightly, "Senior Xue, you also don't need to use the tactic of provocation, you've already been beaten by the monkey, this scar is so blatantly exposed, how angry you must be!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Xue Daofu was furious in his heart! Not only was he beaten by the monkey, but he was also robbed by the monkey! This scar was so openly revealed, how infuriating!</p><p></p><p>But Xue Daofu still held it in, this would eventually become the subject of his ridicule.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's start with a simpler assassination task first, and then take on this task of assassinating the denizens of the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The figure in the black robe nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Then, young prince... who else do you want to assassinate?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it Li Nuanxi you want to assassinate?"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe smiled, as if having expected this.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu's gaze flickered, and he looked at the figure in the black robe in a strange way, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Nuanxi... the young prince wants to kill her with his own hands."</p><p></p><p>"The ones you want the Hunting God Chamber to assassinate..."</p><p></p><p>"Are Li Nuanxi's parents."</p><p></p><p>"Li Che and his wife."</p><p></p><p>"The young prince... wants to make Li Nuanxi an orphan, to destroy her every precious thing bit by bit."</p><p></p><p>"First her parents, then her teachers, then her senior disciples..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu said lightly.</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind the black mask of the figure were sharp.</p><p></p><p>What a cruel young prince.</p><p></p><p>He has indeed inherited the ruthlessness and vengefulness of the Dragon Princess.</p><p></p><p>"This task... isn't too difficult, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No one would have thought that the young prince's assassination target..."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Is Li Che and his wife..."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe narrowed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che, the father of the spiritual prodigy Li Nuanxi of the Golden Palace Branch, at the Spirit Base Realm, Blood Profound Vein Realm, the assassination price, two Seventh-Grade Spirit Crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Ya, Li Nuanxi's mother, Li Che's wife, Tempering Bone Cultivation... the assassination price, ten Ninth-Grade Spirit Crystals."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe stated the prices indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu narrowed his eyes, "The price to kill this Li Che is so high?"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe looked at him, "Li Che also has another identity, the Second-Grade Celestial Scribe, to assassinate a Second-Grade Celestial Scribe, one must bear the wrath of the Celestial Sage Luo Yao..."</p><p></p><p>"The price naturally cannot be low."</p><p></p><p>"This is also considering that Li Che's cultivation is not high."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"So this Li Che also has such an identity."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was more surprised that the Hunting God Chamber's intelligence had already investigated so thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the prices for hunting down the Ox Demon, Horse-Face, and the Monkey King?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu asked.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe curled their fingers, lightly tapping the table, "The Ox Demon and Horse-Face, ten Seventh-Grade Spirit Crystals each, the Monkey King... three Sixth-Grade Spirit Crystals."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a great master with considerable wealth, at this moment... he was still shocked by these assassination prices.</p><p></p><p>How could they be so expensive?</p><p></p><p>After all, Xue Daofu's assassination price in the Hunting God Chamber was only one Sixth-Grade Spirit Crystal!</p><p></p><p>The price of the Monkey King was actually two Sixth-Grade Spirit Crystals higher than him!</p><p></p><p>"First take the lives of Li Che and his wife!"</p><p></p><p>"The denizens of the Underworld... can be discussed later."</p><p></p><p>Xue Daofu said indifferently, in his eyes, the lives of Li Che and his wife... were easy pickings for the Hunting God Chamber.</p><p></p><p>But the denizens of the Underworld were troublesome and difficult, and this time the employer was the young prince, so he dared not rashly issue the task.</p><p></p><p>Just complete the young prince's request one by one.</p><p></p><p>At the time when the Temple God Resonance is about to begin, let Li Nuanxi become an orphan!</p><p></p><p>Disturb her heart, disrupt her ambition!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zheng Lei Peak.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's family returned, holding an oil-paper umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, Xixia was still wearing the horns, a red belly band, and a Vajra Necklace around her neck.</p><p></p><p>She really did look quite like the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen was puffing on a tobacco pipe, puffing out smoke, looking up and down at Xixia's distinctive attire, unable to hold back his laughter.</p><p></p><p>Xixia bared her teeth and claws, not letting Old Chen laugh.</p><p></p><p>The old and young started to play and fight in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Grandmother Su brought Lü Chi as well.</p><p></p><p>When Lü Chi appeared, he was also dressed the same as Xixia, but Lü Chi had always been dressed this way, so there wasn't too much of a contrast.</p><p></p><p>"Lü Chi has participated in a Temple God Resonance before, he's here to guide Xixia."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan and Grandmother Su sat down.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya poured them some clear tea.</p><p></p><p>"Is Lü Chi also going to participate this time?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan nodded, "Give it a try, who knows, he might even obtain the inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, not only Lü Chi, but any spiritual child or prodigy whose age has not exceeded the limit, even if they have participated in the Temple God Resonance before, they will still continue to participate."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this session is a bit different."</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded.</p><p></p><p>This also made Li Che feel a sense of tension and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Although Xixia had the Purple Flame Snake Spear Hidden in her arm...</p><p></p><p>But it's not necessarily certain that she can win the top spot in the Temple God Resonance! The Temple Guardians, the Celestial Scribes, Prince Jie Haihui, and even the hidden Corpse God Sect, they must have also prepared spiritual children...</p><p></p><p>The strength of these forces cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>If one underestimates the world, becomes arrogant and self-confident.</p><p></p><p>Then a huge loss will be suffered! As parents, they will always be anxious about their children's performance in examinations.</p><p></p><p>Even if the child is already very excellent, they will still worry about unexpected mishaps, poor performance, and so on.</p><p></p><p>So, they still need to increase Xixia's foundation.</p><p></p><p>Since the parents can provide the children with better capital and foundation, they will certainly strive to give the best!  At least...</p><p></p><p>Properly stimulate that Purple Flame Snake Spear.</p><p></p><p>Just like last time, when Xixia activated the power of the Purple Flame Snake Spear, she suppressed Prince Jie Haihui, defeating him thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>It was a process of Xixia and the Spear fusing.</p><p></p><p>But now, the fusion degree between Xixia and the Spear is too low, she can't even summon the physical form of the Spear.</p><p></p><p>If she can summon the Spear during the Temple God Resonance...</p><p></p><p>Then Xixia would truly be an invincible supreme emperor, looking down on the world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, if Xixia has to wait for her own Temple God Resonance to cultivate the Spear, and temper her body with the Spear, who knows how long it will take...</p><p></p><p>As Xixia's father, Li Che naturally has the responsibility and obligation to help his daughter strengthen her foundation!</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Flame Snake Spear was obtained by Xixia from the Golden Divine Palace."</p><p></p><p>"If I use the dark golden Heavenly King Chess Piece to stimulate it, I wonder..." Li Che's gaze flickered, suddenly having an idea.</p><p></p><p>If the dark golden Heavenly King Chess Piece doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Li Che can even try using the divine weapon [Monkey King's Face] to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>The [Monkey King's Face] should be able to stimulate the Golden Heavenly King in the Divine Palace...</p><p></p><p>It should also be able to stimulate the Spear, right? And even the false Dragon God of the young prince could stimulate the Spear.</p><p></p><p>There's no way the genuine divine weapon [Monkey King's Face] would be inferior to the Dragon God's impure bloodline, right?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Xu Woodcarving Shop was one of the top-ranked woodcarving shops in the outer city, often receiving orders from the inner city. They had an extremely high demand for all kinds of woodcarvings.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was carving landscape paintings, carving statues of bodhisattvas or Buddhas, or even various deities that Li Che had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>For the workers, transporting the wood materials and finished carvings was all done at a fixed piece-rate pay, which wasn't much, and it was backbreaking work.</p><p></p><p>But if one could become an official woodcarving master and carve a finished product, they could earn at least ten taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>Li Che had even heard that Master Chen had once carved a "Thousand-Armed Guanyin Holding a Child Woodcarving", which took about a month to complete, and he earned a whole sheet of gold leaf, which was equivalent to a hundred taels!</p><p></p><p>That was a skill that could make an ordinary commoner extremely wealthy!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart started racing. In the past, he wouldn't have dared to dream of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Because woodcarving skills required cultivation from a young age, and also tested one's talent and artistry. Like the apprentices in the woodcarving shop, many of them were sent to learn from the age of five or six, with their families spending silver to support them.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had started working at the woodcarving shop at the age of thirteen, already having missed the prime age.</p><p></p><p>Although he had once had the idea of self-learning, after trying for a few days, he gave up.</p><p></p><p>How could he, with just a few days of self-study, compete with others who had endured the hardship of learning for almost their entire childhood? Moreover, woodcarving was one thing to observe, but a completely different matter to actually put into practice.</p><p></p><p>"I should try to find an opportunity to try the 'Immortal Craftsman' Dao fruit, perhaps it could truly grant me the talent for woodcarving?" Li Che couldn't help but feel hopeful.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, causing Li Che to calm down and become more focused. He buried the idea of becoming a woodcarving master for now and started working diligently.</p><p></p><p>Transporting finished woodcarvings was different from transporting wood materials, requiring more care, as any bumps or scratches could damage the carvings.</p><p></p><p>He wrapped them in cloth and tied them with hemp ropes to prevent the carvings from being damaged by the ropes while carrying them.</p><p></p><p>Lifting a six-eyed bodhisattva statue, Li Che walked carefully towards the inner room.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at Master Chen's workshop, he placed the statue down, unwrapped the cloth, and checked for any signs of friction, relieved to find none.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen, I've brought the bodhisattva statue inside. Now I'll go get the 'Curved Willow', you need a larger one, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che loosened his shoulders and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen was already sitting on his work chair, sharpening his carving knives with a whetstone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, hurry up. This time, we need to carve a 'Nine Children Embracing Lotus' statue, the process is quite troublesome, and the inner city is in a rush to get it."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen picked up the carving knife, squinting his eyes to check the sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che returned to the snow-covered courtyard and was about to carry the piece of curved willow wood he had selected.</p><p></p><p>But when he touched the curved willow wood, he felt the "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit within him slightly pulsing, and a strange feeling arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This curved willow doesn't seem quite suitable for carving the 'Nine Children Embracing Lotus' statue."</p><p></p><p>Li Che murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, woodcarving masters would personally select the wood materials, but there were exceptions. Some masters, confident in their skills, were too lazy to go out in the cold and snowy weather to choose the wood.</p><p></p><p>But if the worker selected the wrong wood, even if the master was good-tempered, they might deduct the transportation fee.</p><p></p><p>Not only would he have to carry the wood multiple times, but the money would also be deducted... a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Li Che abandoned the "curved willow" and went back to the wood pile to select another piece, using his palms to feel the wood until he found one that seemed quite suitable under the influence of the "Immortal Craftsman" Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>Carrying this slightly heavier "curved willow" to Master Chen's workshop, he presented it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Not bad, little Li, your eye is good. This wood is just right!" Master Chen was pleasantly surprised, as this piece of wood almost perfectly matched the "Nine Children Embracing Lotus" he had envisioned in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With just a few strokes of the knife, he could outline the basic shape, saving a lot of the effort in conceptualizing the design.</p><p></p><p>Li Che smiled, not saying anything to seek praise.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen complimented him briefly, then began preparing for the carving work.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, help me move this wood to the workbench. I heard your daughter was born, so I'll give you some extra pay for this task."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen stood up and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's eyes lit up, and he quickly agreed, then put on the hemp ropes and started carrying the heavy "curved willow" to place it on the metal workbench.</p><p></p><p>"The inner city is really pressing us, lately they've been ordering a lot of wood carvings of young boys and girls. It's probably related to the recent sensational talk of the 'Spiritual Infant Overlord'. The tastes of the inner city nobles are always changing."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head and muttered.</p><p></p><p>"We have to finish it in five days, my old bones... I'm afraid I'll be working myself to exhaustion."</p><p></p><p>"But the pay is good, hehe, little Li, guess how much this order will be worth?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen rubbed his hands, chatting and laughing with Li Che as he approached the curved willow wood, now dampened by the heavy snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che wiped the sweat from his forehead and exhaled, "With a five-day delivery, it should be at least fifty taels, right?"</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of the "Nine Children Embracing Lotus" statue was not as high as the "Thousand-Armed Guanyin".</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fifty taels? Haha... That's too little, it's missing at least a golden leaf!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen let out a hearty laugh, then slapped the wood with his palm. The skin on his arm seemed to take on a reddish hue, and heat emanated from his palm, driving out the moisture within the wood! The scorching sensation rolled towards Li Che, as if he was facing a blazing furnace. Li Che took a deep breath, both amazed at the wood carving being worth one hundred and fifty taels, and in awe and envy of Master Chen's mystical skills.</p><p></p><p>These wood carving masters not only had craftsmanship, but also the rumored martial arts! Those who became wood carving masters were all practitioners of inner energy, able to channel their inner energy to dry the wood, saving a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the inner energy is infused into the wood carvings, the carvings will possess a certain charm. This charm is the true talent that allows the wood carving masters to make the noble lords of the inner city willingly spend money.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen glanced at the astonished and envious Li Che, and said jokingly, "Want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to learn, you'll have to spend money. Although you can't learn the superior inner energy techniques, you can still learn the common inner energy methods left behind by the Xu family in the outer city."</p><p></p><p>"With a few decades of arduous cultivation, you'll be able to develop inner energy."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred a little. "Master Chen, do you know the price of the inner energy techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"The superior inner energy techniques can't be bought even with money, you can only learn them at the Xu family in the inner city. Normal people can't learn them."</p><p></p><p>"As for the common inner energy techniques in the outer city, you can buy them with money. The cheapest one... would be thirty taels. What, are you actually interested?"  Master Chen said with a half-smile while channeling his inner energy to dry the wood.</p><p></p><p>"Your child has just been born, you should save your money... Even if you buy the inner energy technique, learning it is one thing, and mastering it is another."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head, giving Li Che some well-intentioned advice, seeing that Li Che seemed genuinely interested.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen raised an eyebrow, "You're quite thoughtful. It's a pity you didn't try learning wood carving when you were young. If you want to buy the inner energy technique, come to me. I have one, and you can learn it for twenty taels."</p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't immediately agree, he just smiled and said he would think about it.</p><p></p><p>He then left Master Chen's workshop.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Li Che continued to be busy, helping other wood carving masters move wood materials and finished carvings. He also helped the apprentices in the shop move small wood blocks, earning some wages.</p><p></p><p>The shop provided lunch, though simple, at least it was a hot meal that could fill them up and give them the energy to work.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, after receiving thirty-five large casting copper coins for the day's work, Li Che, weary from the day's labor, set out for home, braving the wind and snow, and buying some charcoal on the way.</p><p></p><p>As he reached the maze of alleys, the night had completely fallen, but the dim glow of the oil lamp in his humble abode made Li Che's steps quicken.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, I'm back."</p><p></p><p>He quickly opened and closed the door to prevent the cold wind carrying snow from entering and robbing the warmth inside.</p><p></p><p>After adding some charcoal to the stove, Li Che tiptoed to the bedside, where Xixia lay wide awake.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Che, Xixia let out a cheerful giggle. Li Che's heart melted as he picked her up and gently rocked her.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya looked at the scene with a soft gaze, then brought out the steaming noodles she had prepared for Li Che's dinner.</p><p></p><p>For a poor family like theirs, there was no concept of postpartum confinement. As long as she prepared the evening meal, that was considered her "confinement" for Zhang Ya.</p><p></p><p>After the couple finished their dinner, Li Che let Zhang Ya rest, and he washed the bowls himself. He then took a small piece of wood and a carving knife, returning to the room.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya, holding Xixia, watched curiously. "Husband, what are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>Illuminated by the dim oil lamp, Li Che flexed his fingers, which cracked, and smiled, "I've learned a bit of wood carving at the workshop recently."</p><p></p><p>"My dear, watch carefully!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya couldn't help but chuckle. "Husband, over the years you've learned all sorts of skills, but after a few days you'd always say it's better to just let it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che's lips curved slightly. "Wife, don't tease me too much. Haven't you heard the saying, 'Thirty years on the east bank, thirty years on the west'?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm different now, I'm a father!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya pressed her lips together, her eyes filled with gentle amusement.</p><p></p><p>What does becoming a father have to do with learning wood carving?</p><p></p><p>Li Che just smiled, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, and the carving techniques and skills for a six-eyed Bodhisattva statue seemed to gush out of his mind like wringing a wet cotton ball.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes again, there was a flash of brilliance in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Calm and composed, his sturdy fingers gripped the carving knife and began the first stroke on the wood...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

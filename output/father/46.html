        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" technique, Li Che concealed his aura and blended into the darkness, indifferently watching the stunned and dumbfounded Zhao Xuan who had emerged.</p><p></p><p>This woman who had entered the martial arts practice at the same time as him had just reached the peak of her cultivation, but now Li Che... could easily defeat a hundred Zhao Xuans, posing no threat whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Yet she dared to muster the courage to come to the battlefield of the "Blood Warrior", even though it was after the battle... the danger factor was still very high.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Zhao Xuan had come with the intention of collecting the bodies of the heroes, and not as a backup of the Lingying Sect...</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his sleeve, releasing the hidden crossbow that could have blown Zhao Xuan's head off at any moment, and silently retreated.</p><p></p><p>The active power brought by the "Dragon Elephant Vajra" attainment dissipated, and a strong sense of fatigue and weakness suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There was a feeling of draining his own vital essence.</p><p></p><p>The second stage of the "Angry Vajra", the improvement was too great, transcending the ordinary and undergoing a transformation of life form! The effect was excellent, the explosive power was extremely strong... but the consumption was also extremely high.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Che felt that his vital energy was somewhat depleted. After using the thunderous explosion to kill the three high-level Blood Warriors of the Lingying Sect, his legs felt a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>However, his body cultivation had now reached the peak of "Tempering the Bones", with extremely strong recovery power. By the time he darted back to his own courtyard, his legs were no longer weak.</p><p></p><p>Using the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" technique to conceal his aura, he circled his courtyard three times to confirm that there were no hidden Lingying Sect disciples, then stealthily returned to the interior.</p><p></p><p>Removing the bloodstained clothes and mask, Li Che exhaled a mouthful of turbid air and directly dashed into his own woodshed.</p><p></p><p>He poured out all the "dirty items" wrapped in the clothes of the Blood Warrior he had crushed.</p><p></p><p>This was the harvest from his latest battle!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's mood was unusually excited, and he unconsciously rubbed his hands.</p><p></p><p>Friends who often kill people should all know that looting the bodies after killing is such a good habit for wandering the rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Che's first time looting bodies, and previously, when he had killed people, he had actually forgotten this important matter.</p><p></p><p>"It's still a lack of experience in wandering the rivers and lakes, too young, too young..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The loot was not much, just a few bottles and jars, two small books, and a wooden sculpture of a "Three-headed Six-armed Angry Lingyin" the size of a thumb, found on the body of a Lingying Sect Blood Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, filled with an excited mood, began to count.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen gold leaves, and three silver notes, each worth five hundred taels... This wave, I've caught an overwhelming fortune, worthy of a Blood Warrior, really rich!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shone brightly. Even though he had now become a talented wood carver at Xu's Wood Carving Shop, to obtain so much wealth in one fell swoop still made his scalp tingle with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The silver notes are not easy to handle, but there are plenty of people in the market willing to buy them, though at a discounted price."</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, there were various bottles and jars. Li Che glanced at them, many of which were for treating falls and injuries, as well as tonics for nourishing the vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a porcelain bottle poured out a round, densely fragrant and pungent bloody pill.</p><p></p><p>After identifying it for a while, Li Che had no clue, but just by smelling it, he could feel his vital energy surging.</p><p></p><p>"This must be from the body of Guo Zhan... It's probably not an ordinary pill."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I'll have a chance to ask around the market."</p><p></p><p>Li Che put away the pill and finally his gaze fell on the two books, and his mind was already rubbing his hands in anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the first book, it was something he had found on the body of a Lingying Sect Blood Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Flipping open the first page, six big characters jumped out at him.</p><p></p><p>"Six-Stage Blood Replacement Technique!"</p><p></p><p>This was a book on a blood replacement technique!</p><p></p><p>And it was not the ordinary three-stage inferior blood replacement technique.</p><p></p><p>Six-stage blood replacement, belonging to the intermediate blood replacement technique.</p><p></p><p>Blood replacement requires the nine-stage refinement of vital energy and blood, to achieve the state of mercury-like vital energy and gold-like marrow, only then can it be considered complete!</p><p></p><p>"It's also a solution to the urgent problem, though it's not a divine technique, but divine techniques are already precious, not getting one is also normal... With the blood replacement technique, I can start working on blood replacement..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was not too disappointed, after all, the cultivation he had revealed on the surface was just at the initial "Tempering the Bones" stage, to get a blood replacement technique from Xu's shop, he would need to reach the peak of "Tempering the Bones". </p><p></p><p>According to the normal timeline, it would take about two to three years...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bone-tempering process reached its completion... Combining the setting of a talented martial artist, it seems reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Shifting his gaze, it fell upon the books that were taken from Guo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>After flipping through the pages, Li Che's eyes suddenly narrowed! It was not the Divinity Technique, nor the Blood Transformation Technique... but a martial art! And not an ordinary one at that...</p><p></p><p>It was, a divine martial art! The Furious Howling Wind and Thunder Arrow!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Xu's Woodcarving Shop, on the long stone street.</p><p></p><p>Extremely dry, even somewhat scorching hot, faintly emanating heat, the snowflakes falling from the sky were evaporated before even reaching the ground.</p><p></p><p>Several figures flitted over, all wearing wooden child masks, hands behind their backs, landing on the houses by the long street.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the 'Wrathful Prince', a divine foundation technique at the Four Guardian level, actually appeared in Flashing Thunder City..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the opportunity I taught?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Sect Master also cultivates the 'Wrath Divinity', this child's divinity has not yet forged the divine foundation, if he can be devoured by the Sect Master... the Sect Master may have the chance to advance further, and condense the 'Three-Headed Six-Armed Wrathful Spirit Child' divine form!"</p><p></p><p>A figure wearing a smiling mask spoke with a tone full of laughter, unable to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"However, this 'Capture the Ox' plan tonight has completely failed, Sī Mù Bái... has also suffered heavy injuries, the Ninth Brilliance level 'Furious Howling Demon Subduer' encountered the 'Wrathful Prince', it was simply hung up and beaten around, haha, how tragic."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for that old lady from the Sī family who had forged the divine foundation... Sī Mù Bái would have been flayed and sinewed, haha..."</p><p></p><p>"As an ally, I should feel sympathy and sorrow for Sī Mù Bái, why do I want to laugh... but I can't stop it, haha..."</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the other few people under the masks were extremely solemn, not even bothering to pay attention to the one who couldn't stop laughing.</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon... has someone behind him! No wonder he suddenly appeared in Flashing Thunder City, disrupting our Sect's great matter..."</p><p></p><p>"So-called heroes, indeed all have hidden hands manipulating them..."</p><p></p><p>Their voices were heavy, because they couldn't take down the Ox Demon, and the one who could manifest the 'Wrathful Prince' divine foundation was even more mysterious and unsettling, causing fear and unease.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure wearing the smiling child mask burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, why do you care so much, isn't the Ox Demon supposed to be a hero?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone supporting a hero to appear is just to stabilize the people's hearts, give them a psychological pillar, not wanting the people of Flashing Thunder City to collapse so quickly..."</p><p></p><p>"And to ruin the hero, that's the easiest thing!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the 'Wrathful Prince' is not weak, he has not yet forged the divine foundation, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon stinks, the people lose their so-called heroic pillar, haha, the one behind him will have to use more methods to remedy it, the more they intervene, the more they will eventually be exposed."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After finishing the inventory and hiding the dirty items, Li Che returned to the courtyard from the firewood room, rubbing his body with cold snow to remove the bloody smell, before stepping into the house.</p><p></p><p>The house was brightly lit!</p><p></p><p>His wife Zhang Ya was nervously gripping the "Wood Raven", remembering the mechanism usage Li Che had taught her.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the returning person was her husband, the tense mood finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly took three steps in two, coming to Li Che's side, circling him once, carefully examining, seeing that Li Che had no injuries, she finally let out a sigh of relief, then threw herself into Li Che's embrace, tightly wrapping her arms around his waist.</p><p></p><p>As if wanting to vent all the unease and anxiety of the night.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright now."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently patted his wife's soft shoulders, feeling her slightly trembling body, speaking calmly to comfort her.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife silently embraced each other, Xī Xī lying arrogantly on the bed, kicking off the quilt, snoring loudly, just like a gift...</p><p></p><p>The warmth from the charcoal stove in the room dispersed the bitter cold, creating an extremely cozy atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt the one in his arms move, and saw Zhang Ya raise her pretty face, her eyes filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>"Husband..."</p><p></p><p>"I want to learn martial arts."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The best seedling for cultivating the divine nature?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes narrowed, but he was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had thought about it earlier, what was so special about the spirit embryo that the Spirit Embryo Sect cared so much about.</p><p></p><p>It must be related to the divine nature.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Spirit Embryo Sect should be malicious and despicable. If Xixia falls into their hands, she will be raised, and when she grows up and her divine nature is abundant, she will be forcibly devoured and extracted..."</p><p></p><p>"Being a raised spirit embryo is definitely not a good thing..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen drank a sip of wine and shook his head solemnly.</p><p></p><p>That's definitely not a good thing, Li Che knew clearly, so he had been treading on thin ice since Xixia was born.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows, Li Che was thinking about countermeasures, wondering how many years it would take for him to grow strong enough to single-handedly destroy the Spirit Embryo Sect.</p><p></p><p>He had the Dao fruit bound to his daughter, and as he grew slowly, he would become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Gently stroking Xixia's head, the little girl's innocent eyes blinked, shining with purity and childlike innocence.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen let out a breath: "Actually, there is a way to deal with the crisis brought by the Spirit Embryo Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Old Chen, his eyes flashing with confusion, signaling him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit embryos are rare, but they do exist. The spirit embryos born to commoners are pitiful, like lambs, and they usually have a hard time growing up. They will be targeted at a very young age, not only by the Spirit Embryo Sect, but also by some other sects that have obtained inheritances from the mysterious temples."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"But if they can survive until the age of four, they have a chance to live."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Four years old... Is there any special reason for that?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled: "Nothing special, the court will intervene."</p><p></p><p>The court?</p><p></p><p>Li Che's expression changed slightly, he had almost forgotten about the court.</p><p></p><p>Feiluo City... was basically divided up by the major aristocratic families in the inner city, who held the power, and the court offices were virtually non-existent, except for handling some common people's disputes, the aristocratic families generally didn't pay much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took a sip of the old yellow wine and shook his head: "Little Li, don't underestimate the court. A dying camel is still bigger than a horse, let alone... the Great Landscape has not yet died. Although the court is in decline, it is still one of the most powerful forces in the world. Even the major sects don't dare to ignore the court."</p><p></p><p>"Feiluo City is mainly remote, and the mysterious temple is isolated, so it has become somewhat out of the court's jurisdiction, but it's not completely unmanaged."</p><p></p><p>"Look at how the court offices and the imperial court now seem to be empty, but how dare the major aristocratic families really ignore them?"</p><p></p><p>"The court used to conduct a screening and testing every four years, and if the child was a spirit embryo with divine nature, they would be recruited and cultivated by the court. Now, this screening and testing authority has been delegated by the court to the major aristocratic families in Feiluo City."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen glanced at Li Che at this point.</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded slightly: "So as long as Xixia safely reaches the age of four, and is screened and found to have divine talent, and enters the Xu family to cultivate, she can obtain the protection of the Xu family and be safe and worry-free?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen smiled.</p><p></p><p>"If the court regains control over Feiluo City, the major aristocratic families will still have to send the children with divine talent back to the court..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che frowned: "The aristocratic families won't be willing to send them back, will they?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen took a sip of wine: "And the court won't be unaware of that... So, what do you think is the purpose behind this decree?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Landscape court is not that they don't manage, but that they are too lazy to manage. Mysterious temples have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, almost every city has one or more mysterious temples..."</p><p></p><p>"If the court were to manage each and every mysterious temple, how could they possibly handle it? So... they have delegated the power to the major aristocratic families in each city, letting them deal with the mysterious temples as they please."</p><p></p><p>"The spirit embryos screened out naturally also serve to supplement the talent pool of the aristocratic families."</p><p></p><p>Li Che suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Old Chen narrowed his eyes: "In addition, the major sects also come to screen every four years, to see if there are any children with divine talent, and take them back to the sect for cultivation, which is like competing with the court for people. However, the requirements of the major sects are higher, and those who can meet the requirements are mostly the carefully cultivated children of the aristocratic families."</p><p></p><p>Li Che was naturally very confused about the cultivation forces in this world, but now, after hearing Old Chen's explanation, he seemed to have a clearer understanding.</p><p></p><p>"If one can enter a major sect for cultivation, that would be the best. But the requirements of the major sects are too high..."</p><p></p><p>Old Chen sighed and shook his head, his eyes flashing with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed that there seemed to be a story behind his words, so he deliberately poured a cup of wine, hugging Xixia, blinking his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eyes, the flames of the Bagua were burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>But Old Chen just rolled his eyes and continued drinking, not saying another word.</p><p></p><p>Li Che felt a little regretful, so he asked, "Old Chen, do you have any martial arts techniques for sale? If so, could you sell me a few?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen had just taken a sip of his drink and almost choked. "Do you think martial arts techniques are as common as cabbages? A few? Martial arts techniques are much more precious than things like skin-softening methods or meridian-opening techniques. Although I do have some stored in my study, they are not many."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Che's eyes immediately lit up, becoming increasingly interested in Old Chen's study.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts techniques have distinct styles. The techniques of the major clans and families naturally cannot be passed down openly. If you were to learn them, you would be held accountable. Forget it, forget it... What type of martial arts technique are you looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Old Chen thumped his chest, caught his breath, and said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Anything works, as long as I can practice it... Can you sell me some?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che, holding Xixia, father and daughter were both smiling radiantly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time waits for no one, the seasons flow like a river.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>Feilei City, Spring Wind Alley.</p><p></p><p>In the tightly closed small courtyard, the snow in the courtyard had completely melted, and the scorching airflow intertwined like a dragon, constantly shaking the loquat tree planted in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was bare-chested, his bronze skin seemingly surging with rushing blood and qi, rumbling and beating the membrane with a muffled drum-like sound, like thunder behind the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Thick, dragon-like tendons emerged on his body, tense and taut, like taut bowstrings.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The powerful qi was released, instantly blowing away the hazy snow.</p><p></p><p>Slowly recovering his inner strength and blood qi, Li Che's eyes opened, shining in the mist like two sharp blades cutting through the fog.</p><p></p><p>The muscles all over his body gradually relaxed, and his black hair flew up wildly.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a thin shirt, Li Che swung his arms, a smile hanging on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed, and a prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (Lv1, 50%)]</p><p></p><p>Twisting his neck, his spine creaked, and his powerful aura flowed.</p><p></p><p>"One month, opening nine major tendons, the Xu family's tendon-opening method is complete... Not bad, a little faster than expected. Of course, it's all thanks to my diligence and hard work."</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, the qi surged wildly, and nine snake-like inner energies coiled around his palm.</p><p></p><p>"The Serpent Inner Qi has also reached the second realm, barely able to be released outward."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Dao Fruit of the Dragon Elephant Vajra has greatly enhanced my martial arts cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The [Immortal Craftsmanship] has improved my wood carving skills, while the [Dragon Elephant Vajra] has enhanced my martial arts talent. Pretty good, I wonder what the third Dao Fruit will be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't help but look forward to the third Dao Fruit that would accompany his daughter Xixia after she turned two.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the medium-grade martial arts technique 'White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist' that I obtained from Old Chen has also been successfully mastered to the minor success level. This kind of horizontally cultivated martial art is truly easy for me to practice."</p><p></p><p>"However, one martial arts technique is still a bit lacking. After completing the wood carving transaction with the young master of the Si family tomorrow, I'll get the gold leaves and go to the market again to see if I can get another martial arts technique to increase my offensive capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing a thin shirt, started punching in the courtyard, the wind howling like a fierce tiger, countless white snow flakes rising and melting under the blood qi, falling to the ground and turning into ice.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of fist techniques, Li Che was finally satisfied with the recovery of his energy.</p><p></p><p>The minor success White Tiger Chaotic Wind Fist, combined with the Vajra Transformation, had an extremely terrifying explosive power.</p><p></p><p>But... it's still not enough.</p><p></p><p>Back in the inner room, after washing his body with hot water, Li Che bought a box of his wife's favorite osmanthus cakes and returned to the wood carving workshop.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a leather apron, Li Che sat in the chair, in front of him was the "Nine-Headed Avalokitesvara Weeping Demon-Subduing Statue" that he had meticulously carved over the past month.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the tools, the [Immortal Craftsmanship] Dao Fruit trembled slightly, and he focused his mind, entering the state of carving, devoting himself wholeheartedly to the finishing touches.</p><p></p><p>In the workshop, there was only the sound of gentle rustling.</p><p></p><p>After the last step was completed,</p><p></p><p>A golden light suddenly flashed in front of Li Che's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a prompt appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Immortal Craftsmanship (Lv3, 0%)]</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit Lv3, further evolution, obtained the embryonic form of the divine ability "Immortal Craftsmanship: Thousand-Splitting Hands"]</p><p></p><p>PS: Seeking reading support on Tuesday, Tuesday's reading support is extremely important and will determine next week's recommendation.

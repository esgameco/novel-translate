        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What was that? The several divine cultivators standing on the rooftop were somewhat perplexed, because... the divine energy was violently fluctuating, as if warning them of danger... </p><p></p><p>A great danger!</p><p></p><p>But this Ox Demon... was just a martial artist in the initial stage of meridian opening, what right did he have to bring them danger?</p><p></p><p>That strange mechanism, a bundle of several metal tubes...</p><p></p><p>What was this Ox Demon trying to do? Using traps and hidden weapons... to deal with them, these "cultivators whose spiritual nature flows like a river", the powerful spiritual cultivators? Martial artists may not necessarily be spiritual cultivators, but spiritual cultivators must be martial artists!</p><p></p><p>And they were seasoned martial artists, their physical bodies tempered and their inner energy reaching the fourth realm...</p><p></p><p>Therefore, their physical bodies were not weak and feeble, facing traps and hidden weapons, they were not without the means to defend.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with their divine perception, the mechanisms before them became utterly laughable!</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon wore a mask, his eyes gleaming, his firepower... always drove people to madness!</p><p></p><p>His vigorous black hair fluttered wildly, his deep voice drowned out the raging wind and rain, echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Enjoy a dazzling fireworks display!"</p><p></p><p>Enjoy it to the fullest! In an instant!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! Terrifying explosive sounds erupted, the sound waves sweeping and shattering the wind and rain! The mechanism the Ox Demon was wielding suddenly burst forth with a powerful sonic roar, the surging air waves rippling outwards in all directions, causing the pooled water on the ground to form layer upon layer of thick ripples!</p><p></p><p>Countless shrieks, countless fireballs, countless shockwaves...</p><p></p><p>Erupting frantically from the five metal tubes of the strange mechanism!</p><p></p><p>One golden lightning bolt after another, like light swords shooting out, in an instant tearing through the sudden downpour, splitting the rain curtain! Tat tat tat tat tat tat!</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast, every single wooden crow was compressed by Li Che's surging vital energy, then explosively propelled, combined with the crows' own powerful thrust, shooting out!</p><p></p><p>A thousand crows cawing in unison!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth blooming with golden flowers! The six masked divine cultivators all had their expressions change drastically, they frantically mobilized the surging divine energy within them like a river! But the wooden crows that were shot out were too fast, in the blink of an eye they were already in front of them, they could only use their own divine energy to summon the chaotic divine energy permeating heaven and earth, freezing the air to form a divine energy air wall!</p><p></p><p>The wooden crows collided with the air wall, seeming to pause for a moment. In that instant, the eyes behind their masks became much calmer.</p><p></p><p>They saw clearly!</p><p></p><p>Those were wooden birds made of ebony, their wood grains lifelike, in that moment of pause, flames burst forth from within the wooden birds, in an instant the flames surged with the wind! As they exploded, they formed countless powerful shockwaves! That explosive tearing force and impact power was enough to tear the skin and flesh of a meridian opening martial artist!</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?"</p><p></p><p>They exhaled, feeling a sense of inexplicable bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, what made their hair stand on end was...</p><p></p><p>In the mechanism the Ox Demon was watching, tongues of fire kept spewing out, one wooden bird after another, slicing through the rain curtain, carrying dazzling golden light, continuously assaulting the air wall of divine energy they had formed.</p><p></p><p>The number...</p><p></p><p>Too many! Boom boom boom...</p><p></p><p>Countless golden lights exploded, thick gunpowder smoke permeated the air, the air waves surging back and forth, rolling and tumbling!</p><p></p><p>Each attack powerful enough to tear the skin and flesh of a meridian opening martial artist, came crashing down dozens of times in the span of a breath or two, even though they were divine cultivators whose spiritual nature flowed like a river, they felt a sense of...</p><p></p><p>Suffocation! As if the soul-collecting emissaries from the depths of hell, the Ox Demon wearing a bovine mask, had grasped the throat of their lives, about to snap their necks and reap their souls! "Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The divine cultivator wearing the smiling child mask could no longer smile, cursing out loud.</p><p></p><p>The air wall in front of him suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden light wooden birds, as if shrieking, pounced towards his body, engulfing him.</p><p></p><p>Under the dense rolling black clouds, clusters of golden smoke flowers, punctuating the artistic beauty of the explosions.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater was all blown apart.</p><p></p><p>The remaining divine cultivators soon followed suit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Scorching waves, dense water vapor hazy in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>When the flames disappeared, the round raindrops falling from the sky pattered down ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>The entire area was a mess.</p><p></p><p>When one of the divine cultivators regained their senses, several figures simultaneously shakily stood up, their masks shattered beyond recognition, their clothes in tatters, some with only a few cloth strips hanging on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Their skin was torn and their flesh exposed, a strong burnt smell permeating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Even the pounding rain could not conceal this... fragrance of flesh...</p><p></p><p>"It's over..."</p><p></p><p>"Where's the Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, he ran away long ago! What was that thing? Shooting out so many wooden birds, actually able to unleash such a terrifying explosion, what kind of mechanism can blow us peak spiritual cultivators into this state?"</p><p></p><p>"Now I understand why the disciples of the Lingying Sect don't call the Ox Demon a hero, his methods can indeed be considered heroic?"</p><p></p><p>The divine cultivators no longer had any hostile or confrontational thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>Simu Bai's Qiankun Jade was gone, the Ox Demon had already fled.</p><p></p><p>What were they going to fight about? Because of loneliness? Their identities were all known to each other, so...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The interest and enthusiasm had faded, and no one wanted to continue dwelling on it. "The way of the mechanism... can it be so powerful? No wonder the Tang clan could once be so glorious, but the mechanism is ultimately a minor path, otherwise the Tang clan would not have fallen into complete desolation after the demise of the divine embryo powerhouses..."</p><p></p><p>"This Ox Demon, who is he? With the aura of a martial artist, combined with the way of the mechanism... actually made us six peak Nourishing Nature cultivators end up in such a sorry state..."</p><p></p><p>The group took a deep breath and exchanged glances, all somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>But gradually, they regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>"Simo Bai's Qiankun Jade is missing... That Ox Demon must have used divine methods to erase the divine aura emanating from the Qiankun Jade."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>"We must find the Ox Demon! We have to find him! That bastard... has the divine opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Disheveled, with tattered cloth and bloody wounds, the group exchanged a few symbolic glances through the hazy steam and rain, then silently turned and left in different directions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Bang! This time, Li Che effortlessly escaped by using the concealing ability of the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant".</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any sign of the divine cultivators discovering and chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>Not only were those fellows blasted open by the "Namo Gatling Crow" and left with bloody wounds, lacking the energy to pursue him, but the fact that he had erased the divine aura from Simo Bai's jade pendant was enough to completely cut off the tracking.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he still cautiously moved through several alleys, changing locations multiple times.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that there was no one following him, Li Che returned to the small workshop courtyard that Xu You had found for him, panting heavily and placing the Namo Gatling down.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he landed, Li Che's figure returned to its normal size, and his mind immediately sank into his arm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Slivers Hand had absorbed a large amount of divine energy from Simo Bai. If he didn't handle it quickly, this divine energy would be difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Che was not a divine cultivator, not even a Nourishing Nature cultivator. If the "Wrathful Cry Subduing Demon" divine energy were to erupt, not only would it affect his mental state, but he might also expose himself, bringing unnecessary trouble! The identity of the Ox Demon... is too sensitive right now.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Che unhesitatingly channeled the absorbed divine energy into the Dragon Elephant Vajra Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Fruit devours divine energy! It can alleviate his pressure! However, the Dragon Elephant Vajra Fruit only absorbed about half of the divine energy before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the pressure on the Thousand Slivers Hand also returned to normal, and Li Che finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>[Fruit: Dragon Elephant Vajra (LV2, 30%)]</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at it, and his heart couldn't help but feel delighted.</p><p></p><p>This wave of consumption had directly increased the maturity of the Dragon Elephant Vajra Fruit by 10%!</p><p></p><p>Li Che even felt that his martial cultivation had reached the limit of the sixth stage of Blood Refinement, and as long as he had a Meridian Unblocking technique, he could break through it with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>The LV2, 30% mature Dragon Elephant Vajra, brought about a tremendous boost to his innate talents.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the surging qi and blood in his heart, Li Che concealed the aura of the Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes again, his gaze was clear, and the rain was pouring down without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Li Che crushed the Ox Mask into fine powder with a slap, and his gaze fell on the "Namo Gatling", a LV3 Immortal Crafted Fruit that had greatly enhanced his combat capabilities.</p><p></p><p>The reason he dared to boldly attack and kill Simo Bai this time was because of this trump card.</p><p></p><p>All his timidity and caution were actually due to a lack of firepower.</p><p></p><p>When the firepower was sufficient... he dared to overturn the heavens! "It's fine, there's still room for further improvement, the material durability is not enough, and the explosive power of the Crow is not strong enough... Firing a hundred Crows is the limit, any more... and it won't be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"Divided among those six divine cultivators, it's only a dozen or so for each person, not enough to kill them."</p><p></p><p>"If one person were to be hit by a hundred Crows, even a Nourishing Nature cultivator as strong as a river, would have to kneel before me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che's gaze flickered, caressing the Namo Gatling, feeling somewhat reluctant to destroy the hard-earned creation.</p><p></p><p>But this thing was too obvious, and it was easy to expose his identity...</p><p></p><p>So, he had to destroy it, no matter what...</p><p></p><p>"Let me study the jade pendant that was devoured by the 'Untainted Heart' first..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>They say... there are divine essence fragments in it, that thing... is truly the good stuff!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Fruit in his chest pounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che then received the feedback from the Fruit [Untainted Heart], which had successfully devoured that jade pendant and acquired its abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was stunned...</p><p></p><p>The abilities of the jade pendant? Containing the universe in a mustard seed, storing the Qiankun in a single jade!</p><p></p><p>This was the ability of the jade pendant that Simo Bai always carried with him! With a thought, pure and clean divine energy gushed out.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the divine energy tore the air like a knife, opening a rift.</p><p></p><p>Behind the rift...</p><p></p><p>There was a space, neither too big nor too small!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xixi glared angrily. Although she was only three years old, she would not cry easily! And she would definitely not cry from being beaten! She was going to be the invincible Empress Xixi in the future! Seeing Xixi's defiant look, Nan Lihuos couldn't help but stroke his beard and laugh heartily. This girl... her arrogance was real.</p><p></p><p>But having arrogance is a good thing. As a divine child with the purple qi of a hundred feet, how could she not have arrogance? Arrogance is the most basic sign of a genius.</p><p></p><p>However, when Nan Lihuos thought about his first time entering the Heavenly King Tower's divine hall to undergo the Heavenly King's examination, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>That time, he was truly beaten to the point of questioning his life.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't recover for an entire month, and the previous Sect Master of the Golden Light Peak had to comfort and guide him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He hoped Xixi... could recover quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, prepare to enter the divine hall."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos rubbed Xixi's head: "Just do your best, don't take the Heavenly King Tower's trial too lightly... If you can defeat your opponent before the age of twelve, that would be great."</p><p></p><p>Xixi raised her head, her eyes carrying a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Teacher, are you looking down on Xixi?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos was at a loss for words: "Your talent is the highest among all my disciples, how could I look down on you?"</p><p></p><p>"I have high expectations for you, hoping that you can defeat your opponent before the age of twelve... I..."</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't succeed even by the age of twelve."</p><p></p><p>"Your late senior brother Zhou Daoyu was the same."</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos explained gently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xixi's brow smoothed out, and she then asked curiously, "The late senior brother... was he very powerful too?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos' eyes suddenly hurt, and upon hearing Xixi's praise, a tinge of sorrow seemed to spread through his heart like ink.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, very powerful, but... not as powerful as you."</p><p></p><p>Xixi immediately raised her head proudly.</p><p></p><p>That was a must, in front of Empress Xixi, everything was her subjects! Nan Lihuos said no more, forming hand seals, and his divine power burst forth.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King Tower suddenly began to tremble, and in an instant, a dazzling golden light burst forth, radiating divine pressure.</p><p></p><p>The golden pagoda temple detached from the altar and flew into the air, once again emitting a suction force that drew Xixi into it.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xixi had the experience from the last time, but she did not shout for help while flailing about.</p><p></p><p>However, the feeling of being pulled into the divine hall was still quite uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>But the little Huhu on her shoulder was very happy, fluttering around Xixi's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Che had helped Xixi research this little Huhu, but so far he had not been able to figure out the function of this butterfly spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>Although its divine power was extremely rich, it didn't seem to have much attack power or destructive force, only exerting a bit of divine power pressure when releasing its divine power.</p><p></p><p>Its divine power was so pure that it was almost comparable to an untainted divine spirit.</p><p></p><p>Li Che couldn't figure it out, so he didn't continue the research, but the little butterfly he researched was frightened in his hands, trembling constantly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be able to sense a person's cruelty.</p><p></p><p>Very clearly, Xixi and Li Che, the latter was a hundred times more cruel.</p><p></p><p>After the dizzying sensation...</p><p></p><p>Xixi opened her eyes and found herself and the little butterfly appearing in the divine hall of the pagoda temple again.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master had explained to Xixi about the divine hall and the mysterious hall, both of which were special domains generated by the mysterious temple and were related to divine power.</p><p></p><p>At least a Nine Luminaries level mysterious temple could generate a mysterious hall.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the mysterious hall and the divine hall was that the mysterious hall had great danger, and once entered, one would encounter various bizarre things infected by the temple deity's divine power, these bizarre things would snatch people's lives, and even turn people into cursed zombies to guard the mysterious temple.</p><p></p><p>But inside the mysterious hall, just like the divine hall, there were also inheritances and opportunities, it's just that the danger was too great.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine hall, it was more like a purified mysterious hall, basically without any danger, and the inheritances and opportunities were also extremely mild.</p><p></p><p>The divine hall originated from the plundered mysterious temple, and after the temple deity's death and the restoration of the normal temple, the divine hall was formed.</p><p></p><p>The resentment and divine power of the dead temple deity had become calm and would no longer infect the hall's visitors, but instead became a place of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the divine hall was the foundation of every great deity sect.</p><p></p><p>Some deity sects even had multiple divine halls.</p><p></p><p>Like the Golden Heavenly King Tower, since the tower was divided into three parts, it had three divine halls that were interconnected.</p><p></p><p>Nan Lihuos told Xixi that if she could defeat her opponent before the age of twelve, she would be able to traverse the divine halls of this area of the Heavenly King Tower and meet and fight the divine children in the other area's divine halls.</p><p></p><p>Xixi was so excited at the time, already imagining the scene of her crushing all the enemies in the divine halls.</p><p></p><p>Xixi looked around, clenching her chubby fists, her eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>She patted the little butterfly and quickly and happily walked towards the majestic and grand golden temple.</p><p></p><p>She was humming the song her "smelly father" had taught her: "I have a little donkey, I've never ridden it before, one day I was inspired, and rode it to the market..."</p><p></p><p>As she sang, the little butterfly danced around her in a fluttering manner.</p><p></p><p>One person and one butterfly, like a flower blooming in the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of the temple gate, the gate was tightly closed, and Xixi widened her eyes, immediately understanding. She took a step forward, and the scattered bangs on her forehead began to flutter wildly in the wind.</p><p></p><p>In the inner realm of her Nirvana, the cultivation method she had learned, the "Extreme Sorrow Wind Fire Subduing Three Princes", was activated instantly! Although it was a Fifth Elder-level cultivation method, Xixi had completed the transformation of all divine powers within half a year.</p><p></p><p>Now, her cultivation was like a river, completely transformed into the Extreme Sorrow Wind Fire Subduing Three Princes divine power! The divine power intertwined with the colors of wind and fire, flickering with brilliance, containing a sorrowful emotion that emanated from Xixi's small body.</p><p></p><p>The temple gate rumbled and slowly opened, sensing that the source of her divine power was the Golden Temple, it opened.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The massive gate opened, and the towering and majestic golden statue of the Heavenly King God appeared before Xixi again.</p><p></p><p>Xixi immediately restrained her arrogant emotions and shrank her neck.</p><p></p><p>The statue looked down from above, but its eyes seemed very gentle, and Xixi gradually relaxed her spirit.</p><p></p><p>Walking up to the statue, Xixi looked around, the temple contained an extremely dense and rich divine power.</p><p></p><p>She felt that if she just opened her mouth to inhale, she could absorb the divine power into her body.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Sect Master said the Golden Temple was an excellent cultivation place, surpassing any Heavenly Abode.</p><p></p><p>Every half a year when it opened, he told Xixi not to just cry after getting beaten up, but to seize the opportunity to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xixi was disgruntled.</p><p></p><p>She, Empress Xixi, would definitely not cry! Definitely not! Xixi was very confident in herself, and she had even brought the firework mechanism that Niu Niu Teacher had made for her! The firework mechanism had three states, if all else failed, she would activate the strongest firepower mode! Hmph—</p><p></p><p>Xixi pouted her lips and looked at the statue.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"The divine hall trial is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>"Go all out, don't hold back!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice suddenly exploded, and Xixi only felt her eardrums shaking, even the little butterfly perched on her shoulder trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, the scene in front of her changed.</p><p></p><p>She widened her eyes, her long eyelashes fluttering slightly.</p><p></p><p>She saw...</p><p></p><p>Under the golden statue,</p><p></p><p>In that treasure pagoda,</p><p></p><p>A small figure slowly walked out, appearing to be cast in pure gold.</p><p></p><p>That figure had golden eyes, and two golden pigtails shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The golden glowing eyes turned and fell on Xixi.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk—"</p><p></p><p>The small figure sneered, then stepped out, leaping down from the huge hand of the Heavenly King Statue that held the golden pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Midair, with a 360-degree roll, a transformation occurred.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a golden crown, with golden ribbons around the arms, barefoot with golden wind fire wheels, holding a golden snake spear!</p><p></p><p>Airborne, with legs spread in a split, the golden ribbons fluttering, the golden wind fire wheels on his feet spinning at high speed, countless sparks brilliantly bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Dancing stars, floating and rushing! A crushing pressure...</p><p></p><p>Bearing down like a mountain!</p><p></p><p>Xixi stared in astonishment, the little Huhu on her shoulder was bristling all over! No...</p><p></p><p>You let the Three Princes come out?! </p><p></p><p>The Sect Master was a big liar, calling this a trial?!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Light City, in the Falling Flowers Alley, Li Che closed his eyes. After swallowing the Eight Extremes Martial Pill, his stomach wall rumbled like a pestle, directly crushing the pill, the overwhelming medicinal power surging into his four limbs and throughout his body!</p><p></p><p>His entire bones and muscles began to squirm, making a "crackle" sound like burning firewood crackling with sparks. His blood and qi were scorching hot and overwhelming, after the Nine Changes of the Divine Vein, the Transformation Realm power fused into his inner qi, at this moment, it seemed to have become a great medicine, traveling with the inner qi, flowing through the meridians! From the top of his head, from the shoulders and back, from the abdomen and dantian, from the spine to the tailbone!</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a blazing fire in his chest, indescribable, instantly igniting and expanding throughout his body!</p><p></p><p>The "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" Dao Fruit hummed and pulsed! His blood rushed like a raging river, as if the great waves had burst forth!</p><p></p><p>At the Sect Master Realm, Li Che had already met all the conditions, cultivating the ultimate profound art, completing the Transformation Realm fusion of at least three martial arts.</p><p></p><p>These were all met, breaking through to the Sect Master Realm was just a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>But the key to breaking through the Sect Master Realm was still in the strength of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Why were the Cursed Copper Corpses so powerful? It was because of the toughness of their physique, unimaginable, forged with the qi of death and corpse, almost no longer flesh and blood, but rather like a weapon.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they were indestructible!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Sect Master was also aimed at tempering the physical body, the foundation of the martial dao was in the physical body!</p><p></p><p>Refining inner qi into true qi was an internal change, while the toughness and strength of the skin and flesh was an external change!</p><p></p><p>From stepping into the Sect Master Realm, it was a transformation of both internal and external changes!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh! The blood in his body surged, flowing faster and faster, if a small hole was torn in the skin at this time, the spraying blood would be even more terrifying than a high-pressure water gun! Sharp like a water knife! Li Che's entire body was flushed red, the Transformation Realm state fused into his inner qi, and the inner qi was rushing through his body, boiling his blood and qi, various Transformation Realm states seemed like illusory scenes, floating around him.</p><p></p><p>There was a roaring white tiger, a continuous barrage of spear shadows, the wailing of a hundred ghosts, arrows intertwined with wind and thunder...</p><p></p><p>There was a three-eyed divine general wielding a three-bladed sword, the sword qi filling the heavens and earth, and a dispersing corpse deity...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The qi was like smoke, igniting with a single finger! Endless varieties of spiritual realms emerged one after another!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's physical body became increasingly scorching hot, with swirling and hazy airflows around him, like a blazing furnace, emanating astonishing intense light and high temperature.</p><p></p><p>Li Che opened his eyes, which were like two burning flames.</p><p></p><p>According to his understanding, a master's breakthrough should not be this difficult, with so many unusual phenomena...</p><p></p><p>"The nine transformations of the divine vein's breakthrough... Is that why it is so arduous?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he was not afraid or shrinking back.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood up.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his clothes were burned to ashes by the scorching hot blood and qi. Without wearing any special elastic clothing, his physical body started to swell.</p><p></p><p>[Dragon-Elephant Vajra], the second transformation, Wrathful Vajra!</p><p></p><p>The bulging sinews trembled, the spine roared up to the sky like a coiling dragon, and Li Che's jet-black hair grew long and flowed down.</p><p></p><p>His lean and powerful physique continued to expand, and his skin seemed to radiate a crystalline luster! Sizzling... Sweat poured out, instantly evaporating into steam on the scorching skin, forming a hazy mist that shrouded the small courtyard! With the Wrathful Vajra state activated, Li Che instantly grew to two meters tall, and every inch of his flesh and blood seemed to be twisted like braided ropes, extremely scarlet red!</p><p></p><p>The dense mist was suddenly torn apart by the fierce and violent airflow.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes shot out scarlet light, his skin vibrating, his flesh and blood resonating, emitting the roar of the dragon-elephant. Peerless skill, the True Essence of Dragon-Elephant! Li Che executed pure and simple martial arts with precision.</p><p></p><p>The air kept exploding, emitting muffled booming sounds!</p><p></p><p>The True Essence of Dragon-Elephant, in Li Che's current state, he had only mastered one dragon and one elephant, even after integrating the Eight Serpents Overturning the River and the Azure Thunder Body, he still had not undergone any transformation.</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the peerless skill was indeed quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, as his martial cultivation surged towards the Patriarch realm, he finally sensed the changes! Supported by the Transformation Realm, he gradually comprehended the true meaning.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of martial arts were completely integrated into his body, seeping into the muscles, forming memories! And the peerless skill, the True Essence of Dragon-Elephant, had not yet given birth to the true meaning, but was devouring these Transformation Realm realms, as if transforming from the virtual to the real, from the false to the true!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's fists and elbows at this moment were almost transformed into terrifying killing weapons.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the techniques became faster and faster, until the fist shadows could hardly be seen.</p><p></p><p>Howling winds and turbulent flows surged in the courtyard, sweeping up countless carved wooden chips!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Patriarch realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand now."</p><p></p><p>Boom—! A fist slammed forcefully into the empty air in front, and the entire air seemed to visibly indent, with invisible ripples spreading out like rolling tides.</p><p></p><p>Thud thud thud—</p><p></p><p>Li Che stood in place, towering like a mountain, and from the violently pulsing thick veins, an extremely dense qi and blood dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surged into the high sky, rolling like billowing smoke! Gradually, the smoke divided into two, one becoming a blood-colored giant dragon undulating in the vast sky, and the other becoming a massive elephant as heavy as a mountain, raising its long trunk and roaring!</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon and the giant elephant, one dragon and one elephant! Circling and coiling around.</p><p></p><p>Rotating in relation to each other, they seemed to have formed a scarlet furnace! Within the furnace!</p><p></p><p>The nine Transformation Realm martial arts realms were being smelted! This is...</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's extraordinary phenomenon!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumbling—! As if with muffled thunder rolling, the dragon's roar and the elephant's cry, even with the Heaven and Earth Chessboard suppressing and isolating, were still transmitted outward!</p><p></p><p>Vague anomalies momentarily appeared between heaven and earth, flashing by, then being obscured by the Heaven and Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>But it still caught the attention of some interested parties.</p><p></p><p>The closest to Li Che's Falling Flowers Alley workshop was the Qin Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Mansion, the Qin Family's divine physiognomist elder Qin Digun suddenly opened his eyes, instantly emerging from the secret room.</p><p></p><p>The wind and waves were raging, his beard and robes were all flying...</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful qi and blood, a Patriarch's extraordinary phenomenon? Who has broken through to the Patriarch realm... and actually able to produce such a phenomenon?"</p><p></p><p>As a divine physiognomist cultivator, Qin Digun himself was also a Patriarch realm master with extremely powerful qi and blood, and his perception was acute.</p><p></p><p>He released his divine sense to scan, but felt that what he had just sensed was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible... I can't detect it anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the same feeling as when I attacked Jade Qing back then... Right in front of my eyes, yet I can't perceive it!"</p><p></p><p>"How frustrating! How vexing!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Digun took a deep breath, calming the surging emotions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ma Mian..."</p><p></p><p>He murmured a name.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Copper Corpse cultivated by the upper echelon Xuan Zheng was killed on the street,</p><p></p><p>the hidden archer in the Golden Light Prefecture City, Ma Mian, had risen to fame, and many were searching for him, but no one could find him.</p><p></p><p>"Has Ma Mian broken through to the Patriarch realm? No... Was Ma Mian not a Patriarch before?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Digun seemed to have thought of something, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cliff Stone Treasure Tower, the Astrology Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The lingering sound of a two-string fiddle drifted over the tower, an aloof-looking Astrology Bureau Director sat on the rooftop, playing the fiddle, his hair and beard flowing in the wind.</p><p></p><p>"The nine transformations of the divine vein, a qi blood furnace!"</p><p></p><p>"Golden Light Prefecture City actually has such a martial arts prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, very interesting..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, just entering the Patriarch realm, a qi blood furnace Patriarch, when he reaches the later realms, I'm afraid he won't be weaker than the Copper Corpse, and could even enter the Lingnan Dao Patriarch rankings."</p><p></p><p>"A Patriarch who has cultivated a qi blood furnace, not a divine root from the Divine Root Roster... Even with just pure qi blood martial arts, he could crush them."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, this person's hidden abilities are truly superb, I wonder which force's high-level expert has come to Golden Light Prefecture City... With such abilities, he must be from a major force, could it be another sect's Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Deity Sect... No, the Corpse Deity Sect cultivates Corpse Puppet techniques, they wouldn't go through the arduous and unrewarding task of refining a Patriarch furnace."</p><p></p><p>"What has he come for? Most likely it's the Eight-Armed Furious Third Prince..."</p><p></p><p>The muttering Astrology Bureau Director had a faint smile on his aged face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother to investigate further, sitting on a small stool, playing the fiddle, humming a little tune.</p><p></p><p>The vortex is getting bigger and more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>I'll just... play a two-string fiddle tune and enjoy my leisurely life.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Within his chest, the [Dragon-Elephant Dao Fruit] was extremely active, suddenly pulsing.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood that had been confined within the courtyard by the Heaven and Earth Chessboard was now all absorbed back into his body.</p><p></p><p>The aura was concealed, hidden extremely well.</p><p></p><p>Li Che stretched his arms, and his entire bones and joints cracked like popping beans, as if each bone had been recast, adapting to the new strength of his body.</p><p></p><p>The qi blood furnace had been forged, and Li Che felt refreshed and clear-minded, as if every pore was expanding and expelling the impurities within.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and between his fingers, there was a distorted airflow intertwining...</p><p></p><p>This is true qi! The true qi had fused with the true meaning of the True Essence of Dragon-Elephant, containing the power of the dragon and the elephant, and also seemed to conceal the power of the Eight Serpents Overturning the River and the Azure Thunder Body.</p><p></p><p>The true qi, the fusion of true meaning and qi blood, had given birth to a domineering force.</p><p></p><p>The true qi could extend to ten zhang around him! If it went any further, the power would show a cliff-like decline.</p><p></p><p>Unless he cultivated to the Great Patriarch realm, with the divine might unleashed, it could shatter rocks and break metal a hundred zhang away! "This is what a true Patriarch is... The so-called Patriarchs I killed before were too weak."</p><p></p><p>"Now, if they fight me, I'll knock them out one by one!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che inhaled and exhaled, like a whale swallowing, stirring up fierce winds and waves! If one had to use a word to describe his current physical body, it would be "perfect".</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Che also knew that he was now in a breakthrough and expansion period, his mentality was extremely inflated.</p><p></p><p>But Li Che felt that in his current state, he might be able to contend with Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Radiant light flickered in front of him.</p><p></p><p>[Dao Fruit: Dragon-Elephant Vajra (LV3, 50%)]</p><p></p><p>The maturity of the Dragon-Elephant Vajra had directly increased by a large margin, reaching 50% of LV3!</p><p></p><p>"If the Dao Fruit reaches LV4, what kind of transformation will occur?"</p><p></p><p>"It's getting close..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's [Immortal Craft] or [Dragon-Elephant Vajra], they're both getting close!"</p><p></p><p>Li Che exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit is the capital for his survival and establishment in this world, researching and developing it is the key to his strength!</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes gleamed like lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Once the seven cycles of the divine root are forged, combined with my current qi blood furnace Patriarch breakthrough... Can I open the tower and contend with the divine physiognomist?"</p><p></p><p>Can he? </p><p></p><p>Li Che didn't know, but...his instinct told him.</p><p></p><p>Like easily slaying the illusory Liu Jinsong, he could certainly do it.</p><p></p><p>Stretching his arms, twisting his waist, the surrounding airflow gathered behind him, like a coiling dragon stretching its limbs! The essential upgrade of his physical body gave him a sense of security in wielding power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's eyes slightly flickered.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and a white flying chess piece floated in his palm.</p><p></p><p>There were images gradually appearing.</p><p></p><p>"Xixie..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xixie opened her mouth wide, staring in disbelief. Her big eyes were filled with incredulity.</p><p></p><p>Although she was only three years old, as a prodigy, her intelligence was precocious, and the cultivation method she practiced was the Extremely Sorrowful Third Prince, so naturally she knew the existence of the golden little boy appearing before her! Wearing a golden vajra ring, with golden brocade wrapped around his arms, feet stepping on wind and fire wheels, holding a golden fire-tipped spear...</p><p></p><p>This was the Golden Third Prince!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Sect Master Teacher was beaten up..."</p><p></p><p>Xixie pouted, feeling an immense sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>That Third Prince, stepping on wind and fire wheels, hovering in the sky, seemed like a divine being emerging from mythology!</p><p></p><p>The golden eyes casting down their gaze made Xixie almost suffocate.</p><p></p><p>The little butterfly on her shoulder had already started playing dead.</p><p></p><p>But after the initial soul-shaking, the next moment, Xixie's tiny body couldn't help but tremble with excitement.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, a trace of madness gradually appeared... Fighting with the Third Prince? How thrilling! Xixie... loved it so much!  "Ahaha haha—"</p><p></p><p>"Xixie loves it so much!"</p><p></p><p>Xixie's eyes shone brightly, her chubby little hands flipping over.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sect Master Teacher didn't fight fairly!</p><p></p><p>Then she...</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>The Namo Immortal Craft Gatling Gun was hefted in her hands.</p><p></p><p>Aimed at the cold and disdainful hovering Golden Third Prince in the sky.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the alley, it was even darker by three degrees.</p><p></p><p>An old man was leading a big-headed boy with a Nezha braid, standing quietly in the snow, looking at the brightly lit Xu Record Wood Carving Shop.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Lingying Sect seems to have set their sights on the talented child you treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"Should we intervene? The Lingying Sect is colluding with the officials of Feiluo City, and all the experts in this shop have been dispatched, leaving it in a state of vulnerability. The Lingying Sect is most likely going to make their move tonight."</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi furrowed his brow, though small in stature, he was very mature.</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head: "Let's just watch for now. I'd rather not intervene if I can help it. I still want to see who is behind the preparation of the strange temple sacrifice in Feiluo City... who has become the dog of the temple god..."</p><p></p><p>"But what if something happens to the child? Master... didn't you say that child is a rare and exceptional spiritual child?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi tilted his head, asking with confusion.</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled and glanced at the big-headed Lü Chi: "If it's absolutely necessary, you can step in. I'll give you a chance to be the hero who rescues the beauty. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chi rolled his eyes dramatically: "A two-year-old girl is considered a beauty? At two years old, how can you tell?"</p><p></p><p>The old man stroked his beard and smiled, his gaze profound: "I never expected that the over twenty-year-old spiritual child... would be the father of the exceptional spiritual child. That pure and flawless divinity giving birth to an exceptional spiritual child is quite normal."</p><p></p><p>"Someone's coming."</p><p></p><p>The old man's smile faded, and he grasped Lü Chi's hand, seemingly blending into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A sudden gust of wind violently tore through the cold air, causing the swirling snow to be shredded to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Several ghostly figures stood on the rooftop, facing the biting wind, accompanied by eerie laughter like wailing ghosts.</p><p></p><p>These figures were cloaked in black robes, wearing masks of various child-like expressions - crying, laughing, ugly, angry, and so on.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of five figures, some carrying large sabers, others gripping long spears, and some shouldering iron hammers.</p><p></p><p>The surging aura was almost enough to melt the falling white snow.</p><p></p><p>"Xu You has been recalled to the inner city, and the only combat-ready expert in Xu Record Wood Carving Shop, Chen Dabao, has been imprisoned. Tonight is the only opportunity, for Xu You will return tomorrow, and Chen Dabao will no longer be detained..."</p><p></p><p>"We must succeed in taking the spiritual child tonight."</p><p></p><p>"And you all better be careful with me as bait, you'd better hurry up and rescue me!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, the figures, accompanied by eerie cries, laughter, and anger, unleashed their martial arts and leaped lightly over the high walls of the Xu family compound.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>A single lamp burned inside the house, the flickering flame casting the shadows of two figures on the paper window.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, Zhang Ya's face was slightly pale as she held the sleeping Xixia. Her woman's intuition, combined with her husband Li Che's unusual behavior, made her realize that there might be danger tonight.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the distance, where a lifelike wood carving sat on a chair. The carving resembled Li Che by about seven or eight parts, only it was not yet polished, the carving lines a bit rough.</p><p></p><p>But through the lamp's illumination, the shadow cast on the paper window was almost identical to Li Che.</p><p></p><p>It gave the impression that the husband and wife were both safely inside the house.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhang Ya did not understand why Li Che would do this, staying inside the house to protect them - wasn't that good enough?</p><p></p><p>But when Li Che took out a thin wooden board and, sitting in the chair, slowly carved a smiling ox mask with a carving knife to cover his face, Zhang Ya was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>She covered her mouth, looking at this unfamiliar husband with unprecedented astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Ox... Ox Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya whispered.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the Ox Demon in Feiluo City, who did not know of him? Who had not heard of him? Specializing in hunting down the Lingying Sect's members who targeted children, although he was constantly on the wanted list, he had become the hero in the hearts of the citizens of Feiluo City!</p><p></p><p>And now, this hero... was actually her husband Li Che?</p><p></p><p>"No... it's not right, the Ox Demon's build is too different from yours."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya shook her head and spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Che had revealed his identity, showing his wife who he truly was. And his wife... would be the first to know his identity as the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, Li Che silently activated the "Dragon Elephant Golden Vajra" technique.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless muscles piled up and twisted like fierce dragons, rapidly growing, becoming as massive as a small mountain, exuding a fierce and powerful pressure that filled the room.</p><p></p><p>In Zhang Ya's dazed gaze, Li Che immediately released the transformation, returning to his normal size.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, I won't let anyone harm you and our daughter, so... you have to trust your husband."</p><p></p><p>Li Che gently caressed Zhang Ya's face and brushed back her fallen strands of hair, speaking softly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya snapped out of her daze, her heart surging, her mind buzzing. Her husband... could actually become so huge! So this is what a refined martial artist is like?</p><p></p><p>But she had never heard of a refined martial artist... being able to grow and shrink in size.</p><p></p><p>The obedient her did not ask many questions, knowing that this must be her husband's secret, and she did not need to understand it too clearly, only to believe and trust.</p><p></p><p>Between husband and wife, there should be some small secrets.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Che's identity as the Ox Demon, and the deaths at the hands of the Ox Demon...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those people in his hands...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya didn't care, the only thing she cared about was her husband.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhang Ya was inexplicably troubled, it seemed that in front of her husband, she no longer had any secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Remember the way I taught you to activate the [Wood Crow]..."</p><p></p><p>Li Che rubbed Zhang Ya's head and kissed her forehead, reminding her.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ya solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Che glanced at the sleeping Xixia.</p><p></p><p>A warm home with a wife and child, he just wanted to live peacefully with his family in this world... Who dares to touch his daughter, he will... </p><p></p><p>Kill them!...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the "Sleeping Dragon Elephant" ability of the [Dragon Elephant Dao Fruit], and his vital energy was completely concealed, his spirit and energy seemed to have been wiped out from the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The concealment effect was excellent.</p><p></p><p>He slipped into the dark alleys around the Xu family's courtyard, wearing a hat and covering his face with a cow mask, transforming into the Ox Demon on a snowy night.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Chuanxiong, openly displaying his schemes during the day, posturing and extremely arrogant... This is somewhat inconsistent with his style of hiding for a year."</p><p></p><p>Li Che pondered, but he already had some understanding.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong knew that the Ox Demon was looking for him, but he still brazenly made a move, as if he was... fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Is Zhao Chuanxiong the bait, to lure me in?"</p><p></p><p>"The work of the Lingying Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Tonight's scheme is a two-birds-with-one-stone scheme... Not only to catch Xixia, but also to eliminate the Ox Demon..."</p><p></p><p>The alley was quiet.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, there was a faint sound of exhalation, accompanied by a chilling murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Heh."</p><p></p><p>"How greedy."</p><p></p><p>Li Che raised his head, looking at the dark sky, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what schemes and tricks you have..."</p><p></p><p>"I want to protect my wife and child..."</p><p></p><p>"I will kill you all, that is the best protection."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was dark and the ghosts were lighting fires, the sky was cold and the wild geese were calling in the frost! The temperature had risen a bit tonight, and the snow falling from the sky had turned into rain, drizzling in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Each raindrop was bitterly cold and bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong had a long sword hanging at his waist, his long black hair scattered, wearing a cheerful child's mask.</p><p></p><p>His toes touched the thick snow on the ground, shattering the falling rain and snow, drifting in like a ghostly figure.</p><p></p><p>He landed outside the courtyard wall of Fang Che's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Because he had visited Li Che before, he was familiar with the route and easily found this courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Under the child's mask, Zhao Chuanxiong's eyes showed little emotion, looking indifferently at the brightly lit house, at the two shadows reflected on the paper window.</p><p></p><p>"What a warm family..."</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, they have a spiritual child."</p><p></p><p>"Talent is a blessing, but also... a disaster."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong drew out his gleaming long sword, the blade trembling and letting out a long wail.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth were silent.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xu family's wood carving workshop... there was no movement at all.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu You had instructed and pleaded with them, those old craftsmen, in the end, chose to play it safe and did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>Even though they already knew that someone would attack Li Che's courtyard tonight to take away Xixia.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chuanxiong gripped the sword with one hand, sweeping his gaze around, the snow and rain mixing, with no one appearing to obstruct him.</p><p></p><p>A cold smile appeared on his masked face: "Human nature..."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, those who dare to be heroes are ultimately few."</p><p></p><p>"Except for you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!! On the sword blade, a fiery red aura suddenly burst forth, and he viciously swung it towards the back.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red sword beam, shattering the swirling snow and rain, the shockwave falling on both sides!</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon!!!"</p><p></p><p>A terrified yet explosive roar came from Zhao Chuanxiong's throat! Behind him, a towering figure appeared like a ghost! Black robes fluttering, under the hat, the cow mask was like a messenger of the underworld, a pair of eyes, cold and full of murderous intent, staring at him.</p><p></p><p>Not a word or waste of time.</p><p></p><p>The Ox Demon's huge palm, like a fan, suddenly clenched.</p><p></p><p>Under the skin, every pore was gushing with boiling blood, like intertwined blood pythons, coiling around the thick arm! White Tiger Raging Wind!</p><p></p><p>One punch! From top to bottom!</p><p></p><p>Looking down from above!</p><p></p><p>Boom, crash!</p><p></p><p>The sword light that Zhao Chuanxiong swung back was instantly shattered by the reckless and domineering force! The remaining power continued to be released! Zhao Chuanxiong used the long sword to block, but the steel long sword blade was instantly bent under the crushing blow!</p><p></p><p>The extremely unfamiliar punch power seemed to be accompanied by a tiger's roar, penetrating the blade, ruthlessly smashing into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Shattering his chest...</p><p></p><p>The child's mask on Zhao Chuanxiong's face instantly exploded, revealing a terrified expression, his eyeballs almost popping out! His legs knelt heavily on the ground, the blue bricks were broken, and the snow covering them scattered high into the air.</p><p></p><p>Cracking, rumbling, it was unclear whether it was the sound of bones breaking or just the snow falling.</p><p></p><p>"Change... blood? !"</p><p></p><p>"It turns out..."</p><p></p><p>"Being the bait... is to be eaten after all..."</p>

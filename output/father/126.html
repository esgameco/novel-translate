        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night wind howled.</p><p></p><p>At the top of Golden Peak, the air was bitterly cold, and the mist and clouds lingered endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the grand temple hall.</p><p></p><p>After Nanlihuo had inscribed the divine markings on Xixis forehead, he rose and gracefully rolled up his sleeves, forming hand seals and chanting in a deep, resounding voice that echoed throughout the entire hall.</p><p></p><p>The petite Xixi sat on a meditation cushion, feeling the divine markings on her brow suddenly grow scorching hot, as if flames were burning there.</p><p></p><p>She resisted the urge to reach up and touch it out of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"You possess innate divinity, and I shall guide the descent of the Precious Pagoda's radiant light upon you, Xixi. Relax, and after the Pagoda's light shines upon you, I shall impart the teachings to you."</p><p></p><p>"All past disciples have received the temple deity's blessings, obtaining various treasures and techniques, all depending on their karmic affinity and natural talents."</p><p></p><p>"Close your eyes."</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo said.</p><p></p><p>Xixi obediently closed her eyes, her heart filled with curiosity about what wonderful things the Precious Pagoda might bestow upon her, hoping for something fun and delicious.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a warm, radiant light enveloped Xixi.</p><p></p><p>The Precious Pagoda deity on the altar began to tremble, and countless divine energies surged forth from within it, forming a pure, dazzling golden pagoda that floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Precious Pagoda spun slowly, radiating light.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the dense clouds had been torn open, and the brilliant sunlight after the rain had broken through the darkness, gathering into beams that shone upon Xixi.</p><p></p><p>With her eyes closed, Xixi only felt a sense of warmth.</p><p></p><p>It was so comfortable, making her feel...</p><p></p><p>...as if she was back in her father's embrace.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, minute by minute.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, two sticks of incense had burned...</p><p></p><p>Bathed in the golden light, Xixi's initial freshness had faded, and she even couldn't help but yawn.</p><p></p><p>The warmth, combined with the tranquil surroundings, lulled Xixi into drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>In the hall, Nanlihuo furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>The distant Sangguanyin and Liuyuangyuan also had slight changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it taking so long?"</p><p></p><p>They both had experienced the Precious Pagoda's teachings, naturally knowing the usual process.</p><p></p><p>Back then, they had both been bathed in the Pagoda's golden light for less than half an incense stick before completing the transmission and obtaining the divine appearance technique and divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Nanlihuo's eyes narrowed, his grave expression tinged with excitement and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>The golden Precious Pagoda trembled slightly, like an ancient bronze bell being struck.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the divine energies throughout the entire temple seemed to awaken.</p><p></p><p>As if an ancient existence had slowly opened its eyes and lowered its gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial divine nature, pure and flawless.</p><p>Can enter the seven-treasure Sarira Precious Golden Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>It was as if the eyes of an ancient deity had opened and closed, its lips parting to chant the divine sounds.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The next moment, the golden light shining on Xixi suddenly changed, erupting with an overwhelmingly powerful suction force.</p><p></p><p>The dozing Xixi was abruptly jolted awake, only to find herself floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>She was immediately startled and began flailing about.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Sangguanyin, Master Patriarch... Save me!"</p><p></p><p>Sangguanyin's face was filled with anxiety, her divine energies surging, as she prepared to rush forward.</p><p></p><p>However, Nanlihuo's eyes gleamed, and with a light tap of his finger, he immobilized Sangguanyin's body.</p><p></p><p>"Do not act rashly, Xixi is in no danger."</p><p></p><p>"This is the opening of the divine sanctum within the Golden Precious Pagoda..."</p><p></p><p>"Only those with pure divine nature may enter."</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity for Xixi."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night wind was bitterly cold.</p><p></p><p>Li Che was unaware of the events unfolding on Golden Peak.</p><p></p><p>He had left many divine chess pieces on Xixi, and as long as Xixi was not in danger, he would not sense it and could continue with his own affairs.</p><p></p><p>Li Che concealed his aura, donned a straw hat and a Milu mask, and silently left the workshop courtyard, blending into the darkness like a shadow, striding across the long street.</p><p></p><p>Following the address given by Li Qingshan, Li Che floated along, stepping on the Cloud Ascent Stairs of the Boundary Realm, his movements as swift and silent as a soaring hawk.</p><p></p><p>A small courtyard, the agreed-upon meeting place.</p><p></p><p>Li Che arrived like a startled phoenix, crossing the high wall and landing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he touched down, his entire body bristled with tension, and a muffled thud resounded as the body under his black robe seemed to swell up in an instant, with countless sinews and bones roaring and howling.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelmingly powerful aura of blood and qi permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his five fingers, the Bloody Shocking Spear fell into his hand, emanating an eerie, bloody scent.</p><p></p><p>In the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit, only five temple deity chess pieces remained, and he had locked onto one, ready to detonate it the moment he activated the Ascending Pagoda state, giving himself time to break free using the Flying Thunder chess piece.</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Che was so tense...</p><p></p><p>was because there was a divine appearance cultivator in the courtyard. A young man wearing a green half-peacock mask, sitting at a stone table in the courtyard, sipping tea, with a small stone stove on the table boiling water.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive courage, but... since you've come, and I don't want to let you leave in my presence, how will you be able to leave?"</p><p></p><p>The faint laughter came from the peacock-masked youth.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Che was wary, he relaxed a bit. This must be an ally... one of their own people.</p><p></p><p>He never expected Li Qingshan's ally to be a divine appearance cultivator! A true divine appearance cultivator, not a false one.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's heart stirred, and the [Chess Saint] Dao Fruit pounded slightly as he quickly analyzed the other's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Astronomical Observatory Deputy Director... Lin Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>That time, during the Shenxong Sect's entry examination, the high-level figures of the various powers in the Golden Light Prefecture had almost all gone, and Li Che had recorded the auras of nearly everyone using the Heavenly Earth Chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the information he had obtained from Shangguan Qinghu about everyone's identities, Li Che could now confirm the other's identity through his divine sense perception, even though Lin Xiu had slightly disguised his divine aura.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why aren't you afraid anymore?" </p><p></p><p>The half-peacock-masked Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Milu mask, did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan arrived, hunched over, with a Goat Horn Heavenly Hammer hidden in his sleeve, wearing a cat-faced mask, floating gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you two came early."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Introduce them, Cat Face."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Peacock, this is Ox Demon, the one who caused such a ruckus for the Qin family."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan introduced.</p><p></p><p>Li Che: "..."</p><p></p><p>Cat Face, Peacock... They should both know each other's identities, yet they're still playing at disguises. These two must have some issues.</p><p></p><p>Especially Li Qingshan, with that Goat Horn Hammer out, his underwear might as well be recognized.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Xiu, the divine appearance cultivator... he clearly had no intention of seriously concealing his identity.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Demon, huh..."</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting, very cautious, and your perception is keen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu smiled: "My concealment techniques are second to none in the Golden Light Prefecture, if not the best..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at the Ox Demon. This Lin Xiu... just loves to boast.</p><p></p><p>In Li Qingshan's mind, the Ox Demon's concealment techniques were truly unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>"You're right." The Ox Demon acknowledged Lin Xiu's words.</p><p></p><p>He, the Ox Demon, never competed, only killed when necessary.</p><p></p><p>"The target is the Shangguan family, the Shangguan family's patriarch, Shangguan Zhenghen, the third-generation Shangguan Leilong, and Shangguan Yunlong, all of whom have been imprinted with the Corpse Deity Sect's Corpse Curse."</p><p></p><p>"The divine appearance patriarch cannot be touched, and killing a divine appearance cultivator is no easy task."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, tonight's mission and plan is to eliminate the three, excluding the divine appearance patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"The five great families all have members imprinted with the Corpse Curse, but we cannot act against them all at once, as moving against one family... requires careful planning and gradual execution."</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen is easy to kill, as he is a lecherous man who often spends the night at Yunfang Pavilion, so we can simply enter Yunfang Pavilion to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"But Leilong and Yunlong are not easy to eliminate, as they have been staying within the Shangguan family estate..."</p><p></p><p>"But today, they have returned from the 'Scorpion Forest', which is the best opportunity to strike."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan spoke softly, his finger dipping in the tea water and lightly tracing on the stone table.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he flicked off the water droplets.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we force Leilong and Yunlong to unleash their Corpse Curse techniques, it will confirm their collusion with the Corpse Deity Sect, and that divine appearance patriarch of the Shangguan family will have no choice but to swallow his anger..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the prerequisite is that your assessment and judgment are correct, Ox Demon, and that Shangguan Leilong and Yunlong are indeed imprinted with the Corpse Curse!"</p><p></p><p>The peacock-masked Lin Xiu looked calmly at the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>In this operation, there was a divine appearance cultivator, one who could smash false appearance cultivators with a hammer, and one... who could kill weakened appearance cultivators, the Ox Demon.</p><p></p><p>With a divine appearance cultivator as the anchor, Li Qingshan would do the killing, and the Ox Demon would provide the assessment.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Xiu harbored doubts about the Ox Demon's analytical abilities, after all... by what means did the Ox Demon sense their Corpse Curse imprints? Did the Ox Demon also have a Corpse Curse imprint? Although the Ox Demon was brought by Li Qingshan, Lin Xiu still had his suspicions.</p><p></p><p>But the Ox Demon's track record was verifiable, as he had ferreted out and killed those Corpse Deity Sect members with Corpse Curse imprints in the Fishing Clan, causing the decline of a major power in the prefecture, which was eventually divided up by the various factions.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show that the Ox Demon's abilities were indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan glanced at Li Che and then smiled: "Peacock, trust me this once."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Xiu closed his eyes again and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He and Li Qingshan were from the same era, but while Li Qingshan had taken the step to become a divine appearance cultivator, Lin Xiu had already completed the transition and consolidation of the false appearance and divine appearance realms.</p><p></p><p>But they had once ridden the rivers and lakes together, experiencing thrilling enmities and favors.</p><p></p><p>The trust that should have existed was still there.</p><p></p><p>He did not trust the Ox Demon, but he would trust Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere seemed to have become slightly stagnant.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, how will the spoils of the killings be divided?" </p><p></p><p>The muffled voice of the Ox Demon broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>This was important.</p><p></p><p>First, they should discuss the money, so that the subsequent cooperation could proceed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu was taken aback, the spoils of the killings? </p><p></p><p>He then snorted derisively and said indifferently, "The spoils are not important to me, but I can't work for nothing, so let's just divide them equally."</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan shrugged: "I've called you two here to cause trouble, so it's not right for me to take the lion's share, let's just divide it equally."</p><p></p><p>As the Shangguan family patriarch, Shangguan Zhenghen must have some good things, and as for Shangguan Leilong and Shangguan Yunlong, being false appearance cultivators, their assets wouldn't be too shabby either.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Xiu, it was nothing, but for Li Qingshan, it could be considered quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>Dividing it equally? A thought crossed Li Che's mind: "I have a friend here as well... his archery skills are top-notch, and if there's a special situation where he can lend a hand, he can take a share of the spoils, but if he doesn't, then forget it... how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che looked at Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan's eyebrows under the cat-faced mask raised slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Your friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Che nodded firmly: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent in archery, can pose a threat to Xuxiang cultivators... can injure the other party."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the eyes behind Lin Xiu's peacock mask brightened: "Is he the mysterious archer who killed Qin Yuqing of the Qin family?"</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan tapped his fingers lightly on the stone table: "Since that's the case, your friend will be the final safeguard... to prevent any accidents."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Niu Mo, what's your friend's name?"</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo pressed down on his straw hat: "His name is... Ma Mian."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen is extremely greedy and licentious, abducting wives and daughters, acting tyrannically and brutally."</p><p></p><p>"He has abducted hundreds of wives, keeping them in his private residence, with dead women being carried out of the residence every day..."</p><p></p><p>"Suspected of cultivating the Corpse God Sect's Six Desires Deity..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu held a piece of paper in her hand, on which Shangguan Zhenghen's crimes were written.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Zhenghen has indeed committed a lot of evil deeds over the years... this person is practically a walking pile driver."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu's eyes were ice-cold, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qinghong was his disciple, and Shangguan Zhenghen was Shangguan Qinghong's biological father, but he had no intention of going easy on him.</p><p></p><p>Because Shangguan Qinghong had also been plotting to assassinate his own father.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Shangguan Qinghong's cultivation was not high enough, so he handed the list of crimes to Niu Mo.</p><p></p><p>Niu Mo glanced at it, and the reflection of Shangguan Zhenghen's numerous crimes in the Ox Demon mask made him close his eyes and pass the list to Li Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Upon reopening his eyes, Niu Mo's eyes were extremely cold, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"He should be killed."</p><p></p><p>A savage aura emanated from Niu Mo, causing Lin Xiu to glance at him again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Niu Mo's character of hating evil, Lin Xiu smiled, knowing that if Niu Mo didn't hate evil so much, he wouldn't have single-handedly hunted down and ruthlessly killed the Corpse God Sect members in the Fishing Gang.</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan didn't even look at it, flicking the list of crimes back to Lin Xiu's hand.</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of seeking the Temple Magistrate for the list of crimes?"</p><p></p><p>"Just kill him directly!"</p><p></p><p>"In the face of life-threatening danger, if he has cultivated the Corpse Summoning Art, he will surely be unable to resist using it to increase his chances of survival. Wouldn't that provide evidence then?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I trust Niu Mo. This kid... has been able to hunt down and kill those with the Corpse Curse Seal imprinted by the Fishing Gang's Corpse God Sect without a single mistake. Of course, he won't make a mistake!"</p><p></p><p>"I trust him."</p><p></p><p>"Take action!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the three in the small courtyard instantly disappeared, each using concealment techniques to silently merge into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Li Che activated the "Dragon Elephant Vajra" to conceal his aura, completely moving in the darkness, his five senses and six consciousnesses completely undetectable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu: "Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>The presence disappeared? Niu Mo... disappeared!</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Xiu was a Xuxiang cultivator, at this moment, he couldn't help but be a little startled.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Niu Mo's concealment technique to be so powerful, at least his Concealment Divine Symbol seemed to be inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, Li Qingshan's concealment technique is like a night lamp at the bottom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"You also know that my concealment technique is at the bottom... quickly give me a Concealment Divine Symbol!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qingshan sighed mournfully.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yunfang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As the most luxurious brothel in the capital city, for Shangguan Zhenghen, as the patriarch of the five great families, the Shangguan family, the amount of silver he could spend in one night at Yunfang Pavilion was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>The luxurious floating pavilion, not far away was the gently flowing Nine Dragons River, the moonlight was shattered and scattered all over, rippling and shimmering.</p><p></p><p>He gently pushed away the woman busying herself below him, lazily leaning back on the soft fur chair.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered slightly, a ruthless light surging in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Li Che..."</p><p></p><p>"That bastard actually got lucky and gave birth to a prodigy, truly envious of me!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Thunder entering the Divine Sect's true inheritance should have been a done deal, but it was disrupted by a three-year-old little girl."</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, Shangguan Zhenghen let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"It's unreasonable, how can that bastard Li Che give birth to a prodigy? Just an ordinary replacement warrior, just a waste cultivating, how can he give birth to a prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be because of the good maternal womb..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's gaze darkened as he thought of Li Che's wife.</p><p></p><p>Li Che's talent was ordinary, so the prodigy must have been due to the maternal womb.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I need to find an opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Stretching, he put on the luxurious thin robe, although he was already over a hundred years old, he still looked young.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the window, the night wind from the river blew in, bringing a cool breeze.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen stood with his hands behind his back, his hair flying, his gaze flickering with a flowing light.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he would become one of the top existences standing at the pinnacle of the Golden Light Mansion.</p><p></p><p>He was currently at the Xuxiang realm, with the Divine Xiang pressing down on him above.</p><p></p><p>If he could achieve true Divine Xiang, he would be able to do as he pleased. </p><p></p><p>The rules were often made for the weak, and even though he was the patriarch of the Shangguan family, he was still constrained by the issue of strength.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen suddenly had a premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He saw that on the tributary of the Nine Dragons River, among the many flower boats, a small boat was swaying.</p><p></p><p>It was about a hundred yards away.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a slender and graceful figure on the lone boat stood up and raised a divine crossbow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>Li Che, wearing the Niu Mo mask, was merged into the darkness, his eyes becoming increasingly cold and ruthless, without the slightest emotional fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly chessboard expanded.</p><p></p><p>He had already locked onto Shangguan Zhenghen's position.</p><p></p><p>He came to act tonight with the determination to kill Shangguan Zhenghen. This person had once released a suppressive aura towards Xixing in the arena, and he had remembered this grudge.</p><p></p><p>And today, he had another reason to kill Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>This person actually dared to covet his Yaya! Dared to target his Li Che's family member, he must die!</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan to make their move, and as for him... he would be the one to deliver the final blow, ensuring that Shangguan Zhenghen would die completely.</p><p></p><p>Killing, Niu Mo was serious about it.</p><p></p><p>Huh? However, Li Che did not wait for Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan to make their move.</p><p></p><p>And the hidden Lin Xiu and Li Qingshan also paused in their actions.</p><p></p><p>Their masked eyes were both gloomy as they looked out, seeing the lone boat swaying on the river bank, and the divine crossbow aimed at Shangguan Zhenghen on the boat.</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming killing intent and hatred were emanating from the boat.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that...</p><p></p><p>Not only were they going to kill Shangguan Zhenghen, but there were also others planning an assassination!</p><p></p><p>Li Che sensed the familiar aura spreading out on the heavenly and earthly chessboard, and his expression became slightly strange.</p><p></p><p>"This aura..."</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Lin Xiu's peacock mask suddenly narrowed, and he sighed softly: "This girl..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The divine crossbow was made of spiritual wood, and it was wrapped with divine symbols, an extremely powerful divine symbol crossbow.</p><p></p><p>The divine crossbow was a top-level killing tool in the Divine Guard Army, specifically used to kill Xiansheng warriors.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the divine symbols wrapped around the divine crossbow, using specially made crossbow bolts, the divine crossbow has become a divine symbol crossbow, with its power increased by several levels.</p><p></p><p>The graceful figure, wearing a squirrel mask, the black eyes behind the mask staring at the Shangguan Zhenghen standing in the window of the Yunfang Pavilion with hatred! "Damn bastard! Die—!"</p><p></p><p>A hateful roar came from under the mask! Spreading the five fingers, divine energy erupted, slamming fiercely onto the divine crossbow, as if awakening the evil dragon in the river! Instantly, the divine crossbow on the boat let out a heaven-shaking and earth-shattering roar.</p><p></p><p>Screech! The sound waves exploded!</p><p></p><p>The crossbow bolt roared, parting the airflow, and shot out in a mad frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The calm river surface suddenly surged with waves, the river water seemed to be split open from the center, the divine crossbow bolt howling and shooting out, the white waves parting to the sides!</p><p></p><p>The divine symbols burned, the divine energy erupted, and the bolt's speed kept increasing!</p><p></p><p>Dragging a hundred-yard-long trail of air in the sky, it was as if it was splitting the river surface in two! In an instant, it approached Shangguan Zhenghen, just three feet away.</p><p></p><p>The surging divine symbols and divine energy kept strengthening the explosive power and penetration of the divine crossbow.</p><p></p><p>This was a premeditated must-kill!</p><p></p><p>However, Shangguan Zhenghen's eyes narrowed, the figure standing on the pavilion window suddenly flashed a bronze color! "Assassination? Do you think I dared to go out at night for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming blood qi erupted from his body, his five fingers like hooks, tearing through the cold wind flow, and slammed out fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Dong—! Terrifying sound waves exploded, as if an ancient bronze bell thousands of years old was struck heavily! The divine crossbow with the divine symbols, if it was an ordinary Xuxiang cultivator, it would really be possible to accidentally pierce through the body and suffer heavy injuries! But Shangguan Zhenghen, a flash of corpse energy black mark appeared on his brow, stepped out, and with his dragon-like muscular steel-clad arms, fiercely grabbed the dragon-like crossbow bolt! The divine symbol power erupting on it was completely suppressed by his Xuxiang aura!</p><p></p><p>The entire pavilion exploded in multiple places, under the raging and surging airflow impact, wood chips flew, and shattered stones shot out.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's black hair flew, his eyes full of ferocious laughter and malice.</p><p></p><p>"A woman?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the graceful figure on the boat, the squirrel mask, Shangguan Zhenghen let out a greedy howl.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Exerting force under his feet, grabbing the divine symbol-burned and power-depleted crossbow bolt, his whole body emanating a bronze color, he ruthlessly rushed across the river for hundreds of yards, splashing up columns of river water as if walking on flat ground.</p><p></p><p>On the boat.</p><p></p><p>The assassin wearing the squirrel mask was obviously startled.</p><p></p><p>"Cursed Copper Corpse?!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the female assassin slapped the edge of the boat, activating the divine symbols, causing the boat to erupt with water flow, shooting out like a speedboat.</p><p></p><p>The divine symbol crossbow couldn't kill Shangguan Zhenghen.</p><p></p><p>I need to find another opportunity! "Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen's eyes flashed with a red light, his whole body flowing with bronze, his muscles roaring, his five fingers clenching. </p><p></p><p>He threw out the long spear-like crossbow bolt.</p><p></p><p>Extremely fast, it shot towards the boat.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>After throwing out the crossbow bolt, Shangguan Zhenghen's pupils suddenly shrank, he found that his wildly dancing hair had suddenly fallen down, unable to rise at all.</p><p></p><p>As if a mountain was collapsing, a terrifying pressure...</p><p></p><p>Crashed down on him.</p><p></p><p>The mighty and violent Shangguan Zhenghen, who was striding across the waves, suddenly stopped, as if turned into a statue, frozen on the river surface! "Just right, he came out himself."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Zhenghen felt that the Xuxiang within him had stagnated, unable to move or release! That was the divine energy level aura! From a Divine Xiang!</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat dripped from Shangguan Zhenghen's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Xiang... Divine Xiang!"</p><p></p><p>"Which Divine Xiang wants to kill me?!"</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets and recommendation tickets, don't let the book go stale, Mr. Li thanks you!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps its body temperature was too high.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found that the emerald-green crystal stones near its body were actually starting to vaporize!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt a bit sorry for it.</p><p></p><p>He quickly called for a stop.</p><p></p><p>The two burning flame-filled eyes of the Molten Flame Demon revealed an extremely humanized expression.</p><p></p><p>Just like a misbehaving child.</p><p></p><p>Yet it looked so burly and terrifying, the contrasting cuteness was gripping.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was also helpless.</p><p></p><p>He knew the Molten Flame Demon didn't do it on purpose.</p><p></p><p>However, in the subsequent instructions, he had the Flame Demon start excavating from the rock layers next to the cave wall crystals, and there were no more problems.</p><p></p><p>In no time, a large cluster of emerald-green crystals, along with some surrounding rocks, were extracted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi cleared out all the water and food from his spatial storage, then stored the crystals in his personal space.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yi sent the Molten Flame Demon back to the elemental plane, then crushed the return scroll.</p><p></p><p>After a dizzying whirl, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi opened his eyes again to find himself back in the teleportation hall of Jiang City.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the teleportation hall, Lin Yi headed straight home.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual items and the things dropped by the Tiger King in his backpack, Lin Yi planned to go to the trading house to check them out tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Back home, Lin Yi had a simple dinner with his parents.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, he returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi opened his panel.</p><p></p><p>The skill point balance that he had nearly exhausted this morning had now increased by forty to fifty thousand points again.</p><p></p><p>This constant feeling of having resources being given to him, it was a steady happiness!</p><p></p><p>Today he had obtained a new wind-attribute skill.</p><p></p><p>Should he put the skills of this system together to see the effect?</p><p></p><p>Reason told him that having more skill systems would definitely broaden his choices, and his combat power would definitely increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>Especially after witnessing the terrifying destructive power of the 7th-tier spell Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had already fallen in love with that feeling of destroying everything with a flick of the hand.</p><p></p><p>If 7th-tier fire spells were already so powerful, </p><p></p><p>then what would 7th-tier wind spells be like? Lin Yi made up his mind, after all, upgrading to 7th-tier would only take a little over a hundred thousand skill points.</p><p></p><p>Just a day of grinding would be enough!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi woke up early as usual.</p><p></p><p>Overnight, his skill point balance had approached a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Probably by noon, he would be able to give the new wind system skills a massive boost, directly advancing them rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Before that.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi planned to first go stroll through the Life Profession Street, sell the large cluster of emerald-green crystal ore he had dug up yesterday, and see how much money he could get.</p><p></p><p>Then go, then go to the trading house to see if he could find a few mage skill books.</p><p></p><p>Finally, go to the Reincarnation Hall.</p><p></p><p>Accept the second job change quest.</p><p></p><p>After the second job change, he should unlock even more new skills.</p><p></p><p>With this plan in mind, Lin Yi went out the door and quickly arrived at the Life Profession Street of Jiang City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found the best appraiser on this street.</p><p></p><p>He planned to first identify what exactly the emerald-green crystals he obtained in that cave were, so that he would have a rough idea of their value, so as not to be cheated by unscrupulous merchants when selling them.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, are you looking to have something appraised?"</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair and glasses, looking scholarly and refined, smiled at Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>This was the most respected appraiser in the entire Life Profession Street of Jiang City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded, taking out a small piece of emerald-green crystal from his spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>The moment this crystal appeared, Lin Yi felt a cool breeze start blowing through the appraiser's hall.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The smile froze for a moment, then turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, the thing you're holding in your hand is extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"May I take a look at it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded and handed the crystal to the old man.</p><p></p><p>The old man adjusted his glasses and began to examine it carefully, while the glow of his appraisal technique also lit up.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old man looked at Lin Yi in amazement: "Incredible, this Wind Spirit Marrow is so pure, it's really quite rare!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's heart stirred. </p><p></p><p>So this thing was called Wind Spirit Marrow.</p><p></p><p>"This type of mineral-rich spiritual object not only requires purity, but also the quantity you have on hand."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what you showed me was probably just a small sample. </p><p></p><p>"You should have the entire crystal ore, and if the volume is large and the purity is at the level of this sample, then..."</p><p></p><p>Before the old man could finish his words, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out a huge emerald-green crystal ore weighing twenty or thirty pounds.</p><p></p><p>The old man, who had just been appraising the value for Lin Yi, suddenly sucked in a cold breath, staring in disbelief!</p><p></p><p>He almost couldn't catch his breath, nearly passing out.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the old man recovered and said, "Young man, a Wind Spirit Marrow this large is no longer something that can be valued by the market price, it's already considered a collector's item."</p><p></p><p>"You should go to a specialized spiritual object recycling shop to inquire."</p><p></p><p>"Don't sell it to a trading house, they can only pay you by weight at the market price, you'll end up getting much less."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi thanked the old man, paid the appraisal fee, and put the Wind Spirit Marrow back in his backpack, continuing to wander around the Profession Street.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>More than half an hour later, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked out of a store called the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was a shop that specialized in recycling rare materials and spiritual objects, similar to the antique shops he was familiar with in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had a Treasure Pavilion VIP black card in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>And there was also 120,000 Daxia coins in the card.</p><p></p><p>After selling that collector's grade Wind Spirit Marrow, the enthusiastic store owner even gave Lin Yi an extra 10,000 Daxia coins.</p><p></p><p>According to the owner, this 10,000 was just to make a new friend.</p><p></p><p>He insisted that if Lin Yi had any such good items in the future, he must come to him.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely buy them at a price far above the market rate.</p><p></p><p>Until he walked out of the store, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi himself was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly become so wealthy?</p><p></p><p>Daxia, as one of the strongest countries on the Blue Star, </p><p></p><p>has a currency value and circulation rate that is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>120,000 Daxia coins is truly a considerable sum of money.</p><p></p><p>It might take Lin Yi's father, Lin Guodong, three or four years of hard work in the mines to earn this much.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Detected that your currency has exceeded 100,000 for the first time, your SSS-rank talent: Gift of the Gods has unlocked a new function!]</p><p></p><p>A prompt sounded in Lin Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>Huh? New function??</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly opened his talent interface.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yi understood what this new function was.</p><p></p><p>[Gift of the Gods]</p><p>[Effect: You gain 1 skill point per second.]</p><p>[New Function: You can now spend real-world circulating currency to purchase a 24-hour skill point reward bonus!]</p><p>[Note, the currency required for each subsequent purchase will increase!]</p><p>[Current purchase cost: 10,000 Daxia coins.]</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

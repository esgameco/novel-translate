        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That is, while the power is extremely terrifying, the skill consumption is also very large! The chanting time is also very long.</p><p></p><p>Take the 7th-tier spell [Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath] that Lin Yi just obtained as an example.</p><p></p><p>[Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath]</p><p>{Type: Active Skill}</p><p>{Tier: 7th}</p><p>{Attribute: Fire}</p><p>{Consumption: 30,000 Mana}</p><p>{Chanting Time: 20 seconds}</p><p>{Cooldown: 2 hours}</p><p>{Effect: Summon the scorching dragon's breath to descend from the sky, igniting all targets within the dragon's breath range, dealing massive fire damage, and inflicting long-lasting dragon flame burn damage.}</p><p>{Remark: Wherever it passes, it will be scorched earth.}</p><p></p><p>This 7th-tier spell requires the consumption of 30,000 mana points to cast.</p><p>It also requires a very long 20-second chanting time.</p><p>Lin Yi currently only has a 100-point mana limit, and he can't even use this high-level skill.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yi turned his attention to his two passive skills.</p><p>Especially [Efficient Spellcasting]! He hopes that this skill can bring him surprises after upgrading, at least allowing him to cast high-level spells!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi switched his skill points to [Efficient Spellcasting], and then, just like he did when adding points to Fireball, he started frantically adding points again!</p><p>The "ding ding ding" prompt sounds never stopped.</p><p></p><p>More than ten minutes later, Lin Yi received the prompt for the final skill upgrade.</p><p>{Consume 100,000 skill points, your Super Mana Surge has been upgraded, and you have gained a new passive skill: Mana Storm!}</p><p></p><p>After consuming more than a hundred thousand skill points, Lin Yi upgraded the [Efficient Spellcasting] little skill to 7th tier.</p><p>Of course, its name is now much more majestic.</p><p></p><p>[Mana Storm]</p><p>{Type: Passive Skill}</p><p>{Tier: 7th}</p><p>{Attribute: Universal}</p><p>{Effect 1: The mana cost of all your spells is reduced by 70%.}</p><p>{Effect 2: Your maximum mana from all sources is increased 7-fold, and you regenerate 7% of your maximum mana per second.}</p><p>{Effect 3: Every 8 hours, you have a chance to cast any spell below 9th tier for free, current available uses: 1, maximum stacks: 3.}</p><p>{Remark: I am the approaching storm.}</p><p></p><p>Whew...</p><p>Lin Yi took a deep breath.</p><p>This is an amazing passive skill! And it just solved his pressing problem! The mana cost of all his skills is reduced by 70%, which means his endurance is much stronger now.</p><p>The cost of a [Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath] has been reduced from 30,000 to 9,000, which, although still high, is no longer out of reach.</p><p>More importantly, he has 3 free casting opportunities every day.</p><p>This way, he won't be unable to use crucial skills due to lack of mana.</p><p>Great! Lin Yi wasted no time and turned his gaze to the last remaining passive skill - [Rapid Chanting].</p><p></p><p>Another over 10-minute frenzy of adding points.</p><p>Lin Yi was starting to feel a bit tired.</p><p>Although the experience of frantically upgrading his own skills is wonderful and exciting,</p><p>it is truly monotonous and tedious.</p><p>The required operation is just clicking and clicking...</p><p>Lin Yi's hands were sore.</p><p>If other practitioners knew of Lin Yi's troubles at this moment, they would probably be furious!</p><p>They all had to work hard grinding dungeons for dozens or even hundreds of skill points.</p><p>Thinking carefully, weighing the pros and cons, trying to maximize the cost-effectiveness and benefits when upgrading their skills.</p><p>Lin Yi, on the other hand, just mindlessly added points, and that's it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, another brand-new seventh-tier skill was forged.</p><p></p><p>【Divine Chant】</p><p>[Type: Passive Skill]</p><p>[Tier: Seventh]</p><p>[Attribute: Universal]</p><p>[Effect 1: When you cast spells below the fifth tier, the spell becomes instant-cast. For spells above the fifth tier, the casting time is reduced by 70%.]</p><p>[Effect 2: Your casting will not be interrupted by any skills below the seventh tier that cause interruption, silence, or anti-magic.]</p><p>[Effect 3: Every 8 hours, you have a chance to instantly cast any spell below the ninth tier. Current available uses: 1, maximum stacks: 3.]</p><p>[Note: Blessed by divine grace, chanting the words of the gods.]</p><p></p><p>Here it is! </p><p></p><p>Instant-cast spells have arrived! Lin Yi had previously anticipated that his two passive skills would become incredibly powerful after advancing in tiers.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect them to be this powerful.</p><p>And they even synergize with each other.</p><p>Costless casting + Instant-cast!</p><p>This is our hot-blooded combo technique!</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yi wanted to, he could even instantly cast a seventh-tier Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath right on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yi hasn't tested the power of this skill yet, he has a premonition.</p><p>If he were to unleash this seventh-tier fire magic attack,</p><p>It might end up causing destruction to half of Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>He's not some kind of misanthropic fanatic, so naturally, he wouldn't do something like that.</p><p></p><p>But to be honest, Lin Yi is already itching to try it out.</p><p></p><p>Since he can't brazenly unleash high-tier skills in the city, maybe he can go to the remote high-level training grounds and give it a try?</p><p>Lin Yi quickly gathered the various alchemy concoctions, red and blue potions, experience scrolls, and return scrolls he had prepared, and dumped them all into the 50-slot personal space he gained after awakening his profession.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yi left his home and went to the commercial street of the living professions in Jiangcheng, where he freeloaded a large amount of food and water sources.</p><p>Completely filling up his personal space.</p><p></p><p>Daxia places great importance on talent cultivation.</p><p>So as a newly awakened professional like Lin Yi, he enjoys educational benefits.</p><p>He only needs to tell these living profession vendors, "I'm a student," </p><p>and show his student ID to freeload a large amount of basic supply items.</p><p></p><p>With all preparations complete, Lin Yi left the inner city of Jiangcheng and headed to the suburbs.</p><p></p><p>The suburbs were an endless grassland. The gentle breeze and pleasant weather made it a nice day.</p><p>Lin Yi scanned the area and saw many people around his age swinging various weapons, hunting harmless little animals like rabbits and marmots.</p><p></p><p>This was the lowest-level training ground outside Jiangcheng: the Peaceful Grassland.</p><p>The monsters in this grassland were generally level 1-4, and they were all non-aggressive creatures.</p><p>Even the weak rabbits and marmots would only flee when attacked, not fight back.</p><p>This place was a paradise for newbies.</p><p></p><p>So a large number of newly awakened professionals would choose to level up here.</p><p>However, the leveling efficiency was relatively low.</p><p>Because there were more people than monsters.</p><p>Most monsters would be instantly killed by the onslaught of attacks as soon as they respawned.</p><p></p><p>So some more ambitious people, or those with stronger professions and ample resources, would venture deeper into the grassland to challenge more dangerous and powerful monsters for higher leveling efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi bypassed the popular leveling spots in the Peaceful Grassland and headed deeper into the grassland.</p><p>It took him half a day to reach his destination.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, Lin Yi saw the dense forest at the end of the grassland and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>That was the higher-level training ground - the Howling Forest.</p><p>The monsters in the forest were generally level 9 and above, and they were bloodthirsty and aggressive, actively attacking intruders.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

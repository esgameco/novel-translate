        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just like your ultimate skill, it's not something that can be easily unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a group of low-level soldiers, it's unlikely that anyone would be willing to casually exchange blows with the Qing Dynasty's troops, right? So Lin Yi has been planning to try his luck, to see if there might be any boss-level targets in this wailing forest that could satisfy his cravings.</p><p></p><p>Now this Tiger King is undoubtedly an excellent target.</p><p></p><p>But before Lin Yi could even cast a spell, suddenly, white lights started popping up on his body one after another!</p><p></p><p>[You have leveled up to Level 8! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p>[You have leveled up to Level 9! Gained 10 free attribute points!] </p><p>[You have leveled up to Level 10! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p>[You have leveled up to Level 11! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p>[You have leveled up to Level 12! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p></p><p>This sight couldn't help but surprise Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Even the nearby Tiger King was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on with this human?</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly level up so much? Of course, Lin Yi didn't know that this was due to the two Inferno Demons he had summoned, which had slaughtered the entire horde of beasts that had driven away the professionals, earning him a huge amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>However, this little interlude only delayed the Tiger King's death by half a minute.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yi extended a finger.</p><p></p><p>Pointing towards the Tiger King.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the heavens and earth changed color!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying waves of magic power stirred up the elemental fire between heaven and earth, causing them to erupt violently!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the previously almost completely darkened dense forest above was lit up again in a deep red color.</p><p></p><p>As if the evening glow had returned!</p><p></p><p>"Roar—!"</p><p>"Wuwuwu—!"</p><p></p><p>The entire tiger pack began to panic.</p><p>Roars, whimpers, echoing all around.</p><p></p><p>Animals' perception of disaster has always been much more acute than that of humans.</p><p></p><p>They all sensed the impending calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even the Tiger King's constant roars could not suppress the urge of its clan and dependents to flee for their lives.</p><p></p><p>Some adult fierce tigers had already started to run on all fours, straining every muscle to try and escape this place.</p><p></p><p>However, the fate awaiting them was still one of despair! Because the Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath, a 7th-tier spell, had an area of effect that was too large, too vast!</p><p>And because Lin Yi's casting was instantaneous, the speed of the attack exceeded everyone's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Resonate—!!!"</p><p></p><p>The elemental giant dragon in the sky let out a long dragon's roar, and then its huge wings began to flap continuously!</p><p>Its lofty head suddenly spewed out vast sheets of scorching dragon's breath!</p><p>The width of the dragon's breath could no longer be measured in meters, but in kilometers!</p><p></p><p>The dragon flames fell like a rain curtain, sweeping across dozens of kilometers. Wherever it passed, the dense forest withered and turned to charcoal. Many poor creatures didn't even have time to react before the great calamity had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Half a minute later.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's breath unleashed by the elemental giant dragon in the sky directly bisected the wailing forest, leaving the dense vegetation and trees on the two sides intact.</p><p>But in the central area, spanning over ten kilometers, it had become a scorched earth, burning like hell.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the fluctuations of magical power gradually subsided.</p><p>The giant dragon formed by the pure fire elements also slowly dissipated on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The professionals who had quickly retreated outside the forest were spared.</p><p>After all, the target of this Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath was not them.</p><p>But the towering heat waves and terrifying winds that had reached them from behind as they ran told them...</p><p></p><p>If this spell's target had been them...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was them.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even have time to escape!</p><p></p><p>Now it's just a pile of ashes. The first powerhouse of Jiangcheng, Jiang Xian, who is also a mage, witnessed the entire process and is trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>He is riding on his celestial horse.</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the entire wailing forest from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This forest covers an area of over a thousand kilometers. The doomsday scorched mark in the middle is silently telling the terrifying power of the seventh-tier spell!</p><p></p><p>That is a shocking power capable of changing the terrain! The one who has arrived in Jiangcheng is not the six-turn great mage.</p><p></p><p>But a seventh-tier magic saint! How could such a character come to this small level-5 base city, and why would they use such a high-level spell in this low-level training area!</p><p></p><p>Tonight, I guess many people, including myself, won't be able to sleep...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the central area of the Wailing Forest.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, this can no longer be called a forest.</p><p></p><p>As far as Lin Yi's gaze can reach, there are burning flames, and the trees are crackling and sparking in the fire.</p><p></p><p>Even the huge cave in front of Lin Yi has become completely bare.</p><p></p><p>The howling gale has also completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>Hereafter, the Wailing Forest will never return to its former appearance, and its name will also be completely changed.</p><p></p><p>As for the entire tiger pack that had been lurking and surrounding Lin Yi earlier, they have already turned to ashes. That majestic, ferocious tiger king has also become a few pieces of equipment and a white skill book, quietly lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>That tiger king was indeed a boss, and it dropped loot!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi picked up the two pieces of equipment.</p><p></p><p>After taking a look, they are both warrior-type plate armor equipment, with only a black iron grade, which can be sold at the auction house for a few thousand Xia coins.</p><p></p><p>The truly valuable thing is that skill book!</p><p></p><p>In this world, skills are the most valuable.</p><p></p><p>Most professionals, due to the lack of skill points, have to make choices among the skills.</p><p></p><p>But the more the better is a principle that everyone understands.</p><p></p><p>Some skills, just by having them, can sometimes produce amazing effects, even if their level is not high.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi picked up the skill book and checked the attributes.</p><p></p><p>[Beginner Skill Book: Wind Blade]</p><p>[Type: Skill Book (Tome)]</p><p>[Profession: Mage]</p><p>[Learnable Level: LV.5]</p><p>[Effect: After use, you will gain a new spell: Wind Blade.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's eyes lit up! Good stuff! Didn't expect to be so lucky!</p><p></p><p>Not only did he get an extremely rare dropped skill book, but it's also one he can use!</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to sell this skill book directly and buy another mage profession skill book with the Xia coins.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems like a direct upgrade.</p><p></p><p>There is a huge difference in the prices of skill books between different professions.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, for some reason, the skill books of warrior and knight-like "dumb" professions are much cheaper.</p><p></p><p>Mage, archer, and other ranged professions, especially mage.</p><p>Skill books are astronomical in price!</p><p></p><p>And in a small base city like Jiangcheng, the goods available in the trading post are basically all beginner skill books, without the existence of second or third-tier skill books.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi directly used this skill book.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he received a prompt.</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations, the use of the skill book was successful, and you have gained a new skill: Wind Blade!]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

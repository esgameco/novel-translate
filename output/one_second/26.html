        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Percentage-based damage vulnerability + percentage-based damage! This mechanism is quite special and a bit overpowered.</p><p></p><p>Although it requires the use of a fire-elemental spell to trigger, it's actually not that difficult for other mages to trigger.</p><p></p><p>Because even for ice mages, they only need to learn a basic fireball spell to be able to trigger the ice-breaking effect.</p><p></p><p>Dealing direct damage based on the target's maximum HP, if it's against monsters with extremely high HP but no ice resistance, the kill speed would be extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>It would even be much faster than just brute-forcing the damage with fire spells.</p><p></p><p>Then there's the 7th-tier ice spell.</p><p></p><p>The difference from fire and wind spells is also very large.</p><p></p><p>The 7th-tier fire and wind spells have very large areas of effect and powerful effects.</p><p></p><p>But this 7th-tier ice spell is actually a single-target spell.</p><p></p><p>[Soul Freeze]</p><p>{Type: Active Skill}</p><p>{Tier: 7th}</p><p>{School: Cryomancy}</p><p>{Cost: 28,000 Mana}</p><p>{Casting Time: 15 seconds}</p><p>{Cooldown: 30 minutes}</p><p>{Effect: Channeling horrific cold, trapping the target's soul in eternal ice, immobilizing them, preventing skill usage, and removing all beneficial effects. Duration is infinite.}</p><p>{Targets encased in the ice are immune to all damage except fire.}</p><p>{The ice will shatter when affected by 6th-tier or higher fire spells.}</p><p>{Note: Imprisoned in unbreakable ice for eternity.}</p><p></p><p>Another non-damaging skill.</p><p></p><p>But it extends the control duration from limited to infinite.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's not broken by fire, it's permanent control!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi is very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Because he now has mastery in three elemental schools.</p><p></p><p>Damage is not lacking at all.</p><p></p><p>What he was lacking was control skills.</p><p></p><p>Now the ice school has completely filled that gap.</p><p></p><p>After completing the ice school, Lin Yi looks at the other passive skill he gained from his second job advancement.</p><p></p><p>[Mana Shield]</p><p>{Type: Passive Skill}</p><p>{Tier: Initial}</p><p>{School: Universal}</p><p>{Effect: When you take damage, 10% of the damage is instead taken from your mana.}</p><p></p><p>A fairly decent survival skill.</p><p></p><p>For mages with far more mana than HP, this skill can be considered a 10% universal damage reduction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi starts allocating points.</p><p></p><p>After over 10 minutes.</p><p></p><p>This survival skill has been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>[Indestructible Form]</p><p>{Type: Passive Skill}</p><p>{Tier: 7th}</p><p>{School: Universal}</p><p>{Effect 1: When you take damage, 40% of the damage is instead taken from your mana.}</p><p>{Effect 2: When you take elemental damage, based on your affinity for that element, you gain additional damage reduction, minimum 10%, maximum 100%.}</p><p>{Current Elemental Damage Reduction:}</p><p>{Fire: 80%}</p><p>{Frost: 80%}</p><p>{Storm: 80%}</p><p>{Effect 3: When you would take fatal damage that would reduce your HP to 0, that damage is fully absorbed by your mana instead.}</p><p>{After this effect triggers, your mana is reduced to 0 and your HP is set to 1.}</p><p>{This effect can only trigger once every 30 days, current remaining uses: 1}</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>Not only does it have high damage reduction, it even gives Lin Yi a once-per-30-days "get out of death free" card!</p><p></p><p>This skill directly maxes out Lin Yi's sense of security.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Lin Yi did feel a bit of pressure when facing 200-level Aberrant Liches and similar bosses before.</p><p></p><p>After all, he wasn't truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>Even though his damage output far surpassed his current job level by orders of magnitude, his survivability has always been quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the fact that Rui Wen Dai had unleashed that fatal Void Slash before he could finish chanting and use the Thousand Tempests Break, his Level 5 Gale Wings would have been completely unable to withstand that attack. </p><p></p><p>He might have ended up crashing and burning.</p><p></p><p>Now, if Lin Yi encounters a similar situation, or an even more intense one, he wouldn't be as panicked anymore. </p><p></p><p>Not only has his survival capability improved, but his control has also increased.</p><p></p><p>Even if he were to face an enemy he couldn't instantly defeat, escaping shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>He has completed the upgrades for his two new skills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi still has over 500,000 skill points left.</p><p></p><p>More than enough to upgrade one of his Level 7 skills to Level 8.</p><p></p><p>It is indeed time to choose which one to upgrade.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi is still considering which one to select.</p><p></p><p>While pondering this, Lin Yi has already entered the gates of Jiang City Second High School.</p><p></p><p>Walking into the teaching building, Lin Yi gradually realizes that something is amiss.</p><p></p><p>Where are the people?</p><p></p><p>How come there's not a single person around?</p><p></p><p>Normally, even if the entire Grade 12 has undergone their career awakenings, there would still occasionally be students returning to school to consult teachers about leveling up or skills.</p><p></p><p>The school administration would even organize activities for teachers to guide students in leveling up.</p><p></p><p>But it's impossible for both students and teachers to have completely disappeared, right?</p><p></p><p>Filled with questions, Lin Yi heads to the faculty building.</p><p></p><p>He knocks on the door of the principal's office.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," an aged voice responds from within.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi pushes open the door.</p><p></p><p>The principal of Second High, named Zuo Qian, was also the one who presided over the entire Grade 12 career awakening ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yi, a look of surprise appears in the old principal's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Student Lin Yi, you've finally emerged from the blow!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm so relieved!"</p><p></p><p>"You've always been my favorite student, and I truly didn't want you to fall into ruin!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian scrutinizes Lin Yi up and down.</p><p></p><p>He can sense that the young man in front of him has grown significantly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Being a mage himself, Zuo Qian can feel a certain kind of spiritual connection between mages.</p><p></p><p>He can tell that Lin Yi definitely hasn't been wasting his time these past two weeks. This puts his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi doesn't explain anything, but directly asks, "Principal Zuo, I heard my homeroom teacher was looking for me urgently, saying it's related to my future. What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian takes off his reading glasses, stands up, and his expression turns serious.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed related to your future."</p><p></p><p>"Let's discuss it as we walk."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zuo Qian leads Lin Yi out of the office.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hauntingly melodious flute sound rings out, and the next moment, a shaggy-furred, somewhat battered-looking, unidentifiable hoofed beast appears.</p><p></p><p>This beast has deer-like antlers, but a more bovine-like face, and its four hooves resemble those of a horse.</p><p></p><p>A true mishmash of features.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, it has multicolored feathered wings protruding from its flanks.</p><p></p><p>As a Level 3 Awakened, Zuo Qian has gained the ability to learn mount skills and possess a mount space.</p><p></p><p>So this is clearly his mount.</p><p></p><p>"Get on, what are you waiting for!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi steps onto the stirrup at the back of the strange beast and climbs aboard.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, under Zuo Qian's control, the hybrid creature flaps its wings and takes to the sky, panting heavily as it does so.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "..."</p><p></p><p>This "Four-in-One" beast is wheezing as if it's about to die any second. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention its flying speed, which is hardly any different from an electric scooter...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, little Hua is getting on in years now. When it was younger, it used to fly so fast."</p><p></p><p>"Never mind the details, let's get to the main issue."</p><p></p><p>"To put it simply, this morning, an unknown abyss energy erupted in the leveling area on the east side of Jiang City, and a time-limited trial instance dungeon has appeared, one that can only be entered by mage class characters."</p><p></p><p>"So I had the teachers from each class notify all the students who have successfully awakened as mages, which of course includes you."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

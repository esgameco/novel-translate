        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yi saw this skill, he felt that this skill was undoubtedly the cool and stylish type.</p><p></p><p>Just like the countless animations he had seen in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>The swordsman who pursued speed as his lifelong pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Drawing the sword and charging, before the enemy could react, he had already slashed dozens of times!</p><p></p><p>Then sheathing the sword.</p><p></p><p>The enemies behind him slowly fell.</p><p></p><p>It was truly badass.</p><p></p><p>But why would this kind of skill appear in the mage's skill set?</p><p></p><p>As a mage, using this skill, I also need to wield a melee weapon.</p><p></p><p>Although the staff is also considered a melee weapon, </p><p>let me tell you, making me use the staff to frantically hit the opponent hundreds of times would feel very awkward!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was walking and looking at his new skill at the same time, and he just happened to arrive at the city center of Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>Here were located the most critical functional departments of the entire Jiangcheng city.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi saw the most magnificent building with the largest flow of people, with the five big characters "Daxia Trading Hall" written on it.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Daxia Bank, the Daxia Trading Hall was also a state-owned functional department supported by the Daxia government in the background.</p><p></p><p>The trading chain covered the entire Daxia.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiangcheng was only a level 5 base city, and the connection between its branch and the headquarters was not completely non-existent, but almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>The circulation of goods and prices were basically controlled by Jiangcheng itself.</p><p></p><p>Entering the door of the trading hall, passing through the bustling crowd, Lin Yi came to a self-service trading window.</p><p></p><p>Since the Calamity Era, the development of spiritual crystal technology in various countries on the Blue Star has become quite mature.</p><p></p><p>The self-service trading windows in the trading hall are the culmination of this.</p><p></p><p>Each self-service window had no one, only the blue spiritual crystals floating in the air, just like the one Lin Yi participated in during the job change ceremony.</p><p></p><p>This was Lin Yi's first time coming here.</p><p></p><p>He looked at how others were operating and quickly understood how to use the thing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual crystal, as long as you touch it, a full-system screen will pop up.</p><p></p><p>Then you can operate on the screen.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's selling or buying, the small teleportation array on the trading counter can instantly deliver your goods.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found it very novel.</p><p></p><p>Online ordering, lightning-fast delivery, on-the-spot arrival, it's really amazing!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi placed all the junk black iron equipment that had dropped from the Forest Tiger King and its tiger cubs and grandchildren under the spiritual crystal for scanning.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual crystal quickly gave an estimate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's previous calculation was not bad, these equipment in the trading hall were just the national benchmark recycling price, not worth much money.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, after a Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath, there were still more than a dozen pieces of equipment.</p><p></p><p>After selling the dozen or so black iron equipment, Lin Yi's card had an additional more than 10,000 Daxia coins.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Lin Yi also sold the materials that had dropped from the monsters he had leveled up before in his personal space.</p><p></p><p>The most valuable ones were one or two special materials dropped by the Tiger King.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual crystal gave an estimate of two or three thousand.</p><p></p><p>The rest were basically just small change.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lin Yi cleared his backpack, and the balance in his card rose from a few dozen to more than 20,000 again.</p><p></p><p>This money was not enough to buy another 24-hour afk skill point reward.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi planned to see if he could find any good items in the trading hall.</p><p></p><p>He searched for mage skill books.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, there were none.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi thought for a moment and quickly understood.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, the drop rate of skill books in low-level areas was really too low, too low, and Jiangcheng was a super remote small city, with not much total goods.</p><p></p><p>This also proved that Lin Yi's killing of the Tiger King yesterday and dropping a skill book was really incredibly lucky.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, even if the goods were available, many people were also unwilling to come to the trading hall in this remote small city to trade.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's easy to sell this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>Just like how Lin Yi obtained the Wind Spirit Essence, which he eventually sold to a specialized shop that deals with the recycling and resale of such items. Other professionals, even if they obtain skill books that they can't use themselves, would certainly want to sell them for a good price.</p><p></p><p>I really want to buy a professional skill book.</p><p></p><p>I'll have to go to the skill book specialty store under the Profession Guild.</p><p></p><p>The Priest's skills are not there.</p><p></p><p>Then, are there any general skill books?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi tapped on the crystal screen, activating the filtering mode.</p><p></p><p>He removed the filter for the Mage profession.</p><p></p><p>He pressed the search button again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a row of skill books appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>[Basic Identification Technique]</p><p>[Price: 18,992 Da Xia Coins/Book]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi scrolled down a bit.</p><p></p><p>He found that the general skill books only had this one type.</p><p></p><p>And behind these skill books, there was information about the manufacturers.</p><p></p><p>It seems these general skills are not dropped by monsters.</p><p></p><p>Rather, they are produced by other enchantment and scroll-related professions.</p><p></p><p>But even the most basic [Basic Identification Technique] skill book costs nearly 20,000 coins, which is exorbitantly expensive! Then how much would the Priest's skill books cost? Lin Yi felt a toothache coming on.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after selling the Wind Spirit Essence today, he felt like he had become a rich guy.</p><p></p><p>But it turns out he was just thinking too much.</p><p></p><p>However, even if it's expensive, he has to buy it.</p><p></p><p>If the Wind Spirit Essence hadn't been glowing with a jade-green light in the darkness, he might have missed such a treasure.</p><p></p><p>With the Identification Technique, he at least won't fail to recognize valuable items.</p><p></p><p>Especially this Basic Identification Technique, in his hands, it won't remain basic for long.</p><p></p><p>He still has hundreds of thousands of skill points to pour into it, ensuring it has no childhood.</p><p></p><p>He'll immediately advance it to the highest level! Lin Yi gritted his teeth and bought the Identification Technique skill book.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his phone in his pocket vibrated, and Lin Yi didn't even need to look.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was the Da Xia Bank notifying him that he was poor again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the teleportation array at the bottom of the crystal screen lit up, and after about ten seconds, a plain, gray scroll appeared in the center of the array.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi picked up the scroll.</p><p></p><p>He checked the attributes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it was the Identification Technique skill book.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately chose to learn it.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Skill Book: Basic Identification Technique used successfully, you have obtained the new skill: Identification Technique (Basic)!]</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yi naturally didn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>He spent tens of thousands of skill points.</p><p></p><p>After a series of "dings",</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi received an unprecedented notification! [Ding! You consumed 120,000 skill points, your Identification Technique (Grandmaster) has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Identification Technique (Pinnacle)!]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations! You are the first person on the entire Blue Star to upgrade Identification Technique to the Pinnacle level, you have received a unique reward!]</p><p></p><p>[Your Identification Technique (Pinnacle) has evolved into a new skill: All-Knowing Eye!]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Whoa?</p><p></p><p>Is this even possible?</p><p></p><p>Am I really the first person on the entire Blue Star to upgrade Identification Technique to this level? In the millennium since the Calamity Era, not a single person has claimed this unique reward??</p><p></p><p>The so-called unique reward, Lin Yi had read about it in his textbooks.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it's similar to the achievement system in games.</p><p></p><p>Once someone completes an unprecedented feat, the Heavenly Dao will trigger a unique reward!

        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qi, what's going on here?" asked the burly man in red armor, Chen Feng, turning to the elder in green robes beside him.</p><p></p><p>The elder's gaze was deep and solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Seventh-tier..."</p><p></p><p>"Wind magic, Raging Waves Thousand Peaks Break...!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, no, based on the current concentration of wind elements, the caster must have released more than one seventh-tier spell!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang, the vice president of the Tianhei City Professionals Alliance, was a true seventh-tier expert. </p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yi, he was also a mage.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, outsiders see the spectacle, while insiders see the tricks.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Guoguang entered the Silent Land, he noticed the intense magical residue in the area. </p><p></p><p>He even directly deduced that someone had consecutively cast three seventh-tier wind spells here!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm...? No!"</p><p></p><p>"There are also traces of fire elemental magic!"</p><p></p><p>"It's... Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Qi Guoguang's eyes widened slightly.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the fluctuations of another elemental power.</p><p></p><p>And the power level...</p><p></p><p>Was also seventh-tier!! Which meant that before those three seventh-tier wind spells, there had also been a seventh-tier fire spell unleashed here!</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang's eyes shone with a faint green glow.</p><p></p><p>He took out a magic staff from his spatial storage, the tip of which was inlaid with a precious magic power crystal.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he waved his staff.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse."</p><p></p><p>A single word escaped his lips.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the raging winds enveloping the Silent Land came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>The thick clouds in the sky gradually dissipated, allowing the sunlight to pour down.</p><p></p><p>Even the burly Chen Feng was left in awe.</p><p></p><p>This ability to casually dispel a storm was truly impressive.</p><p></p><p>Damn, the mage was just so cool!</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Feng was much younger than Qi Guoguang, he still envied this kind of godlike power to command the elements.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the skills of a warrior class like himself were simply crude and straightforward...</p><p></p><p>This was why most people would call warriors "battle studs," while mages were known as "mage lords."</p><p></p><p>Dispersing the storm was not a difficult feat for Qi Guoguang, as he was a master of wind magic.</p><p></p><p>His skills and understanding of the principles of magic were far deeper than Lin Yi's, who only knew how to cast high-tier spells without truly grasping the underlying mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>As the clouds cleared and the storm subsided, the sight on the ground left Chen Feng sucking in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the Silent Land had been violently scoured by the fierce winds, exposing deep, chaotic furrows and gullies, as if carved by incredibly sharp blades.</p><p></p><p>However, the widespread and disorderly pattern of these marks made it impossible for them to have been caused by a swordsman's strikes.</p><p></p><p>These were the deep imprints left by raging wind blades.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was a vast, blackened area spanning over ten kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers long.</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng could hardly imagine what had transpired here before.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qi, there seem to be other people down there!" </p><p></p><p>With his keen eyesight as a sixth-tier professional, Chen Feng had spotted numerous figures lying scattered across the ground, their faint blue magical auras flickering.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Qi Guoguang's figure vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng was left stunned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng looked down and saw the figure of the professional appear among the group on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Wizard's universal skill: Blink.</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng was speechless again.</p><p></p><p>The wizard's invisible self-aggrandizing skill was really too useful! He was so envious! He could only activate the inner battle qi and hurry down.</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng landed next to a professional, stretched out a finger, and checked their breathing.</p><p></p><p>With a surprised expression, he said, "This person is still alive!"</p><p></p><p>"How did they survive...?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng was somewhat amazed at the tenacity of this professional's life force.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Guoguang's previous analysis:</p><p></p><p>Three seventh-tier wind magic spells.</p><p>One seventh-tier fire magic spell.</p><p>Even the entire training area had become this way.</p><p>Yet this person was still alive, which was really absurd.</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang's face showed a shocked expression, and he slowly spoke, "Not only this one is alive, but all the people lying here are alive, just unconscious."</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Ah? They're all alive?</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Qi Lao, with four seventh-tier magic spells coming down, how did they survive!?"</p><p></p><p>In Qi Guoguang's eyes, there was also a deep sense of curiosity and amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Extremely terrifying magic control power."</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng heard this.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang continued to explain, "If I release a seventh-tier wind magic spell now, I can also guarantee that these professionals will not die, or even be injured."</p><p></p><p>"But the person who came here before and dealt with the undead knight, their attainments in fire magic are on par with mine, and their control is no less than wind magic."</p><p></p><p>"He, is at least a seventh-tier holy magic master who cultivates both fire and wind."</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he was searching his brain for someone in the Great Xia who was a fire-wind dual cultivator and had reached the seventh tier or above. Such a person was undoubtedly rare in the entire Great Xia! However, he did not match any suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, is his social network not broad enough? Maybe he should go back to the Temple of the Gods and ask a few executives.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this person is one of the executives of the Temple of the Gods...</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang was actually a bit envious.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a revered wind system holy magic master.</p><p></p><p>But in his life, he could only pursue the ultimate in wind magic.</p><p></p><p>He admired and envied those who could dual cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, dual cultivation requires much more effort than specializing in one system!</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Silently felt the lingering magical power of Lin Yi's four castings.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he peeled away the layers and extracted the magical imprint.</p><p></p><p>The so-called magical imprint is like a person's autograph.</p><p></p><p>Every time a mage casts a spell, they will have their own unique characteristics and details.</p><p></p><p>These details and characteristics combined form a person's magical imprint.</p><p></p><p>By comparing the magical imprint, it is easier to locate the mage himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang recorded this special magical imprint in his heart, then opened his eyes and said:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Cyan first and tell them about the situation here."</p><p></p><p>"It will also be a good way for you to clear your name."</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he was the one who was called upon in an emergency today.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Guoguang had a close relationship with his father, who was not very confident in him going alone, so he asked this seventh-tier holy magic master to assist.</p><p></p><p>They did not bother with these professionals anymore. Since they were not dead, they should all wake up soon.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath would naturally be handled by Cyan City itself.</p><p></p><p>They were only here to deal with the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Now that the crisis had been mysteriously resolved by someone else, they only needed to go through the motions and show that they had indeed come.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that, he looked at Lin Yi with some suspicion.</p><p></p><p>His expression was like saying, "Come on, brother, why are you still trying to probe me? Should I sell it or not?" But Lin Yi didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dafu sighed for a long time before saying, "Brother, don't joke with me. If I sell this thing, I'll really have to go to jail."</p><p></p><p>"That's not the case at all!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was somewhat puzzled. But he inferred a bit from Zhang Dafu's words. It seemed that breaking through the magic crystal was just like obtaining gold-level or higher equipment, which was strictly controlled by the state.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had no shame in admitting that he came to inquire about information on breaking through the magic crystal, as he had no understanding of what it was or how to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Dafu pondered for a moment. It was obvious that he was considering whether this kind of information could also be considered a chargeable commodity. </p><p></p><p>But considering that Lin Yi had just sold him those items, which he could resell for a good profit, he said generously, "Brother, this is actually not a secret, so I'll tell you for free."</p><p></p><p>"The only way to obtain the magic crystal breakthrough is from the magic crystal mines owned by our Great Xia country. The refining and processing technologies are all under the control of the government."</p><p></p><p>"It is strictly forbidden for individuals or organizations to mine, process, or sell it privately."</p><p></p><p>"This thing has a very wide range of uses, playing a key role in enhancing the skills of all professionals and unlocking branch skill trees."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to obtain it through official channels, you need to join the Professionals' Union or have a background in an official large guild, and use your merit points or guild contributions to exchange for it."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, brother, since you are still quite young and have just changed professions, there is another more convenient way for you to obtain the magic crystal breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Some well-known professional schools in our Great Xia also have corresponding magic crystal breakthrough resources. If you get admitted, you should have a way to obtain it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I also heard that our province will reward students who perform outstandingly in the national college entrance examination, and the rewards may include magic crystal breakthroughs."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi now fully understood. </p><p></p><p>All the resources that have a huge impact on the combat power of professionals in Great Xia have basically been allocated through official channels.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to obtain them, one can only do so through the designated official channels.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi thanked Zhang Dafu and left the Treasure Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he still had a Burst Arrow skill book for archers and 100 tradable skill points in his spatial storage, but he did not plan to sell them all at once. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he wanted to sell them in batches to avoid drawing too much attention.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had earned another huge sum of money, Lin Yi naturally planned to spend it on purchasing afk skill point rewards.</p><p></p><p>However, this time Lin Yi did not go home, but prepared to go to the school.</p><p></p><p>Since he had awakened his profession, there were no more classes at school. </p><p></p><p>The class teacher had left a note for him earlier, saying that he had something to discuss with Lin Yi, so Lin Yi planned to go and see what it was about.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Zhang Dafu had mentioned that those who achieved outstanding results in the national college entrance examination could receive official rewards such as magic crystal breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was obviously tempted by this. </p><p></p><p>Since this kind of resource is crucial for his continued growth, the professional college entrance examination and finding a powerful professional college that he had not paid much attention to before, now needed to be put on his agenda.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yi walked towards Jiangcheng Second Middle School, he activated the new function of his talent [Gift of the Gods].</p><p></p><p>[Do you want to spend 50,000 Great Xia coins to purchase a 24-hour skill point reward?]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi unhesitatingly chose "Yes". </p><p></p><p>However, this time he did not blindly confirm it as recklessly as last time. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he started calculating how much money he had left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After consecutively purchasing skill points six times,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi stopped continuing to purchase.</p><p></p><p>At this point, to obtain the 24-hour AFK skill point reward, it would now cost a full 100,000 Daxia coins.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yi saved over 100,000 Daxia coins, keeping this money in reserve in case he wanted to buy something in the future.</p><p></p><p>He could even use it to supplement the household expenses.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, if he wanted to make some more money, he could choose to sell the skill books and skill points.</p><p></p><p>The six purchases allowed Lin Yi to obtain over 500,000 skill points.</p><p></p><p>Adding in what he had saved previously,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi now had over 800,000 skill points.</p><p></p><p>Opening the skill interface,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi selected the ice system skill he had just obtained, and began allocating points.</p><p></p><p>The goal was still to reach Tier 7.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found that Tier 7 spells were sufficient to handle most of the situations he currently encountered.</p><p></p><p>He directly allocated points to max out Tier 7, and if there were any excess skill points, he would choose one skill to upgrade to Tier 8!</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 500 skill points, your Ice Arrow has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Ice Surge!]</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 2,000 skill points, your Ice Surge has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Frost Binding!]</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 5,000 skill points, your Frost Binding has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Blizzard!]</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 10,000 skill points, your Blizzard has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Frigid Zone!]</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 50,000 skill points, your Frigid Zone has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Bone-Chilling Cold!]</p><p></p><p>[Consumed 100,000 skill points, your Bone-Chilling Cold has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Soul Freeze!]</p><p></p><p>With the seven ice system spells in hand, Lin Yi began to review each of these skills one by one.</p><p></p><p>If the fire system was a path of brute force output, and the wind system was a style of rapid attacks and multi-hit combos,</p><p></p><p>Then the characteristic of the ice system skills was extremely clear - control!</p><p></p><p>Absolute control! Ice Arrow inflicts a 30% slow effect on the target, which persists.</p><p></p><p>The Tier 3 spell Frost Binding can select a target and lock their feet in ice, trapping them in place for 5 seconds.</p><p></p><p>The Tier 5 Frigid Zone skill doesn't even have damage.</p><p></p><p>But it can lower the temperature in a large area to dozens of degrees below zero, inflicting a 60% severe slow effect on all targets in the affected range.</p><p></p><p>And this effect will continuously stack, stacking up to three layers, immediately transforming into a binding effect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Tier 6 and Tier 7 ice system skills,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi discovered a pattern.</p><p></p><p>It seems that for all mage specializations, at Tier 6 they will introduce some unique gimmick.</p><p></p><p>Fire system has summoned minions, wind system has hypersonic slash attacks.</p><p></p><p>The ice system's Tier 6 spell is actually a passive skill! [Bone-Chilling Cold]</p><p></p><p>[Type: Passive Skill]</p><p>[Tier: Tier 6]</p><p>[System: Ice]</p><p>[Cost: None]</p><p>[Casting Time: None]</p><p>[Cooldown: None]</p><p>[Effect: All targets afflicted by your slow, binding, or freezing effects become fragile, taking 20% increased damage, and their evasion is further reduced based on the limiting effect you've applied.]</p><p>[Slow Effect: Reduces target's evasion by 30%.]</p><p>[Binding Effect: Reduces target's evasion by 60%.]</p><p>[Freeze Effect: Reduces target's evasion by 100%, and when you use a fire system skill to break their freeze, you deal an additional 20% of their maximum HP as ice damage!]</p><p>[Note: The maximum HP reduction effect will be diminished against high-level, high-rank monsters, capped at 1% reduction at most!]</p><p>[Remark: Bone-chilling cold, piercing to the marrow.]</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【You have killed 2 LV.10 Forest Brown Bears and gained 280 experience points (80 points bonus for killing higher-level monsters)】</p><p></p><p>【Due to the effect of your beginner's experience boost scroll, you have gained an additional 10% experience (135 points)!】</p><p></p><p>【You have obtained 8 Giant Python Scales!】</p><p></p><p>【You have obtained 8 Giant Python Fangs!】</p><p></p><p>【You have obtained 2 Bear Paws!】</p><p></p><p>【You have leveled up to LV.2! Gained 10 free attribute points!】</p><p></p><p>After another wave of system prompts, Lin Yi was enveloped in a white light as he leveled up!</p><p></p><p>Killing these high-level monsters provided a large experience bonus, and the experience boost scroll that Jiang Ya, the little rich girl, had given him earlier provided an additional 10% experience.</p><p></p><p>This round of monster hunting directly allowed him to reach level 2.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi allocated all 10 of his free attribute points into the Spiritual attribute.</p><p></p><p>His mana limit increased by another 700 points.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi looked at his mere 20 HP and still felt a lack of safety.</p><p></p><p>That's right, although his offensive power and alertness were maxed out, there was still the possibility of him capsizing in this high-level grinding area.</p><p></p><p>Especially if there were any stealthy monsters that could ambush him.</p><p></p><p>With only 20 HP, he was too fragile.</p><p></p><p>Although the underlying mechanics of this world were similar to a game, reality was not a game, and there were no second chances.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi had already prepared a countermeasure for this situation.</p><p></p><p>With the additional 700 mana, he was now able to implement his previous plan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi began chanting.</p><p></p><p>Under the 70% casting speed boost from "Divine Blessing Chant", his spell was completed in less than two seconds.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yi finished casting, a massive hexagram magic array appeared on the ground in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The magical runes within the array constantly shifted, causing the entire earth to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Scorching lava erupted from the cracks in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, a towering elemental creature, standing five or six meters tall and composed entirely of molten, scorching lava, appeared.</p><p></p><p>This was a level 6 fire magic spell, Molten Lava Demon! It was a summoning spell that called forth a Molten Lava Demon from the Elemental Plane of Fire. This summoned creature possessed numerous skills and was a powerful, high-HP tank, completely obedient to Lin Yi's commands.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could order it to move, attack, or do as he pleased - it was incredibly docile.</p><p></p><p>Watching his mana plummet from over 5,000 to zero, Lin Yi felt somewhat strained. That sensation of having his mana drained was not a pleasant one.</p><p></p><p>But when Lin Yi saw the Molten Lava Demon's attributes and skills, he felt it was all worth it.</p><p></p><p>【Molten Lava Demon】</p><p>【Level: LV.100】</p><p>【Type: Elemental Creature】</p><p>【HP: 500,000/500,000】</p><p>【Mana: 250,000/250,000】</p><p>【Strength: 800】</p><p>【Agility: 500】</p><p>【Spirit: 800】</p><p>【Vitality: 1,000】</p><p>【Skills: Lava Blast, Quaking Strike, Scorched Earth, Lava Shield, Self-Destruct】</p><p></p><p>A level 100 summoned creature! With a massive 500,000 HP, it was undoubtedly a terrifying force that could easily overwhelm any other monsters in the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>Defeating thousands of them would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yi was most interested in was the Molten Lava Demon's Lava Shield skill, which he could also benefit from.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Magma Demon summoned a molten lava shield to protect itself.</p><p></p><p>As the Magma Demon's massive elemental dual arms swung, a layer of scorching hot lava shield enveloped Lin Yi's body.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Lin Yi had an exceptionally high affinity for the fire element.</p><p></p><p>The unbearable high temperature of the lava only gave him a warm, cozy feeling.</p><p></p><p>[Lava Shield: A searing shield covering the body, can absorb 15,000 points of damage. When you are attacked, inflict 500 points of fire damage to the attacker.]</p><p></p><p>Fifteen thousand shield points. </p><p></p><p>And a counterattack effect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>With this shield that could last for an hour, and the terrifyingly huge Magma Demon by his side, he was filled with a strong sense of security! Under the 7% mana regeneration effect, his just-depleted mana pool quickly refilled.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi chanted again, summoning a second Magma Demon.</p><p></p><p>Then a third one.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the three majestic, imposing Magma Demons before him, Lin Yi was highly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously summoning three was currently Lin Yi's limit, but as he leveled up and his affinity for the fire element increased, he would be able to summon even more.</p><p></p><p>But for now, having three Magma Demons summoned at once was already an incredibly formidable combat force.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Lin Yi made a decision.</p><p></p><p>He gave orders to two of the Magma Demons.</p><p></p><p>He commanded those two Magma Demons to roam and patrol the entire Wailing Forest, slaying any monsters they encountered.</p><p></p><p>The experience and rewards from the monsters they killed would naturally accrue to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially two fully automated leveling "plugins", constantly helping him find and kill monsters.</p><p></p><p>This was far more efficient than Lin Yi leveling up on his own.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Magma Demon, he would keep by his side as a bodyguard.</p><p></p><p>Receiving Lin Yi's orders, the two Magma Demons quickly flew off to other areas of the Wailing Forest.</p><p></p><p>As elemental beings, they had no legs, only an upper body.</p><p></p><p>Their mode of movement was more like floating and gliding through the air.</p><p></p><p>Despite their bulky appearance, their speed was not slow, at least several times faster than Lin Yi could run.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was the Magma Demons' "Scorched Earth" skill - a range-type area-of-effect ability that constantly expanded molten lava and intense heat around them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could clearly see that wherever the Magma Demons went, the ground was left scorched, and the trees in the Wailing Forest began to burn furiously, leaving no vegetation.</p><p></p><p>Any monsters that entered the Magma Demons' Scorched Earth zone were almost instantly reduced to charcoal, without even a chance to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi continued deeper into the Wailing Forest, accompanied by the remaining Magma Demon.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Lin Yi's mind was constantly bombarded with notifications.</p><p></p><p>They were all about how many monsters had been killed, and how much experience he had gained.</p><p></p><p>After just a few steps,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's body was suddenly enveloped in a series of white flashes.</p><p></p><p>[You have reached Level 3! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish allocating those 10 new attribute points,</p><p></p><p>There were another five or six white flashes around him.</p><p></p><p>[You have reached Level 4! Gained 10 free attribute points!] </p><p>[You have reached Level 5! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p>[You have reached Level 6! Gained 10 free attribute points!] </p><p>[You have reached Level 7! Gained 10 free attribute points!]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>What the hell did those two Magma Demons do? </p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly gain such a massive amount of experience to instantly level up 7 times? </p><p></p><p>Leveling up in this world doesn't seem too difficult after all...

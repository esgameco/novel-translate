        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's job change was plain and unimpressive, without any distinctive features.</p><p></p><p>The only change was that the fixed attribute point increase upon leveling up went from 1 point to 2 points.</p><p></p><p>As well as the effect of increasing his mental attribute points on magic damage and mana recovery, which became stronger than a single job change.</p><p></p><p>Although he had long known that the second job change would grant him a new active skill and a new passive skill, the two skills he unlocked were clearly quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The Fireball spell he obtained from his first job change, and the Ice Arrow spell from the second job change.</p><p></p><p>Fire and ice are the most common specializations in the entire Blue Star for the Mage class.</p><p></p><p>Because most people had already obtained the corresponding skills through their first and second job changes.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment where skills are so difficult to acquire, naturally most people have no choice but to choose to become a Fire Mage or an Ice Mage.</p><p></p><p>And after investing their skill points into those skills, it becomes even harder for them to switch to other elemental systems later on.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi did not disdain the Ice Arrow and Mana Shield skills.</p><p></p><p>Because any skill, as long as it is a skill, will become exceptionally valuable in his hands!</p><p></p><p>After the successful job change, Lin Yi opened his personal panel and allocated all the attribute points he had gained to his mental attribute.</p><p></p><p>7th-tier magic spells are all mana-intensive.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the subsequent 8th-tier spells, and even forbidden magic.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that his passive skill "Divine Chant" which accelerates casting time, will also reach 9th-tier after leveling up, allowing him to instantly cast forbidden spells.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yi did not want to become a clumsy mage without mana to cast spells after the free casting effect of "Mana Storm" disappears.</p><p></p><p>After the allocation was complete, Lin Yi's panel had undergone a near-qualitative change compared to two days ago.</p><p></p><p>[Lin Yi]</p><p>[Profession: Intermediate Mage (2nd Job Change)]</p><p>[Specialization: Fire (Primary), Storm (Primary), Ice (Secondary)]</p><p>[Level: LV.39 (4.30%)]</p><p>[HP: 410/410]</p><p>[MP: 39620/39620]</p><p>[Strength: 41]</p><p>[Agility: 41]</p><p>[Mentality: 566]</p><p>[Constitution: 41]</p><p>[Endurance: 41]</p><p>[Talent: Blessing of the Gods (SSS)]</p><p>[Unallocated Attribute Points: 0]</p><p>[Unallocated Skill Points: 312685]</p><p>[Universal Skill: All-Knowing Eye]</p><p>[Profession Passive Skills: Mana Storm (Passive), Divine Chant (Passive), Mana Shield (Passive)]</p><p>[Profession Active Skills: Fire System (1~7 Tier Spells), Storm System (1~7 Tier Spells), Ice System (1 Tier Spell)]</p><p></p><p>After completing the job change, Lin Yi leveled up 9 more times, including the massive experience gained from the Undead Death Knight and the experience from quickly defeating a large number of undead soldiers.</p><p></p><p>After the level cap was removed, these experiences were not lost.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's total mana pool, which previously could only barely reach three to four thousand points even after consuming alchemy potions, had now skyrocketed to nearly forty thousand points.</p><p></p><p>Now, even without relying on the free casting effect of "Mana Storm", Lin Yi could cast three to four 7th-tier spells using his own mana.</p><p></p><p>As for the two new profession skills he had just obtained, Lin Yi looked at his remaining skill points and found that he was just short of being able to max them both out to 7th-tier.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi was in no rush. This harvest was much more bountiful than what he had obtained in the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>After all, the level of the Undead Death Knight was there, and the items it dropped would certainly fetch a good price.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lin Yi walked out of the job change sanctuary and returned home.</p><p></p><p>It was now noon.</p><p></p><p>On the table were three or four of Lin Yi's favorite dishes, along with a note left by his mother:</p><p></p><p>"Just put the cold dishes in the microwave to reheat them."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your homeroom teacher came to look for you this morning, saying there was an urgent matter regarding your future. You should go ask what's going on."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's father, Lin Guodong, worked in the mine. It couldn't be said that he got up early and worked late, but for the next shift down the mine, he would basically have to work seven or eight hours.</p><p></p><p>Going up and down the mine was too troublesome, and frequent coming and going would end up wasting a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>As for his mother Xu Qingfang's occupation, she was a teacher. Of course, she wasn't a professional, just teaching regular cultural courses.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had long been accustomed to his parents not coming home for lunch, and they could only gather together in the evening.</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill, Lin Yi returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>He took out everything that had fallen from the Lich Knight Riven Dale's personal space.</p><p></p><p>First, there were more than a dozen pieces of equipment.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these pieces of equipment were not usable by mages.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the grades, among which there were eight or nine pieces of silver-grade, three pieces of gold-grade, and the last piece was platinum-grade.</p><p></p><p>It just happened to be the black greatsword that Riven Dale had been holding before.</p><p></p><p>[Necromantic Rune Greatsword]</p><p>[Type: Weapon (Two-Handed)]</p><p>[Grade: Platinum]</p><p>[Equip Level: LV.60]</p><p>[Equippable Classes: Warrior, Knight System Subclasses]</p><p>[Weight: 29.3kg]</p><p>[Physical Attack Power +845]</p><p>[Strength +97]</p><p>[Stamina +88]</p><p>[Durability: 100/100]</p><p>[Special Effect: Plague Corruption]</p><p>[When hitting the target, there is a 10% chance of infecting the target with the plague, causing 200 points of dark attribute damage per second, lasting 30 seconds. This effect can stack up to 5 layers.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had never seen other Level 60 equipment and weapons, so naturally he didn't know whether the attributes of this two-handed greatsword were good or not.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that weapons with special effects were usually not low in value.</p><p></p><p>However, this was precisely the most troublesome point for Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Because including the other three gold-grade equipment, he had no way to dispose of them right now.</p><p></p><p>In this blue star world after his transmigration, the Great Summer's control over the equipment of all professionals could be said to be extremely strict.</p><p></p><p>Equipment of silver-grade and above is strictly prohibited from flowing into the civilian professional market by the Great Summer government. If discovered, the source will be traced to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>This is actually the same logic as the Great Summer's ban on guns in the previous Earth.</p><p></p><p>Equipment is the easiest external means for ordinary people, or those with ulterior motives, to enhance their own strength.</p><p></p><p>A person with a very low level and not high skill point allocation can cause great destruction if given a set of excellent equipment.</p><p></p><p>So, except for the upper echelons of the government and the military professionals stationed in the base cities, other professionals merely possessing equipment of silver-grade and above have already violated the regulations.</p><p></p><p>If discovered, they will be severely punished without exception.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this does not mean that professionals who have obtained these high-grade equipment have to let them rot in their hands.</p><p></p><p>The government has opened up a special recycling channel. The good equipment you've obtained, the Great Summer government will buy back at a high price. A really high price, the kind that will satisfy you.</p><p></p><p>So, most professionals have no complaints.</p><p></p><p>However, the reason Lin Yi cannot dispose of these equipment is that, with his current level and paper strength, he cannot explain to the government how he obtained these equipment.</p><p></p><p>If he says he farmed them himself, then he would have to explain even more.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi is very afraid of trouble.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yi plans to first store these equipment in his personal space, and wait until his strength is strong enough on paper later on. </p><p></p><p>At that time, when he disposes of these things, the government personnel won't bother to scrutinize them anymore.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi put back the three gold-grade equipment and the platinum-grade Necromantic Greatsword into his space, and then took out two skill scrolls.</p><p></p><p>These were the most precious treasures!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two skill books appeared before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>The first was a skill book that glowed with faint blue light.</p><p></p><p>【Skill Book: Explosive Arrow】</p><p>【Type: Skill Book (Tome)】</p><p>【Class: Archer】</p><p>【Learnable Level: LV.30】</p><p>【Tier: Tier 2】</p><p>【Effect: Upon use, there is a 70% chance you will learn the skill: Explosive Arrow.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>A bow skill book, and not a cheap one at that!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was a Tier 2 skill book.</p><p></p><p>Its value was likely several times higher than the Wind Blade skill book he had obtained from killing the Tiger King previously. But Lin Yi had just learned that.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, in addition to entry-level skill books, there were also skill books that could directly teach higher-tier skills, but with a chance of failure.</p><p></p><p>It was not a guaranteed success.</p><p></p><p>He finally seemed to understand the difficulties faced by ordinary practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Imagine someone saving up for years to buy a high-tier skill book, only to fail in learning it. That would be truly maddening.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yi would never have such worries.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to find and purchase entry-level skill books.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then turned his gaze to another skill book with a black, gloomy cover.</p><p></p><p>The detailed information soon appeared, instantly exciting him.</p><p></p><p>【Skill Book: Summon: Skeleton Soldier】</p><p>【Type: Skill Book (Tome)】</p><p>【Classes: Death Knight, Summoner, Dark Priest (requires Breakthrough Crystal), Mage (requires Breakthrough Crystal)】</p><p>【Learnable Level: LV.5】</p><p>【Tier: Tier 1】</p><p>【Effect: Upon use, you will learn the skill: Summon: Skeleton Soldier.】</p><p></p><p>Damn, his luck was exploding this time!</p><p></p><p>A necromancy skill book! And the learnable classes include Mage!</p><p></p><p>Necromancy skills are considered extremely rare among all mage specializations, second only to Gravity.</p><p></p><p>Necromancy spells have the distinct advantages of summoning minions and soul attacks.</p><p></p><p>Spells that can directly attack the enemy's soul can sometimes produce extremely exaggerated effects, easily overcoming stronger opponents.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi chose to use the skill book.</p><p></p><p>However, a cold prompt sounded.</p><p></p><p>【Learning Failed! Your class is not the orthodox class system for this skill. To learn it, you need to consume additional materials: Breakthrough Crystal!】</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Can't learn it! What the hell is this Breakthrough Crystal?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi racked his brain but couldn't find any relevant information in his memory.</p><p></p><p>But he had learned the concepts of orthodox class systems and branch class systems before.</p><p></p><p>Basically, after the Bluestar Cataclysm, the various classes were not completely separate parallel lines, but occasionally had connections with each other.</p><p></p><p>For example, with the Mage class skills:</p><p></p><p>The 6th-tier Inferno Demon is a skill that both Fire Mages and Summoners can learn. </p><p></p><p>For Fire Mages, this skill is one they can obtain after advancement. They are the orthodox class system for this skill.</p><p></p><p>But for Summoners, they need the corresponding skill book to learn it. They are the branch class system for this skill.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the 6th-tier Wind Flash skill can also be learned by other classes like Swordsmen, Assassins, Warriors, and Ninjas.</p><p></p><p>It seems that to unlock the skills of a branch class system, one not only needs to consume the skill book, but also this material called Breakthrough Crystal.</p><p></p><p>Well, no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Even if he learned the Necromancy skill now, he still doesn't have enough skill points to level it up high.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still has the Ice system skills and the vital Mana Shield passive skill waiting to be upgraded.</p><p></p><p>He needs to focus on leveling those up first.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out a black card from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>As well as a name card.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Zhang Dafu of the Treasure Hall City Center Branch, contact: XXX..."</p><p></p><p>Hmm, he should...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After half an hour.</p><p></p><p>In the VIP reception room of Jiangcheng Treasure Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat, please have a seat!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Brother Lin, your esteemed presence graces my humble shop!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you've had any recent adventures, and if you have anything you'd like to sell?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi sat on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dafu served Lin Yi a cup of fine hot tea, his face beaming like a chrysanthemum.</p><p></p><p>Plump and powdered, this was Lin Yi's first impression of Zhang Dafu.</p><p></p><p>He was the quintessential businessman.</p><p></p><p>Everything was viewed through the lens of profit.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this was a kind of purity in itself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not dislike Zhang Dafu.</p><p></p><p>And he immediately demonstrated his sincerity.</p><p></p><p>From his personal space, he took out four or five rare materials dropped by the BOSS Death Knight Riven.</p><p></p><p>These materials had all been carefully selected by Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>They were completely random drops from the wild, untraceable to any specific monster.</p><p></p><p>This way, it would not arouse suspicion, nor could his past be traced back.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yi placed these rare materials one by one on the table, he could see Zhang Dafu's plump face slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that these items were very rare! And Lin Yi had done his homework, having a basic understanding of the market price for these materials.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, let me call you brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you selling all of these...?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Zhang Dafu produced a silver abacus from somewhere, his fat fingers moving the beads with incredible speed and dexterity, clicking and clacking.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had expected to wait a while.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, in less than five seconds, there was a result.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I can offer you 450,000 Daxia coins to buy all of these materials!"</p><p></p><p>"And I must tell you, I can give you a detailed list with the unit price for each item - you won't be losing out at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, 450,000 is not an auspicious number, let me round it up to 450,000!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this offer, Lin Yi inwardly nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>His previous research on the trading market had shown the total value of these materials to be 390,000.</p><p></p><p>Coming to Zhang Dafu, he had gained an extra 60,000.</p><p></p><p>This was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Also, boss, do you buy equipment?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dafu's face twitched again.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes, looking at Lin Yi with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you mean...?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yi knew what he meant.</p><p></p><p>And judging by his expression, he was probably testing Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if Lin Yi really said he had silver-grade or higher equipment to sell, he might actually take the deal.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi was not foolish enough to take that risk.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, they're all silver-grade equipment. I'm too lazy to go to the trading market, so I'm just seeing if you'll buy them. If not, I'll find another place."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dafu quickly answered decisively, "We buy everything! As for your silver-grade equipment, if the level is not high, my offer may not be much above the market price, and some may even be at par value. After all, the official control on these items is strict, and the buyback prices are also high!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yi took out the six silver-grade equipment pieces he had previously selected from BOSS drops.</p><p></p><p>Although these equipment were only silver-grade, their levels were generally between 40 and 60, so Lin Yi recorded another 100,000 in his accounts.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhang Dafu thought the day's transaction was about to end,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi suddenly threw out another bombshell.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, do you sell breakthrough magic crystals?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

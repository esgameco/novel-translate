        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems that as one's experience or strength increases, more functions can be unlocked.</p><p></p><p>It appears that becoming wealthy can also be considered a form of increase in strength? In any case, this new function has really caught Lin Yi's eye! After experiencing the exhilaration of instantly leveling up by using high-level skills, Lin Yi actually found it quite difficult to wait for the next skill point allocation.</p><p></p><p>Now, this function is like a timely rain in a drought! </p><p></p><p>Buying skill points with money is essentially buying time!</p><p></p><p>As we all know, your time is extremely valuable!</p><p></p><p>Spending money, how satisfying!</p><p></p><p>It seems that from now on, I also need to put making money on my agenda.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not hesitate and planned to spend all the money, leaving only a small amount.</p><p></p><p>After all, this money was earned by chance, and as my strength continues to increase in the future, earning tens of thousands more should become even easier.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi opened the talent interface and selected the option to purchase the afk reward!</p><p></p><p>【Do you want to consume 10,000 Daxia coins to purchase the 24-hour skill point reward?】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi unhesitatingly selected "Yes"!</p><p></p><p>【Ding! You have obtained the talent: The Gods' Gift of 24-hour AFK Reward: 86,400 skill points!】</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the phone in Lin Yi's pocket also vibrated.</p><p></p><p>It notified him that 10,000 Daxia coins had been deducted from his card.</p><p></p><p>Continuing!</p><p></p><p>【Ding! You have obtained the talent: The Gods' Gift of 24-hour AFK Reward: 86,400 skill points!】</p><p>【Ding! You have obtained the talent: The Gods' Gift of 24-hour AFK Reward: 86,400 skill points!】</p><p>【Ding! You have obtained the talent: The Gods' Gift of 24-hour AFK Reward: 86,400 skill points!】</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi didn't know how many times he clicked.</p><p></p><p>He only stopped when the prompt indicated insufficient balance.</p><p></p><p>Just like many garbage idle games, the cost of purchasing the AFK reward option will continuously increase.</p><p></p><p>The first time was 10,000 Daxia coins.</p><p>The second time it was 15,000.</p><p>The subsequent increases were even more drastic.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi checked the record and made the final purchase.</p><p>He even directly spent more than 40,000 Daxia coins! Ouch...</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yi didn't feel any pain.</p><p>He felt that being able to accelerate his skill advancement process was worth it.</p><p></p><p>But when he actually saw his six-digit bank balance quickly turn into three digits,</p><p>he still felt a deep sense of pain.</p><p></p><p>It's back, it's all back, that familiar life of being a poor bastard.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could only turn to check his personal panel.</p><p>Fortunately, the skill point balance column gave him great comfort!</p><p></p><p>【Current available skill points: 425,821!】</p><p></p><p>He had another 400,000 points in reserve!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi opened his skill page again.</p><p>Upgrading the seventh-tier Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath to the eighth tier requires 500,000 skill points, which is clearly not enough now.</p><p>And Lin Yi currently feels that the seventh-tier Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath is already sufficient, so these skill points should be invested in the blade skills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi opened the wind system skill Wind Blade that he had just learned yesterday.</p><p>In the skill allocation interface, he began the familiar operation again.</p><p>Click, click, click, click, click! Then the "ding ding ding ding ding" prompts echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【Consumed 500 skill points, your Wind Blade skill has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Rending Wind Slash!】</p><p>【Consumed 2,000 skill points, your Rending Wind Slash has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Nine Blades of Gale!】</p><p>【Consumed 5,000 skill points, your Nine Blades of Gale has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Tempest Vortex!】</p><p>【Consumed 10,000 skill points, your Tempest Vortex has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Wings of the Swift Wind!】</p><p>【Consumed 50,000 skill points, your Wings of the Swift Wind has been upgraded, you have obtained the new spell: Flashing Gale!】</p><p>【Ding!...】</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It cost 10,000 skill points, and your Swiftwind Flash has been upgraded. You have obtained a new spell: Shocking Tidal Tempest!"</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, Lin Yi's wind-elemental skill set has expanded from 1 to 7 skills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly reviewed these skills, and he felt that the characteristics of wind magic were quite distinct.</p><p></p><p>If fire magic is simply about high damage, then wind magic combines speed, multi-hit attacks, light control, and some supportive abilities. The most obvious ones are speed and multi-hit attacks.</p><p></p><p>The 3rd-tier fire spell is called Triple Flame Spear, which summons three flame-forged spears from the sky to pierce and burn the enemy. The damage has 3 stages, which is already considered high among the fire spells Lin Yi has mastered.</p><p></p><p>But the 7th-tier spell Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath only has the initial high-damage dragon's breath and the subsequent persistent burn damage.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the 3rd-tier wind spell Gale Nine-Slash fires 9 extremely fast wind blades in 0.5 seconds. And the 7th-tier Shocking Tidal Tempest can inflict over a thousand strikes per second on targets within the area of effect.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Lin Yi the most were the two new 5th and 6th-tier skills:</p><p></p><p>[Gale Wings]</p><p>- Active Skill</p><p>- 5th Tier</p><p>- Wind Element</p><p>- Costs 500 MP/sec</p><p>- 1.5 sec cast time</p><p>- 5 min cooldown</p><p>- Gathers wind elemental power to cloak your true form, making it hard for others to see you.</p><p>- Forms a pair of wind wings, granting you high-speed flight.</p><p>- Also creates a wind barrier around you that can block 3 ranged attacks (up to 4th-tier strength).</p><p>- Note: "Gathering the gale, I take to the skies!"</p><p></p><p>Flight ability! This has been Lin Yi's long-cherished dream as a human - to fly freely in the sky. He never expected wind magic to have such a spell that allows mages to fly without relying on mounts.</p><p></p><p>As for the 6th-tier skill [Swiftwind Flash]:</p><p></p><p>[Swiftwind Flash]</p><p>- Active Skill </p><p>- 6th Tier</p><p>- Wind Element</p><p>- Costs 15,000 MP</p><p>- Instant cast</p><p>- 1 hour cooldown</p><p>- Requires a melee weapon</p><p>- Infuses your speed and your melee weapon's attack speed to the extreme, then unleashes a lightning-fast charge in one direction.</p><p>- Grants 100% dodge chance during the charge.</p><p>- After the charge, deals 99 strikes of your melee weapon damage plus 1 wind-elemental slash on all targets in the charge path.</p><p>- Max charge distance: 10 meters</p><p>- Max charge speed: 10 times the speed of sound</p><p>- Note: "Watch closely, this strike will be magnificent!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

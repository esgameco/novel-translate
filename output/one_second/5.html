        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi rested briefly, ate some dry rations, and drank a few sips of water before continuing on his journey.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he did not let his guard down and took out a bottle of alchemical potion from his spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>This potion was glowing with a faint blue light and looked quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi gulped down the alchemical potion.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the taste was terrible.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what strange herbs were used to concoct it.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of cilantro flavor...</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi didn't pay much attention to it, he was more concerned about the 1-hour buff he had just gained.</p><p></p><p>[Intermediate Mental Potion: Increases your mental attributes by 30 points, and increases your mana capacity by 300 points.]</p><p></p><p>Under the boost of the [Mana Storm] passive skill, the 30 points in mental attributes were equivalent to a 2,100 point increase in mana capacity, and the direct mana capacity increase also provided an additional 2,100 points.</p><p></p><p>With this buff, Lin Yi's mana pool had surged from a measly 100 points to 4,300 points! With a 70% mana cost reduction, Lin Yi calculated that he could cast hundreds of 3rd-tier spells non-stop.</p><p></p><p>As for 4th and 5th-tier spells, he could use them sparingly but still cast them at a high frequency.</p><p></p><p>This was why Lin Yi dared to challenge the level 10 Howling Forest with his fragile level 1 body!</p><p></p><p>As he entered the forest, a chilling aura immediately enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>The forest's vegetation was extremely lush, and even with the sun shining brightly overhead, only a few scattered spots of sunlight could reach the forest floor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were hardly any other leveling players around him.</p><p></p><p>The transfer ceremony schedules of the various schools in Jiangcheng were not very fixed, and there could be a delay of two to three days.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had been AFK at home for three days, so he wasn't too far behind the main group.</p><p></p><p>Venturing deeper, Lin Yi heard a series of howling, shrieking sounds, like those of fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>In reality, these were not the cries of any living creature, but rather the sound of the fierce winds constantly blowing out of a cave deep within the forest.</p><p></p><p>As the winds passed through the trees, they created this eerie, howling sound.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin of the forest's name - the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>"Sss sss sss..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yi heard a rustling sound above him. He became alert.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, he saw a giant python, as thick as a barrel, staring at him with two eyes the size of goose eggs.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the giant python hissed and opened its gaping maw, lunging towards Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was about to activate a skill to instantly slay it.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to do so, the dark forest was suddenly illuminated by an orange-red glow!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt a familiar scorching wave from behind him, and the next moment, a fireball slammed into the giant python's head!</p><p></p><p>The python, hurt by the attack, immediately shifted its hatred and its massive serpentine body sprang from the tree trunk, pouncing towards the source of the attack.</p><p></p><p>However, halfway there, an even larger fireball, the size of a washbasin, came hurtling towards it!</p><p></p><p>Boom! This massive fireball struck the python's body, causing it to erupt in a shower of sparks.</p><p></p><p>Dealt this heavy blow, the charred black python's body twitched once, and then it lay motionless, dead.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Lin Yi finally saw the source of those two fireballs.</p><p></p><p>It was a young student around the same age as him, accompanied by a middle-aged mage in a gray robe.</p><p></p><p>The young man was now looking at Lin Yi with a playful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu, how was my performance just now?" the young man eagerly asked for praise.</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed middle-aged mage nodded. "Young master, your fireball was very accurate. With more practice, you'll soon be able to easily handle the challenges of the Howling Forest on your own."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>S≈çng practiced and leveled up.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Lin Yi found that although the levels of the two people in front of him were much higher than his own, he was able to clearly see the essence of their strength.</p><p></p><p>It might be because they both emanated faint magical power fluctuations and fire elemental auras. That young man's power was countless times weaker than Lin Yi's.</p><p></p><p>And that middle-aged gray-robed mage was only slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Both of them were fire mages.</p><p></p><p>The second-tier Flame Explosion Spell that was just used was cast by the middle-aged mage.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yi's view, without the help of this gray-robed middle-aged mage, the young man would inevitably suffer some hardship in the mouth of the giant python before barely winning.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely would not be able to walk arrogantly through this Wailing Forest, as the middle-aged mage had said, relying only on a fire ball spell at around the third tier.</p><p></p><p>Earning the praise of his elders at home.</p><p></p><p>The young man became even more smug.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Lin Yi and said, "I just saved your life, aren't you going to thank me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi frowned slightly and said something that surprised both the young man and the middle-aged mage.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you steal my monster?"</p><p></p><p>The young man clearly hadn't expected Lin Yi to say such a thing. Not only did he not thank him, but he even said that he had stolen his monster? Did that mean he could have single-handedly dealt with that level 9 giant python?</p><p></p><p>Because of the level difference, the level 7 him could see at a glance that Lin Yi's level was only 1.</p><p></p><p>This kind of newbie in this forest would die without even knowing how.</p><p></p><p>How dare he be so arrogant!</p><p></p><p>However, before he could speak, the gray-robed mage next to him spoke up, "Little brother, I see your level is not high, this training area is very dangerous, you should leave as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>With that, he led the young man away.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi watched the two of them leave and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Although he was very unhappy about having his monster stolen, seeing that these two might have just acted because they thought his level was low, he let it go.</p><p></p><p>But it won't happen again.</p><p></p><p>This little incident was soon forgotten by Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Because as he continued to delve deeper into the Wailing Forest, he no longer encountered any other practitioners.</p><p></p><p>And the monsters were becoming more and more dense.</p><p></p><p>"Sss sss sss..."</p><p></p><p>This time, seven or eight giant pythons with shimmering golden scales climbed down from the treetops.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could approach Lin Yi, Lin Yi raised his hand, and in an instant, dozens of fire balls the size of washbasins traced scorching trajectories and slammed into the giant pythons.</p><p></p><p>Flame Explosion Spell! If the gray-robed middle-aged mage from earlier had seen this scene, he would surely have stared with wide eyes, too shocked to speak!</p><p></p><p>Using the same second-tier skill, Lin Yi's performance was impeccable.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to chant, didn't need to prepare. And it was extremely accurate, with the fire elements permeating the heavens and earth obeying his every thought, turning into ready-made spells to swiftly slay these high-level monsters.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was now a human-shaped automatic spell machine gun!</p><p></p><p>Bored with the second-tier Flame Explosion Spell, Lin Yi started using third-tier spells.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!" Two gray bears burst out of the dense forest behind Lin Yi, roaring and charging towards him.</p><p></p><p>Bears, though they look bulky, are actually not that slow when they run.</p><p></p><p>However, this sudden attack by the two forest brown bears was cut short by three flaming spears that suddenly fell from the sky. Boom! Boom! The three flaming spears pierced the heads of the two brown bears, instantly killing them.</p><p></p><p>The two bears met their demise, the whole family now complete!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

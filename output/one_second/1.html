        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Parallel World, Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>On the playground of Jiangcheng Second High School, there was a bustling crowd at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day when the third-year students of Second High awakened their professions.</p><p></p><p>It was also the nationwide rally for professional college entrance examination!</p><p></p><p>Countless students wearing the school uniform of Second High were seated in rows by class, with numerous media and journalists standing behind them, holding cameras to record this important moment.</p><p></p><p>"Class 8, third-year students! All troops, attention!"</p><p></p><p>"Stand up!"</p><p></p><p>"Repeat after me—"</p><p></p><p>At the front of the formation, a spirited young man suddenly stood up, grabbed the microphone, and shouted with all his might.</p><p></p><p>"From this day on, I will become a member of the Great Xia professionals!"</p><p></p><p>"I will study hard and train courageously!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I will do my part in the revival of humanity... Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he had exerted too much effort, as the series of oaths ended with him starting to retch.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap, clap!</p><p></p><p>The school leaders on stage took the lead in applauding.</p><p></p><p>Countless media and journalists also gave their applause and praise!</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of spirit they wanted to see!</p><p></p><p>In the formation of Class 8, third-year.</p><p></p><p>A handsome-looking young man could barely hold back his laughter.</p><p></p><p>His name was Lin Yi, and he had crossed over to this world eighteen years ago.</p><p></p><p>This was a world that had been invaded and fused with countless games, with the map of the entire world expanded tenfold compared to the Earth Lin Yi had come from.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the humans in this world were not the true apex predators of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>In the vast unknown regions, there lurked countless terrifying monsters and beasts, constantly threatening the civilization of humanity.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, everyone was like they had been injected with chicken blood, always thinking about improving themselves.</p><p></p><p>Except for preparing for battle, it was all about preparing for battle.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, humanity had been blessed by the Dao of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>After turning 18 and becoming an adult, everyone had a chance to awaken a skill.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining a combat-type skill meant a smooth transition into a frontline profession.</p><p></p><p>They would then become the vanguard of humanity in the fight against monsters and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Their status and position would be much higher than those who awakened support or lifestyle-oriented skills.</p><p></p><p>"You can still laugh, I'm so nervous I'm about to die!" </p><p></p><p>A tall, burly young man next to Lin Yi nudged him in the back, dripping with sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so nervous? It's just awakening a profession," Lin Yi said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The tall guy's name was Zhang Shan, Lin Yi's good friend. Perhaps the expectations from his parents were too high.</p><p></p><p>Despite his imposing physique, he was far from as calm and collected as Lin Yi at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"You've been the top student in the entire grade for the past three years, of course you're not nervous!" </p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I just want to be a warrior, to inherit my dad's legacy. He has a full set of equipment and skill books, and even saved up 5 skill point scrolls for me to use!"</p><p></p><p>"Time to cash in, old man!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found it amusing. What a filial son.</p><p></p><p>As the rally ceremony ended, the profession awakening ceremony of Jiangcheng Second High School officially began.</p><p></p><p>The process was very simple - when a name was called, the person would go up on stage and touch the huge, floating azure mana crystal in the center, and they would obtain their first skill. At the same time, they would awaken the corresponding profession traits.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Kuan, obtained the skill: Fishing, lifestyle profession Fisherman!"</p><p></p><p>"Cai Kun, obtained the skill: Singing, lifestyle profession Idol!"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Cheng-liang, obtained the skill: Forging, lifestyle profession Blacksmith!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As one person after another went up to awaken their professions, the teachers announcing the results on stage spoke the cold, technical skills and professions. Many in the audience, like Zhang Shan, were getting nervous.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the teachers of Jiangcheng Second High were also quite dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>They were whispering to each other, wondering how this batch of students could have such poor aptitude.</p><p></p><p>More than ten minutes had passed, and not a single student had awakened a combat-type skill!</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Ya, come up and awaken your profession!"</p><p></p><p>The teacher calling out names on stage summoned another name, and the entire Class 8, third-year immediately turned their attention to a cold-looking female student at the front of the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Go, Jiang Ya!" The students in the class cheered her on.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the very front of the class line, the class leader of Class 8, Hu Kai, who had just been shouting hoarsely and even cracking his voice, revealed a self-satisfied smile and encouraged Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that his attempt to flatter her was not successful, because at that moment, the latter did not even look at him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she raised her eyes and looked towards another young man at the back of the line.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt Jiang Ya's slightly provocative gaze, and felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Just because I've been steadily surpassing you these three years, do you really have to be so resentful? Even when awakening your profession, you still have to provoke me."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya, as the class belle of Class 8 and also the campus belle of Jiangcheng Second High School, this look of hers was quite a sight to behold.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, everyone's attention was once again focused on Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>After all, with one being the top student of the grade and the other being the second, the tension between them was palpable.</p><p></p><p>What professions these two would awaken was also a topic of endless discussion among countless people.</p><p></p><p>After giving Lin Yi a deep look, Jiang Ya strode up to the stage and reached out to touch the blue mana crystal.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the blue mana crystal trembled a few times and emitted a violent magical power fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a series of strange phenomena appeared across the entire training ground!</p><p></p><p>Countless grains of sand and stones began to defy gravity and gradually float up into the air, even revolving in a mysterious trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The old principal on the stage had his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the teacher in charge of the ceremony to speak, he immediately announced the awakening result.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Ya, awakened skill: Telekinesis! Combat profession: Psychic Mage!"</p><p></p><p>A commotion instantly erupted in the crowd!</p><p></p><p>The impatient reporters in the back were frantically snapping photos, recording this historic moment. Psychic Mage, a rare-tier profession! This profession could use psychic powers to manipulate objects to attack enemies, and could also completely shatter the mental defenses of enemies with terrifying psychic powers.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya, the cold-faced campus belle, also revealed a faint smile after confirming that she had obtained such a rare profession.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yi, come up and awaken your profession!"</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Ya's shocking awakening, all eyes were once again focused on Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>If the second-ranked student had obtained a rare profession, then the top student must have an legendary-tier profession, right? As for the even higher epic-tier professions, they didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The pressure was on Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shan, his buddy, couldn't stop his hands from trembling. But as a good friend about to face the most important challenge of his life, he still gave his blessings.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, Ayi, you can do it! Get an epic-tier profession!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi stepped up to the stage.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for him not to feel nervous.</p><p></p><p>In this environment, under the gaze and expectations of so many people, even Lin Yi, whose temperament had become calm and composed after two lifetimes, still felt a touch of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and touched the blue mana crystal.</p><p></p><p>A cold sensation swept over him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a faint magical power fluctuation emanated from the mana crystal.</p><p></p><p>The old principal on the side first raised his brows, somewhat expectantly.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment, this magical power fluctuation did not continue to intensify after its initial appearance.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he suppressed the disappointment in his heart and announced with some difficulty, "Lin Yi, awakened skill: Fireball, combat profession: Mage."</p><p></p><p>Mage.</p><p></p><p>The most ordinary Mage!</p><p></p><p>Although it was a combat profession, with Jiang Ya's dazzling awakening before him, and the countless accolades Lin Yi had accumulated previously, this result was undoubtedly a huge letdown for the majority.</p><p></p><p>The camera shutters kept clicking incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi stood on the stage, not because he was dissatisfied with the skill and profession he had awakened.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he heard another voice echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【Congratulations, you have awakened the SSS-tier talent: Gift of the Gods!】</p><p></p><p>【Effect: You gain 1 skill point per second.】</p><p></p><p>【Note: As your experience and strength increase, this talent will gradually unlock more functions, so please look forward to it!】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

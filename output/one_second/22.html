        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi found a hidden location and descended.</p><p></p><p>All the base cities in the Great Xia were prohibited airspace, unless special permission was granted.</p><p></p><p>He had been too hasty before, directly taking off in front of so many people.</p><p></p><p>Now he needed to enter the city and return to Jiangcheng through the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he did not want to invite more trouble.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yi landed, he saw two streaks of light, one red and one green, flying into the azure city at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "...Damn! Why do they dare to fly like that in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang seemed to sense something. He unconsciously glanced down.</p><p></p><p>The magical power in his eyes flowed, and he soon spotted the hidden Lin Yi under the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Why did this person give him an extremely familiar feeling... But he couldn't quite recall it at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Guoguang was slightly shocked. He remembered.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary-looking young man below, with the faint magical power fluctuations, was actually quite similar to the magical power imprint he had sensed at the scene of the previous incident in the Deathly Silence Land!</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang slowed down his flight speed. With a curious heart, he used an identification spell on the young man below.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yi's profession and level were displayed before him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang shook his head. It seems he overthought it.</p><p></p><p>A 30th-level profession that hasn't even advanced to the second job, although a mage, would definitely not be able to use a seventh-tier spell.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Guoguang didn't look at Lin Yi again and accelerated away.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Lin Yi and Qi Guoguang's strength was too great. This was a complete suppression in terms of level and attributes.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though Qi Guoguang had already used an identification spell on him, Lin Yi didn't notice it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Profession Association Meeting Hall of Qinglan City.</p><p></p><p>Thump! Thump! The sound of knees hitting the floor.</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng and Qi Guoguang saw a large group of Qinglan City's upper echelons kneeling before them, continuously expressing their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Hu, what are you all doing?" Chen Feng, who was the one actually dispatched to handle the crisis, quickly helped Chairman Hu Weizhen of the Qinglan Profession Association to his feet.</p><p></p><p>Hu Weizhen was the one who had scolded his deputy earlier and immediately ordered the evacuation of the citizens and the city-wide alert when the mutated Death Knight appeared.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how to thank you two enough. I can only represent the millions of citizens of Qinglan and kowtow to express our gratitude!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Hu Weizhen was about to continue kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, his heart was truly filled with gratitude at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The joy of surviving the calamity was also genuine.</p><p></p><p>Because this incident was resolved quickly, without any casualties or economic losses. And his handling and response were textbook-level.</p><p></p><p>If all went well, his performance would likely be commended when these two big shots returned to Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Hu, you all seem to have misunderstood something," Chen Feng said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, originally, Qi Lao and I were rushing here as fast as we could to support you."</p><p></p><p>"But by the time we arrived at the scene, it was already over."</p><p></p><p>"That mutated Death Knight world boss was killed by an unknown expert."</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang had been silent the whole time. But his status was higher than Chen Feng's, which was obvious to all the upper echelons of Qinglan present.</p><p></p><p>Qi Guoguang's silence now further confirmed that Chen Feng's words were the truth.</p><p></p><p>The reason Chen Feng explained the situation truthfully was that at his level, he no longer cared much about such trivial merits. Especially with Qi Guoguang, a true big shot, standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he forcibly claimed the credit for himself, although his father's face would prevent Qi Guoguang from exposing him, he would still owe the other a favor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At their level, human relationships were the most difficult debts to repay.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Hu Weizheng and the other high-level officials of Cyan City found that the CPU had been completely fried.</p><p></p><p>Huh? So it wasn't you who killed that BOSS? Then who did it? There's no way Cyan City could have such a powerful bigshot!</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi showed his student ID and entered Cyan City again.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the city, Lin Yi heard the loudspeaker broadcasting the notice of the alert being lifted.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless military personnel in battle armor were all smiles.</p><p></p><p>As for the pedestrians on the street, they were even more tearful and embracing each other.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the Cyan City, which had just been on the verge of a storm and facing a great disaster, had for some unknown reason, had the alert lifted instantly, and they no longer needed to be evacuated from the city.</p><p></p><p>Many professionals who had been in too much of a hurry and hadn't been able to see their wives, their children, now reunited with their families, felt a sense of being spared from disaster.</p><p></p><p>It was the greatest happiness of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What had happened?</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, how had the entire atmosphere of Cyan City changed from peaceful and tranquil to this?</p><p></p><p>But this did not affect his rush to the Cyan City teleportation hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out his phone, and this time he had learned to be smart, buying a first-class teleportation ticket.</p><p></p><p>The task was done, it was time to return to Jiangcheng to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Lin Yi wanted to complete the job transfer directly in Cyan City, but when he passed by the job transfer sanctuary, he found that it seemed to have been used as some kind of air raid shelter.</p><p></p><p>It was full of ordinary people and a large number of professionals.</p><p></p><p>It was noisy and chaotic, so the normal functions would need some time to recover.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi entered the luxurious first-class teleportation hall, and the teleportation array lit up with light.</p><p></p><p>Then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This teleportation experience was silky smooth.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery was still dazzling and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>But the intense and stimulating spinning sensation had been greatly reduced, which was why the other people teleporting with Lin Yi also did not have a strong reaction.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer the stench of vomit permeating the air like before...</p><p></p><p>In less than half a minute, Lin Yi felt his feet firmly on the ground again.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery changed.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to the familiar Jiangcheng teleportation hall.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the teleportation hall, Lin Yi rushed straight to the job transfer sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>"Haa~"</p><p></p><p>Li Yiyi yawned.</p><p></p><p>She took off the glasses on the bridge of her nose and rubbed her slightly sore eyes.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the clock on the wall of the hall.</p><p></p><p>It was already half past eleven in the morning.</p><p></p><p>There was only half an hour left before she could get off work.</p><p></p><p>Today, not only did she see a handsome guy and chat with him a bit, but she had also been slacking off for the whole morning - it was worth it!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Yiyi put on her glasses, but once again saw that handsome face appear in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to turn in the task," Lin Yi said straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Li Yiyi was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Damn! </p><p>Didn't I just see this handsome guy about an hour and a half ago?</p><p>How did he do it so fast?!</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Ah! Okay!"</p><p>"Please follow me!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Yiyi led Lin Yi into a room where the job transfer crystals were stored.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi approached the crystal, touching it with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a prompt appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! A job transfer task has been detected as completed, would you like to submit it?]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi chose to submit it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a magic circle lit up under his feet, and a flash of white light passed through.</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations, your job transfer is successful!]</p><p>[You have advanced to: Intermediate Mage (2nd Class)!]</p><p>[You have gained new skills: Ice Arrow, Mana Shield!]</p><p>[Your mental attribute value and attribute point allocation benefits have increased!]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

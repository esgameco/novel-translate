        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not immediately go to check the effect of this new skill.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he glanced over and saw how many skill points were required to upgrade the "Fire Elemental Incarnation" skill from 8th tier to the next tier.</p><p></p><p>【9th Tier Forbidden Incantation - Calamity of the Eight Realms】</p><p></p><p>【Advancement Requirement: 1 million skill points!】</p><p></p><p>Whew...! It directly doubled again! 1 million skill points, that's too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, without considering any cash shop accelerations, it would take nearly 12 days of grinding to obtain.</p><p></p><p>But 9th tier is already a forbidden incantation! The small goal he had set for himself earlier is actually very close now.</p><p></p><p>At most, he just has to wait it out for 12 days, and he'll be able to gather the 1 million skill points.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yi opened his skill menu.</p><p></p><p>He began to examine the new skill he had just obtained.</p><p></p><p>【Supreme Transcendence, Fire Elemental Incarnation】</p><p>【Type: Active Skill】</p><p>【Tier: 8th】</p><p>【Attribute: Fire】</p><p>【Consumption: None】</p><p>【Incantation Time: Instant】</p><p>【Cooldown: 3 days】</p><p>【Active Effect: Your understanding of the fire element has reached the pinnacle. You can choose to fuse with the fire elements of heaven and earth, entering a state of Fire Elemental Transcendence.】</p><p>【Fire Elemental Transcendence: You are immune to all physical damage, immune to all fire-attribute damage, and gain the ability to fly.】</p><p>【In this state, when you cast fire-attribute skills, your critical strike chance is increased by 100%, critical strike damage is increased by 100%, and you ignore 50% of the target's magic resistance.】</p><p>【In this state, all fire-attribute skills you cast become instant-cast and no longer consume mana.】</p><p>【The Transcendence state lasts for 3 minutes. During this time, you can freely manipulate the vast amounts of fire elements in the surrounding area, instantly raising the temperature to millions of degrees Celsius, triggering a terrifying explosion and inflicting massive fire damage.】</p><p>【Remark: I am the Raging Flames!】</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yi first saw the "Fire Elemental Incarnation" skill, </p><p>he had guessed that it was likely a state-type skill.</p><p>Similar to a superhero transformation, like a Kamen Rider.</p><p>Turns out his guess was pretty much spot on.</p><p></p><p>The description and effects of this 8th tier fire skill were practically a short essay.</p><p></p><p>After reading through it, Lin Yi couldn't help but exclaim inwardly that this skill was overpowered! It was an extremely rare composite skill.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, this skill also had damage capabilities.</p><p>In the Transcendence state, he could trigger a super explosion.</p><p>And the explosion's range and damage were likely even more exaggerated than the Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it also granted him a state.</p><p>This state could directly transform Lin Yi from a human flesh-and-blood body into a pure elemental life form.</p><p></p><p>In this state, all his fire-attribute spells would be guaranteed critical hits, increased in damage, instant-cast, and cost no mana! Bad news: this skill is a Frankenstein's monster.</p><p>Good news: It has stitched together everything that could be stitched!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately decided to try out this skill in the current instance.</p><p></p><p>Fire Elemental Incarnation, Supreme Transcendence required no incantation and consumed no mana.</p><p>Lin Yi just had to focus his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He saw blue flames ignite at his fingertips.</p><p>The human characteristics of his fingers, nails, bones, and flesh rapidly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The blue flames then spread, and in the blink of an eye, Lin Yi found that his hands were now burning with raging flames.</p><p></p><p>This transformation from flesh-and-blood to pure elemental fire was a very unique experience.</p><p>Not only was there no pain, but it also brought Lin Yi a great sense of novelty.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's rate of transcendence exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Almost in an instant, he felt his life form had already completed its metamorphosis.</p><p>He was no longer a carbon-based life, but had become an elemental life.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even, he had become the raging flames themselves! Linyi could still feel his hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>But they could extend infinitely, stretching at will.</p><p></p><p>And throughout his body, he no longer felt the constraints of gravity, Linyi was as light and agile as the air.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the place where Linyi originally stood began to disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that when the temperature reaches a certain degree,</p><p></p><p>All the material in the real world may skip the melting stage altogether.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they are directly vaporized and vanished! The countless shadow demons attracted by the Inferno Demon before, perhaps because they were too close to Linyi.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even let out a mournful howl.</p><p></p><p>They were instantly vaporized.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a vacuum zone of more than ten meters appeared around Linyi.</p><p></p><p>Linyi's facial features and other characteristics disappeared into the blue flames.</p><p></p><p>If someone witnessed this scene, they would probably shudder and tremble all over.</p><p></p><p>In his fire elemental state, Linyi's physique was still normal human size.</p><p></p><p>But the sense of oppression was already terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Just as Linyi completed the ultimate ascension,</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the entire Shilica City, all the shadow demons and dark creatures, became agitated.</p><p></p><p>Because the temperature suddenly soared!</p><p></p><p>Then, Linyi flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The flight ability granted by the fire elemental state, the flight speed was no less than the Wings of the Wind, even surpassing it.</p><p></p><p>Linyi flew high up and overlooked the entire Shilica City.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the scale and map size of this instance were much larger than he had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>The entire Shilica City was almost five or six times the size of the Jiangcheng Base City.</p><p></p><p>And with the help of the [All-Knowing Eye], Linyi discovered a detail that other professions might not be able to know.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, among the countless ruins and rubble in Shilica City, there were tiny light clusters.</p><p></p><p>Above these light clusters were the names and levels of the professionals.</p><p></p><p>If Linyi looked closely, he could get more information.</p><p></p><p>The larger the light cluster, the stronger the corresponding professional.</p><p></p><p>Linyi saw that there were two or three larger light clusters gathered together, and around them were dozens of smaller light clusters.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the corner of the south of Shilica City, there was another slightly larger light cluster, but it was no longer moving, and its aura seemed to be gradually weakening, as if it had suffered a serious injury.</p><p></p><p>Well, it turns out that this instance is a public instance! That is to say, all the professionals who entered the instance were actually distributed to various corners of the Shilica City, and the chance of encountering each other was very small.</p><p></p><p>But it's not impossible!...</p><p></p><p>Shilica City, the central city.</p><p></p><p>Here, there were fifty or sixty people, fighting in groups against the tide of shadow demon monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Our people are just four or five short of being all here, I just checked through the celestial communication, they should have been teleported to remote places and can't get here for now, they will find a shelter by themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Let's hurry to the Central Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, follow me, don't fall behind!"</p><p></p><p>Several teachers from the Tianshui Academy, whose strength has reached the third transformation, were killing monsters while instructing the other students.</p><p></p><p>"Phew! Phew! Phew!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you feel it's getting hotter?"</p><p></p><p>"I was just about to say, this place was freezing cold before, and now I'm sweating after just a few steps!"</p><p></p><p>"I can't go on, it's too hot, I can't walk anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Just a few seconds later.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt that the air they were breathing into their lungs was scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>Their skin was also being baked painfully, as if exposed to the blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>"My God... Look up at the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"What is that!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

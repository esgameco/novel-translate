        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian continued to explain, "This knowledge does not exist in your textbooks, so it's normal that you don't understand."</p><p></p><p>"But you should know, a thousand years ago, what was the fundamental cause of the anomaly on our Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded, "It was the invasion of the Abyss, the overlapping of dimensions."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian said, "Correct! The Abyss, the Abyss, this should be a term you often hear."</p><p></p><p>"You can understand the Abyss as a parallel world, a different dimension."</p><p></p><p>"That is the root source of all the disasters and crises on the Blue Star."</p><p></p><p>"There are endless and terrifying monsters there, and they even have their own civilizations, their own social systems, just like us!"</p><p></p><p>"But dangerous places are often where the most abundant opportunities and rewards are."</p><p></p><p>"Some of our Daxia's true powerhouses have become strong because they have been tempered in the Abyss, and obtained key skills, talents, and exclusive equipment, which are extremely rare rewards."</p><p></p><p>"The Abyss is a horrifying dimension that encompasses everything, it's like a universe constantly rotating and moving, inevitably there will be times when it is especially close to our Blue Star's dimension."</p><p></p><p>"At such times, when the two dimensions conflict with each other, a rift existing in both dimensions is likely to be born."</p><p></p><p>"These rifts are actually what you are familiar with as dungeons."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the old principal's lecture, Lin Yi was enlightened.</p><p></p><p>He had never thought about how those dungeons were actually born.</p><p></p><p>"This morning, a time-limited dungeon has newly appeared in the eastern suburbs of our Jiangcheng," Zuo Qian said.</p><p></p><p>"That dungeon is slightly tainted by the aura of the Abyss, causing the monsters inside to mutate."</p><p></p><p>"The spatial structure of such dungeons is very unstable, and they will disappear after a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"So we must enter it early and obtain the rewards!"</p><p></p><p>"And this dungeon that has appeared this time is special, it is a trial-type dungeon."</p><p></p><p>"And it is a single-class trial dungeon, only allowing mage class characters to enter!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi pondered for a moment and asked, "Principal, what are the benefits if I complete this trial?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian chuckled lightly, "You little rascal, you're indeed one who won't go hunting unless he sees the rabbit. But just like you, we all enter dungeons for the rewards, don't we?"</p><p></p><p>"The reward for completing this trial is a title."</p><p></p><p>"The title is called: 'Challenger of the Abyss'!"</p><p></p><p>"The title has no attributes, but you can understand it as a key, or as a qualification!"</p><p></p><p>"The qualification to enter the true Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi understood.</p><p></p><p>From the principal's introduction, the truly valuable equipment, rare skills, and rare talents all require entering the Abyss to obtain.</p><p></p><p>And those who cannot complete this class trial will not have the qualification to enter the Abyss!</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, it means they will never be able to become true powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was said to affect one's future prospects.</p><p></p><p>"Based on past patterns, each time such a class trial dungeon appears on our Blue Star, the challenge rules will be different, and they will be revealed to the challengers before entering. Once the challenge rules are met, the qualification to enter the Abyss can be obtained!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Jiangcheng is lucky this time, the challenge rules for this mage class trial are too simple, just to persist for 3 hours in the trial dungeon, without requiring you to kill a certain number of monsters or defeat a boss."</p><p></p><p>"So, student Lin Yi, seize this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Because after this, you may not have the chance to encounter such a professional trial again, and it may even be more difficult next time!"</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yi, the difficulty was not a big deal. At least with his current strength, he couldn't say he was crushing those at the same level, he could only say he was striking down from a higher dimension.</p><p></p><p>No matter how difficult this trial was, it wouldn't be too much of a challenge for him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps for Lin Yi, the real abyss would be the true challenge.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yi feared the most was missing out, not knowing when the next opportunity to participate in the trial would come.</p><p></p><p>During their conversation, even though the strange four-legged creature was flying leisurely, the two had already left the city of Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>"You performed well. When I was a teacher before, I also took a few students for high-speed flights, and they were all terrified."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "..."</p><p></p><p>He had a mouthful of retorts that he didn't know how to express.</p><p></p><p>You call this high-speed flight? Can I say that if I were to use my own skills to fly, I could be ten times faster than your turtle-speed mount?</p><p></p><p>The surroundings of Jiangcheng were almost entirely surrounded by lush and beautiful grasslands.</p><p></p><p>Even the eastern suburbs were the same.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the city, they flew eastward for a while, and soon Lin Yi saw a large crowd gathered in a certain area of the grassland.</p><p></p><p>"The news spread quickly. This wizard profession trial instance has just appeared, and people from several base cities around Jiangcheng have all received the news and rushed over."</p><p></p><p>"When I asked your class teacher to find you this morning, there weren't many people yet, and many of our school's wizard transfers had already formed teams and entered. They should be inside by now."</p><p></p><p>"No, it seems to have become a bit difficult now..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian looked at the dense crowd below, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also noticed the problem.</p><p></p><p>That was, the crowd was so dense that the entrance to the instance was no longer visible, and it was obvious that these people were queuing up!</p><p></p><p>What's going on, the instance requires queuing to enter? The strange four-legged creature landed, and Zuo Qian retracted his mount, relying on the connections he had accumulated over the years, he brought Lin Yi and showed his identity to all the Jiangcheng military professionals maintaining order on the scene.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the favoritism towards their own people, these soldiers turned a blind eye to Zuo Qian and Lin Yi's actions of constantly pushing forward, and did not stop them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zuo Qian and Lin Yi arrived at the central area surrounded by the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also saw a spatial rift emanating a gloomy and dark aura, constantly flickering.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was the entrance to the limited-time trial instance.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the entrance, there were many profession-robed professionals and formation masters, maintaining the stability of the instance entrance and trying to extend the opening time of this instance as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Jiang, it's me, Little Zuo!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian put on a humble and flattering expression, and immediately saw Chairman Jiang Xian of the Jiangcheng Profession Association in the middle of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian was now beaming with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Having so many members from other base cities' schools, scattered organizations, and guilds come to his Jiangcheng, made him feel proud.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was a group of people wearing the uniforms of a certain professional school, with powerful auras, basically all at the fourth transformation or above, discussing something with Jiang Xian.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yi's sake, Zuo Qian could only muster the courage to call out.</p><p></p><p>However, his attitude was extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>Having his conversation with the important guests interrupted, Jiang Xian was somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>But since this was a public venue, he couldn't really lash out.</p><p></p><p>He could only turn back to look.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian chuckled awkwardly, "Chairman Jiang, the thing is, our school still has a classmate who has successfully transferred to the wizard profession, but hasn't been able to participate in this trial yet. With so many people here, could you..."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yi, come, this is the Chairman of the Jiangcheng Profession Association, Jiang Xian, a powerful fourth transformation grand mage!"</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yi could speak, Jiang Xian exclaimed in surprise, "You're Lin Yi?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

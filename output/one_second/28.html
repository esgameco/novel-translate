        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian looked at Lin Yi with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen you before, but I've heard your name so much that my ears are almost calloused."</p><p></p><p>"My granddaughter has mentioned you quite a few times."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, just this morning, she asked me to wait for you and arrange this trial for you."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian's eyes lit up when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that Elder Jiang would actually know Lin Yi! This made things much easier.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>The old man in front of him also had the surname Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his words, it was not difficult to guess that Jiang Xian should be Jiang Ya's grandfather.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman Jiang, it's not very appropriate for you to openly give your acquaintances special treatment, is it?"</p><p></p><p>A somewhat cold voice came from behind Jiang Xian.</p><p></p><p>It was a young man dressed in a suit, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, with a somewhat chilly demeanor.</p><p></p><p>The other person standing beside him also chuckled lightly, "And to be frank, it's not that we look down on the educational level of your Jiangcheng, but rather that among the new students of this batch, there are probably only a few who can complete this trial. Instead of occupying the spots, they'll just be going to their deaths."</p><p></p><p>"It would be better to give way to the new students of our Tianshui Academy. We've come from far away, and we don't want to wait too long."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian heard this.</p><p></p><p>His expression also became unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>He had originally been very polite, adhering to the concept of "the guest is king" in welcoming this group that had come all the way from Tianshui.</p><p></p><p>It was just to let the new first-year mage profession students of their batch participate in this trial instance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He really disliked the way these people were arrogant and looking down on others.</p><p></p><p>It was true that this group from Tianshui Academy were almost all second-class or above, and a few even reached the third-class.</p><p></p><p>But they weren't that strong either.</p><p></p><p>What were they pretending for?</p><p></p><p>Just as the few were conversing,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a cry of alarm from the entrance of the instance.</p><p></p><p>Following the sound, Lin Yi saw Jiang Ya, looking somewhat pale, being supported by a nearby practitioner, walking in a dazed manner.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian's expression changed, and he hurriedly went forward.</p><p></p><p>Even based on past experience, this mage profession trial was not considered particularly difficult.</p><p></p><p>But there was still risk involved.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they had failed to complete the trial?</p><p></p><p>"Little Ya, you all...?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was clearly under great shock, her whole body trembling slightly, her complexion deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her grandfather, Jiang Ya's eyes turned red, and tears immediately streamed down, "Grandpa, Second Uncle, Second Uncle... Wuwu!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian's expression became completely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He also noticed that this time, only three people had returned with his granddaughter - and one person was missing! That was Jiang Ya's Second Uncle, Jiang Xian's second son!</p><p></p><p>"What happened, Little Ya, don't cry, calm down and tell Grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya couldn't stop trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>"In there... the monsters, there were too many!"</p><p></p><p>"We couldn't kill them all, and as long as we stayed in one place, more and more monsters would keep coming to attack us. There was almost nowhere to hide in the entire space."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, it was Second Uncle who gave us the last four instance escape scrolls, then drew the attention of those monsters, so that we could escape!"</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, he..."</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu wuwu!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xian and Zuo Qian, upon hearing this, both felt a chill run down their spines! After all, this trial instance was only open to mage profession practitioners.</p><p></p><p>If it was really as Jiang Ya described, with the monsters constantly searching for and attacking them,</p><p></p><p>Without tank professions to withstand the attacks, and without priest healers,</p><p></p><p>Even if the other four besides Jiang Ya were all second-class or even third-class, they still wouldn't be able to withstand such a high-pressure environment.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, their initial assessment that this was only a D-level difficulty trial instance was completely wrong!</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, it was at least an A-level difficulty!</p><p></p><p>"Help... !"</p><p></p><p>"There are injured people here, is there anyone who can heal them?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Profession, please help!" </p><p></p><p>"She's about to die, please save her!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, people were continuously being teleported out of the instance entrance.</p><p></p><p>Wails, cries, and pleas for help were echoing all around.</p><p></p><p>Countless injured people were covered in blood and flesh. Some had their abdomens ripped open by unknown creatures, while others had their legs bitten off completely.</p><p></p><p>The scene was extremely bloody.</p><p></p><p>These people should all be the first batch who entered the trial instance, just like Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the previously lively and crowded area in front of the instance entrance fell silent as if a chill had descended upon it. Although there were still people queuing, most had retreated far away, merely observing from a distance.</p><p></p><p>At least those who managed to escape still had a chance to be rescued.</p><p></p><p>As for those who couldn't make it out, one could only imagine their fate.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian and Jiang Xuan's expressions turned extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>They never expected the once thriving situation to suddenly become so perilous!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Didn't I tell you? You're just going to your deaths by going in there. Why don't you make way for us instead?"</p><p></p><p>"It would have been better if you had done that earlier, instead of making us wait so long."</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled young man from Tianshui Academy adjusted his glasses and crossed his arms, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had already anticipated the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the hundreds of new students from Tianshui Academy who had come to participate in the trial all wore delighted expressions.</p><p></p><p>Now, no one was queuing ahead of them.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, listen up. The task for this trial is to survive for 3 hours."</p><p></p><p>"The instance difficulty is at the A+ level, so you must proceed with utmost caution!"</p><p></p><p>"Take the electronic maps we've provided you and strictly follow the strategy guide!"</p><p></p><p>The teachers from Tianshui Academy began instructing their students on the important points to note.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the surrounding professionals were filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty is not D-level at all, but A+!"</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>"Electronic maps? They even have a strategy guide?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this a newly appeared time-limited instance?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. I've heard that many prestigious professional academies have mastered strategies for instances like this one that require 3 hours of survival, and they might have prepared the guides in advance."</p><p></p><p>Standing beside Lin Yi, Zuo Qian let out a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's our own incompetence."</p><p></p><p>"Not only did we misjudge the instance difficulty, but we also lack their so-called strategy guides."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Jiang Ya, Lin Yi."</p><p></p><p>The old principal suddenly seemed to have aged decades in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He was completely consumed by deep self-blame and guilt.</p><p></p><p>The most dreadful thing was the comparison.</p><p></p><p>Others were fully prepared, clearly demonstrating the difference between their professional academy and their small high school.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Zuo, you don't need to apologize for things beyond your control."</p><p></p><p>"Even without a strategy guide or electronic map, this trial shouldn't be too difficult, right? I want to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>If this trial was truly only at the D-level difficulty, Lin Yi actually found it rather uninteresting.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing so many people failing, he felt a spark of interest.</p><p></p><p>"But in the current situation, I doubt anyone would be willing to team up with you..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qian believed Lin Yi must have the capabilities, but he pointed out the awkward predicament.</p><p></p><p>In this every-man-for-himself environment, who would be willing to team up with him and enter the instance?</p><p></p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, before anyone could reactâ€”</p><p></p><p>They saw Lin Yi stride into the instance entrance, his figure disappearing from sight!</p>

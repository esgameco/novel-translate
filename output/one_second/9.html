        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>To take the profession of a Mage as an example.</p><p></p><p>The first stage, which is the current level that Lin Yi is at.</p><p></p><p>It can only be considered as a novice just starting on the path of magic.</p><p></p><p>This type of practitioner is generally called an Apprentice Mage or Junior Mage.</p><p></p><p>The second and third stages correspond to Intermediate and Advanced titles respectively.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the fourth stage, which corresponds to the level of powerful figures like Jiang Xuan, they are then referred to as Great Mages.</p><p></p><p>The fifth stage is Archmage, and the sixth stage is Grand Archmage.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the seventh stage, they are called Sage Archmages or Mage Saints.</p><p></p><p>In short, once a practitioner reaches the seventh stage, they can be addressed as a Saint.</p><p></p><p>As for higher levels beyond that, even Jiang Xuan does not understand or have knowledge of them. </p><p></p><p>That is a realm he cannot access.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dahai asked nervously, "Then, Elder Jiang... Are you saying that at this moment, within the territory of Jiangcheng, there is a Grand Archmage present?"</p><p></p><p>One of the requirements for job advancement is to have at least one skill reach the corresponding level.</p><p></p><p>So generally speaking, powerful practitioners who can use skills of a certain level will have their job advancement match that.</p><p></p><p>Cases of low-level practitioners possessing high-level skills are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>So seeing the Sixth-Tier Inferno Demon spell is enough to infer this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan nodded, "About decades ago, I had the honor of going to the Pantheon, the highest mage association in the Blue Star, to study."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my mentor was a Sixth-Stage Grand Archmage."</p><p></p><p>"It was then that I witnessed my teacher summon such a Demon of Flames from the Elemental Plane of Fire to this plane."</p><p></p><p>"Spells of such power require absolutely terrifying magical affinity and techniques, and it is a skill I have yearned to learn my entire life, though I'm afraid I may never have the chance..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of regret appeared on Jiang Xuan's face.</p><p></p><p>He secretly made up his mind that he should try to meet this senior predecessor.</p><p></p><p>If he could be fortunate enough to receive some guidance from this senior, that would be an immense honor!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I should lead the troops back to the camp first. This was all just a misunderstanding. I hope that senior can forgive and forget."</p><p></p><p>Wei Xing prepared to leave, while Wang Dahai stole a glance at Jiang Xuan.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see the legendary Grand Archmage.</p><p></p><p>But just as they all had their own plans, a terrifyingly vast magical power fluctuation came from the depths of the Mourning Forest!</p><p></p><p>As a mage, Jiang Xuan was naturally the most sensitive to such magical disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Almost the moment he sensed this magical wave, his expression changed drastically, and he broke out in a cold sweat! </p><p></p><p>For he had detected an aura of the Elemental Plane of Fire even more terrifying than the Inferno Demon.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan suddenly looked up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was already approaching nightfall, with the sun having just set behind the western mountains.</p><p></p><p>The sky was gradually darkening.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, the horizon was ablaze once more, rimmed with a brilliant golden glow!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire sky began to turn red!</p><p></p><p>The practitioners who had not yet retreated also noticed this unusual celestial phenomenon and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Look at the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the sun just set? Why is the sky turning red again?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so hot... Do you feel the temperature has risen a few degrees from before?"</p><p></p><p>"Look over there, what is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit... Is that... a dragon?!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the fiery horizon had coalesced into the form of a terrifying giant dragon with a wingspan of hundreds of meters! </p><p></p><p>The dragon was composed entirely of the purest elemental fire, appearing both majestic and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It emanated an overwhelming aura of power.</p><p></p><p>Just the sight of it made the practitioners below tremble in fear. As the dragon fully manifested, the entire...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The temperature in the Qingfeng Grassland and Haoliao Forest regions has risen another 7-8 degrees!</p><p></p><p>Everyone is so hot that their mouths and tongues are dry! "Run!"</p><p></p><p>"Notify everyone, evacuate immediately!!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, we'll all die!"</p><p></p><p>"This is... a 7th-tier spell!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan forcibly suppressed the shock in his heart, using the last bit of rationality to quickly notify the two people beside him. Wang Dahai, upon hearing this, felt a thunderous roar in his mind, instantly becoming a blank. Ah? A 7th-tier spell?! That means the senior in the Haoliao Forest right now...</p><p></p><p>Is not a great mage.</p><p></p><p>But a 7th-tier Fa Saint!!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!! </p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!!!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Xing reacted quickly, urgently calling for his subordinates to retreat.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>All the professionals practicing in the hundreds of kilometers around the Qingfeng Grassland also received another warning alert!</p><p></p><p>[Alert! Alert!]</p><p></p><p>[Alert in the Jiangcheng Base urban area!] </p><p></p><p>[A 7th-tier spell fluctuation has been detected in the suburbs of Jiangcheng Base, all professionals in the area must immediately take shelter and hide in the nearest underground air defense shelters!]</p><p></p><p>[Repeat! Repeat!]</p><p></p><p>[This alert level is Level 1! Please take shelter immediately!]</p><p></p><p>All the professionals in Jiangcheng were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Within a single day, or even less than half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Issuing a Level 2 and then a Level 1 alert in succession. What's going on? Is the world ending? In an instant, everyone became anxious and started evacuating. Jiang Ya looked at the burning horizon in the sky,</p><p></p><p>And that terrifying fire elemental dragon with wings spread wide enough to block out the sun.</p><p></p><p>Her young mind was greatly shocked!...</p><p></p><p>Time rewinds a bit.</p><p></p><p>One minute ago.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Haoliao Forest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was surrounded.</p><p></p><p>By hundreds of burly, powerful tigers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had already reached the deepest part of this leveling area. </p><p></p><p>He also saw the entrance of the rumored large cave constantly spewing out violent winds.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expect this to be the territory of a group of level 11 forest tigers.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifyingly huge roar suddenly came from the cave.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yi saw a tiger king, around 4-5 meters long, its body covered in flickering emerald stripes, exuding an awe-inspiring, mystical aura, step out from the cave!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Each of its steps was exceptionally heavy.</p><p></p><p>Judging by its weight, it must be calculated in tons! Lin Yi's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>It seems this should be the strongest monster in the entire Haoliao Forest! And this is definitely a boss!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he doesn't have the Identification skill, so he doesn't know the name of this boss yet.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi only felt a blur in front of his eyes, and the next moment, he saw the tiger king swinging its right paw.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, more than ten razor-sharp wind blades came striking at him at an extremely fast speed!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's Lava Shield dropped by over a thousand points! Wow, such powerful attacks! And this boss can even use wind blade spells!</p><p></p><p>Judging from the emerald tiger stripes on its body, it seems to have been transformed by living in this wind element-dense cave for a long time.</p><p></p><p>A trace of surprisingly human-like astonishment appeared in the tiger king's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was very wary of the huge monster beside the human.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't take this human seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>In its mind, a few wind blades should have been enough to tear this human apart! Lin Yi's mouth curved into a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, finally found one with some strength."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's use you to test my new spell!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

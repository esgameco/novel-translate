        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle! The plague of black water that binds the ankles of all professionals.</p><p></p><p>Under the scorching dragon's breath.</p><p></p><p>Light speed turns into wisps of black gas.</p><p></p><p>Scattered in the air, disappearing without a trace!</p><p></p><p>All people regain their freedom!</p><p></p><p>They also saw the same thing, a figure like a deity soaring high in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Yes, in their eyes, the one who can use such terrifying magic, instantly dispelling all plagues and gloom, has already become their savior god!</p><p></p><p>High in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Damn, this high-speed flight, rushing and chasing.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he made it in time! This Death Knight, fortunately, did not die.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yi saw the Death Knight Riven Dahl, he didn't think much.</p><p></p><p>He directly unleashed a flash of Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that the professional players surrounding the boss below would snatch the kill.</p><p></p><p>If he had to talk about his current highest damage skill, it would undoubtedly be the Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this skill is very straightforward, without any dragging attack windup.</p><p></p><p>It's just an ordinary dragon's breath slamming down.</p><p></p><p>Causing devastating strikes.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yi is not a homicidal maniac.</p><p></p><p>His current mastery of the fire element can even achieve the effect that the Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath will destroy all monsters, but not harm the professionals at all.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why that group of over a thousand professionals, who had fallen into despair, did not suffer a single injury under such a terrifying seventh-tier dragon's breath!</p><p></p><p>After the dragon's breath, Lin Yi narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Not dead?</p><p></p><p>Didn't even lose much blood? This boss has some tricks! Lin Yi was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought that a Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath might not be able to kill the Death Knight.</p><p></p><p>But at least it should have taken away half of his health, right? Now it seems that even if he fires a few more Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breaths, it might not work.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi stared at the Death Knight Riven Dahl.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the [All-Knowing Eye],</p><p></p><p>His information soon appeared before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>[Death Knight Riven Dahl (Mutated)]</p><p>[Level: LV.200]</p><p>[Tier: King Tier]</p><p>[Race: Undead]</p><p>[HP: 9,970,000/10,000,000]</p><p>[MP: 100,000/100,000]</p><p>[Strength: 15,800]</p><p>[Spirit: 8,000]</p><p>[Agility: 8,000]</p><p>[Endurance: 15,800]</p><p>[Active Skills: Undead Army, Plague Wave, Death Rift Slash, Grip of Death, Charge, Corpse Explosion]</p><p>[Passive Skills: Undead Will, Indestructible Body (Mutated)]</p><p>[Weakness: Holy Light Damage]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Level 200? Wasn't it said to be level 60?</p><p></p><p>How did the level suddenly increase so much?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yi also noticed the "Mutated" word on the information panel.</p><p></p><p>But he had never heard of this mechanism in his textbooks before.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, does it mean a strengthened version of the boss?</p><p></p><p>However, a Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath only caused 30,000 damage to him, which Lin Yi found a bit puzzling.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the [All-Knowing Eye], Lin Yi soon found the clue from the Death Knight's skills.</p><p></p><p>The problem lies in the passive skill [Indestructible Body (Mutated)].</p><p></p><p>[Indestructible Body (Mutated)]</p><p>[Type: Passive Skill]</p><p>[Tier: 7th Tier]</p><p>[Effect: The power of the Abyss has strengthened your physique, granting you extraordinary damage resistance!]</p><p>[All damage you receive, except for Holy Light damage, is reduced by 50%, and the maximum single-instance damage you can take is 9,999 points.]</p><p>[You recover 5,000 HP per second.]</p><p></p><p>This passive skill is a bit overpowered.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying part is the single-instance damage limit of less than 10,000 points.</p><p></p><p>No wonder a Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath couldn't do much to him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dragon's breath attack came crashing down, but it only caused a little bit of damage.</p><p></p><p>Even the high single-target damage from the dragon's breath attack only dealt 9999 points of damage, and the subsequent blood loss was just from the burning damage.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the devastating passive skill of the Death Knight Riven, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi suddenly felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he had just upgraded his wind magic yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have had a hard time dealing with this boss.</p><p></p><p>It seems that a balanced multi-elemental development path is more effective in boosting combat power than single-element optimization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi used to look down on wind magic a bit.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was...</p><p></p><p>It felt a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>Just compare the basic third-tier spells.</p><p></p><p>Even without his current attributes and equipment, the triple damage of the Triple Flame Spear already exceeds 10,000 points.</p><p></p><p>But the nine strikes of the Gale Nine Blades don't even reach 5,000 points in total.</p><p></p><p>Although it attacks quickly and repeatedly,</p><p></p><p>it just feels too weak.</p><p></p><p>But the situation is different now.</p><p></p><p>When facing a boss like the Death Knight Riven who can withstand high single-target damage, the multi-hit wind magic becomes invaluable!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few minutes ago, in the Cyan City.</p><p></p><p>At the Professional Association headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The lobby was still orderly and calm, with various professionals constantly coming to consult and handle matters.</p><p></p><p>But in the conference room, the top-level officials of the Cyan City Professional Association were all dripping with sweat.</p><p></p><p>"We can't handle it!"</p><p></p><p>"We absolutely can't handle it!"</p><p></p><p>"Based on the data comparison of the wild world bosses that have mutated in our Greater Summer region over the past century, their levels have generally increased by at least 3 times."</p><p></p><p>"That means the world boss in the Desolate Land right now is at least level 180!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been saying all along that once the only world boss around Cyan City mutates, it will be a ticking time bomb!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect it to happen so soon!"</p><p></p><p>All the attendees had ashen faces.</p><p></p><p>The screen in the conference room was currently displaying the fully mutated Death Knight.</p><p></p><p>No one had a crisis response plan ready.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the chairman of the Cyan City Professional Association, sitting in the main seat, made the final decision.</p><p></p><p>"I've already sent a request for aid to the headquarters of the Professional Association in Tianhai City. They've dispatched a sixth-tier professional, and he's on his way here!"</p><p></p><p>"But even for him, it will take two hours to get from Tianhai to our Cyan City."</p><p></p><p>"In these two hours, we need to complete the evacuation of the citizens and defend against the undead army summoned by the mutated Death Knight."</p><p></p><p>"If we can't handle it properly, this will be a major disaster for our Cyan City!"</p><p></p><p>The vice chairman, a bald man, was stunned when he heard the chairman's decision to evacuate the Cyan City citizens.</p><p></p><p>"But... Mr. Chairman!"</p><p></p><p>"Sending the alarm now may cause unrest among the citizens, and if anything else happens..."</p><p></p><p>The bald man didn't even finish speaking before being abruptly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"If the plague and corruption from the Desolate Land spreads to our Cyan City, it won't just be about your official hat, but whether you'll have to go work at a sewing machine for the rest of your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you truly that stupid, or just too eager to advance?"</p><p></p><p>The chairman's gaze was icy cold as he scolded the vice chairman mercilessly, publicly embarrassing him in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Issue a level-one alert, then notify the city defense forces to prepare for the evacuation of the citizens!"</p><p></p><p>"Go do it now!"</p><p></p><p>As the Cyan City leadership made the decision to evacuate, a chilling alarm sounded throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Countless professionals also received the regional broadcast, just like the previous incident in Jiangcheng when Lin Yi summoned the Inferno Demon.</p><p></p><p>They had no way to deal with such a high-level, powerful monster. They could only wait for the true powerhouses of the entire East River Province to arrive!</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

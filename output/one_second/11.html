            <p>[Wind Blade]</p><p></p><p>[Type: Active Skill]</p><p>[Rank: Elementary]</p><p>[Elemental Affiliation: Wind]</p><p>[Consumption: 30 Mana]</p><p>[Incantation Time: 1 second]</p><p>[Cooldown: None]</p><p>[Effect: Summons a wind blade to attack distant enemies.]</p><p></p><p>This skill is quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>It is the foundation of all wind-elemental skills for mages.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Fireball.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of Wind Blade over Fireball is that Wind Blade is invisible and flies at an extremely high speed.</p><p></p><p>The target finds it very difficult to evade.</p><p></p><p>And the incantation time is extremely short, only 1 second.</p><p></p><p>However, in comparison, the damage of Wind Blade is only about half of a single Fireball.</p><p></p><p>Each elemental school of magic has very distinct characteristics.</p><p></p><p>The wind school clearly follows the agile, fast, and decisive school of thought.</p><p></p><p>The fire school, on the other hand, is the epitome of explosive output.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in Lin Yi's hands, after just a few days, this Wind Blade skill will certainly become extremely powerful in output as well...</p><p></p><p>The 7th-tier Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath can already cause this scale of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Then how terrifying would 8th-tier spells, or even 9th-tier forbidden incantations, be? Just thinking about it fills Lin Yi with boundless energy!</p><p></p><p>He is now even more motivated to upgrade his Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath to a 9th-tier forbidden incantation as soon as possible! Lin Yi looked around and found that there were no longer any traces of monster activity in the area.</p><p></p><p>The sky had darkened, and the raging flames of the Dragon's Breath had gradually extinguished after burning all the trees.</p><p></p><p>A crescent moon hung high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lacking the shelter of the trees, the night wind was cold, causing Lin Yi to feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi inadvertently discovered another situation that left him extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>That is, his level had unknowingly risen to 30!</p><p></p><p>In just one day, his level had soared to the limit of the first job change!</p><p></p><p>At level 30, he could even go to the Job Change Sanctuary in Jiangcheng and accept the second job change quest!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath he just unleashed had likely caused far more damage than he had estimated!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi checked the experience gain record.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, after reaching level 30, all the experience he gained became 0 points - these were all excess experience!</p><p></p><p>Since he had not completed the job change quest to unlock the second job, he could not continue leveling up.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there was no longer any reason to stay here, as the monsters in the Mourning Forest could no longer provide him with significant experience.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out a scroll that faintly glowed with a purple light from his spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>This was the return scroll that Jiang Ya had previously given him.</p><p></p><p>The coordinate marked on the scroll was the teleportation hall in Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>It was getting late, and his parents were probably waiting for him at home for dinner.</p><p></p><p>To avoid worrying them, Lin Yi planned to teleport home directly.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Lin Yi was about to crush the scroll to teleport away, a faint, glowing emerald light in the darkness caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Molten Flame Demon he had previously dismissed back to the Elemental Plane had reappeared.</p><p></p><p>This type of summoning spell is actually a long-term contract spell. Using it once allows the summoner to control the summoned creature for an entire day.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Lin Yi, as the summoner, could choose to dismiss the two Flame Demons back to the Elemental Plane to rest and recuperate, and then summon them out again without needing to cast the spell again.</p><p></p><p>With this towering figure engulfed in flames, Lin Yi simply pointed, and the Molten Flame Demon obediently followed his command.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He went towards the spot where the faint emerald green light was flickering.</p><p></p><p>It was like a giant light bulb.</p><p></p><p>With the illumination of the Molten Fire Demon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly found the source of the emerald green light.</p><p></p><p>It was actually the cave that the previous Wind-Patterned Tiger King had emerged from!</p><p></p><p>With the Molten Fire Demon leading the way, and the previous 7th-tier spell clearing the path, Lin Yi was not too worried about any ambushes from the old sixth.</p><p></p><p>But just to be safe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi still had the Molten Fire Demon cast a Lava Shield on him.</p><p></p><p>Then he followed behind, slowly entering the cave.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the cave, Lin Yi felt a strong wind blowing towards him.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Molten Fire Demon's massive body blocking most of it, Lin Yi still felt the wind speed was somewhat excessive.</p><p></p><p>What the hell is in this cave that the elemental winds are so concentrated?</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yi's surprise, the cave turned out to be much deeper than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, the cave's path started to extend downwards into the earth.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the slope was not too steep, so Lin Yi could crouch and descend slowly.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Lin Yi finally saw the source of the emerald green light he had seen earlier, and was deeply amazed! After passing through the previously difficult and narrow passage, he unexpectedly emerged into an open and vast space.</p><p></p><p>The entire cave seemed to have transformed into a towering cathedral-like hall, with fierce gale-force winds of around level 10 blowing through the cave.</p><p></p><p>And the source of these gale-winds were the countless emerald green crystals growing out from the cave walls.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could feel that these crystals contained extremely pure wind elemental power!</p><p></p><p>This must be the reason why this cave is constantly buffeted by fierce winds throughout the seasons - because deep within the cave, there is a large quantity of this mineral that Lin Yi had never heard of before! Although Lin Yi had never seen this type of mineral before,</p><p></p><p>he instinctively felt that it was very similar to the "heavenly materials and earthly treasures" described in his textbooks.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, after the Blue Star's abnormal changes, many minerals, plants, and even animals underwent transformations after being infused with certain spiritually-inclined essences.</p><p></p><p>And these transformed things are beneficial to humanity.</p><p></p><p>Over time, they have all been classified as heavenly materials, earthly treasures, or spiritual objects.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's heart leapt with joy.</p><p></p><p>Today his luck is really good! Not only did he find that skill book, but he also has this unexpected windfall! If he can sell these things at the trading hall, he'll probably get a good price for them. Hmm, he'll also need to figure out a way to get an identification spell.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, although he knows these crystals are treasures, he doesn't know exactly what they are or their specific value.</p><p></p><p>That would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi carefully observed the area.</p><p></p><p>The distribution of the emerald green crystals in the cave was not very uniform.</p><p></p><p>And a small number of crystals were growing on the cave ceiling and extremely high walls, which he definitely could not reach.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were seven or eight clusters of crystals growing in the same place, and the position was not too high, so even though he couldn't reach them himself,</p><p></p><p>this big dumb fellow beside him could!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi commanded the Molten Fire Demon to approach those large crystal veins.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with the firelight, Lin Yi could see more details.</p><p></p><p>Underneath the large emerald green crystal mass, he saw countless animal skeletons and scattered animal fur.</p><p></p><p>From the thickness and length of the fur, he could tell that it was likely from the previous Tiger King.</p><p></p><p>That Tiger King had been resting under these crystal veins for a long time, no wonder it also gained some special wind-attributed abilities.</p><p></p><p>Could this be considered a symbiotic relationship between treasures and monsters?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

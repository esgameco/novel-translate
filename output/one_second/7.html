        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yi's classmates knew about this idea of his, they would probably start cursing him out on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Because even for Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it's still at least half a day away from reaching level 7.</p><p></p><p>This is after she has been training non-stop for the past seven days since awakening her profession.</p><p></p><p>She has now entered the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>Relying on her spiritual sense as a Psychic Mage, as well as her wide-area damage abilities, her leveling efficiency has already far surpassed her peers.</p><p></p><p>But even so.</p><p></p><p>Her seven days of hard work and struggle still cannot compare to the Magma Demon Lord simply strolling around the Howling Forest...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya used her psychic force to shock and completely knock out a Forest Gray Bear in front of her. </p><p></p><p>She then used her psychic force to slice it up and finish it off, completely depleting her spiritual power in the process.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky is darkening, and the entire Howling Forest is becoming even more dimly lit.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya practicing leveling alone here requires courage.</p><p></p><p>She sat down, drank a bottle of blue potion to slowly recover her spiritual power, and at the same time, took out some dry rations and water to replenish the day's consumption.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on a rock in the forest, Jiang Ya's eyes slowly revealed the face of the young man who had oppressed her for three years, making her both resentful and unforgettable.</p><p></p><p>What is he doing now?</p><p></p><p>Has he received the things she sent him?</p><p></p><p>Has she had her family check if there are any signs of him in the Grassland Training Area, or has she not received any news...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he has truly fallen into complete despondency? Should she go find him in person tomorrow?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya kept thinking about it, falling into a state of self-conflict again.</p><p></p><p>In these seven days, these thoughts have troubled her countless times.</p><p></p><p>She stomped her feet.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, why think about it so much, what does it have to do with me! But the more she thought this way, the more she couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>Women are such a mysterious creature...</p><p></p><p>However, the strange changes in the forest soon made Jiang Ya alert again.</p><p></p><p>"Awoooo-"</p><p></p><p>This was a piercing wolf howl.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there were countless other strange beast roars.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, the entire ground seemed to be trembling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya heard the sound of countless hooves and paws rushing.</p><p></p><p>Her expression changed, and she quickly drank two bottles of a potion that could quickly restore her spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Then she hid behind a giant tree and carefully observed the changes in the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jiang Ya saw a large herd of beasts rushing towards her from the far distance.</p><p></p><p>Tigers, leopards, brown bears, sika deer, and even countless smaller animals.</p><p></p><p>These animals that should have been in a predator-prey relationship were now surprisingly harmonious.</p><p></p><p>They were not attacking each other, but only running frantically, as if there was something terribly frightening behind them! Jiang Ya was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A beast tide!</p><p></p><p>In the small training area of Jianchen, in the Howling Forest, a beast tide has actually appeared!</p><p></p><p>What kind of terror has frightened these monsters to make them flee so recklessly!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was shocked and puzzled, and then she saw two other figures hastily fleeing in front of the beast tide - an old and a young person! The older one was wearing a gray robe.</p><p></p><p>The younger one seemed to be a recently awakened student.</p><p></p><p>"What... what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's usually expressionless face was full of astonishment as she saw the two people quickly approaching, and she hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>But the two people didn't even bother to respond to her.</p><p></p><p>They just kept running forward.</p><p></p><p>And after the beast tide had passed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was stunned to discover what had been chasing them all along-</p><p></p><p>Boom! A fierce heat wave suddenly swept over her! Instantly, Jiang Ya felt her mouth and throat go dry! She saw...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was a scene like that of purgatory! Intense flames, blackened and charred trees, and a terrifying monster over 5-6 meters tall, its body flowing with scorching molten lava, its face twisted in horror!</p><p></p><p>Run! Run fast!</p><p></p><p>This was the last survival instinct left in Jiang Ya's mind. It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>She felt that even in her dreams for the rest of her life, she might never forget this sight.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, as a psychic cultivator, Jiang Ya could use her mental powers to propel herself at high speed. Even after advancing her psychic abilities, she could even fly.</p><p></p><p>Her escape abilities were very strong.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya soon caught up with the middle-aged gray-robed mage, and she also noticed that the young man following the mage was almost in tears.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Xu, it's too terrifying, what is that thing?!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged gray-robed mage also had a panicked expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I... I don't know either!"</p><p></p><p>"How could such a terrifying boss spawn in this level 10 training area?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be something wrong here!"</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged mage was named Xu Guangliang. He was the second-in-command of a small mage family in Jiangcheng. Today, he was just bringing his nephew to train.</p><p></p><p>It was supposed to be a relaxing and pleasant outing. Who would have thought they would encounter such a terrifying Flame Demon monster!</p><p></p><p>As a fellow fire-based mage, Xu Guangliang felt that his once-proud Flame Explosion spell was nothing more than a small flame compared to this Flame Demon monster.</p><p></p><p>This old man, the young man, and the constantly fleeing Jiang Ya, never would have imagined that the terrifying Flame Demon that had given them such a huge shock and oppressive feeling was actually a servant summoned by Lin Yi on a whim!</p><p></p><p>And the Flame Demon's target was not actually them, but the fleeing herd of beasts. They just happened to be in the path of the beast tide, and were swept up into it, that's all...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya gritted her teeth. It seemed she wouldn't be able to get any information from the middle-aged mage.</p><p></p><p>She pushed her mental powers to the limit, further increasing her speed, successfully escaping the encirclement of the beast tide, and planned to rush out of the Howling Forest area without stopping.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the entire Howling Forest suddenly sounded a series of regional alarm prompts!</p><p></p><p>[Alert! Alert!]</p><p>[Jiangcheng base area alert!]</p><p>[A few minutes ago, the Jiangcheng City Monster Disaster Warning Center detected two small-scale beast tides moving from the central area of the Howling Forest towards the southeast and southwest.]</p><p>[At the same time, a terrifying unknown-level, unknown-strength monster appeared behind the beast tide!]</p><p>[All professionals within the Howling Forest area or approaching the Howling Forest, please evacuate immediately!]</p><p>[Repeat! Repeat!]</p><p>[This alert level is level 2! All relevant professionals, please evacuate immediately!]</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's face paled. Level 2 alert!</p><p></p><p>She had only seen this alert level in books before. It meant a terrifying monster disaster that could threaten the entire Jiangcheng city was about to occur, and the destruction could potentially reach half-city scale!</p><p></p><p>All the professionals who received this warning message were shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the Qingfeng Grassland, the Jiangcheng city defense-related departments had dispatched a large number of professional armies, and the weaving professionals of the Professional Alliance were also on high alert, nervously watching the direction of the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>From the monitoring footage coming back from the front, the two beast tides were not that big of a problem.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem was those two horrifying giant Molten Flame Demons!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

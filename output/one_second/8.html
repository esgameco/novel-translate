        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The intersection area between the Qingfeng Grassland and the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>The rear area of countless professional armies.</p><p></p><p>Standing there were the two individuals with the highest power and prestige in the entire Jiangcheng City.</p><p></p><p>One of them was clad in battle armor, with a square face and white hair and beard, clearly the image of a seasoned military commander.</p><p></p><p>His name was Wei Xing, the overall commander of the Jiangcheng City professional defense army, whose strength had reached the third-tier level.</p><p></p><p>Standing beside him was another middle-aged man of similar third-tier strength, but slightly plump and overweight.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wei, how are the casualties?" </p><p></p><p>The plump middle-aged man, named Wang Daihai, was a priest, or a so-called "healer", so his physical fitness was naturally not as good as Wei Xing's warrior profession.</p><p></p><p>As the director of the Education Bureau and the city lord of the Jiangcheng base city, he had long been in a high position, so when he saw this scene, the first thing he was concerned about was the casualties.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was related to the so-called performance appraisal during his tenure.</p><p></p><p>Although Wei Xing's expression was solemn, when it came to the casualties, he spoke lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Almost none of the newly promoted professionals have been able to enter the Howling Forest to level up in such a short time, most of them are still in the Qingfeng Grassland."</p><p></p><p>"The few who have entered the forest to level up, at most have just been brushed by the panicked monsters, without actually being attacked, so the injuries are minor, and there hasn't been a single death."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daihai heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, there hasn't been any major trouble."</p><p></p><p>"How's the intelligence gathering on the monsters going?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Xing's expression darkened again as he continued, "It's terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Preliminary estimates indicate that those two monsters are at least at the Overlord level, and their level is around 100. The scouts I sent out failed to use the identification skill, and none of them were able to bring back complete intelligence."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, those two monsters do not seem to have any obvious aggressive intentions, and it appears their target is only the low-level monsters in the forest."</p><p></p><p>"If the situation deteriorates to the point where we have to kill those two monsters, it will be very troublesome. They are elemental beings with extremely high fire resistance, and their elemental bodies can almost completely negate most physical attacks."</p><p></p><p>A drop of cold sweat slid down Wang Daihai's forehead.</p><p></p><p>As an ordinary level 5 base city, how could Jiangcheng deal with Overlord-level monsters over level 100, and such troublesome elemental beings?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding areas were all leveling zones no higher than level 20.</p><p></p><p>How could such high-level monsters have spawned here?</p><p></p><p>During their conversation, the beast horde driven out of the Howling Forest by the two Magma Demons had completely crossed the border and entered the Qingfeng Forest territory.</p><p></p><p>The professional players who had been on standby and ready to attack immediately drew their weapons, intending to deal with these panicked and disoriented monsters first.</p><p></p><p>But just as they had killed a few deer, a terrible change occurred! The two Magma Demons that had also charged out of the Howling Forest, seeing that the professionals had already hunted their targets, let out a deep, terrifying roar!</p><p></p><p>The boiling lava on their bodies surged up!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had ordered them to kill as many monsters as possible to help him level up.</p><p></p><p>But now their prey had been taken by others.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this went against Lin Yi's orders, so the Magma Demons were now enraged! Originally, they had no intention of attacking these humans, but now the two huge elemental arms shook, and the scorching lava on their bodies splattered like raindrops towards the numerous professionals who had stolen their prey.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was their long-range attack skill, Lava Eruption!</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Dahai looked like an unsightly fat man, he was after all a priest of at least three transformations.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a holy white-glowing staff also appeared in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Waving the staff, a golden shield suddenly appeared, enveloping the professionals standing in the front row.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>Countless scorching lava came into contact with the golden shield, the terrifying temperature almost instantly melting through the shield. Wang Dahai hurriedly chanted again, adding another layer of holy light shield, barely saving the lives of those professionals!</p><p></p><p>Wang Dahai was now not just sweating on the forehead, but drenched in sweat! Such high attack power!</p><p></p><p>And this kind of area-of-effect attack also had a lingering burn-type damage. If it hit the group, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>On the side, Wei Xing also gritted his teeth. The situation had indeed deteriorated to the point he least wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to think about what price they would have to pay to kill those two terrifying monsters.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an extremely aged voice sounded from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone stop, do not actively attack any monster in the beast tide, and especially not those two Magma Demons!"</p><p></p><p>"Disperse the encirclement, herd the beast tide within a certain range, and let those two Magma Demons eliminate the beast tide!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this aged voice, Wang Dahai and Wei Xing both brightened up! He's here!</p><p></p><p>The true strongest person in Jiangcheng, the figure like the Anchor of the Seas, the president of the Profession Alliance, the Quaternary Grand Mage, Jiang Xuan!</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, follow Jiang Lao's orders!" Wei Xing quickly instructed his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Soon, no one dared to attack the monsters that had rushed out of the Howling Forest, but instead surrounded them and drove them into the domain of those two Lava Monsters.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the two monsters no longer fell into a rage, but systematically reaped the lives of those monsters.</p><p></p><p>Almost ten minutes later, hundreds and thousands of monsters were all killed by the two Magma Demons.</p><p></p><p>The two Demons were fully satisfied. Without even looking at the hundreds of professionals present, they turned and went back into the Howling Forest.</p><p></p><p>They would faithfully fulfill the orders Lin Yi had given them.</p><p></p><p>A terrible crisis was thus resolved.</p><p></p><p>All the professionals let out a sigh of relief, feeling like they had narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying! They almost lost their lives here today!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan, riding a winged celestial horse, descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After a melodious whistle, the warhorse was recalled into his mount space.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan looked at the two retreating Demons with admiration and awe in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Lao, you know what they are, don't you?" Wei Xing asked.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when Jiang Xuan appeared, he had already mentioned the names of these two monsters and knew their behavioral logic.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Xuan nodded slowly and said, "You're all mistaken, those two Magma Demons are not monsters at all!"</p><p></p><p>"They are the summoned creatures of a great Mage!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Dahai and Wei Xing were both stunned. They couldn't believe their ears!</p><p></p><p>Those were the summoned creatures of a great Mage... Just now, they had actually tried to provoke a Mage of at least six transformations??

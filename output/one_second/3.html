        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, suddenly a knocking sound came from the door.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi got up and opened the door.</p><p></p><p>He saw that it was Zhang Shan, who was carrying a box in his arms, standing outside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yi open the door, Zhang Shan walked in, panting, and put down the thing he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>It made a dull thud.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Yi, I couldn't find you in the leveling area, and I couldn't find you in the dungeon either!"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that you awakened a common profession, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so depressed because of that?"</p><p></p><p>While speaking, Zhang Shan wiped the sweat and opened the box, taking out the things inside.</p><p></p><p>"These are the leveling potions and red and blue potions that my old man bought for me before. The blue potions are useless to me, so I'm giving them all to you."</p><p></p><p>"I also gave you half of the red potions."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there are three skill point scrolls in here. Crush them and you can get 3 skill points, use them as you see fit!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I finally awakened a rare profession, the Holy Knight!"</p><p></p><p>"Considering that you've been helping me cheat on my homework for the past three years, how about I take you leveling? I'll pull the mobs, you do the DPS, no need for a healer, I can tank it. We'll split the experience, you can't just stay at home and emo anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the things Zhang Shan brought, and hearing his words, Lin Yi's heart warmed.</p><p></p><p>This is a true brother!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shan's family isn't that wealthy either.</p><p></p><p>Although his father is a combat profession, he's just an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>These 3 skill point scrolls, it seems this kid has also given half of them to himself.</p><p></p><p>He's really generous!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took the skill point scrolls out of the box and handed them back to Zhang Shan, scolding him with a smile, "Who the hell told you I was emo?"</p><p></p><p>"And you keep these skill point scrolls for yourself, I don't want them!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not slacking off and not leveling, I'm just holding back for a big one!"</p><p></p><p>It took Lin Yi more than ten minutes to persuade the half-believing Zhang Shan to leave, and just as he left, the doorbell rang again.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door, Lin Yi saw another delivery guy in a courier uniform holding a box and smiling, "Is this the home of student Lin Yi?"</p><p></p><p>"You have a package!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "I didn't order anything?"</p><p></p><p>The delivery guy continued, "It's for you, the sender is Jiang Ya."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's mind immediately conjured up Jiang Ya's usually cold and slightly aloof pretty face.</p><p></p><p>Opening the box, Lin Yi saw it was full of high-level alchemy potions and high-grade mana and health potions, and most importantly, he even saw dozens of experience bonus scrolls.</p><p></p><p>Each of these scrolls was probably worth hundreds of gold coins, no wonder she's called the little rich lady.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yi didn't know was that Jiang Ya had agonized over this for seven days.</p><p></p><p>She even planned to go to his house on the first day when she saw him leave school dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>But the young lady's self-restraint and the high-cold persona she had maintained all along prevented her from letting go of her pride.</p><p></p><p>In the end, although she didn't go in person, her goodwill was still delivered.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi gladly accepted this box of items.</p><p></p><p>The three years of classmate affection seems to be much deeper than the desire to compete.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the delivery guy, Lin Yi opened the box, but saw that under the bottles of potions and elixirs, there was a piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the person who placed this paper did not want Lin Yi to see it at all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out the paper and turned it over, seeing a line of elegant small words.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too sad, if you need anything, come find me."</p><p></p><p>Just one sentence.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi could imagine how Jiang Ya must have scribbled and rearranged the words many times before finally writing down this sentence.</p><p></p><p>After checking the items that Zhang Shan and Jiang Ya had sent him, Lin Yi put them away and then opened his own panel.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Lin Yi】</p><p>【Profession: Mage (1st Transformation)】</p><p>【Specialty: Flames】</p><p>【Level: LV.1 (0.00%)】</p><p>【HP: 10/10】</p><p>【MP: 100/100】</p><p>【Strength: 1】</p><p>【Agility: 1】</p><p>【Spirit: 10】</p><p>【Constitution: 1】</p><p>【Endurance: 1】</p><p>【Talent: Gift of the Gods (SSS)】</p><p>【Unallocated Attribute Points: 0】</p><p>【Unallocated Skill Points: 602163】</p><p>【Class Skills: Efficient Casting (Passive), Quick Chanting (Passive), Fireball (Active)】</p><p></p><p>Looking at his over 600,000 skill points, Lin Yi took a deep breath.</p><p>The skill points accumulated over these seven days were terrifying!</p><p>No more words! Deep Blue, add points! Lin Yi opened the skill panel for Fireball and started frantically adding points! Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!</p><p>Lin Yi kept hearing the sound of skill upgrades succeeding, and the Fireball skill on the panel kept flashing with the light of upgrades!</p><p>The flames grew more and more intense, also emanating golden streams of light!</p><p>Awesome! So awesome! This feeling of boosting skills at lightning speed, like riding a rocket, is truly the most wonderful experience in the world! 【Consumed 500 skill points, your Fireball has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Flame Burst!】</p><p>【Consumed 2,000 skill points, your Flame Burst has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Triple Flame Spear!】</p><p>【Consumed 5,000 skill points, your Triple Flame Spear has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Raging Flame Storm!】</p><p>【Consumed 10,000 skill points, your Raging Flame Storm has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Blazing Flame Wheel!】</p><p>【Consumed 50,000 skill points, your Blazing Flame Wheel has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Molten Flame Demon!】</p><p>【Consumed 100,000 skill points, your Molten Flame Demon has been upgraded, you have gained a new spell: Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath!】</p><p></p><p>After more than ten minutes.</p><p>As Lin Yi kept adding points,</p><p>the skills on his skill panel had already undergone a dramatic transformation.</p><p>The once ordinary Fireball, after investing over 100,000 skill points,</p><p>had now advanced to the 7th tier! The entire room had become scorching hot.</p><p>Lin Yi felt an unprecedented, scorching heat wave sweeping over his entire body.</p><p>His limbs and body seemed to be bathed in the most terrifying and intense golden flames in the heavens and earth.</p><p>But these flames would not harm him in the slightest!</p><p>Instead, he felt an extremely terrifying affinity with the fire elemental in this world! He only needed to issue commands,</p><p>and these most brutal and destructive elements would erupt together to burn his enemies to ashes! Lin Yi checked what the next advancement spell was.</p><p>【8th Tier · Flame Spirit Incarnation】</p><p>【Advancement Requirement: 500,000 Skill Points!】</p><p>Lin Yi was dumbfounded, the skill point consumption for subsequent advancements had become astronomical.</p><p>No wonder Lin Yi had heard that only the top-tier super experts in the world, those at the 7th or 8th Transformation, could possibly use spells approaching the level of forbidden arts.</p><p>Without such a long period of time, it would be very difficult to accumulate such a massive amount of skill points.</p><p>And Lin Yi, in just a week, had almost completed the path that those ultimate mages had walked their entire lives! Lin Yi pondered for a moment, shifting his gaze to the other two skills.</p><p>【Efficient Casting】 and 【Quick Chanting】.</p><p>These two skills were awakened when he obtained the basic Mage active skill Fireball.</p><p>The effects were also very simple.</p><p>They could reduce his spell consumption by 10% and chanting time.</p><p>Could these two skills also be upgraded?</p>

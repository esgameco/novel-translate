        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cries, shrieks.</p><p></p><p>And the sound of countless panicked people rushing about.</p><p></p><p>The originally peaceful and tranquil Qinglan City, everyone had become tense.</p><p></p><p>Most of them had never witnessed such a grand scene! Numerous armed military personnel, with an aura of ruthlessness, began to organize the evacuation of the crowd. If they encountered anyone who was in a state of panic or even causing trouble, they would suppress them with thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what had actually happened.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that a great calamity was upon them!</p><p></p><p>"Look, the sky in the south...!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god!"</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Among the hurried evacuees, someone discovered that the horizon in the south had turned a blood-red color! They even saw the silhouette of a legendary creature in the distant, fiery expanse - a dragon! A gigantic, flaming dragon! The dragon's scorching breath was a sight that struck them to the core.</p><p></p><p>It was not just the civilians who were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Even the military personnel maintaining order were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>They actually didn't know what had happened either, but now they could probably guess.</p><p></p><p>Something earth-shattering must have occurred in the southern suburbs of Qinglan City.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of that fire dragon that they had to evacuate the crowd! Fortunately, the anomaly in the southern sky came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was worrying whether their homes had been invaded by some dragon clan, the fire dragon disappeared, and the southern horizon returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>It was as if everything they had just witnessed was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, the entire Qinglan City...</p><p></p><p>The wind started to blow.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning.</p><p></p><p>The previously calm and peaceful city was suddenly hit by a violent gale.</p><p></p><p>The free-floating wind elements in the sky and earth had all gone into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Some of Qinglan City's professionals who had reached the fourth transformation stage mounted their battle pets and took to the skies.</p><p></p><p>They could see more than the ordinary citizens.</p><p></p><p>In the southern suburbs of Qinglan City, it was as if a massive vacuum zone or a terrifying wind vortex had appeared.</p><p></p><p>All the air currents were rushing madly towards that area.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Many of the flying mounts under the riders were trembling in fear of the increasingly horrifying wind currents!</p><p></p><p>The sky had also darkened.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a long-brewing storm was about to descend in full force!...</p><p></p><p>In the dead silence above the land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was suspended at the very center of the storm he had orchestrated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was chanting something.</p><p></p><p>He was performing the seventh-tier wind magic, the incantation of "Tempestuous Thousand Waves Rupture".</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yi still had two instant-cast opportunities left.</p><p></p><p>But since he was now protected by the wind vortex generated by the Gale Wings, his spellcasting would not be interrupted or attacked.</p><p></p><p>He naturally wanted to see how long it would take for him to complete the full incantation of a seventh-tier spell.</p><p></p><p>Even if the incantation was not finished.</p><p></p><p>But the sky had already manifested a terrifying phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>The sky had completely darkened.</p><p></p><p>The clouds had lowered, and a massive, swirling cloud wall, awe-inspiring like a tsunami, was gradually taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Just like water, the air was also a fluid.</p><p></p><p>And under the influence of such dense wind elements, the nature of the atmosphere had become almost liquid-like.</p><p></p><p>When this terrifying cloud wall finally descended, it would mark the end of Lin Yi's incantation.</p><p></p><p>The howling winds had disturbed the peaceful slumber of the dead.</p><p></p><p>This action seemed to have also thoroughly enraged the Death Knight Riven.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised the black knight's sword in his hand, pointing it directly at the airborne Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>A chilling, inhuman growl rumbled from his throat.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the plague-blackened water that had just been scorched by the dragon's breath surged forth like a tidal wave, sweeping...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Restart. Cover the majority of the vast desolate area once again!</p><p></p><p>Beneath the black waters, countless limbs, bones, and rotten flesh are constantly twisting and reforming.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of undead creatures, summoned by the death knight, have returned to the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>This sight made the thousands of professional players in Qinglan City, who had previously planned to come and kill the world boss, shudder in fear.</p><p></p><p>It was too sinister.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's gaze shifted.</p><p></p><p>Under the [All-Seeing Eye], Lin Yi knew this was his skill [Army of the Dead].</p><p></p><p>If he were to let this continue unchecked, all the fallen who had been buried and died in this desolate land would be raised by him as undead, to continue fighting for him! The more people who had died, the more undead soldiers he could convert.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, these undead soldiers could even inherit some of their former strength and abilities.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the entire Qinglan City could turn into a living hell, and that was not an impossibility.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>The death knight Riven Dail swung his massive sword, and a terrifying black energy slash tore through the air, heading straight for the sky where Lin Yi was.</p><p></p><p>This was one of his signature skills, [Death Rift Slash]. The power of the strike should be truly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could even hear the deep rumbling sound of the slash cutting through the air.</p><p></p><p>The Gale Wings at the fifth tier, with their wind barrier effect, would not be able to withstand an attack of this intensity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yi's current health was only a few hundred points.</p><p></p><p>In his haste, he did not have a Molten Fiend to shield him.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi was not the least bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>Because the last magic incantation was about to leave his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Chanting, complete!!</p><p></p><p>Even though it was a 7th-tier spell, the nature of the wind magic was still extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>That is, the chanting time was at least a third shorter compared to the Heavenly Flame Dragon's Breath.</p><p></p><p>And under the 70% chanting time reduction from [Divine Blessing Chant].</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi completed this 7th-tier spell in less than 10 seconds.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind.</p><p>The violent airflow.</p><p>Both had a moment of stillness.</p><p></p><p>This was the final calm before the terrifying storm arrived! The next moment, the cloud wall above the nine heavens collapsed!! Like crashing waves, it plummeted down, carrying a terrible power.</p><p></p><p>That horrifying Death Rift Slash was instantly swallowed by the raging wind flow.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the power of the strike was completely eroded and vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the professionals standing on the ground, they looked up.</p><p>Seeing the sky falling down like that, this incredibly horrifying sight made their hearts even more shaken and terrified.</p><p></p><p>The death knights were impressive.</p><p>Their lives and deaths were essentially at the whim of this boss.</p><p></p><p>But in comparison now,</p><p>the mysterious overlord in the sky was even more impressive! He just waved his hand, and the sky was about to fall to the earth! However, what shocked them even more was not just that.</p><p></p><p>Under the cloud wall in the sky, the blurred figure seemed to point a finger downward.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p>the already terrifying storm had its wind force increase by more than double! Many people could barely keep their eyes open, struggling to breathe! And in the sky above,</p><p>the majestic cloud wall showed signs of overlapping!</p><p></p><p>The first cloud wall had not yet fallen, unleashing the terrifying power of the Thousand Tempest Break spell.</p><p>Yet, two more cloud walls had instantly formed and were crashing down in succession!

        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That big shot, he was actually able to unleash three consecutive attacks with just a wave of his hand?? Just how powerful is he!! The brains of countless professionals were completely fried.</p><p></p><p>In the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had used up all three of the single-cast opportunities he had accumulated over the past day.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yi was actually a very cautious person.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that a Level 7 Shocking Waves and Thousand Blades wouldn't be enough to kill this 200-level BOSS.</p><p></p><p>So he added two more.</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive Level 7 spells came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>There's no way it could still be alive, right?</p><p></p><p>If it's still not dead, then what? Lin Yi had already prepared a retreat plan.</p><p></p><p>If it's still not dead, then he'll just leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, if this BOSS is truly that godly, he'll definitely live long enough for Lin Yi to accumulate a few more skill points and use even higher-level spells to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>He can afford to wait.</p><p></p><p>And while others have to wait ten years for revenge, he only needs to wait ten days before he can unleash forbidden spells.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Lin Yi had worried too much.</p><p></p><p>The cloud wall crashed down.</p><p></p><p>The berserk Wind Blades trapped within the cloud wall were unleashed, indiscriminately attacking all targets within range! It happened in an extremely brief moment.</p><p></p><p>Those undead minions that Lich Knight Riven had just resurrected were hit over a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>The remaining bits of bone and rotten flesh were completely shredded into dust, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The mutated Lich Knight Riven's defense was also very high.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Blades cut across his thick armor, emitting an incredibly dense grinding sound.</p><p></p><p>The bad news was that even at Level 7, the Shocking Waves and Thousand Blades wind magic still couldn't violate the laws of the ancestors, so the damage was still just a scratch.</p><p></p><p>The good news was that it was slicing fast and furious!! Lin Yi saw countless damage numbers popping up above the Lich Knight's head. These damage numbers weren't that big, mostly around one or two thousand, maybe three thousand on a crit.</p><p></p><p>But the frequency of the attacks was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi only needed to make a rough estimate to deduce that from the time the cloud wall crashed down to the full unleashing of the spell's power, it was less than 15 seconds.</p><p></p><p>Yet it had already inflicted over four thousand attacks!</p><p></p><p>Just the first Thousand Blades had completely decimated the Lich Knight, a mutated world BOSS with a health pool in the tens of millions. Its health bar was reduced to less than a third!</p><p></p><p>However, the second and third Shocking Waves and Thousand Blades didn't even give it a chance to recover.</p><p></p><p>They kept coming in succession!</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yi directly saw the Lich Knight Riven's health bar being emptied at lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>In fact, if you really counted, this guy still owed Lin Yi a life!</p><p></p><p>"Roar...!"</p><p>"Hiss...!"</p><p></p><p>Riven's dying roars were filled with resentment.</p><p>His battle steed beneath him also let out a mournful cry, its bones completely shattered and reduced to ashes by the countless Wind Blades.</p><p></p><p>It met the same fate as those undead minions.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations, you have defeated the mutated world BOSS: Lich Knight Riven, and gained 2.2 million experience points, plus an additional 1.5 million experience points for defeating an overlevel BOSS!]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations, your damage contribution rate in the battle against the mutated world BOSS: Lich Knight Riven reached 100%, you have gained 2000 bound skill points and 5 tradable 20-point skill point scrolls!]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations, you have obtained the special task item: Heart of the Deceased, your necromancer class promotion task "The Lich Knight Must Die" has been completed, please return to the class promotion sanctuary to submit the task and complete your promotion!]</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive prompts rang out in Lin Yi's mind.</p><p>Proving that the BOSS who had just been so mighty and full of life was truly annihilated by him.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk!"</p><p>Lin Yi clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the skill points given by this BOSS were quite stingy. </p><p></p><p>Only a little over 2,000 points?? If Lin Yi's thoughts were known by others, they would probably be in tears.</p><p></p><p>Brother, having 2,000 bound skill points and 100 tradable skill point scrolls all to oneself is really awesome and more than enough! Many people have to grind dungeons for over half a year to earn this amount of skill points!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi slowly descended from the sky. </p><p></p><p>After defeating a BOSS of this level, there should be quite a lot of good loot dropping, right?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after landing, Lin Yi found a large amount of gleaming equipment at the spot where the death knight had previously stood, with one item even shimmering in a platinum glow!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the equipment, Lin Yi also saw two skill books lying on the ground! Skill books dropped again! Lin Yi had previously learned that the drop rate of skill books, even from world bosses, was very low.</p><p></p><p>But since the one he killed was a mutated death knight, the drop rate must have been much higher.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expect two books to drop at once! Apart from the equipment and skill books, Lin Yi also found many rare materials based on their names that this enemy had dropped.</p><p></p><p>These materials should also sell for a good amount of money.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi hastily collected all the treasures on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked around.</p><p></p><p>The group of professionals that Lin Yi had noticed earlier in the sky had not been injured under his intentional control, despite the impact of the Tempestuous Thousand Waves.</p><p></p><p>However, even without injuries, the repeated bombardment of 7th-tier wind magic had still caused most of them to succumb to the brutal force and difficulty in breathing, fainting one after another.</p><p></p><p>Well, this made things easier.</p><p></p><p>If these people were still awake now, </p><p>seeing him monopolize all the loot from the death knight, there would inevitably be some envious reactions.</p><p></p><p>Then it would lead to a messy sequence of murder and plunder.</p><p></p><p>Now it's much simpler.</p><p></p><p>The task is done, the treasures are collected, there's no reason to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi activated his Wings of the Gale again and flew back up into the sky, his figure quickly disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Just a few minutes after Lin Yi's departure, two streaks of light appeared in the sky!</p><p></p><p>One person was clad in a full set of red armor, with a burly and imposing figure, their aura of battle energy surging.</p><p></p><p>The other was dressed in a pale green robe, with white hair and beard, exuding an air of immortal elegance.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>The armored giant shielded his eyes with his arms.</p><p></p><p>The violent winds made it difficult for him to adapt to the current environment.</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth were completely hazy, not a trace of the mutated world boss could be seen anywhere!</p><p></p><p>Chen Feng was completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>He was the 6th-tier warrior expert who had come to assist in dealing with this mutated boss in Cyan City.</p><p></p><p>The elder beside him was one of the three strongest in Tianhei City, with 7th-tier cultivation.</p><p></p><p>They had thought it would be an easy task to handle a boss around level 200 after its mutation.</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Feng never imagined that by the time they arrived at the southern outskirts of Cyan City, not only would they not see the boss, but instead witness a raging tempest!</p><p></p><p>That's right, even though Lin Yi had already left, and the main power of the Tempestuous Thousand Waves spell had been fully unleashed, just like how the Blazing Dragon Breath had left permanent damage to the Howling Forest, these three Tempestuous Thousand Waves had also forever changed this once desolate land.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that if no external force intervened, this area would be plagued by gale-force winds of at least level 10 in the future.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

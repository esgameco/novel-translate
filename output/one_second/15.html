        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There are tens of billions of people on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He is one in a hundred billion!</p><p></p><p>No, from the perspective of a history spanning thousands of years, he may be one in a trillion!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly understood why no one before had chosen to max out the Appraisal skill, reaching the pinnacle of that skill level.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>There is no cost-effectiveness at all!</p><p></p><p>Most professionals learn the Appraisal skill just to check the attributes and strength of monsters at their own level.</p><p></p><p>And to check the properties of rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>There is absolutely no need to upgrade to a high level to understand monsters that you can't even defeat.</p><p></p><p>And -</p><p></p><p>Although the skill points required to level up a universal skill like Appraisal are only about a quarter of those needed for a professional skill,</p><p></p><p>who would be willing to spend that precious one-quarter of skill points on Appraisal instead of their professional skills? Understanding this, Lin Yi quickly opened his skill panel.</p><p></p><p>To examine this new skill that had evolved from the Appraisal skill.</p><p></p><p>【All-Knowing Eye】</p><p>【Unique】</p><p>【Skill Level: 9th Tier】</p><p>【Type: Passive Universal Skill】</p><p>【Consumption: None】</p><p>【Incantation: None】</p><p>【Cooldown: None】</p><p>【Effect: When you gaze at a target for more than 3 seconds, you ignore the level difference between you and the target, and ignore all the target's false, hidden, and concealed effects, obtaining all information about that target.】</p><p>【When the target you are gazing at is a spiritual object or an unidentified equipment item, you have a 10% chance of upgrading the quality of that spiritual object or equipment by one tier after successful identification.】</p><p>【Remarks: Comprehending all things, perceiving the universe.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>The power of this skill had exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>And this should be his first 9th Tier skill.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that with this skill, all things in the world will reveal their truest face to Lin Yi! Not to mention, this passive skill also has the ability to break illusions and reveal hidden things.</p><p></p><p>Too overpowered! Lin Yi focused his gaze on a passing professional nearby.</p><p></p><p>After three seconds, all the information about this person was completely exposed before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Profession, level, what skills he has, what equipment he's wearing, his HP, and his current state.</p><p></p><p>Even his weaknesses were all clear! Withdrawing his gaze, Lin Yi calmed his somewhat excited heart.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the trading hall.</p><p></p><p>The harvest from this trip was too rich.</p><p></p><p>The remaining thing to do is to accept the job for a class change.</p><p></p><p>The trading hall and the class change sanctuary are very close, just separated by a street.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi headed straight for the nearby class change sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, a young lady came up to him and greeted him enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, professional, how may I assist you?"</p><p></p><p>The one who received Lin Yi was a black-haired girl with glasses. She showed a gentle smile, her hands clasped behind her back, very obedient.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she had noticed this handsome guy the moment he entered the sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>There are many professionals coming and going.</p><p></p><p>But handsome guys are a rare species.</p><p></p><p>Finally seeing one, and such a handsome one at that, of course she had to go up and chat him up.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "I want to accept the 2nd class change quest."</p><p></p><p>The girl with glasses maintained her smile, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear, and continued, "Then please show me your professional ID."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I just completed my class change, and haven't gotten the official professional certificate yet. Will my student ID work?"</p><p></p><p>The girl with glasses was somewhat surprised: "Ah, you mean you just successfully completed your class change a week ago?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded.</p><p></p><p>The girl with glasses was even more shocked inwardly! She had never seen anyone able to complete a class change in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just one week, he had already reached the requirements for the second job change!</p><p></p><p>His expression was a bit out of control.</p><p></p><p>"Has your level already reached 30?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded again.</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled girl took a deep breath, secretly astonished in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It seems this handsome guy has an extremely terrifying family background.</p><p></p><p>Although in this small city of Jiangcheng, she had never seen local professionals able to second-class this quickly, but in some larger bases, especially in certain families with extremely deep heritage, </p><p></p><p>it is possible to quickly raise their descendants to level 30 through resources.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this handsome guy not only looks handsome, but his family background is also so terrifying! Unconsciously, the bespectacled girl moved a little closer to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yi had no idea that this girl had already imagined so much in her head, he just wanted to quickly accept the task and then complete it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out his student ID.</p><p></p><p>This could prove that he was indeed a professional.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh, okay, I'll help you with the registration procedures right away!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the bespectacled girl had completed the procedures, and then guided Lin Yi to one of the rooms in the Reincarnation Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the room, Lin Yi saw a blue spirit crystal floating in midair again.</p><p></p><p>The same as the one he first encountered when awakening his profession at school.</p><p></p><p>Touching the spirit crystal again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi received a system prompt.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Detecting professional level...]</p><p></p><p>[Current professional level: Level 30, has reached the conditions to accept the second job change.]</p><p></p><p>[Starting to draw the job change task...]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! You have received an S-rank job change task: The Death Knight Must Die!]</p><p></p><p>[Task requirements: Please form a team of 3 or less people to defeat the LV.60 World Boss: Death Knight Riven Dale, and obtain the task item: Heart of the Deceased.]</p><p></p><p>After seeing the details of the task requirements, Lin Yi paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he felt the difficulty of this task was outrageous, but rather that he felt it was a bit too simple.</p><p></p><p>S-rank difficulty is just this? A level 60 Boss, this level is not even as high as the Molten Flame Demon he summoned himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's a Boss, a Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath should be able to kill it, right? If it doesn't die, just add a few more.</p><p></p><p>This task requirement even allows him to form a team of three people.</p><p></p><p>This is too lenient! He really, I'm going to cry! If Lin Yi's thoughts were known to others, they would probably have a mouthful of curses coming from nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Because if they received this kind of difficulty task, they might end up crying their hearts out.</p><p></p><p>They might even never be able to second-class in their lives.</p><p></p><p>World Bosses are known to have high HP and defense.</p><p></p><p>Because this type of Boss is directly refreshed in the leveling area, not in the instance.</p><p></p><p>The Bosses in the instances are strictly limited in the number of people, so their corresponding values will not be so monstrous.</p><p></p><p>But the World Bosses in the wild, their HP is almost ten times that of the same level instance Boss.</p><p></p><p>Because basically these Bosses, once they appear, they are going to be attacked by hundreds or even thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>So except for Lin Yi, if any unlucky person really accepts this kind of S-rank task, their professional path may really end here...</p><p></p><p>Because the job change tasks are randomly distributed, there is no chance to try again!</p><p></p><p>After accepting the task, Lin Yi walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled girl who had previously received Lin Yi, smiled and asked, "Mr. Lin, is the task difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi shook his head, "It's just average."</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled girl clapped her hands, "Oh, then I must congratulate you! If the task is simple, you should be able to smoothly second-class!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the task target? Don't look down on me, I'm the oldest employee in the entire Reincarnation Sanctuary!"</p><p></p><p>"I know how to complete the task requirements of many third-class professionals!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

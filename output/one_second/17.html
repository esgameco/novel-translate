        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yi did not know that his sudden take-off from Wuhu had shocked so many people in the Azure City.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he flew up to the high skies of Azure City, with a wide-open view.</p><p></p><p>The entire Azure City was within his sight. And the surrounding leveling areas were also clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>With a single glance, Lin Yi saw the region hundreds of kilometers south of Azure City.</p><p></p><p>That barren and gloomy area should be the Desolate Land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi controlled the wind wings and began to fly towards the Desolate Land at full speed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Desolate Land.</p><p></p><p>The Desolate Land was not desolate at the moment.</p><p></p><p>A large number of professionals, like sharks that had caught the scent of blood, were flocking towards the central area.</p><p></p><p>That was the respawn point of the world boss, the Death Knight.</p><p></p><p>However, they still encountered strong resistance.</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder Legion Guild has booked the area, please leave, idle personnel!"</p><p></p><p>"The Star Sea Guild has restricted this area, please leave immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Countless professionals in the uniforms of various guilds were stopping any idle professionals who dared to approach the central area, not allowing them to get close at all.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell, is this your family's world boss?"</p><p>"Yeah, why don't you let us in?"</p><p></p><p>The guild members responsible for the blockade sneered.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's our Thunder Legion Guild's, you dare to try and get in?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with such unreasonable and tyrannical behavior, countless professionals were angry but dared not to speak up.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Legion and Star Sea were the two major professional guilds in Azure City.</p><p></p><p>These two guilds often demarcated areas in popular leveling zones, allowing only their own guild members to level up, completely disregarding other professionals.</p><p></p><p>Some had tried to resist before, but the leaders of these two guilds were powerful professionals close to the fifth-tier, with elite troops under their command, so this situation had continued until now.</p><p></p><p>Now was the critical time for the Death Knight to respawn, and the two guilds naturally wanted to monopolize all the experience and loot.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Suddenly, the central area of the enclosure was filled with the rumbling sounds of skill collisions.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the Death Knight Riven Dale had respawned! The elites of the Thunder Legion and Star Sea Guilds had begun to kill the boss.</p><p></p><p>However, this time the situation seemed a little different.</p><p></p><p>Because the sound of skill collisions soon subsided.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, a wave of black pestilence permeated with a strong aura of death began to spread across the entire Desolate Land.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the professionals responsible for guarding the outer perimeter and restricting other professionals from entering were all panic-stricken.</p><p></p><p>They received distress messages from their guild members in the channel: "Something's wrong, the boss is calling for help, let's hurry over!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the members of the two guilds all rushed towards the central area of the Desolate Land.</p><p></p><p>The professionals who had been driven out to the periphery all revealed expressions of joy and followed them in a rush.</p><p></p><p>There was a major difference between a world boss and a dungeon boss.</p><p></p><p>That is, the distribution of experience points and skill points after the kill is based on the contribution to the kill.</p><p></p><p>The more damage you contribute to the world boss kill, the more skill points and experience points you will get in the division.</p><p></p><p>And the loot will only depend on who delivers the final blow.</p><p></p><p>The crowd surged towards the center of the Desolate Land.</p><p></p><p>The sight that met their eyes made everyone feel as if their throats were tightly grasped by the hand of death, unable to utter a sound! Countless professionals in the uniforms of the Star Sea and Thunder Legion Guilds were lying in disarray, maintaining the posture of fleeing outwards.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the ground stained by the plague's black water,</p><p></p><p>Their weapons were broken, their faces filled with anguish, and they died without peace.</p><p></p><p>It was clear they had endured unimaginable torment before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"Guild Leader!" </p><p>"Boss!!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the two guilds guarding the perimeter even spotted their own guild leaders among the pile of corpses.</p><p></p><p>This made them even more disbelieving! It was just a level 90 world boss, after all.</p><p></p><p>They had killed it dozens of times before.</p><p></p><p>How could this happen? A total wipe?!</p><p></p><p>Before they could ponder further,</p><p></p><p>The sound of heavy hooves pounding the ground reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>They saw the culprit behind this scene.</p><p></p><p>A heavily armored knight in jet-black armor, wielding a massive sword nearly 4-5 meters long, riding a skeletal war horse with no visible flesh.</p><p></p><p>The war horse and the knight's head had hollow eye sockets that flickered with eerie blue ghostfire.</p><p></p><p>The Death Knight Riven, his size swollen to over 10 times his normal form.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he passed, the ground was stained with the pitch-black plague water.</p><p></p><p>"Run!!"</p><p>"He... he seems to have mutated!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a shudder of terror in their souls!</p><p></p><p>Legends spoke that world bosses and dungeon bosses had a slim chance of being influenced by abyssal powers, entering a mutated state.</p><p></p><p>In this state, their levels and skills would be horrifically amplified. </p><p>Many bosses that were originally only level 30-40 could end up surpassing level 200 in this state, leading to a total wipe.</p><p></p><p>Flee!</p><p>Run!</p><p></p><p>That was the only thought left in their minds.</p><p>The roles of hunter and prey had been reversed.</p><p></p><p>The Death Knight they had killed countless times before</p><p>had returned from the grave.</p><p></p><p>Riven the Death Knight tugged the reins of his war horse.</p><p>The skeletal steed let out a piercing neigh and its hooves struck the ground.</p><p>In the next moment, waves of necromantic energy radiated outward.</p><p></p><p>The dry earth beneath their feet was instantly submerged in an endless sea of black plague water.</p><p>Within the black water, it seemed countless dead hands with bony claws reached out to grab the fleeing adventurers' ankles.</p><p>They were trapped in the morass of death, unable to move an inch. And as the black water rippled outward,</p><p>an even more chilling sight unfolded before them.</p><p></p><p>The scattered corpses on the ground were now infused with necromantic power, rising back to their feet.</p><p>Picking up their broken weapons, they began chanting familiar spells.</p><p>But this time, they fought for the Death Knight.</p><p></p><p>Black mist shrouded the sky.</p><p>Pitch-black plague rain poured down, the stench of death overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was plunged into despair. They wailed, they cried out.</p><p>But no sound escaped their lips.</p><p>The rain curtain obscured everything, returning this place to deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>"Roarâ€”!!!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to be dragged into the black water and drown,</p><p>a thunderous dragon's roar suddenly rang out in their ears.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a searing heat completely dispelled the chill of death.</p><p>The black mist and rain in the sky abruptly ceased.</p><p></p><p>Then, brilliant orange flames tore open the darkness,</p><p>revealing a massive, blazing dragon in the sky!</p><p>Its dragon's breath cascaded down like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Riven the Death Knight tilted his head back.</p><p>In the ghostly blue glow of his eyes, he saw the silhouette of a figure shrouded in the raging winds behind the mighty fire dragon.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

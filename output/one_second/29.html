        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be conveying the fact that someone had just entered this instance.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yi!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zuo Qian cried out in alarm. He was sweating profusely! The previously grief-stricken and fearful Jiang Ya was also more confused and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Jiang Xuan had developed some fondness and a desire to nurture Lin Yi due to Jiang Ya's constant mentions. But now, he rebuked him. He never imagined that this seemingly steadfast young man would be so reckless! Knowing full well that this was an extremely difficult A-grade trial instance, he still dared to venture in alone!</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled professional from Tianshui Academy, upon seeing Lin Yi's actions, had a look of astonishment appear on his originally cold and emotionless face.</p><p></p><p>He then uttered four words:</p><p></p><p>"Foolishness beyond measure..."</p><p></p><p>The accompanying teachers from Tianshui Academy also looked at each other in bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>Someone immediately sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking his own death!"</p><p></p><p>"He probably doesn't even know what the situation is inside, or how to properly find the refuge, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention him, a rookie who just finished his class change, even if it were us, going into an instance of such difficulty alone would be very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Forget about him, if he wants to seek death, no one can stop him."</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence, and we don't know how long this instance will last. The priority is for our own people to clear the trial!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After passing through the instance barrier, Lin Yi received a system prompt.</p><p></p><p>【You are entering the special trial instance: Twilight City Feilieke】</p><p></p><p>【Warning! Only you have been detected entering this instance, it is recommended to form a team before attempting the challenge!】</p><p></p><p>【Do you still wish to enter the instance?】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi instantly selected "Yes".</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he entered the instance.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes, Lin Yi found himself in pitch-black darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the dark night sky, not a single star could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Only a crescent blood-red moon hung high above.</p><p></p><p>Although the lighting conditions were extremely poor, and Lin Yi had no illumination equipment or light-emitting spells,</p><p></p><p>he could still clearly see his surroundings thanks to his "Omniscient Eye" divine-level skill.</p><p></p><p>Collapsed city walls, tumbling rubble, the faint outlines of the city could be discerned.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt as if he had arrived at a medieval castle.</p><p></p><p>Except, it was a fallen castle.</p><p></p><p>The night wind blew through the dilapidated city, emitting a shrill howl.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the night wind were countless indescribable scraping sounds.</p><p></p><p>As if countless monsters were hiding in the darkness, poised to strike.</p><p></p><p>【Quest Objective Issued!】</p><p></p><p>【Survive for 3 hours in Feilieke!】</p><p></p><p>【Time Remaining: 2 hours 59 minutes 49 seconds】</p><p></p><p>【Note: All monsters in this instance are immune to physical damage. They take 100% increased damage from light-elemental attacks, and 50% increased damage from fire and lightning-elemental attacks.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi received the system prompt.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this instance was a mage-class trial.</p><p></p><p>If it were other weapon-reliant professions, they would likely be completely useless here.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the prompt was a warm reminder.</p><p></p><p>【Friendly Reminder: 300 years ago, on an ordinary night, Feilieke descended, and the sun never rose again.】</p><p></p><p>【If possible, please stop your heartbeat, abandon your breathing, they dislike noisy things.】</p><p></p><p>From this reminder, it seems that this city was once prosperous, with its own civilization.</p><p></p><p>But it must have experienced something that shrouded it in darkness.</p><p></p><p>At present, the entire city is likely filled with countless dark monsters.</p><p></p><p>And these monsters hunt by sound.</p><p></p><p>This reminded Lin Yi of a movie he had seen in his previous life on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Movie.</p><p></p><p>A Quiet Place.</p><p></p><p>In that movie, everyone tries their best to not make any sound.</p><p></p><p>Because as soon as you make a sound, it will attract an extremely terrifying monster.</p><p></p><p>But the instance Lin Yi is in right now is even more bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Because not only sounds from movement, </p><p></p><p>even your heartbeat and breathing can be heard by the monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi heard a strange sound.</p><p></p><p>He turned back and saw in the pitch-black darkness, there were several even darker masses quickly moving towards him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, under the faint moonlight of the blood moon,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also saw several "smiling faces" floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>These smiling faces didn't look too different from human faces, but in this environment, the floating smiling faces were quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>【Fading Shadow Demon】</p><p>【Level: LV.25】</p><p>【Rank: Common】 </p><p>【Race: Shadow Spirit】</p><p>【HP: 8000/8000】</p><p>【MP: 500/500】</p><p>【Skill: Conceal】</p><p>【Weakness: Magic Damage】</p><p></p><p>The dark mass that couldn't be clearly seen was the monster called the Fading Shadow Demon.</p><p>And the floating smiling faces were called【Fading Shadow Nightmare】.</p><p>They had higher HP, moved faster, and were also elite-level monsters.</p><p></p><p>These two types of monsters were clearly coming after Lin Yi.</p><p>They had heard Lin Yi's breathing and heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Jiang Ya said before, as long as you're in this instance, you'll constantly be chased by monsters.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Lin Yi feel it would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Because whether it's bursting into battle or fleeing, </p><p>it will make noise.</p><p>This is a fatal chain reaction, because it will attract even more monsters.</p><p></p><p>The group from Tianshui Academy must have known there should be a sanctuary in this city called Feilie Kaina where they could truly hide from these monster's tracking.</p><p>Or they had some method to shield themselves from the monsters' detection.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of a normal profession player clearing this,</p><p>avoiding combat is undoubtedly the best strategy.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yi,</p><p>he planned to take a different path.</p><p></p><p>To deal with the darkness, my friend, you can't just keep hiding.</p><p>You need to use fire! As long as I kill all of you, I won't need to hide or run!</p><p></p><p>Brilliant flames flashed in Lin Yi's hands.</p><p>A scorching aura appeared.</p><p>He unleashed the 4th tier area-of-effect fire skill, Raging Inferno, in a triple cast.</p><p></p><p>Scorching fire clouds crashed down from the sky like a waterfall, erupting in thunderous booms.</p><p>The 5-6 shadow monsters that had just surrounded him were all instantly killed by Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the next moment Lin Yi heard more rustling sounds approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi raised his hand again.</p><p>After a brief incantation, he summoned a 6-meter tall Magma Demon oozing with lava to guard against the incoming monsters.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Lin Yi opened his skill interface, planning to level up.</p><p>Lin Yi's target was the 8th tier fire magic!</p><p></p><p>50 million points to level up, according to past patterns, it would take a long time.</p><p>However, this time, Lin Yi was pleasantly surprised to find that his talent leveling system seemed to have unlocked something new.</p><p></p><p>【One-Click Level Up】! This was easy to understand, just click once and instantly upgrade the skill you want to the next tier! 【Ding! Consumed 500,000 skill points! Your skill Heavenly Flame Dragon Breath has been upgraded!】</p><p></p><p>【You have obtained a new spell: Highest Ascension, Incarnation of the Fire Spirit!】</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

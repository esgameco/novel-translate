        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What? Gain 1 skill point per second? </p><p></p><p>This cheat is a bit too overpowered!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was completely dumbfounded at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the knowledge he had learned in the textbooks,</p><p></p><p>in this world, the skills of all professionals are mostly obtained in their initial form.</p><p></p><p>Even if you are a grandmaster-level expert who has undergone multiple transformations,</p><p></p><p>when you obtain a new skill, that skill would only be a Tier 1 basic skill.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, you need to grind dungeons, complete quests, or earn skill points through various rare materials or fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>And the efficiency of acquiring skill points is extremely low!</p><p></p><p>At least before reaching the third transformation, for most high-difficulty dungeons, you can only gain a single-digit number of skill points after a run.</p><p></p><p>As for regular dungeons, sorry, the completion rewards don't even include skill points!</p><p></p><p>So for the professionals in this world, the tier of their skills is largely the most direct manifestation of their combat strength.</p><p></p><p>The higher my skill tier, the lower your level, I can still easily defeat you with my superior strength.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why most professionals in this world are hardcore grinders.</p><p></p><p>Because if you want to improve your skill power, you simply can't do it without grinding intensively! And what about Lin Yi?</p><p></p><p>He quickly did some mental calculations.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need to do anything.</p><p></p><p>No need to grind dungeons, no need to complete quests.</p><p></p><p>Just by idling for a day, he can obtain 86,400 skill points!</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept is this?!</p><p></p><p>This means that after Lin Yi obtains a new skill, he will likely only need a single day to max out that skill, or even reach the pinnacle level! Lin Yi's bewilderment and shock, seen by the others,</p><p></p><p>has already turned into unbelievable disbelief and a huge psychological gap! The most feared thing is comparison! With Jiang Ya as a rare profession leading the way, coupled with the high expectations and anticipation of so many people, this is the result they get.</p><p></p><p>They even start to worry that Lin Yi might not be able to withstand this sense of loss and disparity.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shan in the audience clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, he felt even more sympathetic towards his good friend.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, even if Lin Yi couldn't awaken a rare profession like Jiang Ya, at least it should be a unique profession, right?</p><p></p><p>Who knew, it was just an ordinary mage.</p><p></p><p>Even the first skill he obtained was just Fireball.</p><p></p><p>The characteristics of the mage profession are very obvious.</p><p></p><p>That is, high-output, area-of-effect violent damage.</p><p></p><p>But it also has many weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>Long casting time, fragile physique! So most mage professionals, at the beginning, actually get the best skill as Frost Arrow.</p><p></p><p>Because ice-based skills have slowing and control effects.</p><p></p><p>It's convenient for mages to kite and level up.</p><p></p><p>While fire mages have higher damage, they need too much protection.</p><p></p><p>They almost have no solo leveling ability.</p><p></p><p>"Student Lin Yi, I don't think you need to be so dejected, this is already very good."</p><p></p><p>"The mage profession also has a promising future, the road ahead is still long, don't be too bothered by the temporary gap."</p><p></p><p>The principal on stage forced a smile, patted Lin Yi's shoulder, and advised him earnestly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless people in the audience and the media all started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"The top student in the grade, how come he ended up with just a common profession?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I just love seeing the downfall of geniuses like this!"</p><p></p><p>"I've never liked that kid, thinking he's so handsome and good at studies, acting all arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"Now he's eaten his words, look at his expression, he must be unable to bear the blow!"</p><p></p><p>"Time to fade into obscurity!"</p><p></p><p>"You all are talking nonsense! As if you're all guaranteed to awaken combat professions, maybe you're not even as good as Ah Yi!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shan also started arguing with the classmates around him who were talking smack.</p><p></p><p>He...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With his neck stiff and his face flushed red, Jiang Ya in the crowd looked at Lin Yi on the stage, a hint of regret appearing in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>She didn't say anything sarcastic. </p><p></p><p>Nor did she look down on him just because Lin Yi's awakened profession was an ordinary one. She knew this man too well.</p><p></p><p>Three years as desk-mates, three years as rivals.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya had extremely complex feelings towards Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>She had to admit, in this moment, she had finally won against Lin Yi once, but why did she still feel so dejected?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was also taken aback when the old principal comforted him.</p><p></p><p>"When was I feeling down? Can't you see how excited I am right now? Ah, better keep it low-key."</p><p></p><p>No, he couldn't stay here any longer, Lin Yi was afraid he would burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>With this talent, he already had a crazy plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>According to the knowledge in the books, the skill levels of all professions were divided into nine tiers.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the ninth tier would be the ultimate forms of each profession's skills!</p><p></p><p>For mages, the ninth tier skills would be forbidden spells!</p><p></p><p>What lies beyond forbidden spells, Lin Yi did not know.</p><p></p><p>But he had a small goal - to first upgrade his Fireball skill to the forbidden spell tier! From the first tier to the ninth tier, the required skill points would be counted in the millions! For most professionals, it might take hundreds of years, or even a lifetime, to achieve.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yi, it would only take a little over ten days.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not participate in the latter half of the awakening ceremony.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone thought he was now just an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Might as well just play along. </p><p></p><p>Being able to leave school early, how wonderful! Lin Yi left the school and returned home.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door was Lin Yi's father, Lin Guodong.</p><p></p><p>"So, what profession did you awaken to?"</p><p>"Your mother has bought a table of delicious dishes waiting for you to come home!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Guodong smiled warmly at his son.</p><p></p><p>Although he was just an ordinary living profession worker, the most laborious and lowest-ranked miner among living professions, he was proud to have a son like Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's mother, Xu Qingfang, also came out upon hearing the movement at the door, looking at Lin Yi expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi: "Mage!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Guodong and Xu Qingfang exchanged a glance, seeing the joy on each other's faces.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad!"</p><p>"Haha, I didn't expect the Lin family to also produce a combat profession!"</p><p>"Mage is great! High output, no need to worry about employment!"</p><p>"Quick, wash your hands and let's eat!"</p><p></p><p>The three-person family ate this dinner very happily.</p><p></p><p>Lin Guodong even took out the old wine he had been hoarding for years, greedily drinking a few more cups.</p><p></p><p>He even poured a cup for Lin Yi, after all, he was considered an adult now and could drink.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi didn't want to ruin his father's mood, so he could only accompany him and drink a bit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by like flowing water, and seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>During these seven days, Lin Yi didn't go anywhere.</p><p></p><p>He just stayed at home, playing games and browsing his phone.</p><p></p><p>His days were extremely comfortable.</p><p></p><p>After awakening his profession, the theoretical courses and related practical courses at school had already been suspended.</p><p></p><p>For all the newly awakened professionals in Da Xia.</p><p></p><p>Awakening a profession was equivalent to graduating from high school. The next month would be a time for everyone to work overtime to level up their skills.</p><p></p><p>One month later would be Da Xia's annual national professional examination.</p><p></p><p>Passing the exam and getting into a better professional university would greatly benefit one's future.</p><p></p><p>In these seven days, the other classmates were probably working themselves to the bone, at most only gaining a dozen or so skill points? He didn't know how many times he was ahead of them!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

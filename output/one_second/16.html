        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Lin Yi also noticed that this girl had some enthusiasm that was beyond normal.</p><p></p><p>Having lived two lives, Lin Yi was still very cautious and did not directly reveal the details of his mission.</p><p></p><p>He just said indifferently, "No need."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi left the job change hall.</p><p></p><p>The girl with glasses sighed a little.</p><p></p><p>Ah, such a handsome guy, why does he seem to be such a cold-hearted person?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked out of the job change sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>He headed straight for the information library of the Jiangcheng Professional Alliance Guild.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the spirit crystals in the library, Lin Yi quickly found information about this boss.</p><p></p><p>"More than a hundred years ago, the southern suburbs of Qinglan City experienced a terrible plague, with thousands of deaths at the time, and the area later became a forbidden zone ravaged by viruses and plagues."</p><p></p><p>"A large number of infected creatures and undead creatures roam in that area, but there is no sign of living people, hence the name 'Silent Death Land'."</p><p></p><p>"The Lich Knight Reuvendell is rumored to have been the knight commander sent by a certain empire at the time to rescue the disaster victims, but later fell into becoming a Lich Knight for unknown reasons."</p><p></p><p>"Every time after the plague acid rain, Reuvendell would wake up from the grave, riding his skeletal warhorse, and wander forever in the core area of the Silent Death Land."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi read to this point and also knew some basic information about this boss.</p><p></p><p>The boss level matches the task description.</p><p></p><p>Level 60.</p><p></p><p>And the respawn point is in an area called Silent Death Land in the southern suburbs of Qinglan City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi typed the four characters "Silent Death Land" on the spirit crystal screen.</p><p></p><p>The result soon appeared.</p><p></p><p>The location is indeed in the southern suburbs of Qinglan City, with monster levels between 40-50.</p><p></p><p>Suitable for second-class profession training.</p><p></p><p>Then what about the respawn time? All outdoor bosses have a fixed respawn pattern.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Qinglan is not far from Jiangcheng, so the records of the last time the Lich Knight was killed can also be retrieved from here.</p><p></p><p>"World Boss: Lich Knight Reuvendell"</p><p>"Respawn time: 30 days"</p><p>"Last kill record: March 15, 3024 at 9 am"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the current time, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Damn! The last kill time was exactly one month ago at this time point.</p><p></p><p>This means that it must have respawned now?? This kind of world boss will be besieged by countless professionals, and is also the target of many major guilds.</p><p></p><p>Many times, those guilds and organizations will camp the boss.</p><p>As soon as it respawns, they will directly kill it.</p><p></p><p>If he misses it, he'll have to wait another month!</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Lin Yi doesn't want to be stuck on this simple task for a month without being able to level up!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yi hurriedly ran out of the information archive, heading straight for the teleportation hall of Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>In this era, the only two modes of transportation available to civilians are:</p><p></p><p>One is the high-speed underground rail transit that has been dug through underground tunnels, connecting the various base cities in Daxia.</p><p>The underground is basically free of too many monsters and fierce beasts.</p><p>And traveling by underground transit can bypass many monster-dense areas.</p><p>The safety is guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why air transportation is extremely rare in Daxia, even if it appears, it is mostly military motherships or warships.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the most convenient and fastest is the teleportation array.</p><p>Benefiting from the dual enhancement of spirit crystal technology and magic.</p><p>Short-distance spatial teleportation has long been widely used by the public.</p><p>Even though Jiangcheng and the neighboring Qinglan City are separated by thousands of kilometers in geography.</p><p>Using the teleportation array, it only takes a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took out his phone, bought an online ticket to Qinglan City, passed the security check, and headed straight for the teleportation hall.</p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yi rushing to catch a train in his previous life, each wave of people entering the teleportation array is also limited in number.</p><p>And they all rush in to check their tickets.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi followed a group of people and stood in the teleportation array, and then the magical runes lit up.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the teleportation array, a suction force was emitted. The next moment, Lin Yi felt like he was being drawn into some kind of space-time tunnel. The scenery around him was stretched into a bizarre and distorted form, rapidly passing by his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This experience was quite novel for him. And Lin Yi's sense of balance was very good. Even so, he only felt stimulated, without any other physical discomfort. But the other passengers were not the same.</p><p></p><p>When the teleportation was successful and Lin Yi arrived at the teleportation hall of Azure City, the people who came with him were basically vomiting uncontrollably. The smell in the entire hall was indescribable. Lin Yi quickly left.</p><p></p><p>Next time, he definitely couldn't buy a regular ticket. At least he should buy a high-class ticket, not only would the teleportation experience be better, but there would also be fewer people, so he wouldn't have to squeeze with these people.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the teleportation hall of Azure City, Lin Yi clearly felt that as a fourth-level base city, Azure City was more prosperous in all aspects compared to Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi had no time to pay attention to these. He firmly remembered the location of the Deathly Quiet Zone that the girl with glasses had told him about - the southern suburbs of Azure City!</p><p></p><p>Gale Wings was a fifth-tier wind-elemental spell, and the incantation time for wind-elemental spells was very short. But under the blessing of [Divine Grace Chant], even fifth-tier spells were instantaneous for Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yi did not hesitate and instantly unleashed Gale Wings. The next moment, a strong wind suddenly blew at the entrance of the teleportation hall, causing many passers-by to exclaim in surprise. The next moment, a faint green wind vortex surrounded Lin Yi, blurring his figure.</p><p></p><p>The countless security personnel guarding the teleportation hall and the job change shrine of Azure City saw this scene and immediately grabbed their weapons. Some even shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi suddenly realized that he might have made a mistake. In all the base cities of the Great Summer, the use of skills and magic was not allowed in non-leveling areas, and fighting and brawling would even get one arrested.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this skill of his could conceal his identity. But in order to complete the mission before the Death Knight kicked the bucket, Lin Yi didn't care about this too much.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a pair of wind wings appeared behind Lin Yi. With a thought, he felt his weight being completely offset by the wind element, breaking free from the shackles of gravity.</p><p></p><p>The wind rose, and he soared into the clouds! The experience of flying by himself was completely different from using transportation tools in the sky. It was truly exhilarating!</p><p></p><p>Especially that feeling of being able to soar freely between heaven and earth at extreme speeds, Lin Yi was instantly thrilled. He kept accelerating, trying to push the speed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he transformed into a jade-green beam of light, rushing towards the southern suburbs of Azure City!</p><p></p><p>"Mom! Look, someone is flying!" </p><p></p><p>In the bustling crowd below, countless children pointed at the swift figure in the sky, clapping their hands in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Wherever Lin Yi passed, he drew exclamations and envious looks from the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>The group of Azure City law enforcement personnel who had just planned to apprehend Lin Yi were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Fuck! A sixth-tier expert!</p><p></p><p>They had actually tried to provoke a sixth-tier powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Summer's public security management regulations, professionals were not allowed to fly or use skills within the base city limits.</p><p></p><p>However, for a true expert, even if they did this, these small fry responsible for maintaining public order wouldn't dare say much!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

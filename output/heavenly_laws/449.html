        <h1>Chapter 449</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 449 You Are All Surrounded by Me (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Yu's war plan was very comprehensive, but what Lin Yuan was mainly looking at was not the plan itself, but the powerful experts of the other peak race forces, who were the opponents of the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Does it take twenty of our human civilization's peers at the same level of evolution to hold back each Calamity Race expert?" Lin Yuan saw the battle plan targeting the Calamity Race.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan had already heard about the terrifying nature of this race, he was still somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>From Xuanyuan Yu's war plan, Lin Yuan didn't see any intention to defeat the opponent at all. The entire purpose was just to hold back the Calamity Race experts.</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity Race is very terrifying," Xuanyuan Yu sighed. "If it weren't for the unimaginably high difficulty they face in breaking through to the Ultimate, this entire universe would have belonged to the Calamity Race."</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough to the 11th level Ultimate requires escaping the constraints of the River of Time. The normal difficulty for a 11th level cultivator to escape the River of Time constraints is 10, but for the Calamity Race, it's 100 or 1000 times harder.</p><p></p><p>When the Calamity Race breaks through to the Ultimate, the backlash from the entire universe will descend upon them, not giving them any chance to adapt.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the Calamity Race currently only has two 12th level Ultimate experts. In addition to their small population, the success rate of becoming Ultimate is also pitifully low.</p><p></p><p>"The war plan has no problems," Lin Yuan looked at Xuanyuan Yu and said, "but you don't need to arrange anything for me."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Yu's war plan had arrangements for Lin Yuan as well, such as dealing with the strongest 11th level experts of certain peak race forces.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't the Galactic Overlord need to be arranged?" Xuanyuan Yu was a bit puzzled, but still did as Lin Yuan said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Although this would put a lot more pressure on the other 11th level experts of the Human Civilization, Xuanyuan Yu didn't have the slightest doubt about following Lin Yuan's orders.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. When the full-scale war starts, just contact me directly. Handle the other matters on your own." Lin Yuan waved his hand, and Xuanyuan Yu along with the other 11th level perfect evolution experts were all teleported out of the control room.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Rule." In addition to comprehending the space-time fusion rule and many other rules, Lin Yuan was also considering how to attain the Chaos Rule.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the 11th level, Lin Yuan's depth of rule comprehension and his innate awakening ability had both improved greatly. But for the Chaos Rule, he still felt a bit lost.</p><p></p><p>All things in the world originate from Chaos, but what exactly is Chaos, and how to attain the Chaos Rule, Lin Yuan felt a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang and the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower had both comprehended the Chaos Rule. Their explanation was that as long as one accumulates enough foundation, they would naturally comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>But what exactly counts as "enough" foundation, that's not clear. Emperor Xuanhuang and the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower were both Chaos Realm experts. If the required foundation is at the Chaos Realm level, then Lin Yuan is destined to be unable to comprehend the Chaos Rule at the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Even experts like Emperor Xuanhuang and the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower didn't comprehend the Chaos Rule when they were at the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow. I'm not in a hurry. At worst, I'll just spend more time at the 11th level. Without being sure, I absolutely won't attempt the breakthrough to the Ultimate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. With his current mental willpower, he could easily live until the end of the universe. Just a few hundred years, even counting all the time he spent traversing worlds, would only be a few thousand years, which is nothing compared to the complete lifespan of a universe.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan had plenty of time to slowly comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"The 11th level of the Martial Dao?" Lin Yuan divided his attention and tried to establish a complete 11th level Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was also a review and summary of his own path. Establishing the 11th level Martial Dao chapter was not just about upgrading the Martial Dao evolution path to the 11th level, but more importantly, to review the path he had walked.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could he grasp the present and better look towards the future.</p><p></p><p>Outside the super-large battlefield, many 12th level Ultimate experts were observing at will.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, tell me the truth, is that Galactic Overlord the same as the Human Bloodbath?" A peak expert of the Star Alliance asked Xia Qin telepathically.</p><p></p><p>This guess was quite unbelievable. For example, when that blank paper descended into this universe, the Galactic Overlord was only at the 10th level. In the 2D world, all extraordinary powers were suppressed, theoretically making the 10th and 11th levels at the same starting point.</p><p></p><p>But that was just the starting point. As time passed, the growth speed of the higher life level side would far exceed the lower life level side.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord was only at the 10th level. Even if he possessed treasures bestowed by the Human Civilization to break free from the 2D world suppression, his realm and life level were still there. No matter how powerful the treasures were, he must have sufficient strength to activate them.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord was only at the 10th level back then, what could he use to crush the likes of the Four Divine Kings and other 11th level perfect experts? Moreover, the Four Divine Kings also had suitable supreme weapons for themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, according to the Galactic Overlord's current displayed strength, he had reached the level of the strongest 11th level experts of the various peak races upon just entering the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the fact that the Human Bloodbath and the Galactic Overlord had never appeared in the same time and space, and that the blank paper escaped the universe, and the Galactic Overlord soon broke through to the 11th level, etc.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, after the root loss in the 2D world, the Galactic Overlord should have been affected even if the Human Civilization compensated him. How could he have crossed into the 11th level so easily?</p><p></p><p>The only explanation is that the Galactic Overlord was not affected at all by the 2D world. This is consistent with the Human Bloodbath leaving the 2D world alive.</p><p></p><p>All the clues point to one possibility - that the Human Bloodbath who massacred in the 2D world is the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>If it were just one similar clue, it could be a coincidence. But when all the clues are so similar, even without solid evidence, the peak experts of the Star Alliance have already affirmed it in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? And then?" Xia Qin, the peak expert, said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan entered the battlefield and revealed some of his strength, Xia Qin had already anticipated that the identity of the Human Bloodbath might be exposed.</p><p></p><p>But so what if it was exposed? Those powerful experts killed by the Human Bloodbath in the 2D world, what could they do about it?</p><p></p><p>"Very good." The peak expert of the Star Alliance fell silent for a while, a strong sense of shock welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even when he first saw the Human Bloodbath crushing the Four Divine Kings in the 2D world, he didn't feel that much shock, especially after speculating that the Human Bloodbath might possess treasures bestowed by the Human Civilization.</p><p></p><p>But when the Human Bloodbath and the Galactic Overlord overlapped, this Star Alliance peak expert couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>Prodigy. The prodigy level of the Galactic Overlord exceeded the expectations of all the peak experts.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Bloodbath is the Galactic Overlord?" "How is that possible? Wasn't the Galactic Overlord only at the 10th level back then?" "A 10th level could sweep through 11th level perfects?"</p><p></p><p>The thinking speed of the many peak experts was extremely fast, and they similarly deduced that the Galactic Overlord was the Human Bloodbath.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The matter.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping through the Eleventh Realm with perfection would not surprise the strongest ones, but sweeping through the Tenth Realm to the Eleventh Realm with perfection, even in a two-dimensional world, is an unbelievable feat.</p><p></p><p>Could even the Calamity Tribe achieve this?</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Tribe can indeed be considered unrivaled at the same realm, but to fight beyond their realm? From the First Realm to the Twelfth Realm, perhaps below the Sixth Realm, they could fight beyond their realm, as the gap between them is not too large.</p><p></p><p>But the higher the realm, the more difficult it is to fight beyond one's realm. To go from the Tenth Realm to the Eleventh Realm with perfection?</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Human Bloodrain being the Galactic Overlord has been spreading among the strongest ones. Even those strongest Eleventh Realm experts under the strongest ones have learned of this.</p><p></p><p>Especially within the vast battleground, many powerful alien experts need to treat the Galactic Overlord as their opponent, and the more they understand the information about him, the more confident they will be.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Galactic Overlord the Human Bloodrain?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it true or false?"</p><p></p><p>"The strongest one told me in person, so it must be true."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Realm experts of the various peak forces find it hard to believe, as many of them had experienced the journey in the two-dimensional world and have been under the shadow of the Human Bloodrain.</p><p></p><p>Now they are told that the Human Bloodrain they encountered was only in the Tenth Realm, and was only a few hundred years old?</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>In the war base of the Stellar Alliance, the Four Divine Kings sat in meditation, their expressions once again sinking into silence.</p><p></p><p>The impact the Human Bloodrain had on them was already great, and now learning the true identity of the Human Bloodrain, the Four Divine Kings found their minds momentarily blank.</p><p></p><p>In the war base of the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You and the group of Eleventh Realm Evolvers were also discussing animatedly.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord is the Human Bloodrain?"</p><p></p><p>"I see, no wonder the Galactic Overlord has become the commander of this war."</p><p></p><p>"To have such power at the Tenth Realm, I feel like I've been wasting my time for millions of years."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Realm Evolvers of the Human Civilization were not only shocked, but also felt a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the peerless genius of their human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Although the Human Bloodrain was originally a human Evolver, the Human Bloodrain and the Galactic Overlord were completely different.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Human Bloodrain was, it was still within the reasonable range, as no one knew how many years the Human Bloodrain had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Overlord? The growth trajectory of the Galactic Overlord was no secret, and a simple investigation could reveal it.</p><p></p><p>The overlap of the two identities has produced a far greater shock effect than either one alone.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord, is he the Human Bloodrain?"</p><p></p><p>In the corner, Naluo Vice Tower Master was a bit dazed. He had just realized that he had invited Lin Yuan many times in the two-dimensional world to go see the Human Bloodrain, but it had never materialized.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems...</p><p></p><p>The Human Bloodrain is the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to go see or not see him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether the Galactic Overlord is the Human Bloodrain or not, the upcoming war cannot be lost."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You was also shocked beyond measure, but his expression remained calm as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the strongest one said the Galactic Overlord has the best chance of breaking through to the Twelfth Realm. To have such power at the Tenth Realm, his foundation is indeed far stronger than mine."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Human Bloodrain being the Galactic Overlord caused quite a stir among the many Eleventh Realm circles, but it was soon overshadowed by the impending large-scale war.</p><p></p><p>In the core area of the vast battleground, the ten peak force powers began to converge.</p><p></p><p>Eleventh Realm experts stood in the void, their terrifying auras permeating the air as the might of the Twelfth Realm supreme weapons collided.</p><p></p><p>"Humans."</p><p></p><p>Countless Insect Hive Mothers hovered in the air, and the massive Insect Warrior armies surged forth.</p><p></p><p>During the large-scale war, the various peak force powers engaged in combat, with the Human Civilization Alliance and the Insect Hive Alliance being opponents.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the other ten peak force powers were also fighting fiercely, and in the vast central battlefield, spatial fluctuations were boiling, and terrifying auras were bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>"Beware of the soul attacks."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You took the lead, charging towards the largest Insect Hive Mother.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The space distorted, and terrifying soul attacks descended, with a large number of Insect Warriors at the Eleventh Realm Perfection simultaneously launching their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Although the Insect Hive Mothers were not adept at frontal combat, it did not mean they had no self-defense capabilities. The soul attacks of the Insect Hive Mothers were unparalleled among the ten peak force powers.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Hive Mothers needed to simultaneously control a large number of Insect Warriors, which required a massive mental will. The higher the mental will, the stronger their mastery of the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You only felt his vision blur, and then he reacted quickly, a golden gem appearing on his brow, suppressing the soul and resisting any attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, your Insect Queen has brought that treasure into the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You's expression was grave as he stared at the massive Insect Hive Mother, the illusory fluctuations emanating from it, enveloping all the Eleventh Realm experts of the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Nightmare Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You's gaze was fixed on the small palace-shaped weapon atop the massive Insect Hive Mother.</p><p></p><p>The Nightmare Realm was the Insect Tribe's tribal weapon, with an extremely powerful effect on area-of-effect soul attacks. This tribal weapon had often troubled the Feather Butterfly Strongest Ones of the Human Civilization.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the battlefield, a terrifying figure casually unleashed his attacks.</p><p></p><p>Around him, seven or eight figures were struggling to support themselves, and each of these figures radiated an aura no weaker than Xuanyuan You's, yet they were still on the defensive against this one powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Civilization is not doing well. Where is that Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>This terrifying figure was the strongest Eleventh Realm expert of the Calamity Tribe. He had also taken an interest in the matter of the Galactic Overlord and the Human Bloodrain. He had seen the battle footage from the two-dimensional world, and the power of the Human Bloodrain had even made him feel a bit of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The Insect Hive has even brought the Nightmare Realm here."</p><p></p><p>"The Human Civilization is in danger. If they don't have a tribal weapon of the same level, they might be defeated."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what about the Galactic Overlord? Could it be that he doesn't even dare to show up?"</p><p></p><p>The other peak force powers engaged in combat were also observing the situation, noticing the dire predicament the Human Civilization was in.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield between the Insect Hive and the Human Civilization, the largest Insect Hive Mother fully activated the tribal weapon, the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>The void of the Nightmare energy began to sweep across, and many Human Civilization Evolvers felt their consciousness fading, their faces filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man with a small stature suddenly descended into the central battlefield. With a slight lift of his right foot and a gentle stomp, the space-time vortex ground the countless powerful Insect Warriors to dust.</p><p></p><p>The massive Insect Hive Mother was forced to retreat significantly, and the Nightmare Realm atop it began to spin wildly.</p><p></p><p>The young man looked around, his gaze sweeping across the battlefields of the Insect Hive and the Human Civilization, and then towards the other peak force powers engaged in combat, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You are all surrounded by me!"</p>

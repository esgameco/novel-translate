        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of 12th-level ultimate beings had solemn expressions as they gazed at the grand pathway paved with countless rules that stopped not far from them.</p><p></p><p>A young man descended, treading on the rules.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The many 12th-level ultimate beings felt heavy in their hearts. Even though they knew they would have to face the Milky Way Star Lord after rejecting the human civilization's proposal, this moment came too quickly.</p><p></p><p>Just a second ago they had refused Xuanyuan the Strongest, and the next second the Milky Way Star Lord arrived.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Milky Way Star Lord's power, he could have descended silently, but he chose to arrive in such an open and dignified manner.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? It meant absolute power.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Lord was very confident in himself.</p><p></p><p>Those who could cultivate to the 12th level had incredibly fast thought processes, and in an instant they had made many deductions.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, do you really not intend to give us a way out?" The Yu Clan ultimate being said gravely. At this moment, all the 12th-level ultimate beings were brewing terrifying energy within their bodies, ready to unleash their full power at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As for escaping? </p><p></p><p>Everyone wasn't stupid. The universe was only so big - where could they run to? On the contrary, if the 12th-level ultimate beings scattered and fled, it would give the Milky Way Star Lord a chance to pick them off one by one.</p><p></p><p>The only thing the 12th-level ultimate beings could do now was to gather all their strength and try to see if they could resist the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Milky Way Star Lord couldn't defeat them, it would count as a victory.</p><p></p><p>"Submit to humanity, hand over 90% of your 12th-level weapons, treasures and rarities - that is your way out," Lin Yuan said calmly and indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"We can submit to humanity, but for the 12th-level weapons, treasures and rarities, can we hand over less?" The Yu Clan ultimate being's expression changed before he finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>This was already their biggest concession. The 12th-level weapons, treasures and rarities were related to the ultimate beings' confidence in facing the future destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>They absolutely could not lose them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you still harbor false hope." Lin Yuan looked at the many 12th-level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>In fact, handing over 90% of the 12th-level weapons, treasures and rarities was already Lin Yuan being merciful, considering how difficult it was to cultivate to the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, let us see just what level of power you have now." Brilliant light appeared between the Yu Clan ultimate being's eyebrows, and a majestic palace covered all the 12th-level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>This palace was the Yu Clan's strongest defensive clan weapon, obtained from the beginning of the universe when it fell from the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The majestic palace was a top-tier Path Breaking realm treasure, theoretically able to block attacks from peak Path Breaking realm experts. Its only flaw was that it consumed too much energy.</p><p></p><p>But with dozens of 12th-level ultimate beings present, the consumption spread among each ultimate being became much more manageable.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being dared to bargain with Lin Yuan because he was relying on this peak Path Breaking realm defensive treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Milky Way Star Lord was at the peak of the Path Breaking realm, so what? Even if he was stronger than ordinary peak Path Breaking realm experts, so what? As long as he was still within the scope of the Path Breaking realm, he could not overcome this palace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other 12th-level ultimate beings felt slightly relieved. The pressure of directly facing the Milky Way Star Lord was too great, but with this palace as a barrier it was much better.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully after seeing the power of this palace, the Milky Way Star Lord will take a step back on his own."</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the palace could block the Milky Way Star Lord, these 12th-level ultimate beings couldn't hide inside the palace forever, could they?</p><p></p><p>So negotiating with the human civilization and the Milky Way Star Lord was the inevitable outcome.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being believed that with this palace, he could gain more leverage for their side.</p><p></p><p>At least they weren't completely helpless.</p><p></p><p>In the Calamity Clan's territory.</p><p></p><p>In front of a mysterious, unknowable wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat face to face with two Calamity Clan ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>"A peak Path Breaking realm defensive treasure?"</p><p></p><p>The ultimate being on the right raised an eyebrow and said to Lin Yuan: "Milky Way Star Lord, do you need our assistance?"</p><p></p><p>The two Calamity Clan ultimate beings were hated and rejected by the universe's consciousness. Once they took action, there was a risk of being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But as long as they could get on good terms with Lin Yuan, this reincarnated Great Saint, the two Calamity Clan ultimate beings were naturally willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, the deterrence of a Great Saint was too great, and generally those who reincarnated were peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Only peerless Great Saints who had reached perfection in the Chaos realm had the confidence that their reincarnation would not die prematurely. As for ordinary Chaos Venerables? Reincarnating was no different from suicide for them.</p><p></p><p>Even Chaos Great Saints didn't dare to reincarnate lightly. Both Chaos Great Saints and peerless Great Saints were Great Saints, but the amount of memories they could carry after reincarnation was different.</p><p></p><p>"I can handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly. The one sitting here now was just an avatar, while his true body was in front of the dozens of 12th-level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being and the other ultimate beings stood in the starry sky, with a majestic palace covering all the 12th-level beings. The aura emanating from the palace was incredibly heavy.</p><p></p><p>"What a big..." Lin Yuan carefully examined the majestic palace and the many 12th-level ultimate beings inside it, "...cage."</p><p></p><p>The majestic palace was indeed a peak Path Breaking realm defensive treasure. In terms of quality, it was already close to the seven top-grade Path Breaking realm treasures left behind by the Sovereign realm expert 'Cang Wei Yang'.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Lord called this peak Path Breaking realm defensive treasure a big cage? Before the Yu Clan ultimate being could understand what this meant, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly, and dozens of figures condensed from the void all around, surrounding the majestic palace that covered all the 12th-level ultimate beings in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Those are... the Milky Way Star Lord's avatars?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu Clan ultimate being and the dozens of 12th-level beings were puzzled. They sensed that the dozens of figures surrounding them were all avatars condensed by the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The technique of condensing avatars was very common. Not just 12th-level ultimate beings, even 9th and 10th level experts could easily do it.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of avatars was far weaker than the true body. The avatars of 11th level experts probably couldn't even defeat 9th or 10th level experts.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the avatars condensed by 12th-level ultimate beings were basically used to bully special 11th level life forms like Ancient Gods. As for beings of the same level? Avatars were ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan was at the peak of the Path Breaking realm, the avatars he condensed wouldn't be very strong, at most slightly stronger than peak 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Such avatars, even if there were dozens, hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands, so what?</p><p></p><p>"What does the Milky Way Star Lord intend to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Condense dozens of avatars?"</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't think he can deal with us with just these dozens of avatars, does he?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Milky Way Star Lord take us for those 11th level beings?"</p><p></p><p>The many 12th-level ultimate beings inside the majestic palace communicated with each other.</p><p></p><p>They were all too clear about the power difference between avatars and the true body.</p><p></p><p>Even though they didn't consider themselves a match for the Milky Way Star Lord, they didn't think a mere avatar could deal with them.</p><p></p><p>"We should still be careful."</p><p></p><p>Although the Yu Clan ultimate being controlling the majestic palace was also puzzled, he didn't let his guard down at all. He remained vigilant and on full alert, exerting his full power.</p><p></p><p>"Dozens of</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Avatar? The two ultimate beings of the Plunder Clan in their territory were also somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, under the gaze of all the twelfth-level ultimate beings, dozens of avatars surrounding the majestic palace attacked simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, large areas of space-time began to collapse and be destroyed. The supreme defensive treasure at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm that protected all the twelfth-level ultimate beings - that majestic palace - was like a lonely boat floating on the vast ocean, at risk of being capsized at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible?"</p><p></p><p>"How can mere avatars have such great power?"</p><p></p><p>All the twelfth-level ultimate beings inside the palace were somewhat dumbfounded. They could feel the palace shaking. This supreme defensive treasure at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm was being continuously crushed by a terrifying force that was almost beyond its limits.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quietly watched the majestic palace rolling and shaking continuously.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of combat power in the main universe was fixed at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm. This was an iron law. Unless one had the ability to contend with the main universe, they would all be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>And contending with the universe? The universe itself was equivalent to the volume of a normal Chaos Venerable. This meant that even a normal Chaos Venerable deeply trapped in the universe would be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it was a Chaos Great Saint, there would be no need for this. Although a Chaos Great Saint could not completely erase the universe, they could destroy the origin of the universe, causing it to enter the great destruction prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Although after entering the twelfth level, Lin Yuan's combat power directly reached the Sovereign realm level, within the universe, the maximum combat power he could exert was still at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>But even at the same peak Path-Breaking realm combat power, Lin Yuan was much stronger than normal peak Path-Breaking realm beings.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious was that the avatars Lin Yuan condensed all had combat power close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>The universe limited the upper combat power to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm, but it did not limit the number of upper combat power entities.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the efficiency is still too slow," Lin Yuan shook his head inwardly. If there was no suppression from the universe, with his strength, dealing with these twelfth-level ultimate beings wouldn't need to be so troublesome.</p><p></p><p>He could directly activate the mind will secret technique - Eye of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current 60 million points of mind will index, once he used the "Eye of the Abyss", the consciousness of these twelfth-level Path-Breaking realm beings would all sink.</p><p></p><p>The difference in mind will index was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Let's make do with this," Lin Yuan thought to himself, carefully observing that majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body took action. Dozens of avatars attacked, thoroughly shaking the foundation of the majestic palace, and then compressing layers upon layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the originally majestic palace began to shrink, falling into Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>The majestic palace that originally protected numerous twelfth-level alien races had now become a cage trapping them.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Why, why are the Milky Way Star Lord's avatars so strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, we were wrong. We are willing to submit to human civilization forever, willing to hand over 90% of our twelfth-level weapons, armaments, treasures and precious objects..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the majestic palace, one twelfth-level ultimate being after another panicked. At this moment, they were completely suppressed in the palace. Although there was no problem for the time being, they had lost their freedom and ability to act.</p><p></p><p>This was very frightening. The Milky Way Star Lord could slowly find ways to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Even if he still couldn't kill them, when the universe reached its great destruction, he could completely throw the palace into the deepest part of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The power of the universe's great destruction could penetrate through the palace and descend upon them. At that time, all the ultimate beings trapped in the palace would be unable to move and could only endure wave after wave of destructive force. Their demise would almost be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"Now you know you were wrong? It's too late." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He had already given these twelfth-level ultimate beings a chance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the dormant period of human civilization in the distant past to the two million years of the Starry Sea Calendar before Lin Yuan became the strongest, who knows how many evolvers died at the hands of these twelfth-level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>Although the twelfth-level ultimate beings disdained to attack the weak, the aftermath of their battles could cause dozens of star regions to collapse with just one ripple effect.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>In the territory of the Plunder Clan, the two ultimate beings of the Plunder Clan fell into confusion. Even that supreme defensive treasure at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm, which even they found troublesome, was so easily suppressed by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The two Plunder Clan ultimate beings looked at the dozens of slowly dissipating avatars, their spirits trembling somewhat.</p><p></p><p>These dozens of avatars all had combat power close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm? How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>"Mere avatars possess combat power close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm. The true body of the Milky Way Star Lord must at least have Sovereign realm strength." The Plunder Clan ultimate being on the right looked at Lin Yuan's calm expression and couldn't help but swallow.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the dumbfounded state of those suppressed twelfth-level ultimate beings, these two could deduce more.</p><p></p><p>First of all, the combat power of avatars was definitely far lower than that of the true body. There was no doubt about this. Avatars were casually condensed from a wisp of mind will. How could they compare to the physical body and soul of the true self that had been tempered countless times?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's dozens of avatars displayed such terrifying power. The only possibility was that the combat power of his true body was far higher than the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's true body was only at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm because the upper limit within this universe was the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the two silent Plunder Clan ultimate beings, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord... I now have no doubt that the Milky Way Star Lord is a Great Saint reincarnated," sighed the Plunder Clan ultimate being on the left.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought that just entering the twelfth level and reaching the peak of the Path-Breaking realm was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the Milky Way Star Lord would directly soar to the Sovereign realm? Even in the Chaos Void, beings at the Sovereign realm were considered powerful. As long as they didn't actively enter those dangerous places, it was very difficult for them to truly die.</p><p></p><p>But the Milky Way Star Lord had just entered the twelfth level and was already at the Sovereign realm?</p><p></p><p>The news that dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings had been packaged and suppressed by Lin Yuan quickly spread throughout the universe.</p><p></p><p>Those eleventh-level powerhouses of the peak clan forces, upon learning that their ancestors had fallen into the hands of the Milky Way Star Lord, immediately felt their mentality collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Our ancestor was captured by the Milky Way Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Our clan's ancestor is an ultimate being, how could it be so easy..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it, I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>One eleventh-level powerhouse after another from the peak clans found it hard to believe, but soon, they learned the truth of the matter from the avatars their ancestors had left in their clans.</p><p></p><p>Rustle rustle.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the majestic palace, turned and took a step, his figure once again descending to the No. 3 stronghold of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The minds of Xuanyuan and the other nine strongest beings were in a mess. Just a moment ago, they were still discussing how to deal with dozens of twelfth-level alien beings, thinking there would be a bitter battle that might last for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But before they could say much, the Milky Way Star Lord had already resolved all the alien twelfth-level beings?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 474 The Seven Realms of Time and Space (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarch is very special, his strength far exceeds that of the top-tier Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Demon Monarch is condensed from a wisp of demonic qi of the Ancestor of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>And the Demon Monarch is the ultimate form born from the endless demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that he is the incarnation of the Ancestor of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the past battles between immortals and demons, the Demon Monarch is the one most feared by the immortals of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the ordinary demonic beasts? </p><p></p><p>Even if their numbers are endless, they cannot break through the defensive formations of the major immortal cities.</p><p></p><p>As long as they can hold out until the portal to the Abyss dissipates, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>Cloud True Lord has experienced several immortal-demon battles, and is very clear about the terribleness of the Demon Monarch. Such a demonic being, even with the aid of the grand war immortal artifacts of the immortal cities, can at most be severely injured, with basically no hope of being killed.</p><p></p><p>However, now, </p><p></p><p>in Cloud True Lord's eyes, the power required to barely match the Demon Monarch is the might of an entire immortal city.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it is struggling helplessly in the gaps between Lin Yuan's fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Cloud True Lord's mind is in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Although when he entered Lin Yuan's spiritual world earlier, he witnessed that majestic figure, which symbolized unparalleled spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>It almost made Cloud True Lord think that Lin Yuan might be the supreme Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>But Cloud True Lord soon gave up this idea, because the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and Lin Yuan have a great difference.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao resides at the source of the Immortal Realm, overlooking all immortals, but Lin Yuan is obviously not that.</p><p></p><p>In these years, Lin Yuan has displayed his terrifying alchemy attainments and methods that even the top-tier Jade Immortals cannot match, but he is still far from the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Cloud True Lord is puzzled again.</p><p></p><p>Grasping the endless demonic beasts with one hand, among which are six Demon Monarchs, this kind of feat can only be achieved by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, no one else.</p><p></p><p>Jade Immortals?</p><p></p><p>No matter how many Jade Immortals there are, as long as they dare to leave the immortal cities and lose the protection of the cities, they are just delicious prey in the eyes of the Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>Since the appearance of the Abyss, there has never been an example of any Jade Immortal being able to briefly contend with a Demon Monarch by their own power.</p><p></p><p>If they cannot even contend, let alone subdue, much less subdue six of them at once.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Monarchs?" Lin Yuan looked at his right palm, his gaze falling on those six Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>About to step into the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, he has almost reached the threshold of this realm, but in the end, he was disturbed by these demonic beasts, making Lin Yuan slightly impatient.</p><p></p><p>So he directly took action.</p><p></p><p>If it was when he just arrived in the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan still needed to be low-key, enduring if he could, to avoid facing the attention of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao or the Ancestor of the Abyss prematurely.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p></p><p>with the breakthrough to the Seventh Realm of Time and Space imminent, there is no need to restrain himself anymore.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan now already possesses some characteristics of the Seventh Realm of Time and Space.</p><p></p><p>For example, suppressing six Demon Monarchs with a single palm, this kind of suppression is not due to absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>Currently, this Sun Divine Spirit of Lin Yuan's, apart from spiritual will, is not stronger than a single Demon Monarch in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>There is no saying that he has the Immortal Realm's source infused into him after breaking through to the Eleventh Realm in the Immortal Realm, so even with the mysterious gourd's blessing, the world within the Sun Divine Spirit is only a few billion li in radius.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the physical body, most of the resources he obtained in the Immortal Realm have been given to his true body, so the physical strength of the Sun Divine Spirit is only at the normal Demon Monarch level.</p><p></p><p>The endless demonic beasts and the six Demon Monarchs struggling in Lin Yuan's palm are fundamentally suppressed by the spatial-temporal domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is suppressing all the demonic beasts to the extreme through the spatial-temporal rules domain.</p><p></p><p>With his current spatial-temporal comprehension, even if he really faces the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao or the Ancestor of the Abyss, he can still handle it with ease.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point is that the one acting now is just the Sun Divine Spirit, which can be abandoned if necessary.</p><p></p><p>His true body is hidden in a secret and unknown place, where the cause and effect of time and space are isolated, even the Twelfth Realm Ancestor of the Immortal Dao would have to spend a lot of time to locate and lock onto it.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, in this Immortal Realm, there is basically nothing that makes Lin Yuan need to be cautious and wary, once he fully steps into the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, he will be completely unafraid.</p><p></p><p>"These Demon Monarchs," Lin Yuan observed the six Demon Monarchs in his fingers, even though he is crushing them at the rule level.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan will not underestimate them either, after all, these Demon Monarchs are essentially a part of the Ancestor of the Abyss, a Twelfth Realm ultimate being.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed as he observed. Dealing with ordinary demonic beasts is still manageable, but these Demon Monarchs unexpectedly exhibit the opposite of what the immortals cultivating the Immortal Dao do.</p><p></p><p>It's like white and black, life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>"What place is this?"</p><p></p><p>The six Demon Monarchs are completely unaware of Lin Yuan's observation, but they have suddenly changed to a different heaven and earth, and each one of them has become extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>They were born in the Abyss, and apart from the ever-present Ancestor of the Abyss, they have never experienced such fear.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I sense the Abyss anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I can't sense it either."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarchs' scalps are tingling, the Abyss is not just a simple home for these Demon Monarchs, but something akin to a source for them.</p><p></p><p>Any Demon Monarch can sense the aura of the Abyss at any time, and they can instantly return to the Abyss if they wish.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p></p><p>the vast Abyss, almost comparable to the Immortal Realm, has disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it's not that the Abyss has disappeared, but that they can no longer sense its existence.</p><p></p><p>"It's temporarily of no use to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a moment, shaking his head slightly and exhaling a breath.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world in the palm collapsed, the endless demonic beasts were pulverized by the turbulent spatial-temporal force, and those six Demon Monarchs persisted for a few moments before being reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beasts were crushed by the spatial-temporal force and then transformed back into the most fundamental demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>This most fundamental demonic qi is the qi of the Ancestor of the Abyss, and Lin Yuan suppressed it in order to study the Ancestor of the Abyss who was sleeping in the depths of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Among the six Demon Monarchs, after the leader was completely destroyed, the remnant demonic qi gathered billions of li away from the Cangwu Immortal City, forming a figure again.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the majestic appearance of a normal Demon Monarch, this figure has become much smaller, and its aura has weakened, actually falling to the level of a normal Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Survived?"</p><p></p><p>This Demon Monarch is overjoyed, most Demon Monarchs are invincible in their own right and don't have any prepared survival methods.</p><p></p><p>But this Demon Monarch is naturally cautious, even when attacking the seemingly impregnable Cangwu Immortal City, he had left behind a wisp of consciousness in another place beforehand.</p><p></p><p>Now it has proven to be very useful, the true body perished, but the consciousness has revived, a kind of "resurrection".</p><p></p><p>"Abyss"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarch unhesitatingly summoned the Abyss, wanting to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fleeing into the Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>From start to finish, he did not know why his true self had died, or whose hands he had died by.</p><p></p><p>But it did not hinder the fear of the Demon Monarch. If he did not flee now, he would never be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p></p><p>The vast illusory Demon Abyss descended.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a towering great mouth was about to swallow the Demon Monarch whole.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>A giant hand completely composed of space-time extended out.</p><p></p><p>It forcefully grabbed the Demon Abyss Monarch from under that towering great mouth.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Demon Abyss lingered for a while, but ultimately dissipated quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Still want to run?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the ant in his palm, casually crushing it and re-suppressing the source demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, no movement yet?"</p><p></p><p>From the moment Lin Yuan acted to now, the majority of his mental focus had not been on the demons, but on monitoring the movements of the Immortal Dao Ancestor in the source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Easily grasping all the demons in the sky with one palm, the combat power Lin Yuan displayed had already approached the Twelfth Realm, perhaps enough to attract the attention of that Immortal Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was also Lin Yuan's attempt to probe the other party, to find out the Immortal Dao Ancestor's true state.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a moment, Lin Yuan found that the source of the Immortal Realm still showed no reaction. He simply turned and entered the cultivation area, intending to take that final step and advance to the Seventh Realm of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily resolved all the demons, even brazenly grabbing a Demon Abyss Monarch right in front of the Demon Abyss, and then turned around to continue his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have taken a long time, but in reality, it was just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>In the Cangwu Immortal City, countless immortals who had been fleeing in panic and utter despair just a moment ago, now found that the endless demons that had been shaking the entire immortal city had disappeared?</p><p></p><p>Not just one or a part of them, but all of them had vanished.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the collapsing buildings in the immortal city, the many immortals might have thought that what they had just experienced was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the demons?"</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"I don't know, where did those demons go?"</p><p>"Could it be that they retreated?"</p><p></p><p>Many immortals were somewhat dazed, quickly exchanging information, but overall, they all heaved a huge sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the many immortals who were at a loss, the various high-level bigwigs of the Cangwu Immortal City were shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"The demons retreated?"</p><p>"Absolutely impossible."</p><p>"Yes, the Cangwu Immortal City's six major defensive formations have already collapsed. If they had continued for a while longer, those six Demon Monarch could have invaded the immortal city. At this time, they retreated?"</p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>The many high-level bigwigs of the immortal city, who had access to far more information than the other immortals, were very clear about the state of the Cangwu Immortal City's defensive formations.</p><p></p><p>Although they were unwilling to accept it, the many Jade Immortals could judge that the fate of the Cangwu Immortal City would be to be devoured by the endless demons.</p><p></p><p>They, these top-tier Jade Immortals, would also be divided up by those Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>But at the last moment, all the demons had disappeared?</p><p></p><p>The high-level bigwigs of the immortal city were not fools, they knew the character of these demons well, they would not give up on a delicious prey.</p><p></p><p>"They didn't retreat, could it be that they were resolved?"</p><p>"Resolved? Did the Dao Ancestor take action?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord's heart stirred, the six Demon Monarchs, with their combined strength, could tear open the immortal city's defensive formations. Aside from the lofty Dao Ancestor, he could not think of any other existence that could so easily resolve them.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't the Dao Ancestor," said a young-looking Jade Immortal among them, who was the Dao Ancestor's disciple.</p><p></p><p>He was clear that the Dao Ancestor would not have intervened at this time, otherwise he would not have allowed the three immortal cities to be attacked.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Dao Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord and the other bigwig high-levels fell silent, believing most of it.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the Dao Ancestor had acted, his immortal might would have covered the entire Immortal Realm, causing all demons to retreat, and the Demon Abyss would have retreated as well. But now, apart from the Cangwu Immortal City, the other immortal domains in the Immortal Realm were still being ravaged by demons.</p><p></p><p>This did not fit the situation of the Dao Ancestor's intervention.</p><p></p><p>But if it was not the Dao Ancestor...</p><p></p><p>Then who else in the Immortal Realm, aside from the Dao Ancestor, had the means to instantly resolve those six Demon Monarchs?</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord and the other high-level bigwigs could not understand.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed that there is something strange in the Immortal Mansion area of the city?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the many high-level bigwigs of the immortal city were pondering, a vice city lord began to check the general situation of the immortal city and immediately discovered the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Under the siege of the endless demons and the six Demon Monarchs, the defensive formations of the Cangwu Immortal City had collapsed by a large margin, and the various formations inside had also been destroyed to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Now the entire Cangwu Immortal City was like a sieve with holes everywhere, one could see through from one side to the other.</p><p></p><p>And the current group of high-level bigwigs of the immortal city, who had partial control over the city's formations, could observe the entire immortal city from beginning to end without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current Cangwu Immortal City was equivalent to half a ruin, with most of the formations collapsed, making it difficult to conceal any secrets.</p><p></p><p>In this situation...</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Mansion area of the city, a certain Grade-A immortal mansion remained intact, in stark contrast to the surrounding Grade-A immortal mansions.</p><p></p><p>If it were just this, it would have been fine, perhaps that immortal mansion was just lucky and not affected by the aftershocks.</p><p></p><p>But now, as this vice city lord used the remaining control over the immortal city's formations to try to peek into that Grade-A immortal mansion, he immediately sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the situation of the demon attack on the city, the residents of all the immortal mansions had basically fled, except for this Grade-A immortal mansion, the others were all empty.</p><p></p><p>Such abnormalities naturally caught the attention of the many high-level bigwigs of the immortal city.</p><p></p><p>"This immortal mansion..."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a top-tier Jade Immortal, he also noticed that compared to the other panicked mansion owners, this Grade-A immortal mansion seemed unusually calm, without any intention of fleeing the mansion.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had already known that the demons outside would be resolved.</p><p></p><p>This made the Immortal City Lord couldn't help but associate, perhaps the owner of this Grade-A immortal mansion was somehow related to the entity that resolved the demons outside the city?</p><p></p><p>"Is it the immortal mansion of Master Yunzhenzhi?" The Immortal Palace Pavilion Master also found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"You know the owner of this immortal mansion?" The Immortal City Lord's gaze immediately turned to him, and the other immortal city bigwigs also looked over.</p><p></p><p>They all had the authority to inquire about the information of the Grade-A immortal mansion owners in the city.</p><p></p><p>But knowing the identity of the mansion owner did not mean they knew them personally.</p><p></p><p>Inside the immortal mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was sitting in meditation, and numerous insights and realizations were bursting forth in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Without the disturbance of the demons outside, Lin Yuan continued to make rapid progress in his understanding of space-time, approaching the final step of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time, space-time, so this is the essence of space-time!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.</p>

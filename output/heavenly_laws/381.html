        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranggu looked up and found that the sitting figure not far away had already disappeared. </p><p></p><p>"It seems the master doesn't care much about this matter."</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranggu thought to himself, while a hint of worry arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Rain Tavern passed this matter to him at the first opportunity, definitely because they had sensed something unusual. </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't even ask many detailed questions about this matter, which in Cha Ranggu's view, was he being a bit too careless?</p><p></p><p>Little did Cha Ranggu know that Lin Yuan had long since learned the whole story through the information sharing channels established by the outside human civilization.</p><p></p><p>He even knew who the culprit was.</p><p></p><p>In the northwestern region of the ancient Blood Rain country.</p><p></p><p>Here, it was a desolate expanse of desert as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>On a sand dune, Lin Yuan stood silently, his gaze directed towards a location dozens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the native demigods, in addition to more powerful combat strength and near-perfect utilization of their powers, the strongest beings of the myriad races had one more advantage.</p><p></p><p>That was perception.</p><p></p><p>Although all means were suppressed for the strongest beings who fell into this two-dimensional world, and they could only follow the rules of this world to start over again,</p><p></p><p>The spiritual willpower originating from their true bodies still brought them powerful perception.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was at the demigod peak, he took on the bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits, and was able to lock onto their location in a vast primordial forest in just half a day, solely through his own 'perception'.</p><p></p><p>For the native powerhouses, this was extremely inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as a demigod, it would be very difficult to find the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the perception of the strongest beings depended on their strength in this world.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan was at the eighteenth realm of a demigod, and everything within a hundred-mile radius was encompassed by his perception.</p><p></p><p>And at the edge of that hundred-mile range, Lin Yuan sensed several enormous auras lying in ambush - at least at the tenth realm of a demigod, a level that native powerhouses could never reach in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"One, two, three, four, five, six...a total of six. According to the intelligence, the ancient god Tuobatuo and five eleventh-tier special lifeforms formed a group to hunt and search for 'strange objects'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Before taking action, he had of course collected all the intelligence on Tuobatuo's group.</p><p></p><p>In this small group, Tuobatuo and another special lifeform called 'Pei Shen' were the strongest, probably around the twelfth realm of a demigod.</p><p></p><p>The other four were between the tenth and eleventh realms.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tuobatuo possessed a defensive 'strange object', while Pei Shen had an offensive one - a jet-black iron rod. In terms of pure destructive power, it wasn't as strong as the blood-red long blade of that 'Hou Zhu' from the Demonic Race, but it was still quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>"To be on the safe side, I should take a look first."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan took out the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>Although based on the intelligence, Tuobatuo's group would be no match for him - a demigod of the twelfth realm against the eighteenth, what could they use to fight him?</p><p></p><p>Even with 'strange objects'? That still depended on the wielder's strength.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan still planned to use the bronze compass as a precaution.</p><p></p><p>It never hurts to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>The use of the bronze compass was to foresee impending dangers and show the user a path of survival.</p><p></p><p>This seemed like a 'passive' ability, but in fact, after Lin Yuan's research, it could also exert an 'active' effect.</p><p></p><p>For example, at this moment, if Lin Yuan used the bronze compass and got the result that it was completely safe in all directions, it would mean that Tuobatuo's group posed no threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The bronze needle suspended in the center of the compass quickly stopped spinning.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a piece of information emerged in Lin Yuan's mind:</p><p></p><p>"No danger detected currently."</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the needle, Lin Yuan put away the compass.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins of a desert plateau, six figures stood or sat in casual postures.</p><p></p><p>As eleventh-tier special lifeforms, ancient gods with unmatched power in the depths of the cosmic starry sky,</p><p></p><p>Even after falling into this two-dimensional world, they quickly rose to prominence and dominated the region after a few initial years of dormancy.</p><p></p><p>When they first descended, those ninth and tenth-tier strongest beings could perhaps still surround and kill an eleventh-tier powerhouse through numerical advantage tactics.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After over a hundred years of adaptation, the eleventh-tier powerhouses had long since opened up an enormous gap with the ninth and tenth-tier strongest beings.</p><p></p><p>In over a hundred years, those ninth and tenth-tier powerhouses might have just entered the demigod realm, but the eleventh-tiers had at least cultivated to the seventh or eighth realm of a demigod.</p><p></p><p>"In our search of the Blood Rain ancient country over the past half year, we've eliminated more than ten strongest beings and also obtained a 'strange object'," said one of the special lifeforms, his tone quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, 'strange objects' were valuable enough to provoke the strongest of powers to take action, like that Cosmic Outer Radiance.</p><p></p><p>But in this two-dimensional world, they, as eleventh-tier lifeforms, actually had the opportunity to obtain them too?</p><p></p><p>"It's just that we don't know what use this strange object has," said Pei Shen, who carried the jet-black iron rod, shaking his head slightly. "That Ice Race lifeform would rather self-detonate than honestly explain."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Race was a powerful race subordinate to the peak Cosmic Race Grand Alliance. This Ice Race lifeform only had tenth-tier strength in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But he was extremely lucky and happened to obtain a 'strange object'.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this Ice Race lifeform planned to hide obediently in the Blood Rain ancient country and slowly study the abilities of the 'strange object'.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he was discovered and killed by Tuobatuo's group of special lifeforms, who then found the 'strange object' on his body.</p><p></p><p>With Tuobatuo's twelfth realm demigod strength, his perception encompassed a fifty-mile radius. That Ice Race lifeform only realized he was being targeted when Tuobatuo approached within ten miles.</p><p></p><p>But by then it was too late.</p><p></p><p>However, even in death, that Ice Race lifeform never lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Race lifeform was clear that his only hope of leaving this two-dimensional world lay in the strange object he possessed.</p><p></p><p>Now that Tuobatuo had seized the strange object, even if he promised to spare him, he could no longer leave successfully.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, he might as well self-detonate and depart.</p><p></p><p>"These weaklings, relying on their good luck to happen upon 'strange objects', not knowing that these 'strange objects' can only unleash their true might in our hands."</p><p></p><p>Tuobatuo spoke, his gaze icy cold. "In the time to come, we will thoroughly search the Blood Rain ancient country. If we can obtain more 'strange objects', you all will have a share."</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>The other special lifeforms exchanged glances and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Strange objects were inherently obscure - even within their perception range, no anomalies could be detected.</p><p></p><p>So -</p><p></p><p>It was very difficult to directly search for strange objects, because you had no idea what they looked like.</p><p></p><p>But over the past hundred-plus years, as information about 'strange objects' spread among the strongest beings, many of them began searching for them.</p><p></p><p>The strongest beings were scattered across the two-dimensional world, so a large-scale 'search' for strange objects was as difficult as ascending to heaven. However, searching for other strongest beings was not hard.</p><p></p><p>Most strongest beings could not enter the perception of special lifeforms like Tuobatuo, but it had to be admitted that even the weakest of the strongest beings from the main universe had decent eyesight.</p><p></p><p>If they were lucky, even an eighth-tier lifeform had a chance of obtaining a strange object.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Tuobatuo and the other special lifeforms hunted the strongest beings - one reason was to clear the field, and the other was for 'strange objects'.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they might encounter an immovable object and face even stronger strongest beings?</p><p></p><p>The probability was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>With Tuobatuo's group of special lifeforms joining forces, the only strongest beings that could threaten them were the top nine.</p><p></p><p>But the locations of those nine powerhouses were closely watched by many other strongest beings.</p><p></p><p>As long as they avoided those few areas, it could be considered completely safe.</p><p></p><p>"Calculate the time, at most two years, and we can search through most of the Blood Rain ancient country." Pei Shen, who carried the jet-black iron rod, was about to continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked in one direction.</p><p></p><p>Ten miles away, a terrifying aura erupted abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The owner of this aura seemed to tear through the air, charging towards them at nearly dozens of times the speed of sound, the air waves roiling and thundering in its wake.</p><p></p><p>"A powerhouse discovered us in advance?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen's expression turned solemn. The owner of that aura was heading straight for their location, the only possibility being that he knew they were here.</p><p></p><p>And being discovered in advance meant that the opponent's perception range was even wider than theirs.</p><p></p><p>Perception range was generally tied to one's own strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Pei Shen had no real concerns - there were six of them, and he and Tuobatuo possessed...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>'Wondrous object'.</p><p></p><p>Even if they truly encountered Vamana experts stronger than themselves, as long as they were not at the level of the nine great experts, our group had no fear.  </p><p></p><p>Ten li (about 3 miles) was a short distance.</p><p></p><p>Especially when traveling at dozens of times the speed of sound.</p><p></p><p>In just a breath, that figure had descended before Tuo Ba Gu Shen's group.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen and the other five special lifeforms did not scatter and flee.  </p><p></p><p>That would only give this Vamana expert the opportunity to defeat them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped and looked at the six extremely wary special lifeforms observing him.</p><p></p><p>When Vamana experts fell into the two-dimensional world, not only were all their powers and means reduced, even their physical forms were reduced to the appearance of the mainstream humans in this world.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not waste words, directly attacking with a slap.</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to become viscous. Lin Yuan did not attack the strongest Tuo Ba Gu Shen and Pei Shen, but rather the four slightly weaker special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was wary of Tuo Ba Gu Shen and Pei Shen, but he planned to keep all six.</p><p></p><p>First deal with the weak ones to prevent them from scattering and fleeing later.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The four special lifeforms only felt a tingling on their scalps. Although Lin Yuan's slap did not reveal any anomalies or draw upon the power of rules and laws, in their eyes it was as if the heavens and earth were collapsing.</p><p></p><p>These four special lifeforms, though all at the Shaman Ancestor's tenth or eleventh realm, were ultimately only eleventh-tier lifeforms in the outside world with basic awareness.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan attacked them, they realized that directly confronting him would certainly lead to death.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat."</p><p></p><p>The four special lifeforms unhesitatingly retreated in all directions, but the speed of Lin Yuan's slap was far beyond their retreating speed.  </p><p></p><p>Shua la.</p><p></p><p>The special lifeform on the far left was directly struck by the slap.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" This special lifeform felt as if his organs had been shattered, his body tempered for a hundred or two hundred years as fragile as thin paper, easily torn apart by that slap.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's palm penetrated one special lifeform, but he did not stop, his speed undiminished as he slapped towards the second and third.</p><p></p><p>"Attack."</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen next to him resolutely charged out, wielding that jet-black iron rod towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The jet-black iron rod faintly emanated black light. In this two-dimensional world, the only things that could slightly break free of the world's suppression were the 'wondrous objects' that were essentially twelfth-tier precious artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.  </p><p></p><p>The iron rod shook unceasingly, almost flying out of Pei Shen's hand.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen looked at Lin Yuan with utter shock. Under his full-force strike, Lin Yuan did not even retreat, only his attack slightly obstructed.</p><p></p><p>But he himself had suffered minor injuries, the 'wondrous object' iron rod in his hand almost slipping from his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"No matter."  </p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Pei Shen, his figure silently disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen's heart raced. Before he could react, a figure materialized next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand to grab at Pei Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Get away!!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen roared angrily, swinging the jet-black iron rod in fierce resistance.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p></p><p>With a forceful grab, Lin Yuan caused the iron rod emanating black light to suddenly stop. Then with a light tap, the rod struck towards Pei Shen's chest.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen's eyes bulged. Having obtained the jet-black iron rod for so long, he was all too familiar with its might. But in the next moment, the rod struck his chest.</p><p></p><p>In a daze.</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen felt his heart shatter, his internal organs reduced to powder. Even his consciousness began to rapidly fade.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, Pei Shen was a powerful ancient god of the eleventh tier, fifth rank. His flesh body shattering would easily recover. But in this two-dimensional world, everything was ordinary. Not to mention his organs turned to powder, even just a shattered heart meant he would not live much longer.  </p><p></p><p>The only reason he had not died yet was due to his powerful will supporting him.</p><p></p><p>"I possess the ability to attack 'wondrous objects'." Pei Shen found it incomprehensible. Attacks from 'wondrous objects' were unmatched, yet every strike from the jet-black iron rod was easily blocked by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of freak was this Vamana expert?</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen could no longer continue thinking. The light in his eyes rapidly faded as his whole body crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Wondrous objects are not invincible." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, casually collecting the jet-black iron rod.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, 'wondrous objects' had a decisive role for Vamana experts. Back then, the second ranked of the nine great experts, 'Hou Zhu', relied on a blood-red long sword wondrous object.  </p><p></p><p>But a hundred years later today, although 'Hou Zhu' was still among the nine great experts, he had fallen to ninth place.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's power, the higher the realm, the more the effect of 'wondrous objects' would gradually diminish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when fighting at the same realm, the side with a 'wondrous object' would definitely have a greater advantage.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Tuo Ba Gu Shen could not help but retreat a few steps, looking at Lin Yuan with some horror.</p><p></p><p>Pei Shen's strength was no less than his own, and with the jet-black iron rod, his frontal offensive ability was terrifying.  </p><p></p><p>But in Lin Yuan's hands, he could not even last two breaths.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Tuo Ba Gu Shen, who had planned to join the fight, tremble in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had not even attacked yet, and Pei Shen was already dead?</p><p></p><p>"Run."</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen unhesitatingly turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three special lifeforms also reacted.</p><p></p><p>But they were soon slapped to death by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You cannot escape." Lin Yuan gave chase after Tuo Ba Gu Shen.</p><p></p><p>In terms of perceptual range, he was twice as large as Tuo Ba Gu Shen. In terms of maximum burst speed, he was also far superior.  </p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan caught up behind Tuo Ba Gu Shen and slapped out.</p><p></p><p>This slap, if it had landed on Pei Shen earlier, would have either killed him or made him lose the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>But when it landed on Tuo Ba Gu Shen's back, he only trembled slightly before using the force of the slap to flee even faster into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"That defensive wondrous object?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised. The reason he dealt with the four special lifeforms first, then Pei Shen, leaving Tuo Ba Gu Shen for last, was because Tuo Ba Gu Shen possessed that defensive wondrous object.  </p><p></p><p>With a defensive wondrous object, Tuo Ba Gu Shen was absolutely the most difficult of the six special lifeforms to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, there should be no deep grievances between us. As long as you are willing to spare me, I am willing to pay any price," Tuo Ba Gu Shen said pleadingly while frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The 'any price' here referred to what Tuo Ba Gu Shen's true self in the main universe was willing to pay.</p><p></p><p>"Any price?" Lin Yuan was completely unmoved. No matter how great the price, could it compare to the defensive wondrous object Tuo Ba Gu Shen possessed?  </p><p></p><p>This defensive wondrous object, if brought back to the main universe, would make even paramount experts covetous.</p><p></p><p>"If you are not satisfied, sir, the conditions can be raised," Tuo Ba Gu Shen said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Lin Yuan, who erupted with such power, must be at the level of the 'Mother of the Tree Realm' or the 'Four Divine Kings' in the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen frantically fled, occasionally enduring Lin Yuan's strikes that sent him flying like a ball.</p><p></p><p>Their chase soon attracted the attention of other Vamana experts. Tuo Ba Gu Shen's group was searching for the ancient Blood Rain nation.  </p><p></p><p>The Vamana experts within the ancient nation naturally avoided them early on. But the movements of their chase were simply too huge, that aura far transcending Shaman Ancestors spreading out like ripples in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Add to that the deaths of the four special lifeforms and Pei Shen, whose true selves in the main universe made this public, and it quickly incited much discussion among numerous Vamana experts.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba Gu Shen, he's an eleventh-tier fifth-rank special lifeform. Pei Shen is also a special lifeform of the same realm. The two of them joined forces, along with four eleventh-tier special lifeforms, yet they are being chased by a Vamana expert who has never shown himself before?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not a chase, of the six special lifeforms, Pei Shen and four others are already dead. Only Tuo Ba Gu Shen remains."</p><p></p><p>"Right, Tuo Ba Gu Shen is only still alive probably because of that defensive wondrous object. Otherwise, he would have likely died at the hands of that mysterious Vamana expert like Pei Shen."  </p><p></p><p>Many Vamana experts discussed, with some schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of Vamana experts were at the eighth, ninth or tenth tiers. Facing the hunting of special lifeforms like Tuo Ba Gu Shen, their hearts were filled with exceptional dread.  </p><p></p><p>But now, Tuo Ba Gu Shen and the others were instead being overwhelmed and chased by that mysterious Vamana expert.</p><p></p><p>These slightly weaker Vamana experts only felt relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

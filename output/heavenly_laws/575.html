        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hazy and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling and intertwined.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed and felt.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he found himself in a world engulfed in endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>There was not a single ray of light here, only cold and deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>A flame suddenly ignited.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the flame broke the ancient silence.</p><p></p><p>It gave this world the concept of light for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The concept of heat.</p><p></p><p>The flame burned, and the light and heat spread.</p><p></p><p>A brand-new world was opened up.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the flame transformed into a blazing sun, eternally suspended in the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the light shone, it became a domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in silence, but his heart could not calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had stopped contemplating the divine imprint, the scenes he had just witnessed kept flashing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the physical divine technique he had awakened this time had such a far-reaching intent? On the surface, it was just the appearance of a blazing sun in the endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, with the light of this blazing sun spreading and covering, a complete world was opened up.</p><p></p><p>Opening up a world? For the current Lin Yuan, it was not a difficult task, but the realm of the world opened up by that blazing sun was so high that it was probably based on the 'template' of the source world he was in.</p><p></p><p>Opening up the source world? The source world is so vast and mysterious, even more so than the chaotic void. To open up such a world is almost an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>"The 13th-tier time life is truly terrifying," Lin Yuan thought, his mind focused.</p><p></p><p>The creator of 'Infinite Void', that 13th-tier time life, wanted to use this heritage to nurture a universe within its body that could rival the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>And the physical divine technique that Lin Yuan had awakened this time originated from the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, who was also a 13th-tier time life, and its ultimate goal was to open up a vast world like the source world.</p><p></p><p>"The 13th-tier time life has basically occupied a dimensional space, and their perspective is no longer within the dimension they are in, but rather they are eager to explore and occupy more dimensions," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Dimension is a general concept, and it encompasses more than the chaotic void or the source world.</p><p></p><p>No matter whether it's the chaotic void or the source world, they are all part of a certain dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I am still too far from the 13th-tier time life," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, for the difference between the 12th-tier and the 13th-tier is like the difference between a person in the painting and a person outside the painting.</p><p></p><p>"This physical divine technique..." Lin Yuan continued to observe the divine imprint and pondered for a moment, "let's call it 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens'."</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether it was the first physical divine technique or the current seventh one, they didn't have specific names. Lin Yuan named them based on the effects and functions of the divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>The seventh physical divine technique, in essence, is a blazing sun hanging high, and wherever the light shines, it becomes a domain, that is, the world opened up by the blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan named it 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens'.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun," Lin Yuan's mind moved, and a flame appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This flame emanated a mysterious aura, and the surrounding space began to change and assimilate rapidly under its reflection.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan were to continuously infuse energy into this flame to sustain its burning and expansion, theoretically, a second eternal blazing sun would be formed.</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the vast ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just a theory. Firstly, Lin Yuan doesn't have enough energy to support it. Secondly, even if he did, letting this flame evolve would inevitably attract the attention of the true eternal blazing sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Opening the Heavens?" Lin Yuan looked at the slowly burning flame, "With my current realm and strength, it's impossible for me to open up a world similar to the source world, but now, by relying on the awakened physical divine technique, I've indirectly achieved it?"</p><p></p><p>To open up the heavens and the earth, one needs to replace the rules and Dao of the heavens and the earth with one's own. </p><p></p><p>Whether it's the rules and Dao of the chaotic void or the rules and Dao of this source world, they are boundless and endless. With Lin Yuan's current understanding of the rules and Dao, opening up such a heaven and earth would be nothing but a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of divine techniques," Lin Yuan said with a pensive expression. He had not yet mastered or fully comprehended it, but he could still use and unleash it.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it's similar to the Lin Yuan at the first tier, who could use techniques that required a complete understanding of the spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these forcibly unleashed techniques, compared to the true understanding of the spatial rules, are extremely rigid and inflexible, only able to use the same move over and over again.</p><p></p><p>But there's no doubt that they can still overwhelm opponents at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, if I fully activate this divine technique, I can probably maintain the 'Blazing Sun' for about three seconds," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"But within these three seconds, even a Supremacy-level expert would not be able to withstand it, and even a Supremacy peak expert would die. Probably only a Celestial Venerable could survive."</p><p></p><p>The divine technique 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' is clearly equivalent to a 13th-tier secret art.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the limitations of Lin Yuan's strength and foundation, he cannot fully unleash the power of this secret art.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he can still kill Supremacy-level peak life forms with his Mastery-level life force.</p><p></p><p>From Mastery to Supremacy, it is a world-shaking difference. Even the core imperial families of the great ancient kingdoms can only reach the Mastery realm and contend with the Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>As for killing a Supremacy, or even a Supremacy peak? </p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, with his boundless foundation, he only dared to think he had the strength to kill a Supremacy peak after reaching the pinnacle of the Mastery realm and cultivating many techniques like the 'Infinite Void' to the limit.</p><p></p><p>But now? Lin Yuan's actual combat strength is only approaching the Supremacy peak.</p><p></p><p>"With the power of this physical divine technique, as long as I step into the Chaotic realm, basically no Supremacy, Celestial Venerable can be my opponent," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>If he were in the chaotic void, even a Great Saint would be easily swept away by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Supremacy in this source world is equivalent to the Venerable in the chaotic void, and the Celestial Venerable is equivalent to the Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>However, this divine technique also has its flaws. The consumption is too great, and Lin Yuan cannot control it perfectly. In a one-on-one or one-against-a-few situation, Lin Yuan would have no worries, but if they come at him one after another, taking advantage of the interval when Lin Yuan activates this divine technique, he would be a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this divine technique is definitely the most powerful trump card I currently possess. Even the so-called pure killing power divine technique 'Tear the Heavens' cannot compare to it," Lin Yuan said with a spirited expression.</p><p></p><p>The divine technique 'Tear the Heavens' only has that one 'tear', while 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' can be sustained for a period of time, essentially a greatly enhanced version of the divine technique 'World'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the profundity involved in the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' divine technique far exceeds that of the 'World' divine technique.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan has only been thinking about the power of the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' divine technique, but in fact, this divine technique is more inclined towards 'creation' and 'opening up'.</p><p></p><p>As for destruction? It's just one aspect of it.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yu Yan (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Gatekeeper of the Myriad Realms]</p><p>[Bound Talent: Inverted Heavenly Comprehension]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Bloodline Rebirth]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Move Mountains]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Strengthening]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Elemental Body]</p><p>[Divine Technique: World]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Tear the Heavens]</p><p>[Divine Technique: Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens]</p><p>[Current State: Consciousness Descended]</p><p>[Remaining Dwelling Time: Unlimited]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the newly 'updated' seventh divine technique in the lower left of his vision.</p><p></p><p>"The current priority is to comprehend this divine imprint," Lin Yuan calmed his mind. Only by comprehending this divine imprint could he bring it back to the chaotic void, for it to be used by his various true bodies, divine souls, and incarnations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, by 'comprehending' here, Lin Yuan did not mean comprehending the essence of the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens', which was too difficult for him to achieve. </p><p></p><p>Rather, it was simply to comprehend the divine imprint containing this divine technique.</p><p></p><p>It's like a high-tech product, as long as you can perfectly replicate each component inside, you can reassemble it.</p><p></p><p>As for the function and effect of each component, you can research it slowly later.</p><p></p><p>"Before I comprehend it, I can't die," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The current physical body is the carrier of the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' divine technique. If this body were to die, the divine technique imprint would dissipate, and before Lin Yuan comprehended it, it would be equivalent to permanently losing this divine technique.</p><p></p><p>This is a cost that Lin Yuan cannot accept.</p><p></p><p>As for choosing to transmigrate to a life that is not completely the same and then choosing to transmigrate again, Lin Yuan is not sure if he can continue to awaken the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, choosing to transmigrate and descend again means that Lin Yuan has to start over. </p><p></p><p>All the time and effort he had previously invested would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I am cautious with my current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some should also be very difficult to kill." Lin Yuan was quite confident. For over a thousand years, his true body and main spirit had mostly been in cultivation and seclusion, but his two divine incarnations had basically roamed the nearby major domains, arranging all the backup measures to protect his life.</p><p></p><p>Unless the ancestors of the major ancient kingdoms, those at the 13th level of temporal life, personally intervened, it would be almost impossible to completely eliminate Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, Crimson Pine Domain.</p><p></p><p>This major domain was the fief of the Crimson Pine King, who was responsible for defending against the Spiritual Might King on the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's side.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Spiritual Might King, the Crimson Pine King also obtained his royal title due to his royal lineage, with strength at the peak of the Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the Crimson Pine King was not overly ambitious and had no strong desire to become the emperor of the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In the royal city, the incarnation of the Azure Burning Marquis stood before a man with a lazy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, I'm worried that the Spiritual Might King may seek help from his brother."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis expressed his concern.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King's brother was a Sage Realm expert with a bloodline concentration reaching the core royal clan standard.</p><p></p><p>If such an existence joined the battlefield, who in the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom could resist him?</p><p></p><p>The core royal clan at the Sage Realm, relying on their powerful ancestral bloodline, could basically sweep through their peers. If they reached the pinnacle of the Sage Realm, they could even contend with the Heavenly Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>And unlike normal Heavenly Sages, the core royal clan was ultimately at the Sage Realm, so even if they intervened, they would not significantly increase the intensity of the war.</p><p></p><p>"That Spiritual Might King fellow, in order to become the emperor, may indeed do something like that," the Crimson Pine King said in a slightly more serious tone.</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Burning Marquis was breached, as the king responsible for commanding the war, he would certainly bear the responsibility.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take care of this matter," the Crimson Pine King said, looking at the Azure Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Azure Burning Marquis visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>With the Crimson Pine King taking action, there was a high probability that he could request a Sage Realm core royal clan member to counter the Spiritual Might King's brother.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it." The Crimson Pine King's thoughts stirred, and an incarnation immediately coalesced in the distant capital.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the ancient royal clan, he normally needed to guard his fief, but he could also return to the capital at any time.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Pine King soon arrived in front of a vast mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Brother." The Crimson Pine King waited outside.</p><p></p><p>His sixth brother was a core royal clan member, who usually immersed himself in contemplating the ancestral bloodline and rarely dealt with other trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>The core royal clan's bloodline concentration was almost at its peak, and even becoming the emperor could not significantly increase it, so most core royal clan members had little interest in the imperial throne.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the emperor certainly brought many powers, but it would also occupy them with numerous trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>The mansion's large doors opened, and an elderly servant-like figure came out, bowing to the Crimson Pine King, "Your Highness, please come in."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Pine King immediately entered, and in a pavilion inside the mansion, he saw his sixth brother.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Pine King's sixth brother was a tall man, currently sitting cross-legged, with a profound aura circulating within him.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Brother, I feel like you've grown stronger again. Could it be that you're about to break through the Heavenly Sage's shackles and enter the Heavenly Sage Realm?" the Crimson Pine King immediately began to flatter him.</p><p></p><p>He had come this time to seek help from his sixth brother, so naturally, he chose the most flattering words.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Sage?" The tall man shook his head. "We royal clan members, succeed or fail by our bloodline, and have almost lost the possibility of crossing into the Heavenly Sage Realm."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the core royal clan members who had truly cultivated to the pinnacle of the Sage Realm did not fear Heavenly Sage-level experts, and even with the ancient kingdom's many foundations, made those Heavenly Sages extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what matter have you come to seek me for?" the tall man asked the Crimson Pine King, well aware of his brother's character - if he didn't have something to ask for, he definitely wouldn't say these words.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Brother, you know that I've been bored staying in the capital, so I took on the role of a king. Originally, I was still carefree outside, but that Spiritual Might King actually wants to occupy my ancient kingdom's territory to become the emperor."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Pine King continued, "Coincidentally, my fief is right nearby, so I've automatically become the commander defending against the Spiritual Might King's invasion."</p><p></p><p>"If it were just the Spiritual Might King, I wouldn't be afraid, but the Spiritual Might King's brother..." The Crimson Pine King looked at the tall man with a troubled expression. "Sixth Brother, I'm no match for him."</p><p></p><p>"I see." The tall man nodded. "So you want to ask me to lend a hand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Crimson Pine King immediately nodded. "You're the only one I can ask. As for the others, even if they're willing to help me, they'll definitely extort me heavily."</p><p></p><p>With the premise of an enemy ancient kingdom's invasion, he, the Crimson Pine King, could seek aid and request a Sage Realm core royal clan member to intervene without much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>But even if they intervened, the Sage Realm core royal clan members would demand compensation. This was an implicit rule accepted by the ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've said so, I'll help you when the time comes." The tall man sighed, speaking with some reluctance. "But I'll only intervene if the Spiritual Might King's brother takes action. Otherwise, I won't."</p><p></p><p>"That's natural." The Crimson Pine King immediately said beside him. "Without his brother's backing, what is the Spiritual Might King worth?"</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Burning City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body was cultivating and contemplating in the Burning Heaven Pavilion, while his incarnation was outside, interacting with other Sages.</p><p></p><p>Each Sage had already evolved their own unique power path from the Chaos, and this held significant enlightenment value for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Sages would be guarding their own territories, and even if Lin Yuan wanted to exchange insights with them, he wouldn't have the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But now? With the imminent invasion of the Purple Dream Domain, nearly twenty Sages had gathered in the Azure Burning City, allowing Lin Yuan to freely exchange insights with them at any time.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't really Lin Yuan exchanging insights with these Sages, but rather the Sages themselves engaging in mutual exchanges, with Lin Yuan silently listening.</p><p></p><p>The two streams of Chaotic Flames clashed, one displaying two colors - crimson red and azure green, while the other was filled with a keen, blade-like quality.</p><p></p><p>Like a Chaotic Flame Axe, cleaving through everything.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the Chaotic Flame with the keen, blade-like quality retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Red Leaf, the path you've walked by combining Chaotic Flame and Chaotic Life, you'll likely become a Heavenly Sage before long," the Flame Axe Sage said with a touch of emotion.</p><p></p><p>He was also a peak Sage, and the path of his Chaotic Flame focused on annihilation, using the Chaotic Flame as a giant axe to slay everything.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the Flame Axe Sage was a Sage expert adept at destructive power.</p><p></p><p>However, just now, when the Flame Axe Sage sparred with Red Leaf Sage, he was left in a dilemma by Red Leaf Sage's dual use of Chaotic Flame and Chaotic Life.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only concede.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Flame Axe Brother, don't tease me. Heavenly Sage? I don't even know where my Heavenly Sage path is now," Red Leaf Sage shook his head. "Besides, we were just sparring, unable to use our true killing methods. That's a bit unfair for you."</p><p></p><p>After Red Leaf Sage said this, the Flame Axe Sage's expression visibly improved.</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't use my killing methods, and you didn't either. I lost, and that's that."</p><p></p><p>The Flame Axe Sage spoke frankly.</p><p></p><p>The other Sages present also occasionally sparred and exchanged insights.</p><p></p><p>However, most of their gazes were focused on Red Leaf Sage and Flame Axe Sage, as these two were peak Sages.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in the corner, silently observing the collisions between the various Sages.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Watching the fluctuations of the Chaotic Flames has increased your understanding of the Chaotic Flame path.]</p><p></p><p>The Sages present were mostly walking the Chaotic Flame path, occasionally flashing other paths, but Lin Yuan's focus remained on gaining insights into the Chaotic Flame path.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Red Leaf Sage, who had just finished sparring with Flame Axe Sage, suddenly turned his gaze to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan." Red Leaf Sage's tone was gentle.</p><p></p><p>The other Sages also looked over.</p><p></p><p>"Red Leaf Sage." Lin Yuan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"You've been in the Sage Realm for some time now. Have you decided on your own title?" Red Leaf Sage asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Generally, Sages would choose a title for themselves.</p><p></p><p>For example, Red Leaf Sage's real name was certainly not "Red Leaf."</p><p></p><p>Azure Burning Sage was the same.</p><p></p><p>"A title, huh." Lin Yuan thought for a moment, then spoke, "I'll call myself Silver Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

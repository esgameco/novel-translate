            <p>Chapter 289 - Unleashing a Massacre (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Space laws?"</p><p></p><p>"Mastered the complete space laws?"</p><p></p><p>This ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan stared at Lin Yuan, his eyes filled with astonishment. ‚ôúüç™Ôºñ‚ûà‚ìà·ïºùêÆ‚ìß.Âåö‚ìû–º‚ôóüòà</p><p></p><p>Even the six-winged elder was able to guess and perceive it in the end, so naturally he could also see it.</p><p></p><p>The only possibility for the Galaxy Star Lord to instantly dispel that silver-white cube containing the complete space laws was absolute control over space.</p><p></p><p>Space formed with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>And this could only be achieved by personally mastering the complete space laws.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the complete space laws before even reaching a hundred years old?"</p><p></p><p>The ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan was somewhat dumbfounded. The name of the Galaxy Star Lord had spread even among their ninth-stage level. Comprehending three types of high-level cosmic powers almost certainly meant being able to become ninth-stage.</p><p></p><p>One must know, each of these ninth-stage powerhouses had gone through countless difficulties before reaching this level.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this ninth-stage expert from the Tianyu Clan felt that Lin Yuan's current achievements had a bit of luck, after all, comprehending cosmic powers did indeed have random factors.</p><p></p><p>Cosmic powers could not be replicated or simulated, and there was no concrete path or direction.</p><p></p><p>Some extraordinarily talented powerhouses might not comprehend cosmic powers in their entire lives at the eighth-stage, while some relatively mediocre eighth-stage experts might randomly choose a direction and it could be a certain cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Galaxy Star Lord comprehending the complete space laws, it was different.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending cosmic powers might involve random and luck factors, but comprehending the complete space laws could only rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, among the myriad races in the starry universe, very few could comprehend the complete space laws at the eighth-stage, far rarer than the number of ninth-stage and tenth-stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome." The ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan furrowed his brows. An existence that had comprehended the complete space laws was far more difficult to deal with than an invincible eighth-stage.</p><p></p><p>Relying on a higher level of understanding of space, an existence that had comprehended the complete space laws could completely toy with a group of invincible eighth-stages, using layers upon layers of space to exile each invincible eighth-stage into the depths of the void.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the Galaxy Star Lord had not only comprehended the complete space laws.</p><p></p><p>"We must win this battle." </p><p></p><p>The ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan immediately began contacting the clan's experts.</p><p></p><p>"Solante, you possess a ninth-stage defensive secret treasure. Come over here." The ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan used himself as the coordinate to summon a Tianyu Clan expert from their ancestral star domain.</p><p></p><p>Solante was one of the top ten geniuses of the current era in the Tianyu Clan, with a 50% chance of advancing to the ninth-stage.</p><p></p><p>He had comprehended a high-level cosmic power in just ten thousand years, and had also excavated his bloodline very deeply, mastering three bloodline talents.</p><p></p><p>The ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan did not expect Solante to defeat the Galaxy Star Lord, as long as he could stall the other party or entangle a portion of the Galaxy Star Lord's energy, it would be enough.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Galaxy Star Lord could not act recklessly against the invincible eighth-stages of the Tianyu Clan, then the Tianyu Clan still had a chance of winning this battle.</p><p></p><p>On the human civilization side.</p><p></p><p>Within layers of space, a ninth-stage evolver was also sizing up Lin Yuan with extreme shock.</p><p></p><p>His name was "Xilan", the ninth-stage stationed by the human civilization to guard this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Xilan blinked his eyes. Back then, in order to comprehend the complete space laws, he had spent several thousand years.</p><p></p><p>These several thousand years were after he had entered the ninth-stage.</p><p></p><p>Xilan had a bird's eye view, so perceiving the space laws was much easier for him compared to eighth-stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow..."</p><p></p><p>Xilan didn't know how to describe it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Those who could become ninth-stage were all unparalleled geniuses of their era, but now compared to the Galaxy Star Lord, he felt that he had lived these years in vain.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord's talent and aptitude are far above the rumors. Such a treasure must be protected well."</p><p></p><p>Xilan immediately perked up, preventing the ninth-stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Clan from making a desperate move.</p><p></p><p>Even if the current Galaxy Star Lord was just a clone, there were still methods to affect the main body through the clone, right?</p><p></p><p>In Xilan's heart, he had already placed the importance of the Galaxy Star Lord above the outcome of the war.</p><p></p><p>The war with the Tianyu Clan could be lost, but the Galaxy Star Lord must not be harmed. If necessary, he would rather tear apart the hidden rules to ensure the Galaxy Star Lord's safety.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was taking stock of the six-winged elder's spatial bracelet.</p><p></p><p>"So poor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. There weren't any valuable treasures in the bracelet. Added together, they were probably equivalent to the value of a few thousand cubic universes of crystals.</p><p></p><p>This was also very normal. The invincible eighth-stages who dared to enter the battlefield were basically prepared to die, so naturally they wouldn't carry precious treasures on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"But this spatial secret treasure should be quite valuable." Lin Yuan glanced at the silver-white cube beside him.</p><p></p><p>This secret treasure was the trump card the Tianyu Clan had prepared for this war to prevent the human civilization from deploying ninth-stage secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A Tianyu Clan expert with eight pairs of wings on his back, wearing purple armor, appeared on the battlefield following the spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Solante. Galaxy Star Lord, I am your opponent." As soon as Solante appeared, the many panicked invincible eighth-stages of the Tianyu Clan calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Solante was one of the top ten geniuses below the ninth-stage in the Tianyu Clan, his strength far surpassing the previous six-winged elder.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the purple armor Solante was wearing at this moment had a profound aura fluctuation, clearly a ninth-stage defensive secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>Why was the six-winged elder so easily defeated by the Galaxy Star Lord? It was entirely because that spatial secret treasure was countered!</p><p></p><p>Before this, who knew that the Galaxy Star Lord had comprehended the complete space laws?</p><p></p><p>If the six-winged elder had known in advance, he definitely would not have used that silver-white cube.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, Lin Yuan looked towards Solante who had eight pairs of wings.</p><p></p><p>"A ninth-stage defensive secret treasure?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up slightly. This was a good item, its value not inferior to that spatial secret treasure. It was a weapon painstakingly refined by a ninth-stage powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Solante was under great pressure. "I have an eight-winged aptitude, one of the ten strongest eighth-stages of the current generation in the Tianyu Clan. I have mastered three bloodline talents, and now I even possess a ninth-stage secret treasure. I feel I have the ability to kill an invincible eighth-stage..."</p><p></p><p>Solante's thoughts turned as he gradually regained his confidence.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Galaxy Star Lord was, so what? It's not like his goal was to defeat the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Stall! Just stalling was enough!</p><p></p><p>"Make your move."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise there won't be a chance later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sized up Solante and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Taking the initiative to let the other party attack was not because Lin Yuan was arrogant, but because he wanted to witness the techniques the other party had mastered and see if he could incorporate them into his own martial dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Growing stronger with each battle, this described someone with a heaven-defying comprehension ability like Lin Yuan. Even enemies could be turned into nourishment for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Solante's mind moved slightly. With him at the center, endless lightning appeared in all directions for millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the lightning was extremely fast, penetrating layers of space, vast and mighty. Most of the lightning formed a lightning defensive barrier around his body.</p><p></p><p>A small portion of the lightning then blasted towards the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>With the previous six-winged elder's...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Solante focused most of his energy on defense, not expecting his attacks to affect the Galaxy Master, heeding the warning from the nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Not a bad way to use the Thunder Rule." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Rule, although not a pillar rule, was extremely adept at killing power.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>The two were locked in a stalemate. Although Lin Yuan had the upper hand, judging from the collision, it was clear that he would not be able to take down Solante in a short time.</p><p></p><p>With the nine-stage defensive treasure, the Galaxy Master's attacks could not cause any damage to Solante.</p><p></p><p>"I, I'm holding back the Galaxy Master?" </p><p></p><p>Solante was overjoyed and worked even harder.</p><p></p><p>"Finally restricted the Galaxy Master." The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan was also paying attention. "But with the growth rate of this Galaxy Master, he will definitely become a major problem for our clan in the future."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan had a gloomy look in his eyes. The current Galaxy Master already had the ability to determine the situation on a medium-sized battlefield. </p><p></p><p>In the future, when he fully grew up, wouldn't he be able to influence a large battlefield?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, he is indeed one of the top ten eight-stage geniuses of our clan. No matter how strong that Galaxy Master is, what can he do?"</p><p></p><p>"But the Galaxy Master is still too strong, pressuring Solante. If it weren't for that nine-stage treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, at least we don't have to face the Galaxy Master directly now."</p><p></p><p>The eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan breathed a sigh of relief and started chatting with each other.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p></p><p>After tangling with Solante for a while, Lin Yuan finally crushed his soul with a slightly superior soul attack.</p><p></p><p>"Nine-stage defensive treasure."</p><p></p><p>With Solante's death, that nine-stage defensive treasure naturally fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this Galaxy Master to be good at soul attacks too."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan looked pensive, then contacted the clan, "Balaha, you have a nine-stage soul defense treasure. Come to the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Balaha was also one of the ten strongest eight-stage lives of the Tianyu Clan in the current era. In terms of frontal combat power, he was even slightly stronger than Solante.</p><p></p><p>Since even Solante could hold back the Galaxy Master for so long, Balaha, equipped with a nine-stage soul defense treasure and specifically targeting the Galaxy Master, should be able to completely entangle him.</p><p></p><p>Buying a lot of time for the Tianyu Clan's war effort.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master."</p><p></p><p>Balaha had a sturdy figure, completely different from the usually slender Tianyu clansmen, but the aura he exuded was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"I have a nine-stage soul defense treasure. Your soul attacks are useless against me."</p><p></p><p>More than half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>After a long battle with Balaha, Lin Yuan finally crushed him on the physical level.</p><p></p><p>With Balaha's death, the nine-stage soul defense treasure on his body also fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master's physical attacks are also terrifying?" The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Jiamo, you take..."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan continued to contact the clan, mobilizing another eight-stage life from the ten great geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two or three hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Six of the Tianyu Clan's ten great geniuses had already died at Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>These six eight-stage invincible Tianyu geniuses basically all held nine-stage treasures specifically targeting the Galaxy Master, and in the end they all died at the hands of the Galaxy Master with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Each time, the eight-stage Tianyu genius holding a nine-stage treasure died at the hands of the Galaxy Master by a narrow margin.</p><p></p><p>If it only happened once or twice, it might be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>But this situation has occurred six times in a row?</p><p></p><p>"This Galaxy Master? Is he deliberately hiding his strength?"</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"In order to trick our clan's nine-stage treasures? How shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Anger welled up in the heart of the nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan. In terms of the overall foundation of the Tianyu Clan, seven or eight nine-stage treasures were not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>But for individuals, even for a nine-stage powerhouse like him, seven or eight nine-stage treasures exceeded his entire fortune.</p><p></p><p>And now, these treasures and wealth that would make ordinary nine-stage powerhouses jealous had all been given to the Galaxy Master by him?</p><p></p><p>"No need to send anyone else to entangle the Galaxy Master. Abandon battlefield B0001 and retreat with all your might." At this moment, a voice rang in the ears of the nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Our clan's think tank..." The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The voice he heard came from a member of the Tianyu Clan's think tank.</p><p></p><p>For the think tank to make such a decision, there was only one possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan looked at the Galaxy Master again.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the war, the Tianyu Clan's think tank predicted an 80% chance of winning this war.</p><p></p><p>But now, retreating directly was equivalent to believing that defeat was certain.</p><p></p><p>The only difference in between was that the Galaxy Master had joined the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"All retreat."</p><p></p><p>The nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan immediately began relaying his orders.</p><p></p><p>On a medium-sized battlefield, nine-stage powerhouses were not allowed to interfere with the war, but the non-interference here meant no direct interference, no personal involvement.</p><p></p><p>Simply issuing a retreat order was still within the scope allowed by the rules.</p><p></p><p>The many eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan on the battlefield watched helplessly as one genius of their clan after another died at the hands of the Galaxy Master after a struggle, and feelings of unwillingness welled up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"If we had one more nine-stage treasure, we should be able to hold out a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I can see that the Galaxy Master is having a hard time dealing with it."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, we're just a little short."</p><p></p><p>The eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan whispered to each other, expressing their opinions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly--</p><p></p><p>An icy voice rang in the ears of all the eight-stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>"All retreat!"</p><p></p><p>This order immediately caused the expressions of the eight-stage invincibles to change greatly.</p><p></p><p>They recognized the owner of this voice, coming from the nine-stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Clan presiding over this war!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat."</p><p></p><p>"We're all retreating?"</p><p></p><p>"Our clan thinks there's no hope of winning?"</p><p></p><p>Although the eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan were puzzled, following orders on the battlefield was an iron rule, especially orders from a nine-stage powerhouse of the same clan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waited for a moment, but did not wait for the next Tianyu Clan powerhouse holding a nine-stage treasure to arrive.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also noticed the eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan beginning to retreat frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"They discovered it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed in his heart. Ever since the Tianyu Clan sent the second clansman holding a nine-stage treasure.</p><p></p><p>An idea was born in Lin Yuan's mind, which was to deliberately suppress his strength and induce the Tianyu Clan to believe that there was hope of holding him back.</p><p></p><p>Thus sending out one powerhouse after another holding nine-stage treasures.</p><p></p><p>Just pretending for a while, wasting more than half an hour, he could gain a nine-stage treasure worth hundreds of thousands of universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>This deal was too good.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The reaction on the Tianyu Clan's side was very quick.</p><p></p><p>Realizing something was wrong, they directly gave up the war and ordered all eight-stage invincibles to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the many eight-stage invincibles of the Tianyu Clan who were frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll start a massacre!"</p>

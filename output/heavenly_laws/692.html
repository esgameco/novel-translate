        <h1>Chapter 692</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Time is the peak of the 13th Realm, a stage where the life of time begins to converge its own timeline, attempting to unify the past, present, and future.</p><p></p><p>This is in order to break through to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>Even the mightiest of the Six Progenitors of the First Source World, the Great Progenitor, is far from the level of the Lord of Time.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan studied and comprehended the Rune Dao passed down by the Lord of Light, the latter's description of the essence of runes far exceeded anything Lin Yuan had ever seen in the 13th Realm lineages.</p><p></p><p>This is why there is the speculation that the Lord of Light is a Lord of Time.</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible that he is just a powerful time life-form."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his thoughts. His current realm is still too low, not even reaching the 13th Realm, so he cannot truly judge whether the Lord of Light is a Lord of Time or not.</p><p></p><p>"These Rune Dao lineages have been of great help to me."</p><p></p><p>After spending several days thoroughly comprehending the various lineages within the stone statue, especially those related to the Rune Dao, a smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Particularly the Rune lineages originating from the Eternal Lords allowed Lin Yuan to clearly see the essence of the Rune Dao, with the Lord of Light's ultimate pursuit of the Rune Dao being omnipotence.</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords also had their own unique pursuits of the Rune Dao, allowing Lin Yuan to vaguely sense the methods of each Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Still not enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the stone statue before him, still feeling unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>The lineages passed down by the Eternal Lords are so precious, even the peak of the Second Realm of Carefree, 'Lihong', only obtained a portion, let alone more?</p><p></p><p>"Continue to excavate the ruins of other sects and forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, feeling that the direction he had chosen was correct.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, before he could completely open up the Boundless Eternal Sand World, he would not easily venture to the central heavens and have any contact with the Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>However, the various lineages left behind by the Eternal Lords can be obtained in the ruins of many sects, even if not comprehensive, it would be sufficient for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The lineages of the Eternal Lords obtained by the Supreme Saint Sect-level forces should be even more."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the existence capable of establishing the Supreme Saint Sect are all at the Third Realm of Carefree, such powerful experts would naturally have extensive connections with the Eternal Sects, making it too difficult for him to break through to the Third Realm of Carefree on his own.</p><p></p><p>With connections to the Eternal Sects, the lineages related to the Eternal Lords would naturally be more abundant.</p><p></p><p>"Even for a Supreme Saint Sect-level force, if targeted by a certain Source Demon, it would be difficult to escape unscathed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself, through 'Lihong', he was very clear about the power of the Source Demons, entities at least on par with the Abyss Dragons.</p><p></p><p>If he did not undergo a thousand years of cultivation, even Lin Yuan would not be fully confident in subduing them.</p><p></p><p>In the First Source World, in the capital of the Blazing Sun Nation, the Silver River Palace.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi and the other disciples Lin Yuan had taken in came to seek an audience as usual.</p><p></p><p>This was a rule Lin Yuan had set, that every so often, the disciples could inquire about their martial cultivation difficulties.</p><p></p><p>"Master." The disciples greeted respectfully, looking at the young man sitting cross-legged, with countless runes interweaving and colliding, vaguely outlining a vast world. Although the rune level was too high for the disciples to fully comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could not understand or see the full picture, the disciples felt that each rune contained boundless profundity, as if embodying the essential nature of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The countless runes before Master, even a single one of them gives me a feeling of far surpassing those Supreme Grandmasters, what exactly are these runes?" The disciples were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They could sense that each rune was casually condensed by Lin Yuan, with thousands upon thousands of runes constantly interweaving and colliding.</p><p></p><p>"They say Master is the undisputed number one expert among the Six Ancient Nations, even the Six Progenitors look at him with special regard and attach great importance to him. For us to be able to join Master's faction is truly a tremendous blessing."</p><p></p><p>The disciples silently thought to this. The longer they served under Lin Yuan, the more they realized the true weight of the title "Silver River Celestial Lord", an existence that even the Progenitors would bow and pay respect to.</p><p></p><p>Among the Six Ancient Nations, the Progenitors were the supreme existences. From the establishment of the Great Abyss Nation, there had not been any Celestial Lord capable of garnering such attention from the Progenitors, even the Second and Third Progenitors who were still at the Celestial Lord realm did not receive as much focus from the Great Abyss Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>"Back then in the Thousand Fang Domain, I still felt that I might burden Master, worried that Master would not be able to withstand the retaliation of the Thousand Fang King."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi thought to himself, but now it seems that in the face of Master, the Thousand Fang Domain is nothing? Even the Emperor of the Great Spirit Nation would have to be respectful and reverent before Master.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any doubts regarding your cultivation, just speak up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan dispersed the runes before him and looked at the disciples.</p><p></p><p>These disciples were the ones Lin Yuan had selected from his travels across the Six Ancient Nations, possessing the most suitable aptitude and potential for martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan breaks through to the 13th Realm, many trivial matters will need to be handled by them, so he would take the time to guide them periodically.</p><p></p><p>This is crucial for the future...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For a long period of time, Lin Yuan naturally needed to cultivate the reputation of the martial dao practitioners.</p><p></p><p>"Master, time flows like water, but how does it flow and where does it flow to?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shi was the first to ask, as a being with the talent of the martial dao of time, Lin Yuan valued Meng Shi highly, as this talent was no less than the extraordinary life forms with the rich bloodline of time in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating to the perfect 12th stage, one could vaguely sense the many possible scenes of the future.</p><p></p><p>"Time." Lin Yuan pondered for a while, his thoughts stirring, and a talisman symbol converged.</p><p></p><p>This talisman symbol was the 'time' character from the second source world, extremely complex, but after fully condensing, it flowed like a meandering river of time.</p><p></p><p>The talisman dao of the second source world was to replicate everything in the world with talisman symbols, including the rules.</p><p></p><p>"This?" Meng Shi stared at the talisman in front of Lin Yuan, feeling that this talisman seemed alive, and he truly saw the vast Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your guidance." Meng Shi watched in fascination for a while, then solemnly bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Dao in the morning and dying in the evening would be enough, let alone he was not just hearing the Dao, but seeing the Dao. The 'time' talisman casually condensed by Lin Yuan was the great Dao in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples were also observing the 'time' talisman, even though they had not walked the path of time, but observing this talisman that embodied the essence of the great Dao was also immensely beneficial to them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I..." Quickly, the second and third disciples stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then one by one resolved their doubts, and finally condensed the corresponding talismans.</p><p></p><p>The talisman inheritance of the second source world, the replication of the great Dao, was absolutely inconceivable, able to greatly reduce the cultivation threshold, and the talismans condensed by Lin Yuan even more so, exhausting the essence of the rules.</p><p></p><p>The second source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's sun divine soul quickly swept past in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"I have already suppressed thirty-six great demons, and had my incarnations send them to my lord, as for the remnants of the sect forces, I have also discovered the ruins of a Saint Sect-level force, but this Saint Sect-level ruin is not as good as the 'Lihong' Saint Sect, and is not too helpful to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, and then looked further away, "Now let's start exploring further."</p><p></p><p>This source world was boundless, and according to the 'map' of the Qingyan Saint Sect, the location Lin Yuan was currently in was equivalent to a corner near the edge of this world.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the 'demonic' disaster in this source world is more beneficial than harmful to me, at least there is no attention from the Eternal Lords." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If there was no 'demonic' disaster, it could be foreseen that with Lin Yuan's continuous growth and the continuous accumulation of talisman inheritances, it would inevitably attract the attention of the Eternal Sects and even the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords, as time life forms, could observe many future timelines, but with the existence of the Heavenly Light Lord, a time life form that was unfathomable, they might not be as enthusiastic towards Lin Yuan as the ancestors of the Six Ancient Nations.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the ancestors of the Six Ancient Nations were so enthusiastic was that they saw the inevitability of Lin Yuan's future timeline.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly Light Lord? If this time lord was truly a time overlord, with enough and far-reaching timelines observed, perhaps he could see the timeline where Lin Yuan could not cross the 13th stage.</p><p></p><p>And then take action to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a possibility.</p><p></p><p>But it was Lin Yuan's concern, and before crossing the 13th stage, he was not too willing to deal with too powerful time life forms.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan suddenly stopped and looked down at a valley, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt the presence of talisman fluctuations in the valley, "Another sect ruin?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted in his heart, as sect force ruins were like free gifts to him, no matter how weak the sect, they would still be helpful to Lin Yuan, just not very much.</p><p></p><p>"Go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not enter the valley, but approached it carefully to observe.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan approached the valley to a certain range.</p><p></p><p>Talisman symbols instantly permeated the surroundings, and a cold and indifferent golden figure condensed at the high ground of the valley.</p><p></p><p>"This?" Lin Yuan's expression became alert, the talisman symbols permeating the surroundings gave him a sense of far exceeding the talisman inheritance left by the 'Lihong', to be able to do this, the sect ruin in this valley was at least at the level of a Supreme Saint Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have come, you are also a cultivator, the test has begun, our sect's inheritance is special, you can only comprehend it by passing the test." </p><p></p><p>The cold and indifferent golden figure overlooking Lin Yuan spoke in a flat tone, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he tried to move Lin Yuan into the test space.</p><p></p><p>Hum--</p><p></p><p>An invisible fluctuation enveloped Lin Yuan, trying to pull him into a certain space.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>The golden figure frowned slightly, finding that he could not pull Lin Yuan in at all.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 624</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man spoke in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>He did not exude any oppressive aura.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuanqing had not clearly felt the complete disappearance of the two supreme saints, Huanxiao and Yulian, he might have thought the other party was just an ordinary life form.</p><p></p><p>"Perish?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about the last sentence Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Before I perish?</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about that later."</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man waved his hand, and the space around the two of them changed, bringing them to the front of a palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his eyes around and immediately noticed the two ancient symbols at the top of the palace.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know what the symbols meant, he understood it the moment he saw them.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Xuanhuang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, on the beast skin map, the Xuanhuang Palace was the second most important place after the Mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>However, the description of the Xuanhuang Palace on the beast skin map was that it existed in the depths of space-time and was difficult to find.</p><p></p><p>Following the burly and mighty man, Lin Yuan entered the Xuanhuang Palace and stopped in front of a jade table.</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man took the initiative to sit on one side, smiling at Lin Yuan, "Please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was extremely obedient.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the burly and mighty man in front of him was the strongest life form Lin Yuan had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Chaotic Void or the source world where the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was located, he was the strongest life form below the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>He could kill the supreme saints with a single thought, completely destroying any means of survival.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that if the burly and mighty man had the intention to kill him, all the traces he had left in this Chaotic Void would be forcibly erased.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose you already know who I am," the burly and mighty man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The moment the burly and mighty man appeared, the primal essence of the Xuanhuang Universe converged as one.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Xuanhuang Emperor who personally created this subsequent universe, perhaps no one else could have done it.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Supreme Saint Huanxiao and the Supreme Saint Yulian also recognized the identity of the burly and mighty man. These two supreme saints did not dare to resist at all, and simply turned and ran. But in the end, they still could not escape.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha," the burly and mighty man laughed. "In the era I was in, in terms of innate talent and growth speed, even the wondrous life forms nurtured by the Chaotic Void were far inferior to me."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the burly and mighty man looked at Lin Yuan and sighed slightly, "But compared to you, I'm quite ordinary."</p><p></p><p>The moment he returned to the Xuanhuang Universe, all the events that had occurred in this subsequent universe over the past tens of millions of universes poured into the burly and mighty man's mind.</p><p></p><p>And with the burly and mighty man's current state, he could see many secrets about Lin Yuan, such as the fact that his life level was still at the Sovereign Realm, and the cosmic essence within his body was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is not ordinary at all," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>To be able to casually kill two supreme saints, even Lin Yuan, after breaking through to the Chaotic Realm, was not sure if he could do it. The Chaotic Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate he had evolved was not yet fully formed, and he did not know its true power.</p><p></p><p>"My current state is special. Although I have not yet entered the Thirteenth Realm, I have surpassed the Twelfth Realm, so I was able to completely destroy the supreme saints, which is normally impossible," the burly and mighty man smiled. "And when I was at the Sovereign Realm, I could only flee in panic even when facing ordinary Venerable Ones."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened obediently.</p><p></p><p>The implication of the burly and mighty man's words was that when he was at the Sovereign Realm, he could at least survive in the presence of Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>This was already quite remarkable, after all, Lin Yuan's comprehension was extraordinary, and he had descended into many dimensional worlds, and even cultivated a Thirteenth Realm legacy, which was barely enough to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>For other life forms, this was almost impossible to replicate.</p><p></p><p>"Special state?" Lin Yuan looked at the burly and mighty man.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the burly and mighty man said. "You should know that I have long since been trying to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, but have fallen into a time loop."</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man continued, "But now, I have broken free from the time loop, but this is not a normal breakthrough, but a forcible escape. It is destined to not last long, and I will soon perish."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that the All-Seeing Eye had once told him that the Twelfth Realm Perfected Ones trapped in time loops could forcibly break free, as long as they left an anchor point in the outside world and activated it at a certain point in time.</p><p></p><p>Then the Twelfth Realm Perfected Ones trapped in the time loop could lock onto the anchor point and forcibly break free.</p><p></p><p>However, almost no Twelfth Realm Perfected Ones would do this.</p><p></p><p>First, the difficulty was too high. The time loop was isolated from the Chaotic Void, and it was not as simple as having an anchor point in the outside world to break free. It required the strength to shake the time loop world.</p><p></p><p>And generally, Twelfth Realm Perfected Ones with this kind of strength would still have the hope of breaking through the time loop, and would not need to forcibly break free.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, forcibly breaking free from the time loop violated the highest rules of the operation of the Chaotic Void. Even if they returned to the Chaotic Void, they would be constantly subjected to backlash from the entire Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Life forms below the Thirteenth Realm would basically be unable to resist for long and would perish completely.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, why did you want to break free from the time loop?" Lin Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the Xuanhuang Pearl given to him by the Mausoleum Spirit was the anchor point placed by the burly and mighty man in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan crushed it, the burly and mighty man trapped in the time loop world could lock onto it and break free.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan could not understand why the burly and mighty man would do this? The Mausoleum Spirit had said that Lin Yuan could crush the Xuanhuang Pearl immediately after obtaining it.</p><p></p><p>But the Mausoleum Spirit itself did not want Lin Yuan to crush it. This was obviously the will of Xuanhuang, while the latter was the Mausoleum Spirit's own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit also knew what it meant to crush the Xuanhuang Pearl.</p><p></p><p>But why did Xuanhuang leave this order? Was it because he knew about the threat of the two supreme saints to Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside how Xuanhuang knew about the events that would happen tens of millions of universes later, even if he did know, there was no need to do this.</p><p></p><p>To completely destroy his own hope of breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm for the sake of a descendant from so many generations later, and to have his own existence erased, was completely illogical.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanhuang lineage was destroyed in the past, countless disciples of the Xuanhuang lineage were hunted down, but Xuanhuang did not break free from the time loop. Why would he do it now, tens of millions of universes later?</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much about it. I chose to forcibly break free from the time loop, not for you, but because..." The burly and mighty man's gaze became evasive, as if he had thought of something, "I don't want to break through the time loop."</p><p></p><p>"Don't want to break through the time loop?" Lin Yuan was stunned. This could be a reason?</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the time loop that has trapped me is not difficult to break through, I just need to forget my Shijie (senior sister)," the burly and mighty man said, his expression fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, "It's just that, to forget my Shijie (senior martial sister)? I don't want to. In the over 30 million years of universal history, I've experienced countless cycles of having my memories erased and starting over, but I still don't want to."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan did not ask who this "Shijie" was.</p><p></p><p>"I forgot to introduce you to my Shijie."</p><p></p><p>The burly, mighty man said, "I was born in a tribe, and lost my parents at a young age. I suffered a lot, and many times I almost starved to death. Starving to death isn't the worst thing - the terrifying part is being eaten as food."</p><p></p><p>"Later, I left the tribe, wanting to go out into the world to find a chance to survive, but not only did I not find that, I was also captured by an evil cultivator who wanted to refine my essence and soul."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the burly man, based on the mural descriptions in the tomb, Xuan Huang should have originated from a certain celestial universe, with a humble background and a harsh environment.</p><p></p><p>"Later, I met my Shijie. But my Shijie was a disciple of the Qingxuan Sect. Hearing about the evil cultivator, she wanted to eliminate evil and protect justice, so she killed that evil cultivator and saved me."</p><p></p><p>The burly man recalled, "I still remember the first words my Shijie said to me when she saw me, 'Little beggar, don't be afraid, that big evil monster is dead, you can live now.'"</p><p></p><p>"I was thinking, if my Shijie had arrived a little later, I probably would have died." The burly man said, "Later, my Shijie took me back to the Qingxuan Sect. After testing, they found that my talent was not bad, so she accepted me as her disciple."</p><p></p><p>"My Shijie is so kind. She didn't look down on my dirtiness, and actively helped me with Jingjin Xisui (a cultivation technique), transforming me from the inside out. She taught me many cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"From that moment on, I vowed that I must repay my Shijie well and never let anyone bully her in this world."</p><p></p><p>"As I continued to cultivate, my talent and aptitude became stronger and stronger, and I soon became the strongest in the Qingxuan Sect, leading the sect to become the mightiest force in that universe."</p><p></p><p>"Later, I also became Shijie's cultivation partner, and that day was the happiest of my life."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I broke through to the 12th Realm, and with my help, Shijie also broke through to the 12th Realm. Together, we weathered the great destruction of the universe and entered the Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>The burly man's tone became cold as he said, "As soon as we entered the Chaotic Void, we encountered a Dominator-realm plunderer. I was no match for him, so Shijie, in order to let me live, burned her soul, essence, and willpower, even her true body and clone, just to barely hold back that plunderer."</p><p></p><p>The burly man had a melancholic expression: "Although I survived, Shijie died."</p><p></p><p>"I inquired and found that 12th Realm beings have already broken free from the constraints of the river of time, and the only way to revive her is to become a 13th Realm time-based life form."</p><p></p><p>"So I began to aim for becoming a time-based life form. Ironically, at the time I was only at the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm, not even the Chaotic Realm, yet I dared to dream of becoming a time-based life form?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"But after entering the Chaotic Void, I found that my bloodline and constitution were very special. Nurtured by the Chaotic Void environment, my true potential was fully unleashed, so I became stronger and stronger, easily reaching the Dominator, Venerable, and Great Saint realms."</p><p></p><p>"After perfecting the Chaotic Realm, I established the Xuanhuang lineage, opened the Xuanhuang Dominion, and slaughtered all the plunderers within my domain, also to avenge my Shijie, but unfortunately, the plunderer we encountered back then had already died."</p><p></p><p>The burly man smiled lightly, "Becoming an unparalleled Great Saint, I then considered how to break through to the 13th Realm. I visited many special existences in the Chaotic Void at the time."</p><p></p><p>"Those special existences said my heart demon was too heavy, and Shijie's influence on me was too great. In this situation, the time loop I would experience would be very difficult to overcome."</p><p></p><p>The burly man sneered, "But those special existences were born powerful and lofty. How could they understand my experiences? If it weren't for Shijie, I would have died long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Shijie has never been my heart demon, but the only reason for my growth."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. Many lofty and extraordinary existences were indifferent in their emotions, completely selfish.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that although I don't think of Shijie as a heart demon, I'm also aware that given Shijie's status in my heart, the time loop I'll experience in breaking through to the 13th Realm will likely be related to her."</p><p></p><p>"Later, I accidentally entered a dimensional rift, where I obtained a precious treasure. This treasure is difficult for me to suppress with just my own strength, so I can only rely on the power of the time loop to conceal it."</p><p></p><p>"By that time, my realm and strength had already reached the pinnacle, and I already had the power of an undefeatable Great Saint, even though I hadn't yet gained the recognition of other Great Saints. But I didn't want to wait any longer, so using this treasure, the possibility of breaking through the time loop would be greater."</p><p></p><p>"The longer I wait, the more likely it is that the news of this treasure will leak out. Then the other Great Saints will stop at nothing to seize it, and it may even attract the attention of true time-based life forms."</p><p></p><p>The burly man looked at Lin Yuan: "Before breaking through to the 13th Realm, I left many arrangements, including that Xuanhuang Pearl, which contains a trace of the aura of that treasure. Once it is crushed, the aura will resonate with the main body of the treasure, which I have already brought into the time loop world. Any changes, I will know, and then I can use it as an anchor to forcibly break free from the time loop."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I also thought that if I still hadn't broken through the time loop after 30 million universal cycles, I probably wouldn't have the chance to reach the 13th Realm, so I left the order to crush the Xuanhuang Pearl after that time."</p><p></p><p>"And crushing the Xuanhuang Pearl is just a 'reminder' to me. Whether to ultimately break free from the time loop or not, it still depends on me."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan responded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"As for the time loop I've experienced... To break through normally, the only way is to completely forget Shijie. You say, isn't it interesting? I want to revive Shijie by breaking through to the 13th Realm, but the prerequisite is to forget Shijie?"</p><p></p><p>"If I forget Shijie, what's the meaning of breaking through to the 13th Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"If I truly forget Shijie, would I still be me?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man sneered, "In the time loop, I've been repeatedly having my memories erased and starting over countless times, but I've never chosen to forget Shijie. It wasn't until you crushed the Xuanhuang Pearl that I was able to forcibly break free."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the burly man, his thoughts surging.</p><p></p><p>The information the Demon Jade Pavilion Master gave him about time loops was that any 12th Realm cultivator who fell into a time loop would face a trial they had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>But the time loop Xuanhuang experienced required him to forget his own Shijie?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that this "forgetting" meant completely erasing the feelings for his Shijie. Even if he later recalled the memories and revived his Shijie, he would permanently lose that pure, original emotion, and would not even bother to revive her.</p><p></p><p>"During that time loop, without Shijie, there was no hope of breaking through, so I was very bored. Now that I'm out, it's much better."</p><p></p><p>The burly man looked at Lin Yuan and raised his right hand, a faint, hazy glow appearing.</p><p></p><p>"Before my demise, I'll give you this treasure I obtained from the dimensional rift."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

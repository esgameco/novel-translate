        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 333 Martial Path Ranking (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"But of these 200 million merit points, one hundred million is actually provided by the Bloodline Cultivation Path?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a bit surprised. The Ninth Realm Martial Path Scripture being worth 100 million merit points was still beyond his expectations, but within a reasonable range.</p><p></p><p>However, the Bloodline Cultivation Path? This cultivation method is limited by the bloodline realm, and one can only cultivate up to the seventh realm, unable to open an inner world through self-cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Yet it has the same value as the Ninth Realm Martial Path Scripture?</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of its universality?" Lin Yuan pondered inwardly. The Ninth Realm Martial Path Scripture targets the masses - the evolutionary cultivators of the martial path system who must cultivate to the ninth realm for it to be useful.</p><p></p><p>Ninth realm evolutionary cultivators? The entire human civilization has so few ninth realm evolutionary cultivators. Although there are many in the Xuan Huang Secret Territory, that includes all the lifeforms across the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>Among the top peak races, powerful races, and other special lifeforms and solitary practitioners, when dispersed into individual races, ninth realm evolutionary cultivators are rare. Even across the entire universe, there are only some.</p><p></p><p>Just some, with the total number still limited.</p><p></p><p>But the Bloodline Cultivation Path, said to be a branch of the martial path evolutionary system, can actually be completely separated from it.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Body Cultivation lineage in the Central Plains, not only can disciples of virtuous and immortal sects practice it, even demonic or evil cultivators can try the body cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Even with such broad universality, it shouldn't be worth 100 million," Lin Yuan was still puzzled, as the Bloodline Cultivation Path was not his original creation.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization had bloodline evolution families long ago. It's just that Lin Yuan's summarization of the Bloodline Cultivation Path was more complete in terms of refining and applying bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>One hundred million merit points - that's almost the total merit points needed for two eighth-level citizens. The number of eighth-level citizens in human civilization is even rarer than ninth realm evolutionary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It must be influenced by other factors," Lin Yuan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He did not know that in the original judgment of the three goddesses, the Bloodline Cultivation Path was only worth 50 million merit points. It was forcefully raised to 100 million by a few paramount experts to facilitate Lin Yuan's growth.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan is a human evolutionary cultivator, giving him a bit more is no big loss.</p><p></p><p>"My current total merit points is 208 million?" Lin Yuan felt delighted. Of that, 200 million were just obtained.</p><p></p><p>The remaining 8 million consisted of 3 million left over from when he advanced to the eighth-level citizen last time, and 5 million from killing the ninth realm alien avatars in the Xuan Huang Secret Territory.</p><p></p><p>Although he only killed avatars, they were avatars of ninth realm aliens, no less valuable than thoroughly killing an eighth realm alien. Moreover, one of them was the special ninth realm being Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that after I killed Hunyi, those hostile ninth realm aliens of the human civilization abandoned the opportunities in the Xuan Huang Secret Territory and hid in some corner."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Huang Secret Territory is vast and boundless, far more expansive than the Divine Realm by many times over, containing far more than tens of billions of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>If those ninth realm aliens are determined to hide, unless Lin Yuan conducts a comprehensive search, it will be very difficult to find them.</p><p></p><p>But a comprehensive search would be too time-consuming. Even if Lin Yuan opened over 20 billion spatial layers and searched at full effort during the 100-year period the Xuan Huang Secret Territory is open, at most he could only cover one ten-millionth of the territory.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, finding the source of that calling sensation is more important."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shifted his perspective to the Xuan Huang Secret Territory, where his Sun Primordial Mind was rapidly advancing towards the core area.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, it caused great disturbances, occasionally attracting the native lifeforms of the secret territory and dealing with them while harvesting "Xuan Huang Crystals."</p><p></p><p>Now, apart from the human civilization's evolutionary cultivators and the experts following the human civilization, basically no ninth realm expert dared to approach Lin Yuan due to his overwhelming might.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let me check the current ranking of the martial path evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>A thought stirred in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>When the martial path evolutionary path was still at the eighth realm, it was already ranked first in the Chihuo Star Domain evolution ranking and first in the Annan Star Alliance evolution ranking, suppressing all other ninth realm evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>It dominated the Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now that the martial path evolutionary path has reached the ninth realm, with just the Ninth Realm Martial Path Scripture valued at 100 million merit points by the three goddesses, plus the Bloodline Cultivation Path as a branch.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very eager to see the true current ranking of the martial path evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Cangluan Star first, Chihuo Star Domain first, Annan Star Alliance first...Southern Star Region fifty-third?" Lin Yuan scanned the latest ranking information of the martial path evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty-third in the Southern Star Region evolution ranking?" A virtual screen appeared before Lin Yuan, displaying the Southern Star Region evolution ranking from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Star Region is one of the five major star regions of human civilization. Measured in light-years, countless evolutionary scholars, ninth realm evolutionary cultivators, tenth realm evolutionary cultivators, and even eleventh realm evolutionary cultivators have emerged throughout its history.</p><p></p><p>Any evolutionary path listed in the Southern Star Region evolution ranking is undoubtedly among the most paramount evolutionary paths of humanity, with immeasurable depth and influence. Previously, the eighth realm martial path evolutionary path didn't even qualify for the Southern Star Region evolution ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Some eleventh realm evolutionary paths are ranked below the martial path evolutionary path?" Lin Yuan scanned it, inwardly marveling.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated the true potential of the current martial path evolutionary path. For it to surpass eleventh realm evolutionary paths in the ranking is truly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Those are eleventh realm evolutionary paths, with the hope of stably cultivating to the eleventh realm. Even if their ascension potential is zero, they have already reached the pinnacle that countless other evolutionary paths strive for.</p><p></p><p>"It seems in the judgment of the three goddesses, the martial path evolutionary path has the potential to evolve into a paramount evolutionary path," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Only then could the ranking of the martial path evolutionary path be explained.</p><p></p><p>Among the eleventh realm evolutionary paths currently mastered by human civilization, many have exhausted their potential and have no hope of ever touching paramount evolutionary paths. This is the only possibility for the martial path evolutionary path to surpass them.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount evolutionary path," Lin Yuan's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>This is the aspiration of countless lifeforms. Just look at the large alien battlefield from decades ago - when the corpse of a paramount being drifted in through a spatial rift, it caused numerous paramount beings in the main universe to fight over it.</p><p></p><p>This alone shows the preciousness of paramount evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>And that was just speculation that the deceased paramount being's body might contain a paramount evolutionary path. For just that possibility, it caused the insect race to take such a huge risk.</p><p></p><p>"Humans..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued looking at the last ranking list, the "Civilization Evolution Rankings".</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Evolution Rankings was the most authoritative list, recording the hundred strongest evolutionary paths in human civilization's history, including the nine strongest supreme evolutionary paths. </p><p></p><p>"Not in the top hundred," Lin Yuan didn't feel too surprised. </p><p></p><p>Even with the Martial Dao evolutionary path's boundless potential, it was ultimately only a ninth-rank evolutionary path. It would be strange for it to make the Human Civilization Evolution Rankings.</p><p></p><p>After uploading the Martial Dao evolutionary path and reaping an astronomical number of merit points, Lin Yuan took out a mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll quickly restore the world within a radius of nearly two billion li," Lin Yuan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Before the ninth interstellar journey, Lin Yuan had only absorbed up to the fifth drop of liquid from the mysterious gourd, with the world inside only about 1.6 billion li in size.</p><p></p><p>But now, the world inside was approaching a radius of two billion li. </p><p></p><p>Although it seemed like just an increase of over 300 million li, when combined with the more than 20 billion space layers, one could sense the terrifying magnitude of growth.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, each space layer within the inner world was no smaller than the main space. An increase of over 300 million li, multiplied by more than 20 billion...even though the power contained in a single space layer was far inferior to the main space, the sheer number made up for it.</p><p></p><p>"As for the two great spiritual souls' inner worlds, we'll deal with that after the Sun Spiritual Soul returns," Lin Yuan was determined to prioritize restoring his true self's full strength first.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Sun Spiritual Soul recovered its full strength or not didn't make much difference. After all, those who entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm were all ninth-rank experts.</p><p></p><p>Given that the known upper limit of ninth-rank experts' combat strength didn't exceed 10 million, there wasn't much difference between the Sun Spiritual Soul having 100 million or 80 million combat strength.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world of the Annan Star Alliance's central plaza area, more and more cultivators and high-level citizens appeared, gazing at the towering Evolution Rankings pillar and the Martial Dao evolutionary path at the top with awe on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, when the Martial Dao evolutionary path first appeared on the Annan Evolution Rankings, it immediately took the top spot, shocking countless experts.</p><p></p><p>Other evolutionary paths could only climb up the rankings one or two spots at a time with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Dao evolutionary path directly leapt over a hundred ranks to take the first place on the Annan Evolution Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Such an inconceivable rise in the rankings had never occurred since the founding of the Annan Star Alliance - there was no reasonable explanation for it.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this Martial Dao evolutionary path originated from the Chixiong Domain, and it also topped the Chixiong Evolution Rankings at an extremely terrifying speed."</p><p></p><p>"Can the Chixiong Domain even be compared to our Annan Star Alliance? But this Martial Dao evolutionary path is indeed formidable. So many ninth-rank evolutionary paths in our Annan couldn't suppress it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, while you all were still doubting the Martial Dao evolutionary path, I've already had my juniors start cultivating it. With the potential the Martial Dao has shown, it may even ascend to become a ninth-rank supreme evolutionary path in the future."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators and high-level citizens discussed animatedly, their core topic naturally revolving around the Martial Dao evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>After all, this evolutionary path was too dazzling - compared to it, the other evolutionary paths from the same period paled in insignificance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the mysterious evolutionary scholar who created this evolutionary path belonged to human civilization, which was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were an evolutionary scholar, representing the pinnacle of human civilization, while evolutionary scholars represented its depth.</p><p></p><p>Many evolutionary scholars had reached the tenth or eleventh ranks in strength.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when this mysterious evolutionary scholar will update the ninth-rank chapter of the Martial Dao evolutionary path?" a high-level citizen asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"I think it'll be difficult."  </p><p></p><p>"When the sixth, seventh, and eighth-rank chapters hadn't been updated before, many people also thought it would be difficult."</p><p></p><p>"It's different - how could the ninth-rank chapter be the same as the previous chapters?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators and citizens had differing opinions.</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the central plaza, a skinny man sat alone. He was from the Chixiong Domain and had witnessed the rise of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, knowing that this path could not be judged by conventional reasoning.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao evolutionary path...too bad my foundation is set, the cost of switching to cultivate it would be too great," the skinny man said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>He then opened the detailed information overview of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, wanting to look over the contents of the seventh and eighth-rank chapters again.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't cultivate the Martial Dao path, he had purchased the first through eighth-rank chapters.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't take the Martial Dao as his core path, there was no problem with cultivating it as a supplementary path.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" </p><p></p><p>As the skinny man opened the Martial Dao evolutionary path details and refreshed it, his expression froze.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw that after the original eighth-rank chapter, three new words had appeared:</p><p></p><p>Ninth-Rank Chapter.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao evolutionary path updated its ninth-rank chapter?" The skinny man was greatly shocked. He looked around - most people were still arguing, while a few cultivators had expressions of surprise, likely having noticed the new ninth-rank chapter.</p><p></p><p>"A ninth-rank supreme evolutionary path." The skinny man's thoughts surged. After updating the ninth-rank chapter, the Martial Dao evolutionary path would officially join the ranks of ninth-rank supreme paths.</p><p></p><p>"Still first on the Annan Evolution Rankings," the skinny man then looked towards the distant towering Evolution Pillar, seeing the Martial Dao path still at the top.</p><p></p><p>When the Martial Dao was at the eighth rank, it had already topped the Annan rankings. Now with the ninth-rank update, the Annan rankings couldn't display the path's increased potential.</p><p></p><p>"The Southern Star Region Evolution Rankings," the skinny man opened those rankings with a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>"53rd place?" The skinny man fell silent. The Southern Star Region encompassed who knows how many areas like the Annan Star Alliance. The evolutionary paths recorded on its rankings were at minimum tenth-rank, with the top 90 being eleventh-rank paths.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Martial Dao evolutionary path had directly charged to 53rd place?</p><p></p><p>No matter how highly the skinny man viewed the Martial Dao path, at this moment he wondered if the ranking was an error.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, as time passed, the other cultivators and citizens around also gradually discovered the Martial Dao path's update and its final ranking position.</p>

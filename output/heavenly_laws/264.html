            <p>Chapter 264: The Long Three Hundred Years 2 (The title of the previous chapter was wrong, but the content is unaffected)</p><p></p><p>"This is actually a kind of cosmic power?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan repeatedly observed and finally came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The innate purple qi mastered by the old man in purple robes, if placed in the main world, would be a cosmic power that only an invincible Eighth Stage could master.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell silent for a moment, suddenly realizing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Crossing Tribulation Immortal Kings of the Spirit Realm, without the support of an inner world, could rival the Eighth Stage evolvers of the main world.</p><p></p><p>The world power extended from the inner worlds of Eighth Stage evolvers allowed human evolvers to catch up to those innately powerful special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Very few powers of the same level could compare to the amplification effect of world power on evolvers.</p><p></p><p>But cosmic power was definitely one of them.</p><p></p><p>The combat power boost caused by cosmic power was even above that of world power.</p><p></p><p>The innate purple qi mastered by the old man in purple robes only grasped a portion of its power. Once fully mastered, even without world power, one could be on par with peak Eighth Stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Those supreme Immortal Kings, without inner worlds, can rival invincible Eighth Stage. The Dao-forming power they grasp definitely belongs to high-grade cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The invincible Eighth Stage of the main world also had varying strengths. Although the strongest could not defeat the weakest, they could still suppress them. The difference lay in the different cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Some cosmic powers were simply stronger than others, and the former were called high-grade cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"This is the biggest opportunity brought by my eighth crossing!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone brightly. What was the greatest help brought to him by the eighth crossing?</p><p></p><p>Establishing the Eighth Stage of the Martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Stage could be established and perfected anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even without experiencing the crossing, given time, Lin Yuan could still establish it in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the spatial rule model? </p><p></p><p>It was not much different from establishing the Eighth Stage of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>It did not require the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before knowing that the Dao-forming power grasped by the Immortal Kings was equivalent to cosmic power,</p><p></p><p>the greatest help the crossing to the Spirit Realm brought Lin Yuan was saving time, as well as learning from the immortal cultivation system and other cultivation systems.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>after determining the essence of Dao-forming power,</p><p></p><p>it was an irreplaceable gain.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky of the main world, each kind of cosmic power was unique and could not be replicated or simulated.</p><p></p><p>As long as a powerhouse comprehended a certain cosmic power, subsequent lifeforms would be unable to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>This came from the rules of the main world.</p><p></p><p>The "rules" here did not refer to the rules of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, thunder, light, etc.</p><p></p><p>But the "restrictions" from the main world.</p><p></p><p>For example, under the Supremes, all lifeforms had a lifespan limit.</p><p></p><p>This was also a rule of the main world.</p><p></p><p>Another example was that in the cosmic starry sky, the fastest speed was the speed of light. Once exceeding the speed of light, one would enter a wormhole.</p><p></p><p>This was also a rule of the main world.</p><p></p><p>"The 'restrictions' of the main world do not apply in the Spirit Realm. At least for cosmic powers, the Spirit Realm is much more lenient. There is no saying that a certain Dao-forming power can only be mastered by one Crossing Tribulation Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was slightly excited. This meant that in the Spirit Realm, he could fully comprehend a large number of Dao-forming powers.</p><p></p><p>Then, upon returning to the main world, these Dao-forming powers would collectively transform into cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>In the long history of the myriad races in the cosmic starry sky of the main world, many invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses had emerged, but the vast majority of them only grasped one kind of cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>An extremely small number, due to various accidents, grasped two kinds of cosmic power, which was already the upper limit.</p><p></p><p>For normal Eighth Stage powerhouses, there were two goals: one was to step into the Ninth Stage, and the other was to grasp a certain cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>But for the invincible Eighth Stage, there was only one goal, which was to break through to the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Only by advancing to the Ninth Stage could their lifespan be extended. As for continuing to comprehend other cosmic powers, let's not talk about whether it was foolish or not. The key was, could they even comprehend it?</p><p></p><p>The comprehension of each cosmic power involved luck, without a fixed direction. How could you determine that the direction you were comprehending would definitely lead to the comprehension of a cosmic power?</p><p></p><p>This was also the key to Lin Yuan's excitement.</p><p></p><p>If he had not discovered the essence of Dao-forming power, even if he knew that the Spirit Realm did not have such great restrictions on cosmic powers,</p><p></p><p>he would not have had any other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending more cosmic powers? You should know that before fully comprehending the rules of the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin, Lin Yuan himself did not know that the power of Taiji would be a cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>Even with a heaven-defying comprehension ability, wanting to comprehend the next cosmic power would still waste a lot of time, causing Lin Yuan's comprehension in other aspects to slow down or even come to a halt.</p><p></p><p>With a clear comprehension of Dao-forming power, Lin Yuan only needed to spend time comprehending and perceiving, just like comprehending evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Fully comprehending a Dao-forming power in the Spirit Realm and returning to the main world would result in a unique cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>"Innate Purple Qi... In the records of human civilization on the many invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses in history, no invincible Eighth Stage has grasped this kind of cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Of course, there might be unrecorded invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses who had grasped the cosmic power of Innate Purple Qi.</p><p></p><p>But the probability was very low, and what Lin Yuan planned to comprehend was definitely not limited to the cosmic power of Innate Purple Qi. He intended to go through all the Dao-forming powers grasped by the other Crossing Tribulation Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>"The explanation of cosmic powers by human civilization is of great help for stepping into the Ninth Stage in the future. Theoretically, the more cosmic powers one grasps, the greater this help will be. But it is not mentioned much because it is ultimately just a theory."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Normal Eighth Stage evolvers, no matter how extraordinarily talented, could at most grasp one kind of cosmic power, or two at most. As for more?</p><p></p><p>It had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>Because it was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>"Fully comprehending a certain Dao-forming power is very difficult for other Immortal Kings. With that time, it is better to deepen the comprehension of the already mastered Dao-forming power. But I have a heaven-defying comprehension ability, it is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>He had already imagined that when he returned to the main world, grasping dozens of cosmic powers, coupled with the amplification of a vast inner world far surpassing the shackles of human evolvers,</p><p></p><p>he might even have the hope of arm wrestling with Ninth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Historically, no matter how powerful an invincible Eighth Stage was, at most they could only preserve their lives in the hands of Ninth Stage powerhouses. As for arm wrestling?</p><p></p><p>That was seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Because the method for invincible Eighth Stage to preserve their lives in front of Ninth Stage powerhouses was to persist for a while without dying and then wait for the rescue of Ninth Stage powerhouses of the same race.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, invincible Eighth Stage had no ability to resist in front of the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Let's fully comprehend this strand of Innate Purple Qi first." Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he began to seriously observe the strand of purple qi in front of him.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious aura, you begin attempting to fully comprehend it.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious aura, you begin attempting to fully comprehend it.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[...observing the mysterious aura and beginning to try to comprehend it.]</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's perception of the primordial purple Qi, this kind of cosmic power was only ordinary cosmic power and could not compare to higher cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Chi power he had mastered should be considered a higher cosmic power, accommodating two extreme rules at the same time, whether for attack or defense, nearly perfect.</p><p></p><p>As an ordinary city in the Xuan Wang Domain, a large number of True Immortal level powerhouses and even Half-step Immortal King level powerhouses have recently come to seek an audience with the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there are traces of a Tribulation Immortal King, it will attract many powerhouses to gather. Whether they can see the Immortal King or not, they will try to get close first.</p><p></p><p>Many True Immortal peak and Half-step Immortal King level powerhouses have been stuck at their current bottleneck for tens of thousands of years, and the significance of closed-door cultivation is not great.</p><p></p><p>Rather than wandering aimlessly, it's better to try to find the traces of an ordinary Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there is no loss. If it can be helpful to oneself, naturally everyone will be happy. If there is no help, it is also within expectations.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>Now in Xiaoyao City, a large number of True Immortals and Half-step Immortal Kings have gathered. Ordinary cultivators walking on the streets may encounter a Half-step Immortal King with a great reputation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these True Immortals and Half-step Immortal Kings keep a very low profile in Xiaoyao City, after all, they are under the eyes of an Immortal King, and no powerhouse dares to make trouble.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Three figures walked out.</p><p></p><p>"So many True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen so many True Immortals in my life."</p><p></p><p>Jun Haiqiu and the other two Jun family juniors opened their eyes wide and looked at the incomparably profound auras inside Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>The Daode Immortal Sect, as one of the three giants in the Xuan Wang Domain, only has dozens of True Immortals stationed, but the True Immortals in Xiaoyao City are estimated to be hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>This does not include those Half-step Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>And as time goes by, more and more True Immortals and Half-step Immortal Kings are rushing to come.</p><p></p><p>"A large domain like the Xuan Wang Domain generally has hundreds of True Immortal level powerhouses, and the Xuan Wang Domain is just one of the thousands of large domains in the Dongyun Daozhou. Wuji Laozu, as an Immortal King, has attracted the attention of True Immortals from dozens to hundreds of Daozhous."</p><p></p><p>"What are hundreds of thousands of True Immortals? The number of True Immortals coming next is estimated to exceed one million."</p><p></p><p>Jun Nangong said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"One million True Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>Jun Yunxun swallowed.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Wuji Laozu, how could we be standing here now?" Jun Haiqiu said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>They came to visit the Martial Ancestor and soon met Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let them stay in the Martial Temple for a while and would point them when he had time.</p><p></p><p>Such treatment could probably make those Half-step Immortal King powerhouses outside jealous.</p><p></p><p>Being able to freely enter and exit the Martial Temple is equivalent to feeling the aura of the Martial Ancestor at close range, which is a great honor. For those Half-step Immortal Kings, staying by the side of an Immortal King is an even greater opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Orange-yellow flames kept burning inside his body.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lin Yuan's physical body began to collapse and turn into ashes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Rebirth by Dripping Blood circulated, and Lin Yuan's physical body recovered at an extreme speed and came back again.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that I have almost completely absorbed the orange-yellow liquid." Lin Yuan closed his eyes slightly, feeling the amplification of his physical body and inner world.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's inner world, compared with a normal eighth-stage evolver, is six and a half times different.</p><p></p><p>Excluding the 3.33 times of the scarlet-red liquid, the orange-yellow liquid's enhancement to Lin Yuan reached 3.2 times.</p><p></p><p>This is already very close to the upper limit of 3.33 times enhancement after completely absorbing the orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>"The third kind of liquid should be coming soon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"However, during the absorption of the first two kinds of liquids, it was also a kind of tempering and improvement for my divine ability 'Rebirth by Dripping Blood'?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The Rebirth by Dripping Blood, as a physical divine ability, can also be strengthened, but the strengthening speed is too slow. However, during the thousands or tens of thousands of times of absorbing the mysterious liquid in the gourd, causing the physical body to collapse and then recover again and again, it can naturally strengthen the 'Rebirth by Dripping Blood' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good thing, saving me from going through it again after returning to the main world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan spent a full hundred years to completely absorb the orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>But with the hundred years of strengthening the physical divine ability 'Rebirth by Dripping Blood', after returning to the main world, Lin Yuan will only need a few days to a dozen days at most to completely absorb the orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan's comprehension of the physical divine ability 'Rebirth by Dripping Blood' has greatly improved, he can persist for a longer time under the burning of the orange-yellow flames, and it will be the same in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Chi Primordial Spirit climbed up and scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had great enthusiasm for finding other Immortal King level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Especially the existence of the Supreme Immortal King level, the Creation Power they mastered might be equivalent to higher cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending a higher cosmic power will help Lin Yuan more than ten times that of comprehending ordinary cosmic powers after entering the ninth stage in the future.</p><p></p><p>Under the condition of limited time, Lin Yuan naturally prioritized comprehending higher cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"This layer of heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan released his perception and began to spread out in all directions as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he discovered the aura of an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly flew towards that Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead.</p><p></p><p>A majestic and towering figure was standing in front, carefully observing a "black hole"-like spectacle in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the majestic and towering figure. This majestic and towering figure had a huge axe on his back. Just sitting there, the aura emanating from the axe seemed to split open Lin Yuan's endless world.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Opening Heaven Immortal King? The Creation Power he mastered is the 'Opening Heaven Power'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit trembled slightly. In the various pieces of information given to him by the purple-robed old man, the killing power of the Opening Heaven Immortal King could rank in the top three among the Supreme Immortal Kings of this era, and the Opening Heaven Power he mastered could almost split open everything.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As if sensing someone watching, the majestic and towering Opening Heaven Immortal King glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Opening Heaven Immortal King." Lin Yuan walked up with a smile.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected a strand of Opening Heaven Power, satisfied and left.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Supreme Immortal Kings, it was not a difficult thing to ask the other party for a strand of Opening Heaven Power to study when showing goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan also gave his Tai Chi Power to the other party in exchange.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Chi Power was a Creation Power that had never appeared in the Spirit Realm before, and the Opening Heaven Immortal King was very curious and readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Tai Chi Primordial Spirit stayed in the Seventh Heaven, studying the Creation Powers of many Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three hundred years passed.</p>

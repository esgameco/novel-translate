        <h1>Chapter 612</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuations, and through comparing the beast skin map, he had made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sky Palace was a crucial location in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, where the Dark Sky Heart was nurtured, a priceless treasure at the Supreme Saint level.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, aside from the nearly 3-meter-tall Life Divine Stone, the many precious treasures he had obtained were all at the level of Chaotic Saints and below.</p><p></p><p>As for Supreme Saints? Even when the Mysterious Yellow lineage still existed, there were not many treasures at the Supreme Saint level, mostly located in the inner and deeper regions of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan had planned routes according to the beast skin map, but he had not considered the Dark Sky Palace as a stopping point.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Dark Sky Palace was surrounded by Dark Sky Force, a power even stronger than the Floating Buddha Force. With Lin Yuan's strength at the time, it would have taken a tremendous amount of effort to enter the Dark Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan had not given it much thought. Compared to the Dark Sky Palace, he was more focused on the deepest burial mound.</p><p></p><p>But that was then, this is now.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the second layer of the "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan's strength had increased exponentially. The Dark Sky Force that could once obstruct him momentarily now posed little threat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to the spatial-temporal fluctuations emanating from the Dark Sky Palace, it had clearly manifested. If Lin Yuan did not go now, it would undoubtedly attract other Saints.</p><p></p><p>Saints like the Black Obsidian Saint and the Dual Source Saint had the strength to enter the Dark Sky Palace, it would just take them more time.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan's Solar Spiritual Consciousness set out, following the pre-planned route towards the depths of the Mysterious Yellow Universe. As for his true body, it immediately began swiftly traveling towards the Dark Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the "Infinite Void" had brought Lin Yuan an all-around enhancement, not just to his true body, but also to his two spiritual consciousnesses. Now, the Solar Spiritual Consciousness' strength even exceeded Lin Yuan's true body when he first entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I really got the Dual Source Saint good."</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Saint's expression darkened as he swiftly headed towards the depths of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>Being the tenth to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe, the Black Obsidian Saint had limited choices, so he could only immediately proceed towards the depths.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he didn't have time to carefully examine things, leading to him having gained nothing so far.</p><p></p><p>As a powerful Chaotic Saint, to have entered a sub-universe without any substantial gains was unacceptable to the Black Obsidian Saint.</p><p></p><p>"That Dual Source fellow is certainly detestable, but if it weren't for that Lin Yuan..."</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Saint thought about Lin Yuan. If not for him, the Black Obsidian Saint would have been at least the third to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, where did he come from?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Saint was furious. Although Lin Yuan's final slap had sent him flying, the Black Obsidian Saint had not sustained any actual injuries.</p><p></p><p>From that strike, the Black Obsidian Saint judged that Lin Yuan's strength should be about the same as his, at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Black Obsidian Saint's expression changed as he sensed a dense spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming from there."</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Saint looked over, his heart slightly stirring.</p><p></p><p>Such a dense spatial-temporal fluctuation was the anomaly caused by the manifestation of a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"This sub-universe has an extremely high spatial-temporal pressure, yet such a dense spatial-temporal anomaly has still appeared."</p><p></p><p>"It must be a treasure at the Supreme Saint level!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Saint unhesitatingly headed towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>A Supreme Saint level treasure, even if encountered by a Supreme Saint, would be fiercely fought over. As a Chaotic Saint, if he obtained it, even if he couldn't use it himself, he could trade it with a Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>"This spatial-temporal fluctuation..."</p><p></p><p>In another direction, the Dual Source Saint transformed into a gray-blue light and abruptly stopped, "A treasure at the Supreme Saint level."</p><p></p><p>"Even though the creator of this sub-universe once approached the Invincible Saint level, treasures reaching the Supreme Saint level would still be quite rare."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Saint pondered for only a moment before immediately heading towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Without knowing whether there were other Supreme Saint level treasures deeper in the universe, the Dual Source Saint naturally did not want to miss the one indicated by the current spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Prosperity Saint, the Nine Phoenix Saint, the Shadow Demon Saint, and other Chaotic Saints also sensed the sweeping spatial-temporal fluctuation, and judged that a Supreme Saint level treasure was about to manifest.</p><p></p><p>"Such a precious treasure..."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Prosperity Saint, the Nine Phoenix Saint, and the others did not hesitate, immediately heading towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the entrance to the Mysterious Yellow Universe, the reason why these Saints had not fought with the Dual Source Saint and Lin Yuan to be the first to enter was not only due to strength differences.</p><p></p><p>There was also a crucial point - they had no clear benefits in sight.</p><p></p><p>Who said that being the first to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe would definitely lead to gains? And whether this sub-universe even contained treasures worth their all-out battle was debatable.</p><p></p><p>As Chaotic Saints, they were the type to not act unless there was a clear reward. Without any definite benefits, they would not recklessly fight.</p><p></p><p>But now, the level of spatial-temporal fluctuation clearly indicated the imminent manifestation of a treasure at the Supreme Saint level.</p><p></p><p>A Supreme Saint level treasure was enough for these Chaotic Saints to go all-out in fighting for it.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a treasure, even the newly ascended Nine Phoenix Saint and Shadow Demon Saint dared to contend with the Dual Source Saint and the Black Obsidian Saint.</p><p></p><p>Even further away, many Chaotic Venerable Ones also sensed this spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"A treasure, definitely a treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with us."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerable Ones gazed longingly, but were then quickly doused with a bucket of cold water, rapidly calming down.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Jin dared to compete with the Great Saints of Double Source and Black Jade, because they were all at the perfected Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was a gap in strength, it was not too large. At least, the Great Saint of Double Source would find it difficult to kill a newly ascended Great Saint, as the latter was not just a rock and could flee for their life.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Lords? Not only the Great Saint of Double Source, even a newly ascended Great Saint would find it effortless to kill a Chaos Lord. If these Chaos Lords dared to join the fray, they would not have enough lives to lose.</p><p></p><p>"Although it has nothing to do with us, we can still get closer to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, what exactly is this precious treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Some Chaos Lords, curious, also began to approach the source of the spatial-temporal origin. As long as they observed from afar without showing any intention to compete, those Great Saints would likely not bother with them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, looking at the dark-colored palace in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this palace was slowly emerging from the depths of the spatial-temporal realm, with profound dark celestial forces permeating in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, the Dark Heaven Palace is located in the depths of the spatial-temporal realm. Without guidance, it is difficult to discover. Now that the Dark Heaven Palace has actively manifested, is it because the external spatial-temporal realm of the Mysterious Yellow Universe is gradually collapsing, thus affecting this spatial-temporal realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered inwardly. The early emergence of the Dark Heaven Palace was also one of the reasons he came here.</p><p></p><p>If it had continued to remain hidden in the depths of the spatial-temporal realm, Lin Yuan could have waited until after he emerged from the mausoleum to come here.</p><p></p><p>"Once it completely emerges from the depths of the spatial-temporal realm, I can directly take the Dark Heaven's Heart inside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in place, waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a slight spatial-temporal fluctuation emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Double Source was the second to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Double Source did not have the detailed map that Lin Yuan had, but he also immediately noticed the dark palace.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Great Saint of Black Jade, the Great Saint of Fierce Savagery, the Great Saint of Celestial Prosperity, the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes, and the Great Saint of Shadow Demon also arrived successfully.</p><p></p><p>"The precious treasure is inside the palace."</p><p></p><p>All the Great Saints were staring intently at the dark palace slowly emerging from the depths of the spatial-temporal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your mastery of spatial-temporal distortion is indeed unique, but if you want to compete with me for the treasure in this palace, you still fall short."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Double Source stared at Lin Yuan and said, "The path of power I possess is precisely what counters yours. I'm about to fight with all my might, and you definitely won't be my match."</p><p></p><p>If he could make Lin Yuan retreat just by talking, the Great Saint of Double Source would be willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced sideways at the Great Saint of Double Source.</p><p></p><p>What the Great Saint of Double Source said was not wrong. Although he had not fought at full strength outside the Mysterious Yellow Universe, the gray-green power he possessed could indeed greatly disrupt the spatial-temporal realm.</p><p></p><p>But that was under the condition of similar strength.</p><p></p><p>Water can extinguish fire, but a drop of water cannot extinguish a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Savagery, why don't we join forces?" the Great Saint of Black Jade secretly transmitted to the Great Saint of Fierce Savagery.</p><p></p><p>"Join forces?" The Great Saint of Fierce Savagery was moved. He was indeed willing to join forces with the Great Saint of Black Jade, as the latter's domain had obvious restraining and suppressing abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Who are we going to deal with?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Fierce Savagery immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"It's him." The Great Saint of Black Jade thought for a while and glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Great Saint of Black Jade chose Lin Yuan was the result of his careful consideration. Lin Yuan's abilities were similar to the Black Jade Domain and could even suppress the Black Jade Domain.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely what made the Great Saint of Black Jade very wary of him. As for the Great Saint of Double Source? The Great Saint of Black Jade had dealt with him many times and was quite familiar with his methods.</p><p></p><p>If he had to choose between Lin Yuan and the Great Saint of Double Source, the Great Saint of Black Jade felt that Lin Yuan posed a greater threat.</p><p></p><p>"Deal with him?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Fierce Savagery grinned, as he also preferred to strike at Lin Yuan first.</p><p></p><p>After all, among the many Great Saints present, only Lin Yuan's background was unclear. Leaving such a powerful figure of unknown abilities around made the Great Saint of Fierce Savagery a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dark palace in the distance had completely emerged from the depths of the spatial-temporal realm.</p><p></p><p>A dense spatial-temporal fluctuation began to spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Attack."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Black Jade immediately activated the Black Jade Domain, and endless darkness began to spread. The Great Saint of Fierce Savagery also stepped forward, piercing through the spatial-temporal realm towards Lin Yuan with a punch.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Double Source had originally planned to approach the dark palace immediately, but seeing the actions of the Great Saint of Black Jade and the Great Saint of Fierce Savagery, he immediately realized they wanted to attack Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Seize the opportunity while he's weak."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Double Source transformed into a gray-green light and also charged towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood still, glancing at the several auras approaching from behind.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan began to activate the divine ability "World".</p><p></p><p>The great Dao of the spatial-temporal realm was all twisted. At this moment, the universe within Lin Yuan's body had undergone a transformation, and the external universe formed by his inner universe had also greatly increased in power.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The originally gray-green Great Saint of Double Source was directly confined in place by the heavy spatial-temporal pressure, his form even forced to reveal itself, looking at the heavens and earth with disbelief. "This kind of suppression?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The pupils of the Great Saint of Black Jade shrank. The moment the external universe was formed, his Black Jade Domain began to collapse, and he too was suppressed and unable to move. "I can't feel the external spatial-temporal realm anymore?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Fierce Savagery was the same. The punch he had thrown only reached halfway before he suddenly stumbled, looking dazedly at the spatial-temporal realm around him.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the universe, Lin Yuan stood there. But in the vision of the other Great Saints, Lin Yuan had transformed into an eternal blazing sun, constantly emitting light and heat. Wherever it shone, all the Chaos evolutionary powers of the Great Saints were collapsing and disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sight made the Great Saints of Celestial Prosperity and Shadow Demon, who were planning to find an opportunity to strike, tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scorching sun blazed furiously.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly activated the Blazing Sun Divine Body, naturally forming the Blazing Sun World.</p><p></p><p>This immediately suppressed the numerous war machines of the Purple Dream Realm, rendering them unable to move.</p><p></p><p>This was the terrifying empowerment brought by the more than 30,000 Blazing Sun Seeds to the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's bird's-eye view, the war machines in the Purple Dream Realm below began to enter an irreversible 'self-destruction'.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced and immediately knew he could not stop this 'self-destruction'.</p><p></p><p>Each war machine, even the lowest-ranked Class C war machine, was unique, containing the secret Chaos Markings that belonged to the ancient nations' top secrets.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the war machines were engraved with 'self-destruction' markings. Once they lost control, they would self-destruct immediately.</p><p></p><p>If they did not self-destruct, and the war machines fell into the enemy's hands, the contained Chaos Markings could be comprehended and replicated, allowing the creation of identical war machines.</p><p></p><p>This was something the ancient nations could not accept.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Lin Yuan saw the Venerable Leige act on the Class B war machine, he immediately intervened, fearing that the other's methods would trigger the 'self-destruction' markings within the Class B war machine.</p><p></p><p>"It's just self-destruction, but the materials will still have residue, which is very valuable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the war machines shattered one by one.</p><p></p><p>The manufacture of war machines, in addition to engraving the corresponding Chaos Markings, also required extremely precious materials. After all, they needed to withstand the power of hundreds or thousands of Sovereign Realm experts, and have that power amplified. If the materials were even slightly weaker, they would not be able to pose a threat to the Venerable Ones and would simply disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"These remaining materials, as well as the merits gained from defeating the enemy, should not be few, and can be exchanged for many cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he glanced at the Venerable Leige who had already fled deep into the Purple Dream Realm.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leige's strength was far superior to the Ninth Mysterious Venerable of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan forcefully killed the other, he could certainly do it, but he would have to chase the other for a while.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he would have to delve deep into the heart of the Purple Dream Realm, where there would be many variables. If multiple peak Venerable Ones or even Celestial Venerable-level experts joined in the hunt, Lin Yuan would have a hard time escaping unscathed.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan never planned to pursue Venerable Leige.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still too weak."</p><p></p><p>"If I could completely refine the Second Layer of the 'Infinite Void', and possess the near-invincible power of a Venerable One, I would have the confidence to deal with Venerable Leige."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the enemy Venerable One, if Lin Yuan killed Venerable Leige, he would certainly gain considerable merits.</p><p></p><p>Even though Venerable Leige had a means of escaping death and could revive, it would take time for him to recover his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, he would not be able to participate in the upcoming battles.</p><p></p><p>These would all count as merits.</p><p></p><p>During wartime, killing the true body of an enemy Venerable One is not an easy task, as they generally do not act alone.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if one could kill them, the rewards would be very high.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Venerable Leige dared not return, Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the Class B war machine appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>To ensure this war machine was not damaged, Lin Yuan had only brought it out now.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One."</p><p>"Thank you, Venerable One, for your assistance."</p><p></p><p>From within the Class B war machine, the unicorn-headed man 'Luo Peng' and other peak Sovereign Realm commanders flew out, expressing their deep gratitude to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they also realized that if it were not for Lin Yuan, they would have likely perished under Venerable Leige's attack.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. "The enemy has been routed, you all can clean up the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>All the war machines in the Purple Dream Realm had self-destructed, and the numerous Sovereign Realm experts within them had become Lin Yuan's prisoners of war.</p><p></p><p>For these prisoners of war, there was a relatively tacit understanding among the ancient nations on how to handle them. That was to 'ransom' them back after the war ended.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan did not mistreat these prisoners, but simply placed them in a corner of his personal universe.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"The Venerable One's actions directly frightened Venerable Leige into a hasty retreat."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the unicorn-headed man 'Luo Peng' and the other peak Sovereign Realm experts couldn't help but praise Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although they had been inside the war machines and taken away by Lin Yuan, through the communication between their avatars, they had a general understanding of what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Defeating Venerable Leige is nothing special. Whether the war is won or lost depends mainly on the core defensive line battles."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, having a very clear understanding of himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this war involving dozens of major realms, he could not influence much.</p><p></p><p>"But that was still a victory in the local defensive line."</p><p></p><p>The unicorn-headed man 'Luo Peng' immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Go down now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan left,</p><p></p><p>The unicorn-headed man 'Luo Peng' and the other peak Sovereign Realm experts finally looked up.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought we would have to fight a bitter battle, but it ended so quickly."</p><p></p><p>One of the peak Sovereign Realm experts said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to the Galactic Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>The unicorn-headed man 'Luo Peng' said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's all because of the Galactic Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>The rest of the peak Sovereign Realm experts nodded. Without the Galactic Venerable One, even if they could resist the enemy, they would have to pay a brutal price, and might even...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Destroying part of the war machines. Lin Yuan returned to the rear of the defense line.</p><p></p><p>He then observed the fierce battles between the peak Supremes in the core defense line area.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>The peak Supremes on both sides gradually ceased their attacks.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the war, the Supreme-level experts on both sides were mainly testing each other, not unleashing their full power. </p><p></p><p>For someone like Lin Yuan to directly defeat Luo Ge Supreme was a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was planning to continue studying the war machines.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis manifested a divine avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River."</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis smiled at Lin Yuan, feeling extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength had allowed him to gain face among the peak Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Many peak Supremes were unparalleled in combat power, but they were lacking in teaching disciples. </p><p></p><p>It was extremely difficult to guide a Supreme-level disciple, let alone one approaching the peak Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Prince of Chisongh wishes to see you," Qingfen Marquis stated his purpose directly.</p><p></p><p>"The Prince of Chisongh wants to see me?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "Prince of Chisongh" referred to the Chisongh King, as the royals preferred to be addressed as "Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Qingfen Marquis nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's good news," Qingfen Marquis explained. "You defeated Luo Ge Supreme, although not in the core defense line area, but it has still boosted our morale, and the Prince of Chisongh is very pleased."</p><p></p><p>"The Prince of Chisongh is pleased." Qingfen Marquis looked at Lin Yuan: "If you have any requests, you can take this opportunity to make them. Even if the Prince doesn't agree, it's fine. But if he does agree, then that's a windfall for you."</p><p></p><p>"It can be done like this?" Lin Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Prince of Chisongh is pleased, he will be more lenient on many matters," Qingfen Marquis said.</p><p></p><p>He was quite familiar with the Chisongh King.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you there right now."</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis immediately led Lin Yuan to traverse the void.</p><p></p><p>After only dozens of such transits, they arrived at a small city floating in the sky, occupying an area of only tens of billions of li, equivalent to a small cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis brought Lin Yuan to the front of a pavilion in the small city.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, Silver River has arrived," Qingfen Marquis announced.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," a gentle voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed Qingfen Marquis and entered, seeing the Chisongh King seated in the middle of the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Chisongh King was also a Supreme-level expert, but his aura was far more imposing than Qingfen Marquis, even surpassing the Red Leaf Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, have a seat," the Chisongh King smiled at Lin Yuan, without any airs of being a royal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately took a seat.</p><p></p><p>"You have displayed your prowess on the battlefield, and I am very pleased," the Chisongh King said with a smile. "Tell me, what reward do you desire?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis stood by the side, not making any moves.</p><p></p><p>"Reward..." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already been forewarned by Qingfen Marquis, understanding that this was an opportunity to make a bold request. Even if it didn't succeed, there would be no consequences.</p><p></p><p>"What should I ask for?" Many thoughts flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Resources? There were many ways to obtain resources, no need to waste this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness," after a brief moment, Lin Yuan had made up his mind. "I wish to study the Grade-A war machines."</p><p></p><p>So far, the war machines Lin Yuan had been able to access were only at the Grade-B intermediate level.</p><p></p><p>But that level was already the limit. As for the higher Grade-A war machines, they could only be found on the core defense line battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan went to the core defense line, the overlords there were peak Supremes. Could Lin Yuan casually study the war machines there like he did in the Seventh Defense Line area? It would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qingfen Marquis secretly protected him, he definitely couldn't hide it from the Chisongh King.</p><p></p><p>"Study the Grade-A war machines?" Qingfen Marquis slightly changed expression upon hearing this request.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Lin Yuan to dare make such a request.</p><p></p><p>The Grade-A war machines could accommodate thousands to tens of thousands of peak Sovereign experts, and a single strike from them could threaten the existence of peak Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Such war machines could already influence the outcome of local wars. Even Qingfen Marquis himself did not have the qualifications to casually approach any Grade-A war machine.</p><p></p><p>In Qingfen Marquis' view, the possibility of this request being granted was not high.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Chisongh King was extremely pleased, the Grade-A war machines involved the foundation of the ancient kingdom, which the Chisongh King understood clearly.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had just requested some rare treasure, Qingfen Marquis believed the Chisongh King would agree. But the Grade-A war machines? The Chisongh King daring to agree would also bring certain risks to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the profound mysteries contained in the Grade-A war machine Lin Yuan studied were to be leaked, the Chisongh King would be the primary responsible party.</p><p></p><p>"Grade-A war machines?" The Chisongh King raised his brows and shook his head. "You really know how to make requests."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Chisongh King's words, Lin Yuan immediately realized that the Grade-A war machines were even more important than he had estimated.</p><p></p><p>"But who told you to make me this happy?" The Chisongh King smiled at Lin Yuan. "Since you want to study the Grade-A war machines, you can study the ones used in this war."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

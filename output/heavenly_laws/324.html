Moreover, the strength Lin Yuan currently displayed had obviously surpassed that of sovereign gods, reaching the level of supreme gods.</p><p></p><p>Begging a supreme god for mercy was not very humiliating.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to submit?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was calm, unmoved. </p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had just entered the Ocean of Light and planned to negotiate with the gods, and the latter agreed to his request and voluntarily offered their godhoods, Lin Yuan really wouldn't have gone on a killing spree.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>They had already made a move. Lin Yuan had killed so many true gods and sovereign gods. Accepting the gods' submission at this point would obviously be somewhat superfluous.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's stay in this world would only last for 1,110 years. If these gods and sovereign gods submitted now, they would definitely be reluctant and unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan finished his traversal and returned to the main world, without his deterrence, it would be hard to predict what actions the gods and sovereign gods might take.</p><p></p><p>Therefore‚Äî</p><p></p><p>With the idea of cutting weeds and eliminating the roots, since Lin Yuan chose to take action, there was no need to leave any leeway.</p><p></p><p>Voluntarily offering their godhoods?</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't voluntarily offer their godhoods, Lin Yuan could take them himself.</p><p></p><p>And he could also gain a vast divine kingdom containing immense energy as nourishment to enhance his Origin Essence Metal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally knew how to choose.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying energy vibrations shook the layers of space heavily.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ocean of Light, all true gods had been completely exterminated. Even the most ancient true gods couldn't withstand such crushing power.</p><p></p><p>The only ones left alive were eight sovereign gods.</p><p></p><p>Even so, these eight sovereign gods had paid a heavy price, their auras exhausted to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the moment Lin Yuan started taking action until now, less than ten breaths had passed.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign God of Light burned his divine power and finally unlocked the spatial layer seal of the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and escape."</p><p></p><p>The remaining eight sovereign gods didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. They directly occupied deeper spatial layers and quickly distanced themselves from the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in place, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign gods were the "favorites" of this world, and their sovereign godhoods gathered part of the "authority" of this world.</p><p></p><p>If the sovereign gods used all their power to escape, even if Lin Yuan opened up 120 million layers of space, it would be very difficult to stop them in a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, in essence, Lin Yuan and the ninth-level sovereign gods were still at the same level of life, just that his "foundation" was slightly thicker.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were in this world, the sovereign gods' means of escaping were far stronger than normal peak ninth-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan didn't expect that entering the Ocean of Light this time would allow him to kill so many sovereign gods at once.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expectation was to deal with all the true gods, and as for the remaining sovereign gods, he would hunt them down one by one.</p><p></p><p>The sovereign gods' means of escaping were indeed very powerful, but if he persisted, once Lin Yuan occupied more, deeper, and wider spatial layers, these sovereign gods would still be like birds in a cage, within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>However, what Lin Yuan didn't expect was that the Sovereign God of Light was so cooperative. He actually took the initiative to seal off the Ocean of Light, turning this abode of gods in this world into a complete prison, giving Lin Yuan the opportunity to directly deal with sixteen sovereign gods.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's descent, the strongest beings in this world were the sovereign gods, and the various killing techniques and methods of the Ocean of Light were also targeted at the sovereign gods.</p><p></p><p>Sealing off the spatial layers of the Ocean of Light was initially meant to temporarily trap the other sovereign gods here.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that now it had become a death warrant for all the sovereign gods?</p><p></p><p>In fact, under the opportunity just now, with Lin Yuan's strength, if he erupted with full power, whether true gods or sovereign gods, they would all die completely within five breaths.</p><p></p><p>However, such terrifying full-power force made Lin Yuan worry about damaging the true godhoods and sovereign godhoods within the true gods and sovereign gods.</p><p></p><p>Godhoods were not indestructible. At least if Lin Yuan was willing, he could easily destroy demigodhoods.</p><p></p><p>True godhoods might be countless times more solid than demigodhoods, but they also couldn't withstand Lin Yuan's full-powered strike. As for sovereign godhoods? Perhaps they could endure, or perhaps they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't want to gamble.</p><p></p><p>After all, each godhood and sovereign godhood was a shortcut for Lin Yuan, and their value was far greater than those true gods and sovereign gods.</p><p></p><p>So when making a move just now, Lin Yuan was being cautious and careful, prudently grasping the force of his attacks, trying his best not to affect any godhood or sovereign godhood.</p><p></p><p>"The sovereign godhood of the God of Divination?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a bright white godhood slowly floated, coming from the power of the twenty-four sovereign gods, the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>In the first wave of crushing just now, the God of Divination was the first sovereign god to fall. The main reason was not that the God of Divination had the weakest ability to save his life.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination died so easily simply because he suffered the backlash of the Gate of Myriad Realms, leaving his strength in a precarious state.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with the God of Divination's personality, having suffered such heavy injuries, he should have hidden in his divine kingdom and not come out.</p><p></p><p>But the opportunity related to the supreme god was too tempting. Even though he knew he was heavily injured, the God of Divination still wanted to come and join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>What if?</p><p></p><p>What if he was lucky enough to obtain the supreme god's opportunity?</p><p></p><p>So, with this thought in mind, the God of Divination became the first sovereign god to completely fall.</p><p></p><p>"The sovereign godhood of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined the bright white crystal in his hand.</p><p></p><p>During the confrontation with the sovereign gods just now, Lin Yuan was especially careful. As soon as the divine body of this sovereign god was completely extinguished, Lin Yuan immediately took action to protect the sovereign godhood that dropped out.</p><p></p><p>"A part of it is cracked."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Yuan discovered cracks on the godhood.</p><p></p><p>It was these cracks that caused the God of Divination's strength to be greatly diminished. Facing Lin Yuan's strike, coupled with the Sovereign God of Light's action of sealing the spatial layers, he only endured the first few waves of crushing before completely dying and falling.</p><p></p><p>"These cracks should be from the backlash of the Gate of Myriad Realms." Lin Yuan thought to himself. He could see that the cracks had appeared for some time.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't have much impact."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the sovereign godhood of time. Through this "key", Lin Yuan vaguely glimpsed the mysterious essence of the vast rules of time in this world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll comprehend it later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he solemnly stored the sovereign godhood of time into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Lin Yuan also glanced at the small mountain beside him.</p><p></p><p>It was composed of one true godhood after another. Basically, all the existing true gods of the Ocean of Light over countless eons were here.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, all the godhoods were here.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Myriad rules." Lin Yuan's eyes were slightly feverish as he gazed at the small mountain-shaped true god slots, and many insights began to well up in his heart. </p><p></p><p>"Hold it in, hold it in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness withdrew from his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Early on when he took action, Lin Yuan had already placed marks on all the chief gods. No matter where they escaped to, they could not avoid his perception.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need for marks at all. By locking onto the rules of cause and effect, one could know the locations of those chief gods.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly took action against the chief gods, producing the strongest cause and effect between the two. In the eyes of experts skilled in the rules of cause and effect, this was undoubtedly a beacon showing the way.</p><p></p><p>"Let them slowly escape, I'll deal with the true gods of the Dark Abyss first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually tore open a spatial layer and stepped into the spatial layer where the Dark Abyss was located.</p><p></p><p>This world was only so big. Even if those eight chief gods tried their hardest to escape, it was impossible for them to leave the scope of the world. </p><p></p><p>Chief gods controlled the authority of heaven and earth, but similarly could not leave heaven and earth either. Once they left, the chief god slots within their bodies would collapse.</p><p></p><p>And somewhere in this world, a new chief god slot would condense again.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why the number of chief gods in this world had always been twenty-four throughout history, no more and no less.</p><p></p><p>Even if chief gods occasionally inexplicably disappeared in history, their chief god slots would reappear within this world.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan allowed the eight chief gods to flee.</p><p></p><p>One, it would be troublesome to stop them and he might not necessarily be able to do it. If he used too much force, he might damage the chief god slots.</p><p></p><p>Two, the chief god slots he wanted the most would not leave this world.</p><p></p><p>In a certain space deep within the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The Dark God was fleeing in a panic-stricken and uneasy manner.</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't have gotten involved in this mess. The opportunity related to the Supreme God is all bullshit!" The Dark God's mind was still trembling.</p><p></p><p>What he experienced in the Sea of Light earlier had thoroughly frightened him. It turned out that his indestructible divine body was so fragile in front of the Longshan Patriarch?</p><p></p><p>The Dark God had a feeling that if the Light God had been twenty or thirty breaths slower in sealing off the spatial layer, he might have ended up like those true gods, left behind in the Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying, too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>The Dark God felt his scalp go a bit numb. "But now that I'm hiding in such a deep spatial layer and constantly moving, it shouldn't be easy for that Longshan Patriarch to find me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The true gods in the Dark Abyss are currently being slaughtered by the Longshan Patriarch and are seeking my help?" The Dark God seemed to sense something and his heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>As the second chief god born in this world, the Dark God had an inseparable connection with the Dark Abyss he created, and could sense the calls of the many true gods within the Dark Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The Dark God felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>Since proclaiming himself a chief god, he had never experienced a desperate escape like this moment. Even when fighting his nemesis the Light God for long ages, he had never felt as hopeless as he did now.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left the Dark Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"It's just you left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed into the distance at a certain spatial layer, where one of the chief gods of the Sea of Light had escaped to.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-Colored Dragon God?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared again as he pursued to kill.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>A seven-colored divine dragon millions of zhang long was frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>With each undulation of its dragon body, it crossed a vast number of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The spatial layer the million-zhang seven-colored divine dragon was in was instantly occupied, and a figure appeared in front of the Seven-Colored Dragon God. It was none other than Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Longshan Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Dragon God felt a bit desperate. "How can your speed be so fast?"</p><p></p><p>As the chief god of the Seven-Colored Dragon Race, the Seven-Colored Dragon God was very skilled in manipulating space, but he didn't expect Lin Yuan to be able to catch up in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any last words you want to say?" Lin Yuan asked in an indifferent tone.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was taking the opportunity to occupy more spatial layers. The battles between 9th stage lifeforms were essentially chases through countless spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many spatial layers Lin Yuan opened up, he had to completely occupy them in order to form an absolute advantage.</p><p></p><p>Before thoroughly occupying them, a chief god skilled in spatial rules like the Seven-Colored Dragon God had a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Longshan Patriarch, I can sense that the bloodline of my Seven-Colored Dragon Race flows within you." The Seven-Colored Dragon God looked at Lin Yuan and spoke. "In a sense, we are still kin."</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Dragon God began to pull connections with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as long as he could survive, he was willing to do anything.</p><p></p><p>"Kin?"</p><p></p><p>"I can see that you are also moving to even more distant depths of space through the gaps between spatial layers." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>He was taking the opportunity to occupy more spatial layers, and the Seven-Colored Dragon God naturally wouldn't sit and wait for death either. He was also trying various efforts.</p><p></p><p>In terms of direct combat, with the battle power Lin Yuan displayed in the Sea of Light, the Seven-Colored Dragon God knew that there was no way he could match up no matter what.</p><p></p><p>So he wanted to rely on his innate talent to instantly shift between spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>But very obviously, the Seven-Colored Dragon God's plan couldn't be hidden from Lin Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who occupied 100 million spatial layers, had reached a terrifying realm in his perception of the subtle aspects of space.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Lin Yuan had already occupied the 100 million spatial layers here. With a thought, a vast force pressed down towards the Seven-Colored Dragon God.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Dragon God watched all this helplessly. He wanted to continue escaping into even more distant spatial layers, but he just couldn't do it. The surrounding space was completely sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"Even I will have a day of complete destruction? To be able to die under the power of the Supreme God level, it's worth it." The Seven-Colored Dragon God's divine body was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a chief god slot radiating seven-colored light fell down and was taken into Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This chief god slot?" Lin Yuan carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the other chief god slots Lin Yuan obtained, the Seven-Colored Dragon God's chief god slot was a bit special. It actually contained seven powers at the same time, or more precisely, seven rules.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, facing Lin Yuan who occupied an absolute advantage, the seven rules the Seven-Colored Dragon God mastered weren't even used before he died.</p><p></p><p>"Seven more left." Lin Yuan put away the chief god slot.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of all the demigods in the vast human world were now gathered above the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally star-studded sky was now dim and lightless, with only five or six huge stars symbolizing chief gods still twinkling.</p><p></p><p>But very obviously, the remaining five or six stars couldn't last much longer either. Soon, another two stars fell.</p><p></p><p>All the living beings in the entire human world were as silent as cicadas in winter, watching this unprecedented shocking scene.</p><p></p><p>Two more chapters done.</p><p></p><p>Please vote~</p><p></p><p>XOXO~~~</p>

            <p>Chapter 207: Spreading Martial Arts, Planning Ahead (Happy New Year)</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed expressionlessly at the many powerful figures below him, their postures respectful. These people could be said to be the most elite forces in the entire Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they were the core group that held the reins of power in the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, within the Tianqing Alliance, the Alliance Leader was the strongest. But to command a force, relying solely on the strongest was useless. </p><p></p><p>It still required subordinates. Power did not flow from top to bottom, but from bottom to top.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was usually either in secluded cultivation or battling the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Where would he find the time to manage the Tianqing Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Simply put, these people were the actual controllers of the entire Tianqing Alliance, and thus the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan controlling these people, saying he controlled the Tianqing World was not an exaggeration in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tianqing Alliance Leader?</p><p></p><p>His most trusted subordinates, cherished lovers, valued offspring, etc., had all become Lin Yuan's people now, and were currently completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yuan, the Tianqing Alliance Leader was nothing more than meat on a chopping block, to be dealt with whenever he pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Too smooth."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the crowd, his heart inevitably feeling a tinge of emotion.</p><p></p><p>When he first started, he merely wanted to find a few powerful figures from the Tianqing Alliance to parasitize, then infiltrate the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And slowly develop from there.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought development would be so fast, he simply couldn't stop the momentum. Before he knew it, he had accidentally become the behind-the-scenes controller of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to review in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, for things to go so smoothly,</p><p></p><p>It was greatly related to the Tianqing Alliance Leader's decision to launch a counterattack against the foreign evil gods, dispatching all twelve sub-leaders and many guardian elders into the Tianqing World, mobilizing their foundation.</p><p></p><p>If these powerful figures of the Tianqing Alliance were still on the evil god battlefield, it would have been very difficult for Lin Yuan to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Because in order to prevent "desertion", the Tianqing Alliance Leader had long ago decreed that cultivators on the evil god battlefield were forbidden from returning to the Tianqing World without his orders.</p><p></p><p>This would have made Lin Yuan's "parasitism" not go very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Because the parasitic ability of the perfected Demon Seed required Lin Yuan to be present to personally utilize it.</p><p></p><p>If those powerful figures did not come, Lin Yuan definitely could not go to the evil god battlefield alone.</p><p></p><p>But under the Tianqing Alliance Leader's orders, the various sub-leaders and guardian elders all returned, providing Lin Yuan with an excellent external environment.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, emotions.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the stronger one was, the more lonely they were, and the fewer people they could call good friends.</p><p></p><p>Without deep feelings, if you said some place had a peerless treasure, basically no powerful figure would believe it.</p><p></p><p>You say there's a treasure, so there's a treasure?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only with a life-and-death level of trust.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of trust was very high. Moreover, being in the Tianqing World, everyone's mood was good and their guard was lowered. Thus, they were attracted over one by one, allowing Lin Yuan to "parasitize" them individually.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it was Lin Yuan's perfected "parasitism" ability.</p><p></p><p>This reason could be said to be the most important point. The Tianqing Alliance was very familiar with the Ancestral Demon Tree's parasitic ability.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that a parasitized powerful figure would perfectly replace the original, causing no one to suspect in that direction.</p><p></p><p>This was also why these powerful figures of the Tianqing World were inadequate in dealing with sudden situations and had no countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Lastly,</p><p></p><p>It was because Lin Yuan's strength was sufficiently powerful. </p><p></p><p>Even if he lured them in one by one, those twelve sub-leaders and four sacred beast kings all had seventh level battle power.</p><p></p><p>Although far inferior to Lin Yuan, they still had a chance to transmit information out.</p><p></p><p>However, under the Space Prison Lin Yuan had comprehended, isolating heaven and earth, those sub-leaders and sacred beast kings were successfully parasitized without sending out any information.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the parasitized people did not die, but lived on in another way. Thus, life fire and other methods could not detect any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Because the people did not die, life fire and many other life-or-death divination methods were naturally useless.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is everything I know."</p><p></p><p>An extremely beautiful woman respectfully said. This woman was the Tianqing Alliance Leader's mistress.</p><p></p><p>With her account, Lin Yuan's understanding of the Tianqing Alliance Leader had reached an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>He even knew the color of the other party's underwear.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should we lure the Alliance Leader over now?"</p><p></p><p>Another sub-leader respectfully inquired. This sub-leader had made great contributions to Lin Yuan smoothly taking control of the Tianqing World this time.</p><p></p><p>He had brought over most of the Tianqing Alliance's sub-leaders.</p><p></p><p>Because this sub-leader was the current Tianqing Alliance Leader's master, and had extremely high prestige in the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With him taking action, how would the other sub-leaders dare refuse?</p><p></p><p>As for how this sub-leader was lured over, it was entirely because Lin Yuan controlled one of his offspring who held the position of guardian elder.</p><p></p><p>This sub-leader doted on this offspring immensely, leading to Lin Yuan's successful move.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head, not planning to immediately take action against the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>His greatest advantage now was being hidden in the dark. That Tianqing Alliance Leader had no idea that everything he had painstakingly built had already fallen into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>The timing of when Lin Yuan made a move against the Tianqing Alliance Leader was extremely important.</p><p></p><p>If he lured the Tianqing Alliance Leader over now, there was a chance it would arouse the other party's suspicions.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the foreign evil gods still unresolved, what was the meaning of the Tianqing Alliance's strongest, the only one capable of blocking the Ancestral Demon Tree, returning to the Tianqing World instead of guarding outside?</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianqing Alliance Leader was lured over, there was a high possibility he would bring that World Sword.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword was a world weapon nurtured by the Tianqing World for countless years. Outside the world, it could exchange a few moves with the Ancestral Demon Tree at its peak.</p><p></p><p>As for inside the world, even the current Lin Yuan was not very willing to directly confront the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had long schemed on how to deal with the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally speaking, the Tianqing Alliance Leader was not the owner of the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>He was just a temporary user. If not for the threat of the foreign evil gods, the Tianqing World's will would never have let the World Sword appear.</p><p></p><p>The root cause for the World Sword's appearance was the foreign evil gods.</p><p></p><p>As long as the foreign evil gods were dealt with, the World Sword would not continue to remain in the Tianqing Alliance Leader's hands.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan had no intention of immediately moving against the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>"I have two tasks for you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the many powerful figures below and slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Master. Let alone two tasks, even if it's twenty or two hundred, we will complete them."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Master, please tell us."</p><p></p><p>Nearly three hundred powerful figures listened attentively, eyes blazing, bowing their bodies.</p><p></p><p>As parasitic hosts of the Demon Tree's seeds, they had an innate xxx towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(Translation incomplete due to reaching maximum response length. The Chinese text is longer than what can fit in a single response.)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Absolute obedience.</p><p></p><p>"Gradually spread this cultivation system."</p><p></p><p>New ⑥⑨ Book Bar → ⑥⑨ⓢⓗⓤⓧ.ⓒⓞⓜ</p><p></p><p>In addition to opening up the subsequent stages of the martial arts evolution system, spreading the martial arts evolution system was also a plan that Lin Yuan had set long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, in the first hundred years after arriving in this world, Lin Yuan's identity was special, and he didn't even dare to show his face, let alone spread the martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>But it's different now.</p><p></p><p>With the help of these native powerhouses of the Cyan World, it's easier than ever to spread the martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation system..."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, Master. Such a profound cultivation system is a bargain for those ants."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Master. We guarantee to complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>Nearly three hundred powerhouses patted their chests and promised.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no doubts.</p><p></p><p>Because this matter was indeed not difficult, especially since the powerhouses present were all high-ranking individuals in the Cyan World.</p><p></p><p>What's the big deal about spreading a cultivation system?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial arts evolution path has unlimited potential. Even without their promotion, as long as it's not suppressed or targeted, it will slowly spread.</p><p></p><p>"Another thing is to return to the Demon God Battlefield, return to the side of the Cyan Alliance Leader, pretend that nothing happened, and launch a counterattack against the foreign Demon Gods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Destroying the Demon God Battlefield was one of Lin Yuan's goals.</p><p></p><p>Without the Demon God Battlefield, if the Ancestral Demon Tree wanted to descend into the Cyan World, it could only rely on growing to the fifth stage and then establishing a spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was bound to have more bargaining chips, and thus could scheme for more benefits.</p><p></p><p>For example, a large amount of the Ancestral Demon Tree's origin power? Lin Yuan obtained origin power not only to enhance his own strength but also to weaken the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, five years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Cyan World.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Demon God Battlefield was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Under the all-out counterattack of the Cyan World, it began to occupy large areas, while the foreign Demon God Ancestral Demon Tree, under the guard of the Cyan Alliance Leader wielding the World Sword, did not dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>In a distant illusory space, the aura of the Ancestral Demon Tree was turbulent as it watched the Demon God Battlefield gradually crumble into dust, its heart bleeding.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God Battlefield was refined from a special metal in the outer void, costing the Ancestral Demon Tree an untold amount of effort.</p><p></p><p>Through the Demon God Battlefield, the Ancestral Demon Tree could more easily attack the interior of the world.</p><p></p><p>But now, its painstaking work was collapsing.</p><p></p><p>There was no way. To retract the Demon God Battlefield required a great deal of time, and the Ancestral Demon Tree had to be present on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>And this was something the Cyan Alliance Leader would never give a chance for.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't exhausted so much of my origin, would I be afraid of you?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Demon Tree gritted its teeth. At its peak, just the Cyan Alliance Leader alone could not stop it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Cyan Alliance Leader dared to launch a counterattack, the Ancestral Demon Tree would descend onto the battlefield, dragging the Cyan Alliance Leader to fight near the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In this way, just the aftermath of the two's battle would be enough to sweep across the battlefield, making it impossible to occupy the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>With severe depletion of its origin, the Cyan Alliance Leader wielding the World Sword could chase and hunt it down, leaving no spare energy to take into account the situation on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Above the Demon God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Alliance Leader sat cross-legged with the World Sword floating in front of him, emitting layers of inexplicable fluctuations, enveloping all directions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Demon God has no intention of making a move."</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Alliance Leader muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>His purpose here was to wait for the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the Ancestral Demon Tree, launching a counterattack and destroying the Demon God Battlefield was tantamount to draining the pond to catch the fish.</p><p></p><p>Four hundred years ago, the reason the Ancestral Demon Tree was able to easily open up the Demon God Battlefield was that the Cyan World was unprepared.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Demon God Battlefield was destroyed and the Cyan World was prepared, even if the Ancestral Demon Tree obtained a second Demon God Battlefield, it would not be able to open it outside the world.</p><p></p><p>In the Cyan Alliance Leader's view, launching a counterattack and destroying the Demon God Battlefield, that foreign Demon God would struggle a little more or less.</p><p></p><p>After all, once the Demon God Battlefield was destroyed, it meant that the foreign Demon God would no longer have a chance to descend into the Cyan World.</p><p></p><p>"Duan Lang is a master strategist with unrivaled strength. That foreign Demon God knows that even if it makes a move, it can't possibly be Duan Lang's match, so it didn't do anything meaningless."</p><p></p><p>An extremely beautiful woman appeared beside him and spoke softly to the Cyan Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>"A Yan."</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Alliance Leader looked at the beautiful woman, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>This extremely beautiful woman named A Yan had an ambiguous relationship with him, and the two had confided in each other a lot.</p><p></p><p>It's just that due to the pressure of the foreign Demon God, the Cyan Alliance Leader had never confirmed their relationship with A Yan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although their relationship was not confirmed, the Cyan Alliance Leader compensated A Yan in many ways, such as the position of Deputy Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>"A Yan, once we completely destroy the Demon God Battlefield, we can be together forever."</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Alliance Leader couldn't help but hold A Yan and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He had already begun to fantasize about all the wonderful things after repelling the foreign Demon God.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would take the woman he liked to tour the mountains and rivers, enjoying a carefree life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the merit of repelling the foreign Demon God, he would become the greatest cultivator in the history of the Cyan World, praised by countless cultivators of later generations.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, then A Yan can be with Duan Lang forever."</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman A Yan said softly, her tone tinged with a hint of shyness.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>"That's for sure."</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Alliance Leader laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't notice was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, A Yan, who was nestled in his arms, had a hint of strangeness flashing deep in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the distance towards the Demon God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"The war seems to be coming to an end."</p><p></p><p>With the separation of the world barrier, Lin Yuan could not perceive the specific situation on the Demon God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But through the life and death status of the parasites, it could be inferred that the counterattack should be going smoothly.</p><p></p><p>And as an offspring of the Ancestral Demon Tree, Lin Yuan could vaguely sense the general location of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Ancestral Demon Tree could also sense Lin Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's perception, the Ancestral Demon Tree had never approached the Demon God Battlefield from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>At the root area, that cluster of burning black flames suddenly began to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan's mind immediately sank in front of the black flames.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>The somewhat anxious voice of the Ancestral Demon Tree came from within the black flames.</p><p></p><p>"What stage have you grown to now?"</p><p></p><p>"The situation on my side is beyond redemption. I can only rely on you."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 310: A Hundred Leisurely Years (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The deficiency in the original spiritual energy cannot be perfectly replenished simply by consuming spiritual fruits and other nourishing items. üëåüíÄ‚ùªÔºôùî∞‚ÑçÔºµùìç.‚í∏„Ññ–ºüê£üëä</p><p></p><p>At least by Lin Yuan's standards, it is far from being that simple. </p><p></p><p>But it's not too difficult either.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, with the current conditions, it will take at most three to four days to replenish it.</p><p></p><p>At that time, with the original spiritual energy complete, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed will usher in a period of explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>Actually, it can't really be considered cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It's more like methodically returning to the peak.</p><p></p><p>"The life in this world, the physical body conceals an immeasurable potential." Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, silently thinking in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already discovered this aspect when his consciousness awakened. The original body, Long Shanyuan, was addicted to women day and night. Even though he appeared weak, he would basically recover after resting for a few days, which shows how robust his physique is.</p><p></p><p>"Does the potential come from the bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were slightly closed as he carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Even with such a rough perception, he noticed that there were dozens of bloodlines within Long Shanyuan's body. Some of these bloodlines were faint, probably separated by many years, but among these dozens of bloodlines, more than ten belonged to the seventh-level bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>"It's somewhat similar to those bloodline evolution families in the main universe." Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the "Knight" cultivation system in this world is to continuously tap into the power of bloodlines. For example, the Long Shan cultivation method is to continuously improve strength by stimulating the "Mountain Dragon" bloodline within the Long Shan family.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many mixed bloodlines. How promiscuous was the ancestor of the Long Shan family?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The "Mountain Dragon" bloodline of the Long Shan family comes from a dragon beast with a body similar to mountain ranges. How to integrate the bloodline of this dragon beast into the Long Shan family is also a mystery.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline evolution families in the main world mostly extract the bloodlines of those special lifeforms, make them into bloodline elixirs, and finally integrate them into their own bloodlines in the form of elixirs.</p><p></p><p>But it's unknown for the Long Shan family and many other families, and even the imperial families.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan has not heard of the concept of "bloodline elixirs" in this world.</p><p></p><p>"By tapping into the power of bloodlines, the knights in this world have a fast cultivation speed, but of course, their lifespans are also very short."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Those bloodline evolution families in the main universe, although they also tap into their own bloodlines, they also cultivate other evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>They don't completely rely on the power of bloodlines like the knights in this world.</p><p></p><p>The result of doing so is that unless they are the demigods at the seventh level who have ignited the divine fire, even the legendary knights at the sixth level find it difficult to live past a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It's even more so for the fourth and fifth level knights. Living past two hundred years is considered longevity.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just completely relying on the power of bloodlines, but more so the restrictions of the world's laws?" Lin Yuan came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much one relies on the power of bloodlines, after entering the sixth level, equivalent to the sixth stage evolutionists in the main world, the essence of life is there. How could they not live past a thousand years?</p><p></p><p>The only possibility is the laws of this world.</p><p></p><p>For example, during the eighth crossing, those supreme immortal kings in the Spirit Realm, as long as they don't die from accidents, can almost endure through one era after another, with a lifespan far exceeding the eighth stage evolutionists in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Unless the divine fire is ignited, their lifespans are all very short.</p><p></p><p>"However, the lifespan of the eighth-level deities seems to be frighteningly long, forming a stark contrast with those below the seventh level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the sky again.</p><p></p><p>If the demigods at the seventh level who have ignited the divine fire still have the possibility of the divine fire being extinguished,</p><p></p><p>Then the eighth-level deities can truly be called eternally existing, residing high above in the ocean of light or the abyss of darkness, overlooking the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Especially those twenty-four main gods who wield some authority over the laws, they pose a greater threat to Lin Yuan than even Hun Yi, the strongest ninth-stage life of the Tianyu Clan who opened up more than 30 million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the descending clan has a residence time of 1,110 years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not in a hurry. With the full support of the Long Shan family, as long as Lin Yuan recovers a certain amount of strength, the subsequent strength growth will be completely snowballing.</p><p></p><p>"It's just..."</p><p></p><p>"This world places so much importance on bloodlines, and the ancient and mysterious origins of the bloodlines within the body, the 'Physical Divine Abilities' born from this... I'm sure they won't be very weak."</p><p></p><p>An expectant look appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Physical Divine Abilities are the exclusive abilities of the martial arts evolution path. When cultivated to the sixth stage, divine abilities are awakened based on the bloodlines within the body.</p><p></p><p>For other martial arts evolutionists, they can awaken at most one Physical Divine Ability in this lifetime, but Lin Yuan, with the ability to descend with the consciousness of the Myriad Realms Gate, can awaken one divine ability after another.</p><p></p><p>However, even among Physical Divine Abilities, there are differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>The three Physical Divine Abilities currently mastered by Lin Yuan‚ÄîRebirth by Dripping Blood, Moving Mountains, and Strengthening.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Rebirth by Dripping Blood and Strengthening are of great help to Lin Yuan, but Moving Mountains... as a pure power divine ability, its use is slightly smaller.</p><p></p><p>It is weaker than the first two in terms of both scope of application and intensity.</p><p></p><p>With so many bloodline origins in the body he descended into this time, the Physical Divine Ability awakened in the end shouldn't be too bad.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>This day is a big day for the Long Shan family. It is said that the first viscount of Long Shan established the Long Shan family on this day, opening up more than 2,000 years of absolute overlord rule of the Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>As the third-ranked heir of the Long Shan family, Lin Yuan naturally would not be absent on such a grand occasion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yuan, the sun is so hot today... It's making me dizzy. What should I do..." A young girl from the Long Shan family blushed and leaned towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a bit scorching, but for the physically strong members of the Long Shan family, this bit of heat was nothing. They could stand for three days and three nights without issue.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with your cultivation?" Lin Yuan glanced at the girl. Her name was Long Shanling, and she was considered a distant cousin of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure the purity of the bloodline, the Long Shan family generally practiced intermarriage within the clan. As long as they were not direct blood relatives, they could become partners.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. I just feel the sun is making my body so hot." Long Shanling continued to lean on Lin Yuan, saying somewhat coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"I think the heat on your body is not from the sun, but from your own burning, right?" Another girl on the side couldn't hold back and said with a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"Long Shanlan, will you die if you don't speak?" Long Shanling immediately glared.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what's wrong? You can speak but I can't? Is there such a rule in our Long Shan family?" The girl named Long Shanlan immediately retorted.</p><p></p><p>"If you're tired, rest for a bit first. I should go back to cultivate." After saying that, Lin Yuan turned and left.</p><p></p><p>As the third-ranked heir of the Long Shan family, after Lin Yuan "turned over a new leaf" and it was announced that he sensed the qi sea within five hours, he received a lot of attention from the Long Shan family</p><p></p><p>The Pursuit of the Dragon Mountain Family's Girls</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Lin Yuan is good-looking, with a kind of androgynous beauty that is different from the rugged and masculine qualities of the Dragon Mountain family. Moreover, Lin Yuan is likely to become a fourth-level knight in the future and inherit the viscount position of the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that he has become the most popular male in the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>Countless age-appropriate girls are eyeing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even those girls who are a bit older or younger are also eyeing him.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't like an outstanding man? Not to mention, Lin Yuan is not just outstanding, he is simply perfect.</p><p></p><p>"Just now I was so close, Long Shan Lan, you ruined my plan." Long Shan Ling said angrily as soon as she saw Lin Yuan leave.</p><p></p><p>"Ruined your plan? Long Shan Ling, can't you see that Brother Yuan has no interest in you at all?" Long Shan Lan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>She had also pursued Lin Yuan, but was directly rejected. At this moment, seeing Long Shan Ling getting handsy with Lin Yuan, she couldn't help but interrupt.</p><p></p><p>"I think, Brother Yuan should like someone more gentle, you are all too direct, it will scare Brother Yuan," a young girl spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Scare Brother Yuan?" Long Shan Lan rolled her eyes.</p><p></p><p>It's only been a few years, and everyone has forgotten about Long Shan Yuan's past?</p><p></p><p>But the girls of the Dragon Mountain family don't mind if a man has too much of a romantic history, as long as he is strong and outstanding enough.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I still feel that Brother Yuan has some good feelings for me, at least he didn't reject me just now."</p><p></p><p>Long Shan Ling thought a little infatuated, but immediately gritted her teeth and looked at Long Shan Lan, "Long Shan Lan, if you dare to ruin my plan again next time, I will be at odds with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Humph, Brother Yuan will definitely have the strength of a fourth-level knight in the future and inherit the viscount position. He will only be with a woman who can help him. I, Long Shan Yao, my grandfather is also a fourth-level great knight, and can help Brother Yuan take control of the family. I am the most suitable for Brother Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Another young girl walked to the side and said.</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather was none other than Long Shan Zhu. Although Viscount Long Shan and Long Shan Zhu decided that they must not reveal Lin Yuan's true talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>But Long Shan Zhu kept hinting to his granddaughter to pursue Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that Lin Yuan's true potential and talent were countless times stronger than what was shown to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Although he dared not say that he would become a demigod who ignited the divine fire, because the Dragon Mountain family did not have detailed information about the seventh-level demigods.</p><p></p><p>But at least there was a good chance of becoming a sixth-level legendary knight.</p><p></p><p>That was a legendary knight. As long as he was willing to serve the empire, he could at least obtain the rank of "Earl", and the territory he commanded would be dozens of times larger than Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the wife of an earl was an extremely rare honor in the entire empire.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly arrived at his cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>"The source energy has been replenished, and next I can cultivate." Lin Yuan sat cross-legged and took a Dragon Origin Fruit and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>The vast power flowed through his body and was quickly absorbed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is still stable, and Xilan has not been caught up by Hun Yi." Lin Yuan felt a little relieved after sensing it with the help of the Myriad Realms Gate.</p><p></p><p>He had descended to this world for almost a week, and a little over half an hour had passed in the time flow of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>For such a long time, Hun Yi still had not caught up with Xilan, so there should be no accidents in the future.</p><p></p><p>Since Xilan dared to promise Lin Yuan that she could persist for three years, she should have enough confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Secret Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly, and the feeling of being called from the core area of this secret realm made him a little curious now.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, this world should be the hometown of one of the followers of that 'Your Majesty' in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>What that follower longed for the most was to return to his hometown, and he even used the coordinates of his hometown as the most precious treasure among the many treasures he left behind.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the hometown that the other party had been thinking about before his death was now in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>The graceful woman in black gauze stood there, frowning, "After returning to Dragon Mountain City, Long Shan Yuan actually became interested in cultivation, and sensed the Qihai within five hours?"</p><p></p><p>The graceful woman was a little dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>That good-for-nothing Long Shan Yuan actually had the potential to become a fourth-level knight?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>It can no longer be said to be potential.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Qihai within five hours, coupled with being the third-ranked heir of the Dragon Mountain family and receiving the resource tilt of the entire Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that unless there are unexpected circumstances, he will definitely be able to become a fourth-level knight.</p><p></p><p>"God's envoy, what should we do now?" The fox woman below was also incredulous. She was clear about Long Shan Yuan's character, and the two of them had been entangled for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Now Long Shan Yuan must be under the key protection of the Dragon Mountain family, which is a bit troublesome." The graceful woman felt it was tricky.</p><p></p><p>If it was the previous Long Shan Yuan, even though he was the third-ranked heir, he did not have the qualifications to become a knight and would not receive too much attention from the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The graceful woman even suspected that there were fourth-level knights secretly protecting Long Shan Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing now is to see Long Shan Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Aptitude is destined by the heavens, there's no way around it. But Long Shan Yuan likes to enjoy himself and is fond of women. As long as he sees you, he will definitely not be able to control himself."</p><p></p><p>The graceful woman looked at the fox woman, "You go to Dragon Mountain City and try to see Long Shan Yuan, only then can we grasp him in our hands again."</p><p></p><p>After replenishing the source energy, most of Lin Yuan's time was basically spent on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Except for occasionally seeing his parents, even Da Shan rarely saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the fourth-level knights of the Dragon Mountain family also wanted to give some pointers to Lin Yuan, so that this future hope of the family could take fewer detours.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, something that once again caused the mental state of the fourth-level knights of the Dragon Mountain family to collapse happened.</p><p></p><p>Their guidance to Lin Yuan had no effect at all. Lin Yuan seemed to be born to become a knight.</p><p></p><p>Those knight theories and techniques, as long as they said the first few words, Lin Yuan could completely comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>As time went by, these fourth-level knights gave up the idea of shining for the family, because they finally found that they couldn't guide Lin Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, as they kept talking with Lin Yuan, these fourth-level knights were horrified to realize, was the path they had taken wrong? Was the most correct way to cultivate the Dragon Mountain family's Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method no longer correct?</p><p></p><p>On Lin Yuan's side, after sending away those fourth-level knights of the family, Lin Yuan's cultivation began to soar.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient resources, after going through the early stage, Lin Yuan was improving every moment.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Time began to pass silently.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a hundred years had passed.</p>

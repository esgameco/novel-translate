        <h1>Chapter 714</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Incredible."</p><p></p><p>"Unheard of."</p><p></p><p>"Inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>One Eternal Lord after another spoke up, expressing their feelings.</p><p></p><p>As time beings, they had watched countless future timelines and seen even the most fantastical futures. </p><p></p><p>But something like Lin Yuan - if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they simply wouldn't have believed it.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability gazed into the distance at the Origin World and said, "Everyone, I plan to go back for a visit and meet that young friend 'Galaxy'."</p><p></p><p>Although in many future timelines, the Lord of Immeasurability judged that Lin Yuan was not difficult to get along with.</p><p></p><p>But in the more distant future, they and the other Eternal Lords would still need to rely on him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, meeting in advance to establish a good relationship was extremely important.</p><p></p><p>In futures where Lin Yuan existed, the so-called Demon Calamity could basically be overcome.</p><p></p><p>So what the Eternal Lords were considering was how to interact with Lin Yuan after the Demon Calamity ended.</p><p></p><p>"Go back for a visit?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Lord of Black Void, Lord of Wu Mountain and other Eternal Lords changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>To return to the Origin World, one needed to cross the barriers separating light and darkness.</p><p></p><p>When the world underwent great changes, the Eternal Lords had expended many isolation methods to restrain the light body of the Lord of Heavenly Light, resulting in the current stalemate.</p><p></p><p>This not only locked down the light body of the Lord of Heavenly Light, but also thoroughly locked themselves here.</p><p></p><p>But nothing is absolute. At the level of Eternal Lords, there were many methods. To break free of this lockdown and briefly return to the Origin World was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, it would come at an enormous cost.</p><p></p><p>And even if they returned to the Origin World, it would only be as a consciousness avatar, which was no match for the dark magic body of the Lord of Heavenly Light.</p><p></p><p>Therefore it was basically meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the thirteen Eternal Lords had not even considered this idea.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Even if it came at a huge cost.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could return to the Origin World and establish early contact with 'Galaxy', any price would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>As time beings, their perspective and plans were not limited to the present, but extended to the distant future.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps paying a huge price to go back would be very disadvantageous in the short term.</p><p></p><p>But over a longer timeline, as long as they could befriend Lin Yuan and befriend the future Time Lord, what did this small cost matter? Moreover, Lin Yuan was definitely not an ordinary Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>Possessing this kind of almost certain future, his background was so great that even the thirteen Eternal Lords dared not think too deeply about it.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back too."</p><p></p><p>"Since you're going back, Immeasurability, I'll go as well."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other twelve Eternal Lords immediately made their decisions.</p><p></p><p>If the Lord of Immeasurability hadn't brought this up, some Eternal Lords might have hesitated due to the huge cost.</p><p></p><p>But since the Lord of Immeasurability planned to go back, the other Eternal Lords naturally had to follow.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if twelve Eternal Lords went back and became familiar with young friend 'Galaxy', leaving just one Eternal Lord who didn't go,</p><p></p><p>Many future opportunities in the timelines would likely have nothing to do with that one.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body sat cross-legged, with chaotic energy drifting around him.</p><p></p><p>As countless particle worlds continued to open up within his body, Lin Yuan's aura grew increasingly profound, like an unprecedentedly huge black hole, instinctively devouring all the surrounding void and chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Runes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not devote much attention to opening up particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>In the second Origin World, he had already gone through this process once, so now it was just a repeat, naturally relaxed and effortless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's focus was on the application of runes.</p><p></p><p>"Time."</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought from Lin Yuan, countless tiny runes condensed between his thoughts, forming miniature timelines that continuously extended into the future.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the level where thoughts instantly became runes, Lin Yuan's mastery of runes was now like instinct. His observation of timelines was the same - although far from being as clear or as numerous as true time beings.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling of absolute control over timelines still fascinated him.</p><p></p><p>"Future."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at one of his future timelines.</p><p></p><p>In this timeline, Lin Yuan transformed into a true time being after 8,000 years, and then began to try exploring dimensional spaces beyond the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>After that, as Lin Yuan continued to observe deeper, he felt a certain resistance.</p><p></p><p>"The further into the future timeline I observe, the more resistance I encounter. I'm not yet a true time being, so even though I've found a shortcut to observe time beings, I still can't see very far."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"However, once I break through to the thirteenth level, with my understanding of the Rune Dao and the transformation of my life essence, the number and depth of timelines I can see should far exceed other newly ascended time beings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently pondered.</p><p></p><p>Not yet having become a time being, he could already attempt to observe timelines on his own.</p><p></p><p>If he became a time being, the improvement he gained would definitely far surpass other newly ascended time beings.</p><p></p><p>"But my future..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spent most of the day observing dozens of his timelines, and found that it was truly as the six Progenitors had said - in every timeline he broke through to the thirteenth level and became a time being.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the reason for this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wondered inwardly. As his realm and strength increased, he increasingly realized</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of breaking through from the twelfth level to the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the time loop, there is no certainty, at most it only increases the possibility of breakthrough, but in his case, it's certain? "Is it related to the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his heart, "Or rather, even the time loop cannot stop the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made many associations.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>These were all just Lin Yuan's speculations. </p><p></p><p>As for whether it was true or not, he would only know after falling into the time loop.</p><p></p><p>"With my current foundation, even without relying on the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, the possibility of breaking through the time loop is very high."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, practitioners of the martial arts evolution path are spread across dozens of dimensional spaces, the sheer number forming an incredibly solid 'anchor'.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, with the inheritance left by the Lord of Celestial Light, Lin Yuan's use of runes had reached the level of manifesting with a thought. Even if deeply trapped in a time loop, he could 'cheat' to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand years, Lin Yuan had comprehended thousands of great Dao rules, with a breadth of knowledge that probably surpassed even true time beings.</p><p></p><p>Once trapped in a time loop, even if faced with challenges he had never encountered before, one key opens a hundred doors - the more areas mastered, the more ways to cope.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan really wanted to know how long the time loop could trap him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Everywhere Lin Yuan looked, there were runes. He quickly saw through most of the essence of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Is that where the thirteenth level time beings of the chaotic void reside?" Using the power of runes, Lin Yuan discovered seven locations in the chaotic void with profound auras that he temporarily couldn't see through. He deduced these should be the time beings of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Seven time beings?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, this was also the first time he learned the number of time beings in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void had dozens of special places, but that didn't mean there were dozens of time beings. Each time being established multiple special places to make up for the hidden dangers they observed about the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic void is not a source world, yet it can give birth to quite a few time beings." Lin Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The first source world only had six time beings, which were the six ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also because the first source world was still young and didn't have enough time to nurture new time beings.</p><p></p><p>"I can challenge the thirteenth level at any time now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts, vaguely sensing wisps of time power swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>This was because Lin Yuan's life essence was too powerful, so powerful that time power actively attached to him. As long as Lin Yuan decided to challenge the thirteenth level and start enhancing his life essence, these time powers would immediately form a loop, trapping him inside.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until the particle world is fully opened."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the dozen or so future timelines he had just seen, he didn't try to challenge the thirteenth level until thousands of years later at the earliest.</p><p></p><p>Since his future self did so, there must be a reason for it, and he didn't need to go against it.</p><p></p><p>At least in these future outcomes, he successfully entered the thirteenth level. If he went against it and created a new timeline, it could lead to variables in his entry to the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>That would give Lin Yuan a headache.</p><p></p><p>The second source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, faint demonic qi could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>"Demon God."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, "The so-called Demon God is the dark demonic body forged by the Lord of Celestial Light, so where is His light body?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought arose,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had the answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The light body of the Lord of Celestial Light was held up by the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Since the great change of heaven and earth began, all the Eternal Lords disappeared together, and the light body of the Lord of Celestial Light also vanished.</p><p></p><p>The demonic qi enveloping the entire source world all originated from the dark demonic body of the Lord of Celestial Light, that is, the Demon God, but the light body had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of all the Eternal Lords and the light body of the Lord of Celestial Light together.</p><p></p><p>The reason was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Lord of Celestial Light, His light body's strength surpasses the dark demonic body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, "I guess the thirteen Eternal Lords are now in a stalemate with the light body of the Lord of Celestial Light."</p><p></p><p>If the thirteen Eternal Lords had suppressed the light body, they should have returned by now.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't suppressed it, but were instead suppressed by the light body of the Lord of Celestial Light, then the light body should have returned as well.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Celestial Light." Lin Yuan once again felt the power of this Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Under the premise of losing His mind and will, His two true bodies respectively held up the entire source world and thirteen Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh~ The surrounding space-time stirred up waves, and one after another mighty consciousnesses arrived in an instant, descending not far from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Each mighty consciousness quickly condensed into a towering figure, with a total of thirteen figures standing silently there.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these thirteen figures caused the entire source world to start shaking, endless demonic qi began to churn, and the aura of the Demon God showed signs of re-coalescing.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled and looked towards the thirteen towering figures not far away.</p><p></p><p>The leading towering figure wore a smile, looking at Lin Yuan with kindness in his eyes, "Wuliang greets the young friend."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

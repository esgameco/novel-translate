        <h1>Chapter 722</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the way to the Yin-Yang Twin Flowers, Lin Yuan never stopped observing his own future timeline.</p><p></p><p>Through his experiences in the timeline, he conducted repeated "trial and error".</p><p></p><p>He judged whether he should take action or not, and the various possible consequences that would arise after taking action.</p><p></p><p>If he could bear the consequences of taking action, he would take action to seize the opportunity. </p><p></p><p>If not, or if the price to pay was too high, he would observe from afar.</p><p></p><p>And at this point in time, and in this position, was where Lin Yuan had observed in the timeline to be the opportunity of greatest value he would encounter.</p><p></p><p>"In the future timeline, this opportunity has already been targeted by two time beings. They have even been planning for countless ages for this opportunity, just waiting for it to mature today," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he observed the timeline to this point, it would become blurry and unclear.</p><p></p><p>But through subsequent in-depth observation, Lin Yuan discovered that those two time beings were both quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>If he took action to compete with them for this opportunity, it could possibly lead to attracting the attention of a true Time Lord through these two time beings.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the Chaos Void, or the First Source World, or the Second Source World.</p><p></p><p>The time beings Lin Yuan had encountered were all extremely friendly towards him, even going to great lengths to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>This was because he coexisted with them in the same dimensional space, and was a natural ally.</p><p></p><p>When this dimensional space collapsed and entered the dimensional gap, they would be time beings of the same camp.</p><p></p><p>But for time beings outside the dimensional space, it was not necessarily so.</p><p></p><p>After perceiving the special nature of Lin Yuan's future timeline, their first thought might not be to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>It was also possible they would report this matter to a Time Lord they could contact.</p><p></p><p>Offending a future Time Lord like Lin Yuan was probably something no time being would be willing to do.</p><p></p><p>But leaking information about Lin Yuan to another Time Lord was still a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only a possibility.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan could not fail to guard against it.</p><p></p><p>So on the way to the Yin-Yang Twin Flowers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried as much as possible to avoid any contact with other time beings.</p><p></p><p>With the methods of time beings, they could explore the relevant timeline along the chain of cause and effect in the instant of making contact.</p><p></p><p>And thereby learn Lin Yuan's true background.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Previously when Lin Yuan discovered this opportunity in the timeline, after repeated deliberation.</p><p></p><p>He ultimately chose to give it up.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity was certainly of great value.</p><p></p><p>But before reaching the thirteenth level, Lin Yuan did not want to be too high-profile.</p><p></p><p>However now? With the awakening of the eighth physical divine ability 'Lord's Status'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's own timeline began to be sealed off.</p><p></p><p>Even if he came into contact with other time beings, they would find it very difficult to detect anything.</p><p></p><p>Peering into Lin Yuan's timeline was much harder than peering into the timeline of a time being of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"I can give it a try," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood silently in the boundless dimensional gap, observing timeline after timeline with each breath.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by the Lord's Status, the timelines Lin Yuan saw were much easier to observe than before. Even when looking at the timelines of those time beings, they were no longer blurry and distorted, but became clear.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Lin Yuan had already observed hundreds or thousands of timelines.</p><p></p><p>They were all timelines where he took action to compete for the opportunity and came into contact with those two time beings.</p><p></p><p>Whether successful or not, no hidden dangers were buried in the process.</p><p></p><p>"In that case," Lin Yuan made up his mind, "I'll take action."</p><p></p><p>At the thirteenth level of time beings, the demand for resources was equally great.</p><p></p><p>The metamorphosis of time beings themselves - which one did not require mountain-like, sea-like resources? The seven time beings of the Chaos Void all had their true selves in closed-door cultivation and slumber in the Chaos Void, but their main battle avatars were basically all fighting in the dimensional gap, competing with other time beings for key resources.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for the other two Source Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Why did the time beings of the three dimensional spaces attach such importance to Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Because as long as Lin Yuan grew up, their pressure would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Time beings were lofty and aloof, but they also faced a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"That opportunity will not fully mature for another hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly. Since he was prepared to take action to compete, he would naturally go all out.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan began to use his Taiji Primordial Spirit as an 'anchor' to summon his true self.</p><p></p><p>It took the Taiji Primordial Spirit decades or even a century to get here.</p><p></p><p>But his true self? With different strength, the speed was naturally different. Plus, with the Taiji Primordial Spirit as an 'anchor', the span of space-time traversal was also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>It would take at most a few years for his true self to arrive here.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, over a hundred years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>A huge black-gray tree of unknown height floated slowly in the boundless dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>This black-gray giant tree was called the Nightmare Tree, a well-known dangerous place in the dimensional gap, but it also nurtured the Nightmare Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Nightmare Clan was born from the Nightmare Tree and possessed many inconceivable methods. With the help of the Nightmare Tree's main body, they had almost become the most powerful force below the time beings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the top of the black-gray Nightmare Tree, a fruit covered in black and gray colors was gradually maturing.</p><p></p><p>This fruit was called the Nightmare Fruit. After refining it, one would experience nightmare after nightmare, which had a marvelous effect on improving one's mental will.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to past Nightmare Fruits, this Nightmare Fruit was much larger.</p><p></p><p>Normal Nightmare Fruits were only ten meters in size.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The diameter of this nightmare fruit reached a massive 10,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, such a huge nightmare fruit, what kind of nightmare could it create? How much could it enhance one's mental willpower?"</p><p></p><p>"A 10,000-meter nightmare fruit?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless members of the Nightmare race went crazy.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they rushed towards the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>At that moment - the space-time around the nightmare tree froze.</p><p></p><p>An incredibly enormous face appeared, gently inhaling towards the nightmare tree.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless Nightmare race members were sucked into that giant mouth. Even the nightmare fruit at the very top began to sway, on the verge of falling.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the great Time Being."</p><p></p><p>Countless Nightmare race members looked utterly desperate. They never imagined that the nightmare fruit produced by the nightmare tree this time would attract a great Time Being.</p><p></p><p>In the dimensional gaps, Time Beings were the undisputed overlords, able to roam freely at will.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand-Faced River, this nightmare fruit is mine."</p><p></p><p>Rumble~ The giant face opened its mouth to inhale. As the nightmare fruit swayed precariously, suddenly a heaven-spanning giant hand condensed nearby, reaching out to grab the fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Hangui, if you want this nightmare fruit, show me what you've got." The giant face seemed to have anticipated this, stopping its inhaling motion and roaring at the giant hand.</p><p></p><p>As 13th-level Time Beings, they had observed the relevant timelines countless times before the nightmare fruit matured, making many preparations.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Space-time shattered into powder.</p><p></p><p>The two Time Beings immediately began fighting fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Time Being 'Thousand-Faced River' or the Time Being 'Ling Hangui', their strengths were at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Only under such circumstances would they take action to compete for the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>Because both sides had hope of seizing the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>If the difference in strength between the two was too great, the weaker one would have no confidence.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't even participate in the fight for the nightmare fruit at all.</p><p></p><p>"Nightmare fruit." Just as the two Time Beings were battling fiercely,</p><p></p><p>A figure silently appeared at the very top of the nightmare tree - it was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This nightmare fruit can greatly enhance a Time Being's mental willpower. Even among the rare treasures at the 13th level, it would be considered uncommon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze revealed desire.</p><p></p><p>The black jade produced by the first source world's Black Jade Nest no longer provided much enhancement to his mental willpower. After reaching the 13th level, it probably wouldn't have any effect at all.</p><p></p><p>At least Lin Yuan had never heard that the six Ancestors needed black jade to enhance their mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>So this nightmare fruit was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>"Collect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached out and collected the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>The 10,000-meter nightmare fruit directly entered Lin Yuan's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it was isolated from cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the nightmare fruit immediately drew the attention of the two Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>In the many future timelines they had observed, only the two of them were competing for the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they had let their guard down, focusing most of their energy on fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>In the future timelines they had seen, only by defeating the other could they ultimately obtain the nightmare fruit.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The nightmare fruit suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>This was beyond the expectations of the two Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>This was a scene that had never appeared in the future timelines they had observed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the two distant Time Beings and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>His figure silently disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>'Thousand-Faced River' suddenly let out an angry roar. An invisible soul attack, following the faint traces of cause and effect, directly struck Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At an infinite distance away.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his mind shook.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of attacks came, originating from the Time Being's furious strike. Even Lin Yuan could only defend with all his might, dispersing it through the infinite sand-like particle worlds within his body before fully blocking it.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't hesitate. With his current strength, to directly confront two Time Beings? Basically impossible.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even confront one normal Time Being easily. In the second source world, Lin Yuan had fought all-out against the Demon God because the Demon God was not a normal Time Being and couldn't observe future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>In terms of escape speed, Lin Yuan believed he was not inferior to any Time Being. His comprehension of the space-time Great Dao was already at the level of Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>By the nightmare tree.</p><p></p><p>The two Time Beings 'Thousand-Faced River' and 'Ling Hangui' looked furious. They had waited for long ages, just waiting for the day this special nightmare fruit would mature. But in the end, it was snatched away by another Time Being?</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly was it?"</p><p></p><p>The Time Being 'Thousand-Faced River' originally planned to directly chase and kill.</p><p></p><p>But the rationality in his heart made him take a look at Lin Yuan's timeline while he was at it.</p><p></p><p>Just one look, and 'Thousand-Faced River' felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The Time Being 'Thousand-Faced River' was shocked. The timeline he observed was blurry and vague, as if completely sealed off. He couldn't see any useful information at all.</p><p></p><p>"Must absolutely not provoke."</p><p></p><p>The Time Being 'Thousand-Faced River' immediately gave up the idea of pursuit and killing.</p><p></p><p>To be able to seal off one's own timeline to such an extent, even if not a Time Lord, it wasn't far off.</p><p></p><p>The other Time Being 'Ling Hangui' also immediately gave up the idea of pursuit, his expression uncertain and wary.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

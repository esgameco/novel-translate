        <h1>Chapter 623</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Flee! Flee! Flee!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens and the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn ignited their physical bodies, spiritual souls, and even the very path they walked, all in the hopes of escaping the towering, mighty man.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Time and space transformed into a prison, with the yellow and black Qi permeating everywhere. The two supreme great sages were trapped within.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens roared, causing the surrounding time and space to violently explode, trying to shatter the yellow and black prison, but unable to budge it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sage of Jade Unicorn had a grave expression. He looked towards the distance, and at that moment they had returned to the original location, with Xuan Huang standing there calmly, his gaze indifferent as he looked down upon them.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, you have not reached the 13th Realm, yet you have forcibly broken free from the time loop. This is courting death," the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn said solemnly, staring intently at the towering, mighty man.</p><p></p><p>The towering man did not speak, his expression calm. He raised his right hand with a flip.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the yellow and black prison trapping the two supreme great sages began to collapse, and the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens and the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn inside started to disintegrate as well.</p><p></p><p>"Last time you survived, but this time, you won't." </p><p></p><p>The towering man's gaze fixed upon them. The Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens and the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn struggled desperately, but were reduced to powder within just a few breaths, their physical bodies, spiritual souls, and the universes within them all turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>"They're dead?" Lin Yuanshen breathed out. </p><p></p><p>The two supreme great sages, just like that, were dead? Lin Yuan had fought against the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens before, and was very clear about the strength of this supreme great sage. As long as he was willing to pay the price, he could easily suppress Lin Yuan in a short time.</p><p></p><p>But this supreme great sage, in the hands of Emperor Xuan Huang, couldn't even last two or three breaths? And the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn, who was no weaker than the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens, had met the same fate?</p><p></p><p>The two supreme great sages, in Lin Yuan's hands, were like the Chaos Lords before him - without any ability to resist at all. "Is the strength of the Invincible Saint so much greater than that of the supreme great sages?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan found this hard to believe. He had also concluded that Emperor Xuan Huang had not reached the 13th Realm, still being at the 12th Realm, but his strength was too powerful, making the supreme great sages at the same level as mere ants.</p><p></p><p>"No, this isn't right." </p><p></p><p>"The Invincible Saint shouldn't be this strong."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was certain of this. The Invincible Saint should be much stronger than the supreme great sages, able to sweep them aside, but the difference in their strengths couldn't be this great.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the time loop?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the towering, mighty man. At this moment, Xuan Huang's state was very strange, caught between the 12th and 13th Realms. He had not yet crossed into the 13th Realm, but had also surpassed the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the complete annihilation of the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens and the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn,</p><p></p><p>the towering man retracted his right hand and looked at Lin Yuan, smiling as he said, "I'm going to deal with some hidden dangers. I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Watching as the towering man disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yellow and Black Universe,</p><p></p><p>the various Chaos Lords were unaware of what had happened in the universe, still discussing the scene of the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens and the Great Sage of Jade Unicorn entering.</p><p></p><p>However, the distant Eye of All Laws and a few other special existences had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the towering man appeared at the entrance of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In a fleeting moment, the Yellow and Black Universe behind him began to infinitely expand and spread, encompassing the four directions of time and space, as well as the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?" </p><p></p><p>"How did he come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the two supreme great sages?"</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Lords were still a bit dazed, not having fully reacted.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed Emperor Xuan Huang!"</p><p></p><p>The broken sword spoke in a low voice. Even though it had already confirmed this earlier, seeing the Yellow and Black reappear, the one who had attempted to break through to the 13th Realm three million years ago, its heart was still somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>As a special existence, they had witnessed too much, even personally experiencing the birth of 13th Realm life.</p><p></p><p>But to forcibly break free from the time loop? That was extremely rare, for one, it was extremely difficult to accomplish, and two, the price was too great.</p><p></p><p>This forcible breaking free was not a normal breakthrough in overcoming the constraints of the time loop, but a different way of breaking free.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuan Huang kid, I didn't expect his heart demon to have such a great influence," the Eye of All Laws sighed. He had once told Lin Yuan that the possibility of Xuan Huang breaking through the time loop was very low, because the heart demon of this supreme great sage was truly too heavy.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>The towering man appeared outside the Yellow and Black Universe, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Chaotic Qi from several surrounding void domains, as well as the thin Chaotic Qi of the desolate void, were all swallowed into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The towering man glanced at the locations of the Eye of All Laws and the other special existences, not paying them much attention, and instead stretched out his right hand, "Come, sword."</p><p></p><p>The Yellow and Black Qi gathered, forming the illusory image of a long sword.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was similar to the Xuan Huang Sword obtained by Lin Yuan, but it was in a phantasmal state. Even so, an unprecedented sharpness was condensed within the illusory long sword.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>The towering man directed two sword slashes towards the depths of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>In an extremely hidden void secret realm,</p><p></p><p>the Great Sage of Chaotic Heavens had a grave expression as he looked towards a certain direction, murmuring, "Xuan Huang?"</p><p></p><p>As one who had experienced...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The supreme great sage of tens of millions of universes naturally had many life-saving methods. His true body alone had four incarnations, and his clones numbered as many as fifty-eight.</p><p></p><p>The four true body incarnations and fifty-eight clones - as long as one of them remained alive, the great sage Hunxiao could quickly recover.</p><p></p><p>As for life-saving methods? In the boundless and vast chaotic void, Hunxiao the great sage had left behind countless life-saving methods.</p><p></p><p>If all of his true body incarnations and clones were to be killed, it would trigger his life-saving methods, allowing him to 'revive' once again.</p><p></p><p>"Tens of millions of universes ago, you killed all of my true body incarnations, breaking through my many life-saving methods. I could only reincarnate, but now? Can you still force me to reincarnate?"</p><p></p><p>Hunxiao the great sage sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A sword light came slashing through the causal space-time towards Hunxiao the great sage.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Hunxiao the great sage had not even reacted when his physical body and soul were quickly extinguished under the sword light.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Hunxiao the great sage's third true body incarnation, located deep within a certain spatial maze, was also slain by a sword light.</p><p></p><p>The fourth true body incarnation was cut down.</p><p></p><p>The first clone of Hunxiao the great sage, hidden deep within the ruins of Taiyan, was slain.</p><p></p><p>The second clone, hidden in a certain special place, was cut down.</p><p></p><p>The third clone, residing in a mysterious space, was also slain.</p><p></p><p>In that same instant, Hunxiao the great sage's three true body incarnations and fifty-eight clones were all cut down.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless chaotic void, the many life-saving methods left behind by Hunxiao the great sage were also struck by sword lights and extinguished.</p><p></p><p>At the same time that Hunxiao the great sage's true bodies, clones, and life-saving methods were extinguished,</p><p></p><p>The same happened to Yulian the great sage. His many true body incarnations and life-saving methods were slain without any resistance under the sword lights that followed the causal space-time.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"This kind of causal space-time fluctuation?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Mysterious Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the causal threads of these two supreme great sages immediately alarmed many ancient great sages in the chaotic void. Many supreme great sages were in seclusion, preparing for the final assault on the Thirteenth Realm, but they were all startled.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, is it the Mysterious Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor? That supreme great sage who rules over tens of thousands of void domains?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't he said to be assaulting the Thirteenth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Some ancient supreme great sages, even if they did not belong to the same era as His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor, had still heard of this supreme great sage. At this moment, they were horrified.</p><p></p><p>In the long history of the chaotic void, there had indeed been instances of supreme great sages being extinguished, but that was during an extremely special period, and the supreme great sages who were extinguished had gone through many fierce battles before their demise.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was unclear whether they were truly extinguished, because at the last moment, supreme great sages could still undergo reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Once reincarnated, the supreme great sages would lose everything - their physical bodies, souls, and so on, but at the same time, their causal threads would be completely severed.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage had used this method to escape the pursuit of the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the causal threads of Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage was too fast.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Emperor... the Mysterious Emperor is settling accounts, clearing out all the great sages who are against the Mysterious Yellow lineage."</p><p></p><p>The many supreme great sages were horrified, but they did not dare to step forward. Tens of millions of universes ago, the Mysterious Emperor already possessed the invincible strength of a great sage. Given enough time, he would be recognized by all the supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>The power he was now displaying was even beyond the normal range of supreme great sages. At this moment, no supreme great sage dared to stand up.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious Yellow Universe,</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man carefully sensed the situation, then slashed out three more sword strikes.</p><p></p><p>After these three sword strikes, three ancient supreme great sages had their causal threads completely extinguished, unable to even reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even tens of millions of universes ago, when Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage reincarnated, they were killed by the Mysterious Emperor without any chance of escape, with all their true body incarnations and clones extinguished. In the end, they were forced to choose reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>But now? Being slain in just one true body incarnation, Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage were far from reaching the point of no return, so they naturally did not immediately reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>They just never imagined that the sword strikes unleashed by the burly and mighty man would possess such terrifying power, instantly extinguishing all their true body incarnations, clones, and life-saving methods.</p><p></p><p>After slashing out five sword strikes, the long sword in the burly and mighty man's hand dissipated, and he stepped into the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Mysterious Yellow Universe,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The causal threads of Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage have been completely extinguished?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had engaged in combat with these two great sages, naturally forming causal connections with them. He could use these causal threads to determine whether they still existed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this could only confirm their existence or not. With Lin Yuan's current mastery of causal threads, he had not yet reached the ability to precisely locate the coordinates of these two supreme great sages through their causal threads.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two supreme great sages would also conceal their own causal threads.</p><p></p><p>But while he could not locate the positions of the two supreme great sages through their causal threads, he could still determine whether they were alive or not based on the existence or disappearance of their causal threads.</p><p></p><p>Now that the causal threads of Hunxiao the great sage and Yulian the great sage had disappeared, this disappearance was so complete, as if they had been erased from existence.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan's thoughts were wandering,</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man appeared not far away, taking a step forward and standing before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I know you have many questions."</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man looked at Lin Yuan, with a faint smile on his face: "Don't be in a hurry, I will explain everything to you."</p><p></p><p>The burly and mighty man paused for a moment, then added another sentence: "Before I perish."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 608</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This Supreme-Grade Treasure"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan emerged from a planet called the Spiritual Treasure Star, examining his harvest.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Treasure Star was one of the places in the Mysterious Yellow Universe where secret treasure weapons were nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the conventional methods of forging secret treasure weapons in the Chaotic Void, the Mysterious Emperor lineage's way of refining secret treasure weapons mainly relied on nurturing.</p><p></p><p>First, they would refine a treasure weapon embryo, then place it in a specific Spiritual Treasure Star. After a long period of nurturing, the secret treasure weapon would naturally be born.</p><p></p><p>This refining method had two major advantages: it was convenient, as one only needed to refine the treasure weapon embryo, and the final secret treasure weapon that was born would often be more powerful than those at the same level.</p><p></p><p>As for the drawbacks? The lack of human intervention meant it took too long.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as one could obtain a powerful secret treasure weapon, spending some extra time was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme-Grade Spiritual and Mental Defense Treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the yellow 'drop' the size of a thumb, as if observing a vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a Supreme-Grade secret treasure weapon or other level secret treasure weapons, the defensive ones were generally more valuable than the offensive ones.</p><p></p><p>After all, protecting one's life was more important than killing methods.</p><p></p><p>Among the Supreme-Grade defensive treasures, the spiritual and mental defense treasures were the rarest.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. Although this Supreme-Grade defensive treasure could not be compared to the Life Divine Stone he had obtained earlier, its value was still very high. Many Chaotic Saints had exhausted entire universes but still could not obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I'm now approaching the inner regions of the Mysterious Yellow Universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. Every being that entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe would randomly appear in the outermost and most peripheral areas.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan continued to explore deeper, he gradually approached the inner regions of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious manifestation was that Lin Yuan could faintly sense the auras of other Chaotic Saints.</p><p></p><p>The auras of Chaotic Saints, when fully unleashed, could be felt even across void domains, but the oppressive rules of the Mysterious Yellow Universe had made it so that Lin Yuan could only detect them when he was close to the inner regions.</p><p></p><p>"There is no other Saint following the same path as me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the surroundings and came to the conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The other Saints did not have the Beast Skin Map, and their understanding of the various regions within the universe was not as comprehensive. Given the vastness of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, the probability of their paths coinciding with Lin Yuan's was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>"Danger will start to appear once I enter the inner regions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave. In the outer regions, obtaining precious treasures was not too difficult, as their value was not too high.</p><p></p><p>As for the three-meter-wide Life Divine Stone? That was a complete exception.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Life Divine Stone nurtured by the Life Source Star would have a very low efficiency. Even after the passage of a universe cycle, the resulting Divine Stone would only be the size of a thumb.</p><p></p><p>A palm-sized Life Divine Stone could save a severely injured Chaotic Saint.</p><p></p><p>A thumb-sized Life Divine Stone could probably only save a Chaotic Realm Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Life Source Star could, at most, nurture normal Chaotic Realm-level precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, a universe cycle had nurtured a thumb-sized Life Divine Stone.</p><p></p><p>What about ten universe cycles? A hundred universe cycles? A thousand or ten thousand universe cycles?</p><p></p><p>Quantitative change leads to qualitative change. The Mysterious Yellow Universe, which had been sealed for millions of universe cycles, allowed Lin Yuan to obtain such a large Life Divine Stone.</p><p></p><p>This was completely a matter of chance and coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Even if there is danger, I have more advantages than those Saints."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the Beast Skin Map had brought him immense help.</p><p></p><p>Starry Tear 'Shard World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow Universe, his true body and main self were currently progressing smoothly, at most encountering the Mysterious Yellow Beasts as obstacles. As for the other Chaotic Realm cultivators? The Mysterious Yellow Universe was too vast, and the hundreds of Venerables and dozens of Saints were like a drop of water in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>"For now, it is still the exploration stage, and there will be no conflicts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The so-called conflicts were mainly between the Saints. Since they had not yet reached the inner regions, the Saints would not encounter each other, and thus could not fight.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that the conflicts between Saints would only occur after they had delved deep into the inner regions.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can actually go and challenge the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Floor of the Magic Jade Black Tower had almost accompanied Lin Yuan from his weak to strong stages.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Twelve Tribulations, Lin Yuan had passed through the Eighth Floor. As for the Ninth Floor? It was completely different from the previous eight floors. The Ninth Floor required facing a mark left behind by the Black Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>Even though this mark had no spiritual intelligence and was more like a fixed 'program', it was still left behind by the Black Tower Master, a peerless Saint.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, the Black Tower Master was not much weaker than Emperor Mysterious, and according to the All-Seeing Eye, Emperor Mysterious was an existence approaching the invincible Saints.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Black Tower Master was also at a similar level of strength. The mark he left behind would at least require a Chaotic Realm peak or even a Chaotic Saint to have a chance of defeating it.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Twelve Tribulations, even if Lin Yuan's Transcendent Dao Realm cultivation reached its peak, he would only be comparable to an ordinary Chaotic Venerable. He naturally had no hope of passing through the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan diverted a thread of his spiritual will, descending into the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>In front of the majestic Nine-Story Black Tower,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's six-armed figure appeared and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at Lin Yuan, his expression was slightly complex.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not descended here for a very long time, and now that he had come, he was probably trying to break through the ninth floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>And based on the six-armed figure Shen Ji's understanding of Lin Yuan, if he did not have a certain degree of confidence, he would not have come here specifically.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Lin Yuan was well aware that to face the imprint left by the Lord of the Jade Pagoda on the ninth floor of the Black Tower, he would not have the idea of breaking through it without reaching the peak of the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Chaos Realm?" The six-armed figure Shen Ji's thoughts scattered. He had watched Lin Yuan grow to this extent, remembering the first time he saw this little guy, he was only at the sixth or seventh level.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had already possessed the strength at the peak of the Chaos Realm?</p><p></p><p>"I will try the ninth floor of the Black Tower," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Go in then," the six-armed figure Shen Ji nodded, not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The doors of the nine-story Black Tower opened.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped in, and immediately appeared on the ninth floor.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the pervasive pressure in the previous eight floors, the ninth floor was empty and desolate, seemingly devoid of anything.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the heavens and earth became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure gradually materialized.</p><p></p><p>He wore a black robe, his gaze indifferent, as if containing the rules of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was the imprint left by the Lord of the Jade Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The first time Lin Yuan faced this imprint of the Lord of the Jade Pagoda, he could not even withstand the Lord's gaze, and his mind was completely shattered and fell into ruin, not even knowing how he was defeated.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Lin Yuan's strength had increased by who knows how many times, and the Lord's gaze, while subtly influencing his mind, could not shake his will.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Jade Pagoda silently looked at Lin Yuan, his gaze devoid of any emotion, and directly raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the heavens, earth, and time all turned into pure darkness, a darkness completely different from the Black Obsidian Saint's Black Obsidian Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability: 'World'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly transformed into a blazing sun, and the cosmic energy outside his body spread out in all directions, faintly contending with the Lord of the Jade Pagoda's Jade Black Darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Without reaching the Chaos Saint realm, he is not an opponent at all."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was certain that even a peak Chaos Realm expert would not be able to break through the ninth floor.</p><p></p><p>"Time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the changes in the surrounding time, not just simple acceleration, deceleration, or reversal, but involving deeper transformations.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Jade Pagoda's strength must have increased significantly after slaying that time blood essence-rich extraordinary life, and he must have gained a great harvest from it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through the eighth floor, he obtained a drop of 'Time Blood' left behind by the Lord of the Jade Pagoda, originating from that time blood essence-rich extraordinary life.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Jade Pagoda did not keep this drop of Time Blood for his own comprehension, but instead left it on the ninth floor of the Black Tower, indicating that this drop of Time Blood was no longer of much help to him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The blazing sun's radiance spread, the cosmic energy outside his body suppressed, and Lin Yuan found himself in a stalemate with the Jade Black Darkness the Lord of the Jade Pagoda had conjured, feeling an unusual discomfort.</p><p></p><p>This discomfort was not because he could not overcome the Lord of the Jade Pagoda, as the Lord's current aura was not as strong as the Dual Source Saint or the Black Obsidian Saint.</p><p></p><p>But the pressure it exerted on Lin Yuan far exceeded the previous two Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Tear the Sky."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's right hand grasped, and five terrifying traces flashed, tearing open five cracks in the endless Jade Black Darkness surrounding the Lord of the Jade Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>However, these five cracks soon closed up again, being enveloped by the endless Jade Black Darkness.</p><p></p><p>"No other choice."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The divine ability "Tear the Sky" was absolutely one of his top five killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>If even this divine ability could not defeat the Lord of the Jade Pagoda, Lin Yuan had no choice but to use his ultimate move.</p><p></p><p>"Universe, Explode!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the cosmic energy outside Lin Yuan's body suddenly began to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the fusion and devouring of the Blazing Sun Source within his body, the explosive power of this technique had surpassed the divine ability "Tear the Sky."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was no longer just a divine ability, but a brand-new method formed by the fusion of the thirteenth-level talent "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic energy outside collapsed, and the Blazing Sun also began to disintegrate, unleashing a terrifying power that tore open every inch of the ninth floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Crashing.</p><p></p><p>The endless Jade Black Darkness conjured by the Lord of the Jade Pagoda also rapidly disintegrated, until the imprint left by the Lord of the Jade Pagoda also quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out from the depths of space-time, his aura in a state of decline.</p><p></p><p>"Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, no longer sensing a trace of the Lord of the Jade Pagoda's aura, and let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed as he looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Strands of Jade Essence gathered and once again formed the figure of the Lord of the Jade Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the initial indifferent and emotionless figure, this newly formed figure of the Lord of the Jade Pagoda had a noticeable difference - the gaze directed at Lin Yuan actually revealed a sense of surprise, as if it had "come alive."</p>

            <p>Chapter 265: The Temptation of the Ninth Heaven (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>A figure descended upon the Seventh Heaven, where "wonders" were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"I've arrived." Lin Yuan smiled as he looked at a Celestial King sitting cross-legged in the distance. This Celestial King was sitting there quietly, and the surrounding void was affected by an invisible force, becoming exceptionally stable, allowing ordinary people to survive.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that even in the First Heaven, at least True Immortal level combat power is required to enter.</p><p></p><p>If a life form below the True Immortal level rashly ascends without the protection of a True Immortal level powerhouse, it simply cannot withstand the pressure from the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>This is the case even in the First Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Normally, only Supreme Celestial Kings can reside in the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Celestial King." Lin Yuan carefully observed that Celestial King, "One of the most famous Celestial Kings in the Three Thousand Dao Realms."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Celestial King is a Supreme Celestial King. Among the Three Thousand Dao Realms, there is a realm called the Supreme Dao Realm, which is the place where the Supreme Celestial King's Dao lineage is passed down.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once had the people of the Martial Shrine collect many immortal cultivation techniques, among which was the "Supreme Jade Pure Immortal Scripture", which was created by the Supreme Celestial King and deliberately spread.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of killing power, the Supreme Celestial King is not as good as the Heaven Opening Celestial King, but in terms of overall strength, the two should be at the same level." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Among Supreme Celestial Kings, there are also differences in strength. Some Supreme Celestial Kings who have mastered complete Transformative Powers are stronger than other Supreme Celestial Kings, and some Supreme Celestial Kings have even mastered several complete Transformative Powers.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Eighth Stage Invincible Beings in the main world who have lifespan limitations, the Supreme Celestial Kings of the Spirit Realm can almost be said to coexist with the Spirit Realm and have ample time to comprehend various Transformative Powers.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor." The Supreme Celestial King opened his eyes, looked at Lin Yuan, and greeted him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, although Lin Yuan had not formally taken action,</p><p></p><p>with the perception of Supreme Celestial Kings, they basically realized that Lin Yuan's strength was unfathomable,</p><p></p><p>so whether it was the Heaven Opening Celestial King, the Supreme Celestial King, or other Supreme Celestial Kings, they were all willing to befriend Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Lin Yuan had befriended many Supreme Celestial Kings. Those who could be in the Seventh Heaven were all Supreme Celestial Kings. Whenever Lin Yuan saw one, he would take the initiative to communicate with them.</p><p></p><p>He tried to trade for the Transformative Powers they had mastered.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Opening asked me to ask you, how are your preparations?" Lin Yuan looked at the Supreme Celestial King and said.</p><p></p><p>"I am ready." The Supreme Celestial King's expression became solemn, and he said seriously: "Those old fogeys from the Prehistoric Era who refuse to die have occupied the Eighth Heaven for so long, it's about time they moved aside."</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Tribulation Transcending Celestial Kings like the Purple-Robed Elder, it is difficult to come into contact with matters related to the Prehistoric Era.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of Supreme Celestial Kings, the Prehistoric Era is not much of a secret.</p><p></p><p>Since the end of the Prehistoric Era and the beginning of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era, those Supreme Celestial Kings who survived from the Prehistoric Era have occupied the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>And they forbid the Supreme Celestial Kings born in the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era from going up.</p><p></p><p>So all along, Supreme Celestial Kings like the Heaven Opening Celestial King and the Supreme Celestial King, who were born in the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era, have been constantly trying to attack the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In order to explore the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the Prehistoric Era or the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era, all Supreme Celestial Kings are clear about one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, there is a great secret in the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This sentence is not a rumor.</p><p></p><p>The "Heavenly Beings" here are rumored to possibly be existences that surpass the Celestial King level.</p><p></p><p>The end of the Prehistoric Era is also related to the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>All Supreme Celestial Kings have an incomparable desire for the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It's just that now, the Eighth Heaven leading to the Ninth Heaven is occupied by those Supreme Celestial Kings from the Prehistoric Era. How can the Supreme Celestial Kings born in the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era just watch?</p><p></p><p>So for millions of years, every few hundred thousand years, the Heaven Opening Celestial King and other Supreme Celestial Kings would attempt to attack the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>And just now, the "preparation" Lin Yuan mentioned was the preparation for the Heaven Opening Celestial King and other Supreme Celestial Kings to once again launch an attack on the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Of course, so far, it is still those Supreme Celestial Kings from the Prehistoric Era who have the upper hand. The Heaven Opening Celestial King and other Supreme Celestial Kings' repeated plans to invade the Eighth Heaven have all failed.</p><p></p><p>"Prehistoric Era..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. The reason he joined the Heaven Opening Celestial King, the Supreme Celestial King, and other Supreme Celestial Kings was not only for the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It was more about the Transformative Powers mastered by those Supreme Celestial Kings from the Prehistoric Era.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, Lin Yuan had collected a strand of Transformative Power mastered by almost all the Supreme Celestial Kings in the current era.</p><p></p><p>But he had rarely come into contact with those Supreme Celestial Kings from the Prehistoric Era.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Supreme Celestial King, Lin Yuan returned to his "residence" in the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I have made great progress in these three hundred years." Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, especially in his comprehension of the Universal Forces, with the Transformative Powers of the various Supreme Celestial Kings as reference.</p><p></p><p>In just three hundred years, Lin Yuan had comprehended more than thirty kinds of Universal Forces.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were four that could be considered high-grade Universal Forces.</p><p></p><p>The Force of Heaven Opening, the Force of Destruction, the Force of Immeasurability, and the Force of Balance.</p><p></p><p>As for ordinary Universal Forces, there were nearly thirty kinds, such as Primordial Purple Qi, Infinite Cutting, Fluctuation Domain, Supreme Yang Thunder, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan had only initially comprehended these Universal Forces and had not delved deep into them.</p><p></p><p>According to the classification of the Supreme Celestial Kings in the Spirit Realm, each Transformative Power can be divided into three levels: the First Heavenly Realm, the Second Heavenly Realm, and the Third Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only comprehended to the First Heavenly Realm before stopping and turning to comprehend new Transformative Powers.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most efficient method. First, comprehend these Transformative Powers, then bring them to the main world and transform them into Universal Forces.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the world coordinates of the Spirit Realm and could descend into this realm at any time, it required the expenditure of ten strands of Realm Breaking Source Power, so he had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Although the dozens of Transformative Powers he had comprehended were only at the First Heavenly Realm level, they involved four high-grade Transformative Powers.</p><p></p><p>Just taking the high-grade Transformative Power of Immeasurability as an example, it encompassed many ordinary Transformative Powers, including Primordial Purple Qi, Fluctuation Domain, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Infinite Cutting was also one aspect of the high-grade Transformative Power of Heaven Opening.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, not all Supreme Celestial Kings have mastered high-grade Transformative Powers. If ordinary Transformative Powers can be cultivated to the Third Heavenly Realm, they will be close to the Second Heavenly Realm of high-grade Transformative Powers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart. Most Transformative Celestial Kings mastered several ordinary Transformative Powers at the Third Heavenly Realm, and their combat power was not much weaker than the Heaven Opening Celestial King.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that it was too difficult for high-grade Transformative Powers to be cultivated to the Third Heavenly Realm. Even the Heaven Opening Celestial King...</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Immortal King stopped at the second level.</p><p></p><p>"The dozens of creation powers I have mastered, even if they are all at the first level of the Heavenly Realm, when combined together, should not be much weaker than a certain high-level creation power at the third level?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he only comprehended one or two high-level creation powers, with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability, he might be able to cultivate them to the third level within three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not meet Lin Yuan's expectations. There were so many creation powers in the Spirit Realm. When brought to the main world, they would transform into universal powers. The quantity was definitely more important than the quality.</p><p></p><p>The quality could be improved after returning to the main world, but if the quantity was not satisfactory, he would have to pay the price of ten strands of boundary-breaking source power to descend to the Spirit Realm again.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending dozens of creation powers was only a part of Lin Yuan's gains from three hundred years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the perfection of the Eighth Stage Realm of the Martial Dao, Lin Yuan had also surpassed the third stage and entered the fourth stage.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's conception, the Eighth Stage Realm was divided into four stages. Reaching the fourth stage basically meant entering the final phase.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to the Eighth Stage Realm of many evolutionary paths in the main world, which was also divided into only four stages.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eighth Stage Invincible, which was superior to the Eighth Stage, it was essentially also at the fourth stage, but had mastered a certain universal power, belonging to an unreplicable case.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the main world has great restrictions on universal powers. My Taiji Power belongs to a universal power. Later generations of martial arts cultivators, even if they follow my footsteps step by step, will not be able to transform this kind of universal power again," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Taiji Power didn't work, one could try other powers.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Five Elements Power - metal, wood, water, fire, and earth - mutually generate and restrain each other.</p><p></p><p>Once the five basic rules were thoroughly comprehended and the Five Elements rules were integrated, it would surely become another universal power.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao encompassed all Daos and theoretically had the possibility of giving birth to many universal powers.</p><p></p><p>"There is also the spatial rule model."</p><p></p><p>A faint spatial fluctuation appeared in the depths of Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that there were more than seven thousand core spatial models. The more there were, the greater the difficulty of comprehension later on. Under such circumstances, Lin Yuan was still able to comprehend more than one thousand six hundred types, which was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Four thousand six hundred core spatial models, using the main world's Eighth Stage evolutionary beings as a template, the inner world should have a size of 6.8 million li in circumference."</p><p></p><p>The more spatial models one comprehended, the larger one's inner world would be. Theoretically, if an Eighth Stage evolutionary being comprehended 7,782 core spatial models, the size of their inner world would reach 10 million li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>"But that is the size of a normal Eighth Stage evolutionary being's inner world. The size of my inner world..." A hint of unusual color appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>After the enhancement of the mysterious gourd, the size of Lin Yuan's inner world had nearly reached 70 million li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>Such a vast inner world, let alone human Eighth Stage evolutionary beings, even special lifeforms with supreme bloodlines like the Starry Sea Roc were far from reaching it.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, the upper limit of the Starry Sea Roc's inner world was 50 million li in circumference, which was also the reason why the Starry Sea Roc was known as a supreme bloodline. The upper limit of their race was five times that of humans.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's inner world size even exceeded the upper limit of the Starry Sea Roc's inner world by a large margin, which was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that the inner world of 70 million li in circumference was still far from being Lin Yuan's upper limit.</p><p></p><p>"The gourd..."</p><p></p><p>The inner world exceeded the same level of spatial comprehension of Eighth Stage evolutionary beings by tenfold, naturally because Lin Yuan's rarity of the liquid inside the mysterious gourd had reached the fourth kind.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven kinds of liquids - red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple - Lin Yuan had begun to absorb the green liquid.</p><p></p><p>The color of the mysterious gourd had also transformed into a grayish-green.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty of absorbing the green liquid is much greater than the previous three kinds of liquids. I started absorbing this kind of liquid twenty years ago, but until now, the amplification effect on the inner world and physical body has not even doubled..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He could predict that the absorption would become slower and slower later on, especially for the cyan, blue, and purple liquids. Lin Yuan even doubted whether they were prepared for Eighth Stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I have already profited immensely. Gaining an additional tenfold size of the inner world out of nowhere, I guess even the Supremes would find it unbelievable, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't know if the Supremes could achieve this, but at least with his multiple identities as a seventh-level citizen, Star Lord, and the founder of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, he had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Now the strength of this Taiji Avatar of mine is far weaker than my true body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the mysterious gourd, the strength of the Taiji Avatar and the true body wouldn't differ much.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Power, Primordial Chaos Power, and other universal powers mastered by the true body could also be mastered by the Taiji Avatar.</p><p></p><p>In fact, due to the nature of the spiritual energy body, the Taiji Avatar would be even more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Due to the difference in the inner world...</p><p></p><p>The inner world opened up by the true body had reached 70 million li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>With a tenfold difference, the true body and the avatar were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>Three Thousand Dao Realms.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Wang Domain.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>After three hundred years of development, the Martial Temple had now become a behemoth in the East Yun Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Its influence had even transcended the East Yun Dao Realm and spread to dozens of nearby Dao Realms and hundreds of Dao Realms.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the Martial Dao cultivation system, if one looked at the entire Three Thousand Dao Realms, might not be as great as the Immortal Dao, but in the East Yun Dao Realm and the dozens of nearby Dao Realms, its influence was definitely in a league of its own.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Dao could not suppress the Martial Dao in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that Martial Ancestor personally presided over the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, Martial Ancestor had appeared several times to give lectures, expounding on the essence of the Martial Dao to the living beings, leading countless geniuses and talents to embark on the path of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The current Martial Dao..." Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes. After three hundred years of promoting the Martial Dao, the current Martial Dao cultivation system, if not on par with the Immortal Dao...</p><p></p><p>At least it was the strongest cultivation system under the Immortal Dao, without exception.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that in the past three hundred years, occasionally some other Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings wanted to visit Lin Yuan, but they all ended up like the purple-robed elder. After sensing a portion of Lin Yuan's strength, they went back and ordered their disciples and juniors not to be enemies with the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the influence of the Martial Dao grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>It could be predicted that with the passage of time, the Martial Dao might really reach the height of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that made Lin Yuan unsatisfied was that up until now, the Martial Dao still had not produced an Eighth Stage powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Several lectures had only given birth to a large number of Fifth Stage and Sixth Stage Martial Dao practitioners.</p><p></p><p>But the Eighth Stage of the Martial Dao, which was comparable to the Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings, had yet to be born.</p>

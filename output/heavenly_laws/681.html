        <h1>Chapter 681</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the King of Thousand Teeth was extremely anxious and fearful.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, he was cultivating and enjoying himself in the Thousand Teeth City, as the ruler of the Thousand Teeth Domain and the Enthroned Saint of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In this vast domain, the King of Thousand Teeth possessed supreme power and status. Even the commands of the Great Spiritual Emperor could be selectively refused by him.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, he was forcibly moved to this place? From start to finish, the King of Thousand Teeth had never broken free.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, he had not even had time to react before appearing here. </p><p></p><p>This left the King of Thousand Teeth's mind completely blank. He was a Saint! Even if he was not the Peak Saint or the Top Peak Saint.</p><p></p><p>But who could so easily ignore his resistance and move him here? Even the mightiest Saints would not possess such power.</p><p></p><p>While the gap between Saints and the mightiest Saints is vast, they all belong to the Saint realm, and such a scene of overwhelming power at the rule level should not occur.</p><p></p><p>"That is?" After the initial shock and fear, the King of Thousand Teeth also noticed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This single notice immediately made the King of Thousand Teeth's scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Saint that the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms dare not provoke the most, the Galactic Saint! Having seen the portrait of the Galactic Saint by the order of the Great Spiritual Ancestor, the King of Thousand Teeth naturally could not mistake his identity.</p><p></p><p>And the ability to silently move him here was likely only possessed by the legendary invincible Saint, the Galactic Saint.</p><p></p><p>"King of Thousand Teeth?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the King of Thousand Teeth's shock, the young Meng Shi was somewhat desperate.</p><p></p><p>He had once caught a glimpse of the King of Thousand Teeth from afar, and immediately recognized the ruler of the Thousand Teeth Domain.</p><p></p><p>His escape had actually attracted the lofty King of Thousand Teeth, and the young Meng Shi was somewhat hopeless.</p><p></p><p>But the young Meng Shi soon realized something was wrong, as the King of Thousand Teeth also seemed fearful, not knowing how he ended up here. "Is it the senior?"</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi was not stupid, and immediately realized the appearance of the King of Thousand Teeth was related to the senior who had blocked him. Especially when Lin Yuan finally said to the King of Thousand Teeth, "What do you think?", it seemed to imply that the senior already knew the King of Thousand Teeth would come.</p><p></p><p>"The Saint is right!" The King of Thousand Teeth did not know what Lin Yuan had said before, but the first words he heard were "What do you think?".</p><p></p><p>However, this did not prevent the King of Thousand Teeth from responding. No matter what the Galactic Saint said, he had to go along with the meaning.</p><p></p><p>As for refuting? </p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth was well aware of the unspoken rule among the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms that the Saints were prohibited from interfering. For the Galactic Saint, this rule was ineffective.</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Ancestor had personally ordered them not to provoke the Galactic Saint for any reason, and the King of Thousand Teeth naturally knew what he should do.</p><p></p><p>It was just not to offend him.</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth had even prepared to cede the Thousand Teeth Domain. With the Galactic Saint's personal descent, the matter he sought must not be small, perhaps he had set his sights on the Thousand Teeth Domain.</p><p></p><p>There was a second-grade treasure land within the Thousand Teeth Domain, of great value.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled at the young Meng Shi.</p><p></p><p>He was quite satisfied with the other's performance.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan did not care much about the character of martial cultivators, as long as they cultivated the Dao, they were Lin Yuan's "anchors" and "guideposts".</p><p></p><p>But if the character was good, Lin Yuan would also feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the respectful King of Thousand Teeth, and then at the smiling Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, the lofty King of Thousand Teeth, faced with the "senior" who had blocked him, had an attitude so low that he almost kowtowed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take this person away."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the King of Thousand Teeth and said in a flat tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, Saint, not only this one person, even if you want to take away all the living beings in the Thousand Teeth Domain, it's no problem."</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth hesitated slightly, glancing at the young Meng Shi, and quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had prepared to give up the Thousand Teeth Domain, but he did not expect the Galactic Saint to only want to take away Meng Shi? "Then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand and left with the still stunned young Meng Shi.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Saint has left?"</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth bowed for a while, tentatively raised his head to look around, and felt a sense of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So that was the Galactic Saint? The invincible Saint recognized by the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms?"</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth's thoughts scattered.</p><p></p><p>With the Galactic Saint's strength, even without the Great Spiritual Ancestor's order, he would not dare to provoke him.</p><p></p><p>In the newly born treasure land, the Galactic Saint had slaughtered indiscriminately, even crushing the mightiest Saint of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom, known as the number one Saint since the establishment of the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying power, even the mightiest Saints trembled before him, let alone the ordinary Saint like the King of Thousand Teeth.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Saint wants to take that person away? I don't know why he did that?"</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth was puzzled, but dared not think too much about it, and immediately reported the matter to the Emperor of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Emperor's reply came, saying that he had done well, and that he should agree to any request the Galactic Saint made.</p><p></p><p>"Agree to any request?"</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth once again realized the terrifying nature of the Galactic Saint. The Emperor dared to say that, it must have been with the Ancestor's tacit approval.</p><p></p><p>And the Ancestor actually valued the Galactic Saint so much, saying that any request would be agreed to? At this moment, dozens of figures came chasing after, the same strong ones who had previously pursued the young Meng Shi.</p><p></p><p>These strong ones stopped when they saw the King of Thousand Teeth, and bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"The one you were just chasing, his name is Meng Shi, right?" The King of Thousand Teeth asked one more question.</p><p></p><p>He did not know Meng Shi, as there were too many such insignificant ants in the Thousand Teeth Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of pursuers looked at the King of Thousand Teeth cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't chase him anymore."</p><p></p><p>The King of Thousand Teeth pondered for a while and ordered, "In the future, if you encounter Meng Shi again, immediately notify me, and do not dare to lay a hand on him."</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the purpose of the Galactic Saint in taking Meng Shi away, since it was related to the Galactic Saint, the King of Thousand Teeth, even if it was just an ant, dared not be negligent.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought the young Meng Shi into the Galactic King's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic."</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi looked at the majestic mansion, vaguely guessing Lin Yuan's true identity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the young Meng Shi, after reacting, also finally understood why the lofty King of Thousand Teeth had behaved in that way when he saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because the senior who had blocked him was the Galactic Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Saint who shook the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao inheritance that the young Meng Shi had recently tried to cultivate was established by the Galactic Saint himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the young Meng Shi nervously entered the depths of the King's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"You should know who I am, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, smiling at the young Meng Shi.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Galactic Saint."</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In terms of gratitude, if it were not for the Galactic Saint, he estimated...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>JÃ¬ had already been captured and taken back by the Thousand Tooth King.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Silver Galaxy Venerable was known as the number one powerhouse under the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms' ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi naturally knew who he was facing.</p><p></p><p>"Get up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the young Meng Shi felt an invisible force lift him up.</p><p></p><p>"I intend to take you as my disciple, are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi's martial arts talent in the time aspect was too rare. If he was not guided by Lin Yuan, he would easily go the wrong way and waste this innate talent.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing, I, Meng Shi, am willing."</p><p></p><p>The young Meng Shi suddenly kowtowed: "Greet the master."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After that, Lin Yuan briefly pointed out a few things about Meng Shi's martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is very good, just focus on the time aspect and try to condense the time spirit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Mist Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gradually dispatched some avatars to recruit some talented martial arts disciples with good aptitude within the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms, to personally cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>These seedlings would be the pillars of the future martial arts evolution path, as well as the foundation for Lin Yuan to open the Seventh Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart of the Abyss Dragon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the pulsating heart in front of him, and at the same time, he spawned an avatar to try to open up a world universe at the particle level.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan opened the first particle world, it was still very easy. With his strength, opening a world was easy, even if it was within his own particles.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan opened the 12,000th particle world, he felt a slight pressure. Each of these 12,000 particle worlds required a portion of his mental focus, and while the mental focus required for a single particle world was negligible, 12,000 of them was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>Especially when Lin Yuan had almost 99% of his mental focus devoted to comprehending the origin operation of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>"The 120,000th particle world."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan opened the 120,000th particle world. At this point, his expression was solemn. 120,000 particle worlds had almost occupied all of his mental focus outside of comprehending the origin operation of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, and the 120,000 particle worlds began to show signs of imbalance. In an instant, the avatar used for experimentation was quickly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the reason for the failure in opening the particle worlds was not a lack of mental focus.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did not focus on comprehending the origin operation of the Source World and invested all his mental focus into opening particle worlds, how many could he open in the end?</p><p></p><p>1.2 billion? Or 12 billion?</p><p></p><p>After all, particles are the most microscopic structure of life.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan's true body, not to mention 12 billion particle worlds, even 120 billion particle worlds would be just a drop in the ocean, an insignificant trifle.</p><p></p><p>"Maintaining particle worlds should not consume mental focus. The existence of particle worlds is instinctive, just like drinking water and breathing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to observe the Heart of the Abyss Dragon in front of him. This Source World's first born life, the 'Abyss Dragon', had a boundless world contained within each of its particles. The existence of these boundless worlds definitely did not consume any mental focus, otherwise the Abyss Dragon would have long since collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Heart of the Abyss Dragon and was not discouraged. Failing once was not a big deal. Through this failure, he realized that opening particle worlds was not related to mental focus, and this was already progress, bringing him closer to success.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of time and space, within a palace.</p><p></p><p>The Six Ancestors were seated one by one. This palace was a place where only the Ancestors could enter, where they occasionally gathered to discuss.</p><p></p><p>Only because of Lin Yuan's appearance did the Six Ancestors constantly dispatch an avatar here, to facilitate timely communication.</p><p></p><p>In each Ancestor's vision, there were countless time lines extending, and if observed carefully, these time lines were all Lin Yuan's future time lines.</p><p></p><p>After discovering the near-inevitable nature of Lin Yuan's future, the Six Ancestors naturally focused all their attention and mental focus on observing each other's time lines.</p><p></p><p>After all, this kind of near-inevitable future had aroused the curiosity of the Six Ancestors, and they wanted to know if the future time lines were still the same.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan was still at the Venerable level, it was relatively easy for them to observe his time lines, as there was a gap in the level of existence.</p><p></p><p>But when Lin Yuan also crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, it would become extremely difficult for the Six Ancestors to directly observe his time lines, they might even be unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the Six Ancestors naturally wanted to take advantage of the current situation to observe as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>After repeated attempts by the Six Ancestors, they found that as soon as they observed Lin Yuan's time lines beyond three billion years in the future, they would receive backlash.</p><p></p><p>This backlash was not only from the time lines themselves, but also from the future three billion years later, when Lin Yuan would have grown to a certain height, or had a deep karmic connection with a life of that level, naturally bringing about this backlash.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Spiritual Ancestor's expression changed. In the future time line he saw, Lin Yuan had not yet crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, but had transformed into a towering and all-encompassing 'Black Dragon', lightly tearing open the Source World's membrane and entering the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Ancestor carefully observed this time line of Lin Yuan, and after a moment, his expression became somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>In this time line, the 'Black Dragon' that Lin Yuan had transformed into was very similar to the 'Abyss Dragon' born at the dawn of heaven and earth, but the strength was vastly different, the former's erupting aura was almost at the Thirteenth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"Dafu, look at this time line."</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Ancestor immediately looked at the other five Ancestors and actively displayed the time line he had observed.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Black Dragon' that the Silver Galaxy Venerable transformed into should be based on the 'Abyss Dragon', but this strength..."</p><p></p><p>The five Ancestors were somewhat doubtful. They were very sure that at this point, Lin Yuan had not yet crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, but this strength, was it not inconceivably powerful?</p><p></p><p>"Dafu, you gave the Abyss Dragon's Heart to the Silver Galaxy, could it be that there is still some secret within it?" The Yin Ancestor couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>When the five Ancestors paid their respects to the Silver Galaxy Venerable, the Dafu Ancestor had sent out the 'Abyss Dragon's Heart'.</p><p></p><p>"A secret?" The Dafu Ancestor fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He had already comprehended the Abyss Dragon's Heart thoroughly, but even if he could open worlds within all his own particles, he could not possibly raise his strength to this level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, that 'Abyss Dragon' would not have died at the hands of the Dafu Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Even if that 'Abyss Dragon' had the strength of the Silver Galaxy Venerable in this time line, the Dafu Ancestor would not have had the chance to cross into the Thirteenth Realm, and would have been killed by the Abyss Dragon long ago.</p><p></p><p>But the method the Silver Galaxy Venerable used to transform into the Black Dragon in this time line should come from the Abyss Dragon's Heart.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Silver Galaxy Venerable had comprehended a hidden technique within the Abyss Dragon's Heart that even the Dafu Ancestor did not possess.</p><p></p><p>"This Silver Galaxy Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>The Dafu Ancestor's expression was complex, feeling that the Silver Galaxy Venerable was more like a Thirteenth Realm time life than himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

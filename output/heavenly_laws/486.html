        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 486: The Grand Dao Rules All Originate from Chaos (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the appearance of the first crack.</p><p></p><p>On the majestic giant 'egg', the second, third, and more cracks continuously appeared.</p><p></p><p>Each crack rapidly spread, expanded, and split.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The giant 'egg' nurtured by myriad rules was covered in cracks.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuanzhen's divine soul, all his incarnations, and all the rules he had comprehended finally merged completely.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, Lin Yuan had comprehended more and more rules, and the various rules had already shown a trend of integration, and now they were completely fused together.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The majestic giant 'egg' covered in cracks collapsed silently, and a brand-new rule that transcended the myriad rules was born.</p><p></p><p>This is Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Rule.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, finally, I have comprehended the Chaos Rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, and in the instant the Chaos Rule was born, all of Lin Yuan's incarnations and even his two divine souls had completely grasped it.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Chaos Rule?"</p><p></p><p>Everything in Lin Yuan's vision became simple.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that the Spatial-Temporal Rule is the foundation of all things, the operation of the world, and the influence of the rules, they cannot be separated from the Spatial-Temporal Rule.</p><p></p><p>Then the Chaos Rule is the source of all things, from the Spatial-Temporal Rule to the fundamental rules of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, they all originate from the Chaos Rule.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Dao rules all originate from Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"My mental will, my soul, my physical body, my everything, are all becoming stronger." After giving birth to the Chaos Rule, Lin Yuan felt that everything about himself was undergoing a tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it is very difficult to make further progress from the peak. At Lin Yuan's level, it is almost impossible for his strength to surge again unless he breaks through to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago and a thousand years later, the latter Lin Yuan had comprehended hundreds of millions more pillar-level integrated rules than the former, but the difference in their strength was not very large.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of pillar-level integrated rules, although numerous in number, were like loose soil.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to form a unified force.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the birth of the Chaos Rule, the hundreds of millions of rules quickly combined on the other side, forming an invincible and extremely sharp blade.</p><p></p><p>"Forty million points of mental will." Lin Yuan slightly sensed, and he confirmed that his mental will had reached forty million points.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the improvement of mental consciousness is not as easy as the physical body and soul. Over the past thousand years, Lin Yuan had immersed himself in the core of the Immortal Realm Origin, and he had only increased his mental will by tens of thousands of points.</p><p></p><p>And now, as soon as the Chaos Rule was born, his mental will index had exceeded forty million points, and it was still increasing.</p><p></p><p>"My perception of time and space is also rapidly improving."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze vaguely penetrated the infinite time and space. Previously, he could at most sense a spatial range of dozens of Immortal Realms. </p><p></p><p>Now, this range is rapidly approaching one hundred Immortal Realms, and it is advancing towards two hundred, three hundred Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>"The internal world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at his own internal world. The internal world of his true body has a range of 2.3 billion li.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the main universe, which experienced a breakthrough from the tenth level to the eleventh level to be infused with the Chaos Void Origin, the normal internal world size is just this range.</p><p></p><p>This is also based on the transformation and blessing of the mysterious gourd. Otherwise, the upper limit would be restricted to just a few million li in radius.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the birth of the Chaos Rule, the internal world also began to expand crazily, reaching ten billion li, a hundred billion li, a thousand billion li.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The River of Time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the River of Time in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the main universe or the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan was suppressed by the River of Time, and the only way to break free from the suppression was to make the ultimate leap and break through to the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>Even though the path of martial dao evolution has spread among the countless beings, the suppression of the River of Time on Lin Yuan has at most only slowed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>However, now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan clearly felt that the suppression of the River of Time on himself had decreased significantly.</p><p></p><p>The reduced suppression of the River of Time also means that the backlash Lin Yuan faces when making the ultimate leap to the twelfth level has also decreased.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the probability of Lin Yuan successfully breaking through to the ultimate twelfth level can be greatly improved after comprehending the Chaos Rule at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this reason is only theoretical.</p><p></p><p>Those who have comprehended the Chaos Rule are no longer at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>So-called eleventh level comprehending the Chaos Rule is just based on the principle of Chaos giving birth to all things.</p><p></p><p>The River of Time is essentially a combination of time and space, and time and space can suppress all life, but they cannot suppress Chaos.</p><p></p><p>As long as one comprehends the Chaos Rule, even if it is only a single layer of the Chaos Rule, it can greatly offset the suppression and backlash of the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Rule is the threshold for the Sovereign Realm to enter the Chaos Realm. To become a Chaos Realm expert, one must comprehend the Chaos Rule," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth level is divided into three levels: Dao Splitting, Sovereign, and Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth level Chaos Realm can roam freely in the Chaos Void, and experts like the Mysterious Emperor are Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Mysterious Emperor is at the peak of the Chaos Realm, and the Demon Jade Pavilion Master is also at this level.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength should be able to directly confront an Ancestor of the Immortal Realm at the twelfth level?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before comprehending the Chaos Rule, Lin Yuan could only barely survive in front of an Ancestor of the Immortal Dao at the twelfth level by relying on the Spatial-Temporal Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the ultimate foundation of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao at the twelfth level, even if Lin Yuan attacked, he probably couldn't break through the defense.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Chaos Rule has consolidated all the rules Lin Yuan has comprehended into one.</p><p></p><p>Even if his life essence has not yet reached the twelfth level, in terms of direct combat power, Lin Yuan can be considered at the ultimate twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>This is only Lin Yuan's true body in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The true body in the Immortal Realm is ultimately just a temporary vessel for Lin Yuan, and it is far from the true body in the main universe in terms of foundation accumulation.</p><p></p><p>The true body in the main universe has the ability to withstand the infusion of the Chaos Void Origin when it broke through to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Lin Yuan's life essence not reaching the standard, most of this foundation is submerged in the depths of the internal world.</p><p></p><p>But after Lin Yuan gave birth to the Chaos Rule, even if his life essence level does not change, his absorption of the Chaos Void Origin will definitely increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>It can be expected that once Lin Yuan returns, the strength of his true body in the main universe will increase far beyond the current true body in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if the main universe's twelfth level ultimate experts are stronger than the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, Lin Yuan will still be able to resist and even suppress them.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth level ultimate experts in the main universe compete with each other, and with the many inherited treasures from outside the universe, as well as the infusion of the Chaos Void Origin during the ultimate leap, their average strength will be significantly higher than the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm about to be forced to make the ultimate leap at any moment?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light sigh. His foundation accumulation is now too strong, and he feels that the time for the ultimate leap is approaching.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great river was about to overwhelm him.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, hold on."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan steadied himself, and the ultimate leap would definitely be placed in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, by making the ultimate leap in the main universe, he could obtain the infusion of the chaos void origin, which the immortal realm did not have. This was also one of the reasons why the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was not as powerful as the ultimate twelfth-stage in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not sure whether after making the ultimate leap in the Immortal Realm, the return to the chaos void of the main universe would replenish him with another origin infusion.</p><p></p><p>But for the sake of safety, it would be better to return and then assault the twelfth-stage.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and began to familiarize himself with this brand-new power, or rather, this set of rules.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was constantly operating the chaos rules and colliding with the myriad rules of the Immortal Realm, the operation of all the rules in the entire Immortal Realm began to tremble without stop.</p><p></p><p>The origin land, the Dao Ancestor Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was in seclusion, and even after entering the twelfth-stage, he still needed to comprehend numerous rules.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao abruptly opened his eyes, and a look of shock appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How come I feel that all the rule fluctuations are trembling?" the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao said in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Rule fluctuations were orderly and stable. The world could operate completely because the myriad rules were perfectly combined.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the eyes of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao at the twelfth-stage, the rule fluctuations seemed to have a life of their own.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao clearly noticed that all the rule fluctuations in the origin land, or rather, all the rule fluctuations in the Immortal Realm, had begun to become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>It was just like a calm pond, where every stream of water was very stable, but now, in the depths of the pond, there was a huge creature twisting, causing the calm pond to have surging undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>However, the operation of the world and the coverage of the myriad rules had already formed a perfect balance. It was not something that could be interfered with at will, even for someone as powerful as the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao. He could only affect the rule stability within a certain range by operating his own Dao.</p><p></p><p>Like the current rule chaos originating from the entire Immortal Realm, it made the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao feel a little panicked.</p><p></p><p>"What is the reason for this?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao swept his gaze across the origin land and the thirty-three immortal domains of the Immortal Realm, and even the Ancestor of the Abyss in the distant Abyss was also examining the vast Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao finally looked towards the core of the origin land of the Immortal Realm, which was the location of the Immortal Realm's consciousness. It was also the place where the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had entered a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was not sure what the reason for the rule chaos was. But he was certain that it had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm and the Abyss, the only one capable of causing the current situation, other than himself, was the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, who had remained unfathomable until now.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly did the Ancestor of the Martial Dao do to cause this situation?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao's mind was in turmoil. He could feel the trembling and fear of the myriad rules in the origin land and the entire Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Or has he made a breakthrough, entering the Ancestor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao pondered, but then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He himself was in the Ancestor Realm, and he knew what the impact of entering the Ancestor Realm was like. It was immense and inconceivable, but it was definitely not like the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, until now, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had not felt any life breaking free from the constraints of the long river of time, which meant that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had not yet entered the Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The operation of the chaos rules was first sensed by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, it was the many golden immortals and jade immortals of the thirty-three immortal domains.</p><p></p><p>The golden immortals had already comprehended the spatial rules and had a certain degree of perception of time and space. The jade immortals were even more so. Compared to them, the immortals below the golden immortals, as well as the many mortals, did not feel it as clearly.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are the spatial rules becoming unstable?"</p><p></p><p>"I am the same. Many of the basic rules are also like this."</p><p></p><p>In the thirty-three immortal domains, the golden immortals and jade immortals were uneasy. The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had already stepped out of his own Dao, and the changes in the external rules would not have a great impact on him. This was the essence of the Dao-Severing Realm.</p><p></p><p>But for the golden immortals and jade immortals? They were still in the stage of perceiving various rules, and they were heavily dependent on the external rules. Even the slightest change could shake their foundations.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao? The Ancestor of the Abyss? Or the Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"I think it should be the Ancestor of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, before the Ancestor of the Martial Dao appeared, there had never been such a day in billions of years."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the method of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The many golden immortals and jade immortals were trembling in fear. Each of them who had cultivated to the golden immortal realm was not a fool. They vaguely guessed that all of this might be related to the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even so, not a single golden immortal or jade immortal dared to go to the Martial City and ask the disciples of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>What a joke? The Ancestor of the Martial Dao could cause such a stir in the entire Immortal Realm, and even the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Abyss had not taken any action. They, as golden immortals and jade immortals, questioning him? Wasn't that just looking for death?</p><p></p><p>Did they really think they had lived too long?</p><p></p><p>"That's enough."</p><p></p><p>After becoming familiar with the chaos rules, Lin Yuan gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also saw the impact of the chaos rules on the myriad rules of the Immortal Realm. As the origin rule that reigned supreme over all other rules, the chaos rules naturally suppressed the other rules.</p><p></p><p>Even the time-space rules were no exception.</p><p></p><p>The core of the origin land of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned, looking towards the Immortal Realm's consciousness that was hiding in the corner.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, when Lin Yuan entered here, he had found the Immortal Realm's consciousness to be on high alert.</p><p></p><p>However, he had been too lazy to bother with it, and had instead focused on comprehending the myriad rules in this place.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm's consciousness, seeing that Lin Yuan did not have any extreme reactions, gradually abandoned its vigilance and divided this core place into two halves with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, ever since Lin Yuan had nurtured the chaos rules and actively released the aura of this origin rule, the Immortal Realm's consciousness had become like a mouse seeing a cat, immediately hiding in the farthest and most remote corner, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>This left Lin Yuan quite surprised. Although the Immortal Realm's consciousness could not use the power of the Immortal Realm in this core place, Lin Yuan could still feel that it still had means to protect itself.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, the Immortal Realm's consciousness had compromised and actively allowed Lin Yuan to enter, and it was not just because Lin Yuan's threat was truly effective, but also because the Immortal Realm's consciousness still had other trump cards.</p><p></p><p>At least, it would not be completely defenseless against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the Immortal Realm's consciousness hiding in the corner and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm's consciousness only had instincts, and its current behavior was out of genuine fear.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Immortal Realm's consciousness responded with a buzzing sound, explaining Lin Yuan's doubts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

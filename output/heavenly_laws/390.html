        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate, the Heavenly Gate has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heavenly Gate, I feel like the entire two-dimensional world is shaking."  </p><p></p><p>"I now believe that by passing through the Heavenly Gate, we can truly leave this world."</p><p></p><p>On the mountainside, the powerful experts from various races were excited, staring intently at the peak above. At this moment, under the surging spatial forces, a 'Heavenly Gate' over ten meters high gradually took shape from the void.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings looked solemn. Although they considered themselves invincible in the two-dimensional world, they could not help but feel a little nervous now.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate was related to whether they could go out or not. The other powerful experts who remained in the two-dimensional world would pay the price of a fundamental loss of part of their will.</p><p></p><p>But for the Four Celestial Kings, if they could not return to the universe, the loss would not just be a part of their will, but also a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Even for supreme experts, obtaining a supreme weapon that was completely suited for them was not an easy thing.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Four Celestial Kings?</p><p></p><p>If they lost this supreme weapon in this two-dimensional world, the Four Celestial Kings would probably have to wait until they became supreme experts to obtain another supreme weapon suited for them.</p><p></p><p>But how long would that take?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Four Celestial Kings had no guarantee that they would become supreme experts, the ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have dragged it out until now.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I must be the one to enter the Heavenly Gate!" The Four Celestial Kings' expression was fierce, with a strange force circulating between their four arms.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Heavenly Gate?"</p><p></p><p>Far away, Lin Yuan was also observing the Heavenly Gate. "Such a tremendous spatial fluctuation!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed. The spatial fluctuations emitted by the silver mirror paled in comparison to the Heavenly Gate, like a firefly's glow next to the brilliant moon.</p><p></p><p>The two were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>"To leave this two-dimensional world, one can only rely on the Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that it was absolutely impossible to cause such tremendous spatial force fluctuations through individual power alone.</p><p></p><p>Outside the painting scroll.</p><p></p><p>At the very moment the Heavenly Gate began to manifest, dozens of supreme experts were on high alert. According to their estimations, if the Heavenly Gate was a passage connecting the two-dimensional world and the main universe, then when the Heavenly Gate appeared, the two-dimensional world that had been isolated by the 'white paper' would form a connecting passage to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they, as supreme experts, would be able to better observe the nature of the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>They might even be able to interfere with the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>For example, they could forcibly 'retrieve' the powerful experts trapped within.</p><p></p><p>With the obstruction of the white paper, the supreme experts could not influence the interior of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But if a connection was formed, with the means of supreme experts, they could definitely 'retrieve' people.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the supreme experts outside the painting scroll had ugly looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is there no change out here even though the Heavenly Gate has begun to manifest inside?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the reports from our clansmen, when the Heavenly Gate manifests, there should be tremendous spatial force fluctuations, which are characteristic of the formation of a spatial passage. Why is there no reaction out here now?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances for a spatial passage, if one side had spatial fluctuations, the other side would also have spatial fluctuations. Otherwise, how could the two places be connected?</p><p></p><p>"Did something unexpected happen?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see. Maybe it's because the Heavenly Gate hasn't fully manifested yet, so it hasn't affected the outside for now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's keep waiting. When the Heavenly Gate is fully formed, it should be about time."</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts glanced at each other and patiently waited again.</p><p></p><p>They had lived for a very long time, so patience was something they did not lack.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Celestial Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Heavenly Gate began to manifest, the Four Celestial Kings and the other five eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms suddenly charged toward the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying sonic booms shook in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the Four Celestial Kings and the five other eleventh-level perfected beings had already exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p></p><p>"Deal with the Four Celestial Kings first."</p><p></p><p>The scrawny old man and the other four looked at each other and quickly joined forces to suppress the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the Four Celestial Kings posed too great a threat. If they left the Four Celestial Kings alone, after they had decided the victor, the Four Celestial Kings would just pluck them like ripe fruit.</p><p></p><p>"You want to deal with me first?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you even qualified?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings laughed madly, waving their four arms as dense vital energy spread out.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' four arms were extremely agile. With a light thrust, they struck the chest of a three-meter-tall muscular man.</p><p></p><p>This three-meter-tall muscular man, also an eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeform, turned pale and was forced back hundreds of meters before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The three-meter-tall muscular man's figure disappeared and rejoined the battlefield against the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Hum! Hum!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the fierce battle between the Four Celestial Kings and the scrawny old man's group of five experts, the terrifying aftershocks of their attacks almost 'plowed' the entire mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong."</p><p></p><p>"How can the Four Celestial Kings and the others be so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, over a hundred eleventh-level experts originally intended to approach the Heavenly Gate to see if they could take advantage of the situation.</p><p></p><p>But after witnessing the intense battle between the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts, no one dared to get close.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who approached the Heavenly Gate now would become the target of the Four Celestial Kings and those five experts' attacks, facing almost certain death. Even with defensive treasures, they would not survive.</p><p></p><p>Defensive treasures might be able to block 99% of the attacks, but the remaining 1% would be enough to extinguish any of the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Near the center of the mountain peak, the Demonic Race's Hou Zhu gripped a blood-red long blade, looking resentful.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the few powerful experts on the scene who dared to carry a treasure.</p><p></p><p>But Hou Zhu...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He did not directly carry any strange objects. His blood-red long blade was placed inside a wooden box, so outsiders did not know what was contained within.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Hou Zhu had planned to make a grand display by relying on the blood-red long blade when approaching the Heavenly Gate. However, he did not expect that at this moment, he could not even approach the battlefield of the Four Celestial Kings and Bo Shan.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred thousand powerful experts from various races watched the battle between the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts with utter shock.</p><p></p><p>"In this two-dimensional world, they can actually display such power. The Four Celestial Kings are truly monstrous, aren't they?"</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that we came down from the peak earlier. Otherwise, we would have been severely injured or even killed by the shockwaves from their clash."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it seems I have no chance to enter the Heavenly Gate. The Four Celestial Kings and those five experts have already occupied six opportunities to enter when the Heavenly Gate opens. I can't possibly live for seventy thousand years in this two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>One expert after another from various races watched the battle while feeling a sense of despair welling up inside them.</p><p></p><p>Some even directly annihilated their avatars, as they would eventually suffer a fundamental loss anyway, so they might as well face it proactively now.</p><p></p><p>On the side of human civilization, evolved beings like Xuanyuan Du also watched the battle at the Heavenly Gate with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain, should we give up on this opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate?" Xuanyuan Du could not help but ask, as she was truly terrified by the scene of the powerful experts clashing.</p><p></p><p>"Let's observe further," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Four Celestial Kings had not used that ultimate weapon.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the six experts appeared extremely brutal, but neither side had truly used their full power.</p><p></p><p>The five eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms led by the skinny old man had also not used any strange objects yet.</p><p></p><p>Below the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Huff! Huff!"</p><p></p><p>The six figures were engaged in a frenzied battle.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is about to manifest."</p><p></p><p>"You four, work together to stall him. I'll go to the Heavenly Gate and take a look."</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man swiftly disengaged and headed towards the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>According to the information in this two-dimensional world, only the lifeform that reached the front of the Heavenly Gate first after it opened could attempt to push it open.</p><p></p><p>This meant that it had no direct relation to strength. Even if the Four Celestial Kings were individually the strongest, if they did not stand in front of the Heavenly Gate, the skinny old man might be able to enter it first.</p><p></p><p>"You dare?" </p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings instantly went berserk.</p><p></p><p>A hazy glow suddenly shone between his four arms, and an aura that shook one's soul instantly covered the entire mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings are using that ultimate weapon."</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man, who had originally intended to approach the Heavenly Gate, immediately retreated.</p><p></p><p>His earlier actions were completely to provoke the Four Celestial Kings into using their ultimate weapon prematurely.</p><p></p><p>If the Four Celestial Kings had endured a little longer and allowed the skinny old man to approach the Heavenly Gate, the other four eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms might not have been able to sit still.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura exploded, and the skinny old man and the other four experts immediately used their strange objects as well.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the battle below the Heavenly Gate escalated to another level, and the terrifying shockwaves nearly caused the height of the mountain peak to continuously evaporate.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you five pieces of trash, did you think you could defeat me by joining forces?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings waved his four arms, and each attack he unleashed released a power that caused the auras of the skinny old man and the other four eleventh-level perfected legendary experts to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>"So strong?"</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man's expression turned unsightly, but he did not retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate was right in front of him, and he was unwilling to give up unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Four Celestial Kings held the advantage by fighting one against five, but that did not mean he would definitely win.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man and the other four experts raised their auras again, fending off the Four Celestial Kings' frenzied attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>"We can't stay any longer."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and leave."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the eleventh-level experts standing on the mountain peak began to flee towards the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that if they continued to stay in their original positions, they might be in mortal danger.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain, let's hurry and leave too."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Du urged anxiously. They were only able to withstand the pressure from the Four Celestial Kings and the others because of Lin Yuan's protection.</p><p></p><p>Most human evolved beings did not even have the qualification to stand on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Now that the battle between the Four Celestial Kings and the five experts had escalated, if they did not leave, they would be courting death.</p><p></p><p>"Leave?"</p><p></p><p>"Why should we leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, his gaze still fixed on the Heavenly Gate, which had already manifested most of its form. "Originally, I thought that a refined ultimate weapon would be able to unleash much greater power in this world. I didn't expect it to be just like this."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Xuanyuan Du was a bit confused. She did not understand why, at a time like this, instead of avoiding the shockwaves, Lord Blood Rain was still talking about the power of an ultimate weapon.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before Xuanyuan Du could recover her senses, Lin Yuan, who had been standing in front of her, calmly took a step forward and disappeared from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Below the Heavenly Gate, the Four Celestial Kings and the skinny old man, along with the other experts who had been engaged in a frenzied battle, suddenly felt their scalps tingle, as if facing a life-or-death situation, and a great fear arose in their hearts. They immediately began to retreat in all directions without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>A figure passed through their previous positions and appeared in front of the Heavenly Gate, which was about to fully manifest.</p><p></p><p>This figure had his back turned towards the Four Celestial Kings and the other six experts. He raised his right hand and casually drew a line behind him.</p><p></p><p>A constantly fluctuating black aura appeared, encircling more than half of the mountain peak, with the Four Celestial Kings and the six experts standing outside this black aura line.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lin Yuan glance at the Four Celestial Kings and the other experts.</p><p></p><p>"Those who cross this line will die!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

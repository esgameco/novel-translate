        <h1>Chapter 632</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign and the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign were two ancient celestial sovereigns from the mysterious Yin ancient country. </p><p></p><p>Compared to other celestial sovereigns, their spiritual consciousness and awareness were somewhat lacking. This was why they so coveted the rare and precious black jade produced in the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>As the guardianship of the Black Jade Nest was about to change hands, they planned to secretly infiltrate it. It wasn't really much of a risk, as the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign had made ample preparations for this operation.</p><p></p><p>The new guardian, the Grand Sovereign of the Milky Way, was much stronger than the other peak experts of the imperial clan, but had not yet reached the realm of celestial sovereignty. He was nowhere near as difficult to deal with as the previous guardian, the Blazing Sun Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign had also observed many recordings of the Milky Way Grand Sovereign's battles, and felt he had a good understanding of this new rising imperial clan from the Scorching Yang Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were discovered immediately upon infiltrating, they were confident they could easily retreat without exposing any information related to their identities. As long as the Scorching Yang Ancient Country couldn't gather solid evidence afterwards, the matter would simply be left unresolved.</p><p></p><p>"Ten breaths," the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign instructed the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign as they successfully infiltrated the Black Jade Nest. "No matter how much black jade we obtain, we must retreat immediately after ten breaths."</p><p></p><p>Ten breaths was the time it would take for reinforcements from the Scorching Yang capital to arrive at the Black Jade Nest via teleportation. </p><p></p><p>The two celestial sovereigns were not overly concerned about the Milky Way Grand Sovereign, but they were wary of the reinforcements from the Scorching Yang capital.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since they dared to infiltrate this premier treasure trove, they had to plan for the worst-case scenario. With their strength, it was unlikely they would be discovered immediately upon entering. But as long as there was that possibility, they had to make their plans accordingly.</p><p></p><p>In just a fraction of a breath, the two celestial sovereigns had fully infiltrated the Black Jade Nest and were rapidly approaching the area where the black jade was being cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Black Jade Nest, Lin Yuan was refining the black jade, with strands of black jade energy slowly and steadily tempering his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan sensed two auras infiltrating the area. These auras had not been detected by the defensive formations of the Black Jade Nest, but were sensed purely through Lin Yuan's own perception and the semi-activated state of his "World" divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Black Jade Nest was nearing maturity, Lin Yuan had been extremely cautious, keeping his "World" divine ability in a semi-activated state at all times. The Blazing Sun Celestial Sovereign, a powerful celestial sovereign, had not hesitated to completely offend several other celestial sovereigns in order to gain the opportunity to guard the Black Jade Nest. How could the celestial sovereigns of other ancient countries be any less covetous?</p><p></p><p>"It should be two celestial sovereigns from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country," Lin Yuan surmised as he gazed down at the rapidly approaching auras.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign and the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign had prepared thoroughly, confident they could evade detection by the Black Jade Nest's defensive formations. And indeed, the formations did not detect their presence. </p><p></p><p>However, while the defensive formations could not sense them, Lin Yuan's "World" divine ability had them in clear view.</p><p></p><p>"They've arrived, the area where the black jade is cultivated is just ahead," the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign and the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign felt their spirits stirring, especially the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign, as the Black Jade Nest's defensive formations had not reacted at all so far. It seemed the Milky Way Grand Sovereign hadn't even noticed their presence.</p><p></p><p>"Two breaths have already passed, we'll have three breaths to retreat, leaving us only five breaths to collect the black jade," the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign glanced at the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign immediately nodded. Cultivating to the realm of celestial sovereignty, they would not lose their composure in the face of treasures, and would act according to their pre-made plan.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the two celestial sovereigns entered the area where the black jade was being cultivated. A vast expanse of profound, inky-black jade stones came into view, and the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign and Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign suppressed their excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Collect them all, even the unmatured black jade," the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign said quickly. </p><p></p><p>The black jade cultivated in the Black Jade Nest was only extracted once it was fully matured. But the unmatured black jade still had effects, just not as potent in tempering spiritual will as the fully matured black jade.</p><p></p><p>As plunderers, the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign and Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign naturally wanted to collect everything in sight, regardless of maturity.</p><p></p><p>However, when they tried to envelop the black jade with their power, they discovered a layered spatial barrier surrounding each piece.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign frowned, able to sense that this spatial barrier did not originate from the Black Jade Nest's defensive formations.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin, what do we do now? I can't collect them," the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign quickly asked, finding the spatial barrier covering the black jade completely impenetrable.</p><p></p><p>As the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign pondered their next move, his expression suddenly changed as he looked up to see a young man emerge from the void, calmly gazing down at the two celestial sovereigns from on high, like two ants before an ancient, powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Grand Sovereign?" the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign immediately recognized this young man as the current guardian of the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"We've been discovered?" the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign said solemnly, with the black jade now fully protected and the Milky Way Grand Sovereign present, it was clear they had been detected.</p><p></p><p>"Has this Milky Way Grand Sovereign been prepared for us all along?" the Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign thought, glancing at the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign, waiting to see what they should do next.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign said, though somewhat reluctantly. He knew that in this situation, the best choice was to retreat immediately. Staying would be pointless, as they had no way to collect the black jade for now.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign's mind raced, and since they had already been discovered, he no longer needed to conceal his aura so thoroughly. As long as he didn't reveal his signature attack, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>A spatial disturbance began to build as the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign tried to forcefully break through the spatial channel connecting this place to the outside world, in order to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of the formations surged, suppressing the Northern Yin Celestial Sovereign's attempt to pierce the spatial fabric.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Sovereign of the Milky Way?" </p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin looked at Lin Yuan, "Still wanting to keep us here?"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin frowned, but did not pay much attention, then unhesitatingly flew out.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not break through the spatial channel to retreat quickly, he would just fly out directly.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formation of the Black Jade Nest mainly defended against attacks from the outside, but as for the inside?</p><p></p><p>At least it could not stop the Sovereign of the Northern Yin, a powerhouse like him.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan completely unleashed the divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The vast external universe spread out like a vast ocean, instantly filling every inch of space within the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Extreme Cold's expression changed drastically, he clearly felt that he was being suppressed in all aspects, and even flying had become extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Under this suppression, not to mention being able to retreat from the Black Jade Nest in three breaths, even in thirty breaths or three hundred breaths, it would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin's expression looked grim, through the all-pervasive domain suppression, he realized that the strength of the Sovereign of the Milky Way was far beyond his estimation, and had even crossed into the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>"Don't hold back."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin unhesitatingly began to use all his escape techniques.</p><p></p><p>Invisible and terrifying yin energy began to spread in all directions, trying to resist the suppression of the external universe. At this moment, the Sovereign of the Northern Yin did not hold back at all, even if it meant exposing his true identity.</p><p></p><p>As a Sovereign of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, he had rashly attacked the first-class treasure land of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country, breaking the implicit rules between the two ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Once this was revealed, he would certainly be punished by the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, but any punishment would be far lighter than the loss of this physical body.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin had a feeling that if he did not fight desperately, he would not be able to break free from the suppression of the external universe, and if he dragged on, by the time the powerhouses of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country came to aid, there was a possibility of being captured and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>As a Sovereign-level powerhouse, secretly breaking the implicit rules and taking action, the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country would certainly punish him out of face-saving, but it would not be too severe, after all, he was one of their own.</p><p></p><p>But if he was captured and suppressed, the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country would lose face, and there would be no limit to the punishment they would inflict on him.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin began to burn his physical body's origin, trying to break through the spatial suppression around him, but found that it had little effect, the overwhelming suppressing force was like a millstone, crushing him.</p><p></p><p>Impossible to match.</p><p></p><p>Impossible to block.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign of the Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin's gaze turned to Lin Yuan, who was overlooking him, and suddenly said, "Or perhaps I should call you the Sovereign of the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>For the Blazing Yang Ancient Country to give birth to a Sovereign-level powerhouse, although extremely rare, it was not too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blazing Yang Ancient Country had a large number of peak Great Sovereign powerhouses, just one step away from the Sovereign realm, and could break through at any time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was recognized as the core imperial clan of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>With the identity of the core imperial clan, becoming a Sovereign, the significance would be completely different from other newly born Sovereigns. "Sovereign of the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Extreme Cold also looked at Lin Yuan, his heart surging with huge waves, the saying that the core imperial clans of the major ancient countries could not transcend the Sovereign shackles, had been broken by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the Sovereign of the Northern Yin and the Sovereign of the Extreme Cold, without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the strength at the Sovereign level was something Lin Yuan had planned long ago.</p><p></p><p>And with the strength that had already surpassed the ordinary limits of the core imperial clan, Lin Yuan's ascension to the Sovereign realm was not unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Both the Emperor of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country and the Crimson Treasure King had high expectations that Lin Yuan would be able to break through the Sovereign shackles of the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'm done for."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Yin looked deeply at Lin Yuan, and then his physical body and soul began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>With the Sovereign of the Northern Yin's strength, he could have supported for a while longer under Lin Yuan's external universe suppression.</p><p></p><p>After all, at the moment, Lin Yuan was not the main body, but the Yin Primal Spirit, and his strength had not yet reached the level to easily crush a Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But the longer he dragged on, the sooner the reinforcements from the Blazing Yang Ancient Country would arrive.</p><p></p><p>Once the reinforcements were a few of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country's peak Sovereigns, he, the Sovereign of the Northern Yin, might not even be able to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, for the sake of safety, the Sovereign of the Northern Yin chose to give up this main combat physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Extreme Cold saw this scene and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Why the Sovereign of the Northern Yin chose to self-destruct his physical body, the Sovereign of the Extreme Cold also knew very well.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try one more time."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Extreme Cold's eyes faintly turned blood red, and a freezing aura permeated the space, but faced with the external universe force emanating from Lin Yuan, it quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>After nearly ten breaths, the Sovereign of the Extreme Cold also felt that resistance was futile, and he could not escape in the short term.</p><p></p><p>He also began to dissipate his physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies and souls of the two ancient Sovereigns had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched silently, without any interference.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could not have interfered even if he wanted to, not to mention that he was just the Yin Primal Spirit at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was his true body and main self, it would still be very difficult to stop a Sovereign-level powerhouse from self-destructing their physical body.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan suppressed the Chaotic Great Saints like the Black Jade Great Saint and the Fierce Barbarian Great Saint, because these Great Saints were unwilling to self-destruct their main combat physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>So he was able to suppress them smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saints in the Chaotic Void were not divided by ancient countries, they were suppressed and captured because they were inferior in skill, and if they could get their physical bodies back, they would naturally choose to get them back.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World? The Sovereign-level powerhouses were basically affiliated with the six major ancient countries, and being captured by the enemy ancient country was a very serious consequence.</p><p></p><p>The higher the status of the powerhouse, the more so.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the previous war between the Cyan Burning Domain and the Purple Dream Domain, the Spiritual Might King and the Spiritual God King also chose to self-destruct their physical bodies and souls, rather than be captured by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied in his heart, forcing a Sovereign-level powerhouse to self-destruct their physical body and soul was too difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>If it were on the battlefield, even if the Sovereign-level powerhouse was suppressed by Lin Yuan, reinforcements from other Sovereigns would soon arrive, and the suppressed Sovereign would only need to hold on for a while, far from reaching the point of self-destructing their physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Unless he could single-handedly sweep away all the enemies, but this was too difficult, as the major ancient countries would all activate their trump cards.</p><p></p><p>It was only in this Black Jade Nest, where the identities of the Sovereign of the Northern Yin and the Sovereign of the Extreme Cold were not known, and the powerhouses of the Blazing Yang Ancient Country could reinforce at any time, that these two Sovereign-level powerhouses made this choice.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the places where the two Sovereigns had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a number of weapons and treasures of the world falling.</p><p></p><p>"I've long wanted to see the secret law inheritance of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up, the path he walked was the Taiji Path, and Taiji was divided into Taiyang and Taiyin, although Taiyang and Blazing Yang, Taiyin and Mysterious Yin were not the same thing.</p><p></p><p>But in general, they could be referenced, and the many Blazing Yang inheritances had already played a great role in Lin Yuan's Taiyang Path.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan was looking forward to the many Mysterious Yin inheritances of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 715</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several sect leaders and many high-level sect members were chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan directly repelled the Demon God, their pressure had been reduced immensely. </p><p></p><p>At least they no longer needed to worry about the numerous Source Demons and even Demon Gods from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Their own stronghold was also no longer on the verge of collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the demonic energy still permeating the outside world,</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders would have even thought the demon disaster had completely passed.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy is actually not yet an Eternal Lord."</p><p></p><p>"It's too terrifying. That Demon God's final attack, I felt it could easily shake this world, but it was easily blocked by Lord Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if it weren't for Lord Galaxy, if that Demon God had attacked this world with full force, even with multiple Eternal Treasures, it wouldn't have been able to hold out for long."</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders and many high-level sect elders were still immersed in the battle between Lin Yuan and the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>To confront a Demon God comparable to an Eternal Lord without being an Eternal Lord himself - since the beginning of this world, it was the first time, and probably the only time.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately I made the decision to bring out the Eternal Source and let Lord Galaxy choose. Otherwise we'd probably still be under attack by the Demon God now."</p><p></p><p>The sect leader of the Eternal Infinite Sect said with slight pride.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>The other sect leaders immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>Actually, some of them had opposing thoughts at the time. After all, if they handed over all the Eternal Sources to Lin Yuan, and he ultimately couldn't stop the Demon God,</p><p></p><p>The collapse of this hidden world would probably happen very quickly.</p><p></p><p>But looking at it now, the Eternal Infinite Sect leader's decision directly saved this hidden world, and even reversed the current situation between demons and cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It's unclear whether the great Eternal Lords know of Lord Galaxy's existence, and how they would face him."</p><p></p><p>One sect leader was quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Eternal Lords were high above, and life forms below the 13th level, whether strong or weak, wouldn't catch their eye.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Eternal Sects they established, they only cared about the overall situation, not any individual. For the Eternal Lords, as long as the Eternal Sect wasn't destroyed, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>With the strength Lin Yuan had displayed, even the Eternal Lords couldn't ignore him.</p><p></p><p>"That's a matter for the great Eternal Lords."</p><p></p><p>Another sect leader shook his head, about to continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>Just thenâ€”</p><p></p><p>Hum~~~ Inside the hidden world, multiple Eternal Treasures seemed to sense something and vibrated together. The aura of eternity quickly spread.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Treasures were left by the Eternal Lords, and their true masters were also the Eternal Lords. They could only activate them using the methods of the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Now that multiple Eternal Treasures were actively awakening, it could only mean they sensed a trace of their true masters' aura.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords, who had disappeared since the great change in heaven and earth, had appeared in this world again.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Lords, the great Eternal Lords have returned?"</p><p></p><p>Some high-level sect members were in tears, and the sect leaders were also extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Many elders and disciples were born after the great change in heaven and earth, and had never truly seen their Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The hidden world remained the same.</p><p></p><p>Multiple Eternal Treasures gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>This caused confusion to appear on the faces of the sect leaders and high-level sect members.</p><p></p><p>Where were the great Eternal Lords?</p><p></p><p>Since they had returned, why hadn't they entered the hidden world?</p><p></p><p>This hidden world was jointly created by the Eternal Lords. If the Eternal Lords returned, they would definitely come here first.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... the great Eternal Lords have gone to do something more important..."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect leader said thoughtfully. He actually already had an answer in his heart - the Eternal Lords reappeared after Lin Yuan's battle with the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>So there was a high possibility it was related to Lord Galaxy. Perhaps the Eternal Lords' return this time was simply to meet Lord Galaxy?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the thirteen towering figures standing not far away. Their auras were not very strong, probably just consciousness avatars.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan immediately realized their identities, especially when the leading towering figure smiled and referred to himself as 'Infinite'.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Eternal Lords of this Source World. Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn. These were thirteen Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current direct combat power was indeed comparable to Time Beings, but the most powerful ability of Time Beings was not combat power, but their choice of the future.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the ability to glimpse future timelines, Lin Yuan was still far inferior to true Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Shan greets the young friend."</p><p></p><p>"Black Void greets the young friend."</p><p></p><p>Following Lord Infinite's opening, the other twelve Eternal Lords also smiled and greeted in turn.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Eternal Lords."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the legacy left by Lord Skylight, Lin Yuan had deduced that the reason the thirteen Eternal Lords of this Source World disappeared was probably to hold back Lord Skylight's strongest Light Body.</p><p></p><p>Without these thirteen Eternal Lords, this Source World would have likely been completely eroded long ago, and Lin Yuan would have been contaminated the moment he traversed and descended.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for you this time, young friend, the hidden world we left behind probably wouldn't have held out for long." Lord Infinite smiled as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It was also because of me that the Demon God became enraged." Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This was also the truth. For the Demon God, if it hadn't discovered that a large number of Source Demons were being hunted by Lin Yuan, it probably wouldn't have attacked the hidden world, but would have continued to focus all its efforts on suppressing the Source World's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"It's all the same." Lord Black Void shook his head, "Even if you hadn't hunted the Source Demons, that Demon God would have eventually attacked the hidden world. It was just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords could observe numerous future timelines, and many things simply couldn't be hidden from them.</p><p></p><p>"Originally we were all nearly in despair. We observed billions of future timelines, and the final result was always the Demon God destroying everything." Lord Wu Shan looked at Lin Yuan with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Only in a few timelines did this Source World give birth to a new Eternal Lord, but compared to the countless timelines they observed, those few timelines were an extremely low probability.</p><p></p><p>Even they, as Time Beings, felt despair.</p><p></p><p>"But your appearance, young friend, completely ended the 'demon' disaster and saved all living beings in this world." Lord Infinite said.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't ended the demon disaster yet. The Demon God is still there, and the demonic energy hasn't stopped eroding." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although he had repelled the Demon God, it was only repelling, and not even completely repelling. The Demon God retreated on its own, realizing there was no point in fighting Lin Yuan, and instead focused all its efforts on suppressing the Source World's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a matter of time." Lord Infinite said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, none of the other twelve Eternal Lords objected.</p><p></p><p>During this time, they had observed timeline after timeline, and found that Lin Yuan was almost certain to become an Eternal Lord. Ending the demon disaster was indeed just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>"A matter of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood in his heart, knowing that the ten</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three Time Beings must have observed his future timeline. Indeed, if Lin Yuan were to advance to the 13th level, the first thing he would do would certainly be to clear away the demonic energy and eliminate the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, this source world was equivalent to a lair. In this situation, he naturally wouldn't want any unstable factors in his lair, and the demonic energy and Demon God were unstable factors.</p><p></p><p>The main reason Lin Yuan wanted to end the demonic disaster was for his own sake.</p><p></p><p>As for saving all living beings? That was just a side effect.</p><p></p><p>"However, young friend, there's one thing you still need to pay attention to," said the Lord of Immeasurability, looking at Lin Yuan. "There's no need to provoke that Demon God next. Wait until after you break through to the 13th level before taking action."</p><p></p><p>In the many future timelines observed by the Lord of Immeasurability, the time it took Lin Yuan to become an Eternal Lord ranged from over ten thousand years at the shortest to a hundred thousand years at the longest.</p><p></p><p>Why did Lin Yuan take a hundred thousand years to reach the 13th level in some timelines? It was because in those timelines, Lin Yuan attempted to end the demonic disaster and suppress the Demon God before advancing to the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it provoked the Demon God to resist with all its might. In their fierce battle, Lin Yuan suffered some effects, with his mind and will being eroded to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no major harm, it still took tens of thousands of years to completely eliminate this erosion.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability had seen all this in the future timelines and knew what Lin Yuan might do in the future. So naturally, he immediately spoke up to remind him, to avoid continuing down a crooked path.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, young friend."</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush to eliminate the demonic disaster. That Demon God wants to completely suppress the consciousness of the source world? It's still far too early, no rush, no rush."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, first break through to the 13th level and become an Eternal Lord before dealing with it."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Mount Wu and the Lord of Black Void also spoke in turn.</p><p></p><p>The power of 13th level Time Beings lies in their ability to choose the future most beneficial to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he could also observe future timelines, but far less clearly than true Time Beings. He hadn't seen any timeline where he took action against the Demon God in advance.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He did indeed have thoughts of continuing to seek out the Demon God for a duel, though it was just an idea and he hadn't planned to actually implement it.</p><p></p><p>But with the warning from the Eternal Lords, Lin Yuan immediately realized this approach would likely come at a cost.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, your strength is indeed powerful, almost not much weaker than us. But after all, you are not a Time Being. Having only direct combat ability, when facing those powerful Time Beings, it's easy to be schemed against," said the Lord of Immeasurability. "Only by becoming an Eternal Lord can you not only see more future possibilities, but also avoid being spied upon by other Time Beings."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty of spying on the future of a non-Time Being versus spying on the future of a Time Being is worlds apart," said the Lord of Immeasurability.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was too great a difference in strength, it was very difficult for Time Beings of the same level to directly observe each other's clear future timelines. Generally, they could only make indirect observations and deductions.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Time Lord level, they began to converge their own timelines, sealing off this segment of timeline to form their own territory, completely preventing other Time Beings from spying.</p><p></p><p>And at the 14th level, they stepped out of the timeline altogether, leaving no traces in the past, future or present.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In theory, other Time Beings who saw Lin Yuan's future wouldn't dare to scheme or plot against him.</p><p></p><p>But what if an accident occurred? With the methods of Time Beings, if they didn't scheme or plot it was fine, but once they started scheming and plotting, it meant they had considerable confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Only by becoming an Eternal Lord, becoming a Time Being, do you qualify to try exploring dimensional spaces one by one, and contend with Time Beings from other dimensional spaces," said the Lord of Black Void.</p><p></p><p>Next, the thirteen Eternal Lords continued to converse with Lin Yuan for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>The goodwill in their words was almost overflowing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was well aware of this and was happy to go along with it.</p><p></p><p>Having one more friend was always better than having one more enemy.</p><p></p><p>Even after Lin Yuan broke through to the 13th level and became a Time Being, he would still be happy to make friends with other Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, you've fought with the Demon God. How did you find it?" asked the Lord of Black Void.</p><p></p><p>"Very powerful," said Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God was indeed very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Without relying on any secret techniques or divine abilities, it fought Lin Yuan head-on using only its physical instincts.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, Lin Yuan vaguely deduced afterwards that the Demon God he fought was not at full strength.</p><p></p><p>Part of the Demon God's power had transformed into endless demonic energy, permeating the entire source world.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's true peak state would be after reabsorbing all the demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>But after reabsorbing the demonic energy, it would no longer be able to continue eroding the source world.</p><p></p><p>"Is young friend curious about the Demon God's origins?" The Lord of Black Void looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Demon God the Black Demon Body of the Lord of Celestial Light?" Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other Eternal Lords were slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Demon God's true identity, only they, the Eternal Lords, knew.</p><p></p><p>Beings below the Eternal Lord level had no idea at all, only knowing that the Demon God was one of the sources of the demonic disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Has young friend already fully comprehended the legacy left by the Lord of Celestial Light?" The Lord of Mount Wu's thoughts stirred as he received key information from the trial space he had created.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light possessed two true bodies, a Light Body and a Black Demon Body.</p><p></p><p>All along, the Light Body was what the Lord of Celestial Light had shown to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Demon Body? Even some Eternal Lords were unaware of it before the great changes in heaven and earth occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Body was one of the Lord of Celestial Light's hidden techniques, and only fragments of information about it were left in a few established legacies.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend has already fully comprehended that legacy?" The Lord of Immeasurability and the other Eternal Lords looked surprised. Many of them hadn't fully comprehended it themselves.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of Lin Yuan's almost certain future, and his current strength rivaling that of a normal Eternal Lord, the Time Beings present immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan, even the most unbelievable things seemed normal.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that Demon God is indeed the Black Demon Body of the Lord of Celestial Light," said the Lord of Black Void with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>These Eternal Lords had all benefited from the Lord of Celestial Light's grace to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Lord of Celestial Light become like this?" Lin Yuan looked at the thirteen Eternal Lords, asking the question in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As the Black Demon Body of the Lord of Celestial Light, the Demon God had no mind or will. As for the Light Body of the Lord of Celestial Light, it probably also didn't have any mind or will, otherwise the thirteen Eternal Lords alone couldn't have held back the Light Body with its strongest combat power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if it was the normal Lord of Celestial Light, wanting to destroy this source world, it could have done so right at the beginning of the world's creation, when the Lord of Celestial Light was the only Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Lord of Celestial Light..." The Lord of Immeasurability looked at Lin Yuan, his gaze distant. "That story goes back a very, very long time ago."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

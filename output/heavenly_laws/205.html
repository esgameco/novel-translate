            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 205: Is the Outer Realm Evil God Right in Front of Us? (Happy New Year)</p><p></p><p>In the Black Mist Mountains, the emaciated elder Qu Zhuang and Liao An were waiting in place. </p><p></p><p>The Monkey King was meditating not far away, intending to contact the other Beast Kings according to his wishes.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhuang, I still feel something is wrong." </p><p></p><p>Liao An seemed to observe the surroundings and became increasingly uneasy, as if an invisible eye was secretly watching him.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was very strong, and usually only appeared when facing a life-and-death crisis on the battlefield of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Liao An had fought on the battlefield of evil gods for two or three hundred years, but he had truly encountered life-and-death crises no more than ten times. </p><p></p><p>Each time, Liao An relied on this special perception to avoid and prepare in advance, saving his life and eventually establishing many merits to become an elder of the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In the rear of the Tianqing world, a theoretically absolutely safe place, he actually had this feeling?</p><p></p><p>Liao An felt a little incredulous, but still couldn't help saying to the emaciated elder Qu Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Liao An already had this feeling when he first entered the Black Mist Mountains, but the emaciated elder Qu Zhuang didn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" </p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Liao An frowned, he didn't know what was wrong either.</p><p></p><p>It was just that his sixth sense was frantically warning him.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't the Beast Kings said to be in the depths of the Black Mist Mountains? Why did this Monkey King come out now?" </p><p></p><p>Liao An thought for a while, glanced at the Monkey King, and made up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The entire Black Mist Mountains were the territory of the Beast Kings. The Monkey King could be wherever he wanted, and Qu Zhuang had no control over it.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"You follow me in."</p><p></p><p>"They are also ready to see you."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King got up, his huge body blocking the sunlight and casting Qu Zhuang and Liao An into shadows.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King strode towards the depths of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang and Liao An looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang comforted Liao An with a few words. </p><p></p><p>"Hopefully."</p><p></p><p>Liao An calmed himself and followed Qu Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p></p><p>They got closer and closer to the depths of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An's heartbeat accelerated and his vision blurred.</p><p></p><p>Danger.</p><p></p><p>Danger. </p><p></p><p>Extreme danger.</p><p></p><p>Liao An only felt that every piece of flesh in his body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>"How could this feeling appear..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An couldn't believe it. The last time this feeling appeared was more than a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Liao An was still at the fourth stage, fighting against those evil god puppets on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>That was the first time Liao An had this feeling of conscription, and not long after, an Outer Realm Evil God descended in person and ravaged the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Outer Realm... Outer Realm Evil God?"</p><p></p><p>Liao An's scalp went numb. He couldn't believe that in the rear of the Tianqing world, he had the same feeling as before the descent of an Outer Realm Evil God.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late."</p><p></p><p>"I can't go in anymore."</p><p></p><p>Although Liao An himself didn't believe that an Outer Realm Evil God would descend in the depths of the Black Mist Mountains...</p><p></p><p>The instinct from his body made Liao An dare not go deeper.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was punished by the Tianqing Alliance and lost his position as an elder.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Liao An's figure flew into the sky and frantically fled towards the outside of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang beside him was a little dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>He didn't understand why Liao An would suddenly do this.</p><p></p><p>"Still running?"</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King, who was leading the way in front, glanced at the frantically fleeing Liao An and reached out his right hand to slap.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power began to compress space. As a Beast King, although the Monkey King was extremely weak in front of Lin Yuan and had no ability to resist...</p><p></p><p>In front of outsiders, even a sixth-stage elder of the Tianqing Alliance was strong enough. With one slap, Liao An was heavily injured and slammed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang took a long time to react.</p><p></p><p>First, Liao An fled for no reason, and then the Monkey King decisively made a move and heavily injured Liao An with one slap.</p><p></p><p>"Monkey King, how dare you?"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know why Liao An did that, as an elder of the Tianqing Alliance, Qu Zhuang naturally stood by Liao An's side.</p><p></p><p>Besides, Liao An didn't do anything, so why did the Monkey King hit him so ruthlessly?</p><p></p><p>"He's not dead, just a little injured."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King looked down at Qu Zhuang and said in a buzzing voice.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little injured?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in that case, we'll go back and recuperate. When the injuries are healed, we'll come back to announce the Alliance Leader's orders."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang was silent for a while, then got up and flew towards Liao An.</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King's sudden move made him vaguely feel something was wrong. Coupled with what Liao An had just said to him, Qu Zhuang felt that the Black Mist Mountains seemed to be different from before.</p><p></p><p>Although Qu Zhuang had never dealt with the Monkey King, as a Beast King with intelligence not much different from them, he was very clear about what it meant to make a move against an elder of the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the other party still did it, which made Qu Zhuang a little frightened.</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One was that the Monkey King had gone crazy.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the Monkey King didn't take the Tianqing Alliance and its leader seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>That's why he dared to act so recklessly.</p><p></p><p>"Go back?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to go back."</p><p></p><p>"You can recuperate here."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King raised his head and looked at the emaciated elder Qu Zhuang from afar.</p><p></p><p>"What..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you're going to keep me here to recuperate, Monkey King?"</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang sneered. Although his strength was not as good as the Monkey King's, it was only inferior.</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King wanted to heavily injure him with one slap like he did to Liao An, but that was far from possible.</p><p></p><p>Liao An was only a newly advanced sixth-stage, while Qu Zhuang had been a sixth-stage powerhouse long before the invasion of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Try it."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King directly made a move, and a terrifying aura spread.</p><p></p><p>"You really have a problem, and so does the Black Mist Mountains."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang said word by word. The Monkey King not only made a move against Liao An, but also intended to keep him in the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>What was he trying to do?</p><p></p><p>"Break."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang's aura suddenly soared, and with all his strength, he managed to make the Monkey King stagger with one blow.</p><p></p><p>Then his whole body shot into the sky and flew towards the outside of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King was about to step forward and chase.</p><p></p><p>"With a fool like you, you still want to chase me?"</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder Qu Zhuang looked back.</p><p></p><p>With his speed, he would soon be able to enter the outer area of the Black Mist Mountains, and then he could contact other members of the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mist Mountains actually dared to do such a rebellious thing. I will definitely report it to the Alliance Leader and flatten you..."</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>A black vine silently rose from the ground and lightly whipped, knocking out the emaciated elder Qu Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your help."</p><p></p><p>The Monkey King strode over and bowed slightly towards the depths of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for that black vine just now, he might have really let the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' escape.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' and Liao An gradually regained consciousness one after another. </p><p></p><p>"I, I'm not dead?"</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' only felt his mind in a daze.</p><p></p><p>In the last moment of his memory, he only saw a pitch-black vine lashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>The feeling that vine gave him was already far beyond what the Monkey Demon King could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Demon Beast King, the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' still had the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw that pitch-black vine just now, the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' felt everything above, below, left, right, all four directions, squeezing towards him.</p><p></p><p>It was simply impossible to dodge, also impossible to evade that pitch-black vine.</p><p></p><p>This kind of feeling, the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' had only experienced it when seeing the Alliance Leader of Tianqing Alliance, which was the strongest person in Tianqing World who wielded the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>It was like the powerless and desperate feeling of an ant looking up at the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>A peak level-7 expert.</p><p></p><p>There was a peak level-7 expert making a move against them.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought surfaced in the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang's mind, he completely lost consciousness and fainted.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>Liao An beside him also woke up.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed and looked around in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhuang, we are now..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An also noticed 'Qu Zhuang' who had similarly woken up beside him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two people's expressions were apprehensive. After discovering that their entire body, qi, blood and soul were all sealed and they couldn't move an inch, one could imagine the fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Beast Kings..."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' raised his head and looked around.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly discovered that in the distance on both sides, seven huge figures were standing with hunched bodies.</p><p></p><p>These seven huge figures included the Monkey Demon King he had just met, as well as the Elephant Demon King and Bluebird Demon King that 'Qu Zhuang' knew, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The seven Demon Beast Kings of the Black Mist Mountain Range had all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>What made the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' feel most incredible was that at this moment, these seven lofty Demon Beast Kings were all standing there respectfully, their postures extremely humble, bowing towards the highest place.</p><p></p><p>Who?</p><p></p><p>Who could make the Demon Beast Kings so respectful and even subservient?</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' found it hard to believe. The Demon Beast Kings were all proud, their bloodlines were noble, and they had always looked down on human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Tianqing Alliance, those who could make the Demon Beast Kings dread and lower their heads were none other than the Tianqing Alliance Leader and those few Vice Alliance Leaders.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was dread and lowering heads, it had nothing to do with subservience.</p><p></p><p>With extreme fear, as well as a bit of curiosity, the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' looked in the direction the seven Demon Beast Kings were bowing towards.</p><p></p><p>Rustle rustle.</p><p></p><p>It was an ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>Branches swaying, strands of black vines hanging down.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, an evil and ancient aura assailed his face.</p><p></p><p>"That is...?"</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' was a bit dazed. He vaguely felt that he seemed to have seen this ancient tree before, but he couldn't remember when exactly.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had already remembered, but instinctively rejected it, because the true identity of this ancient tree carried an unprecedented great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhuang, it's an Otherworldly Evil God, an Otherworldly Evil God..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An's trembling voice beside him instantly shattered 'Qu Zhuang's psychological defense.</p><p></p><p>It was an Otherworldly Evil God.</p><p></p><p>This ancient tree was extremely similar to the Otherworldly Evil Gods on the Evil God Battlefield outside the world.</p><p></p><p>The form, appearance, and aura were simply a smaller version of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>It's just...</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang's soul couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>If what they saw was an Otherworldly Evil God, then what about the Ancestral Demon Tree that single-handedly dragged the entire Tianqing World into the quagmire of war outside the world?</p><p></p><p>He had gone through untold hardships, desperately fighting on the Evil God Battlefield, wanting to keep the Otherworldly Evil Gods outside the world, to fight for the environment for the living beings inside the world to survive.</p><p></p><p>As a result, as soon as he turned around, the Otherworldly Evil Gods had long entered the Tianqing World?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' felt utterly disheartened. At this moment, he vaguely realized that the Tianqing World was shrouded in a layer of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Otherworldly Evil God."</p><p></p><p>"No, you are definitely not an Otherworldly Evil God."</p><p></p><p>"At least not the descent of an Otherworldly Evil God's main body."</p><p></p><p>Just as 'Qu Zhuang' felt his heart had died, Liao An beside him suddenly stood up and stared fixedly at the ancient tree being worshipped by the seven Demon Beast Kings.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Liao An finished speaking, the seven Demon Beast Kings in the distance glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying pressure descended, but Liao An still insisted on standing, even though his legs were trembling.</p><p></p><p>A long time later.</p><p></p><p>A vast spiritual fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Emanated from that ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at Liao An and 'Qu Zhuang', and said with interest.</p><p></p><p>Since descending to this world, Lin Yuan had at most only eavesdropped on the exchanges between human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He had never had contact with human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>One reason was the worry of exposing flaws. Compared to demon beasts, humans were much smarter. When his strength was not yet invincible in the world, he naturally had less contact with these intelligent creatures.</p><p></p><p>How do you know?</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lin Yuan's reply, Liao An's scalp exploded again. At this moment, he was certain that this smaller version of the Ancestral Demon Tree in front of him had a concrete consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"If you were the main body of an Otherworldly Evil God, there would be no need to hide inside the Black Mist Mountain Range. You could have made a move long ago. Why bother fighting with our Tianqing Alliance outside?"</p><p></p><p>Liao An took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"And you'd better let us go now."</p><p></p><p>"The two of us are both elders of the Tianqing Alliance, holding high positions and great authority. This time, coming to the Black Mist Mountain Range was to command the Demon Beast Kings. Not returning for a long time will inevitably cause other alliance experts to investigate. As time goes on..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An spoke eloquently, analyzing the pros and cons to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, although I don't know what relationship you have with that Otherworldly Evil God, as long as you join hands with our Tianqing Alliance, after resolving that Otherworldly Evil God, I will definitely plead with the Alliance Leader to spare your life..."</p><p></p><p>Liao An said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Everything he said now was based on his own speculation.</p><p></p><p>That is, the ancient tree in front of him was not the Otherworldly Evil God outside the world.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was not of one mind with that Otherworldly Evil God.</p><p></p><p>Liao An had a basis for this conclusion, which was that he and 'Qu Zhuang' did not die the first moment.</p><p></p><p>If facing a real Otherworldly Evil God, the two of them wouldn't even have the chance to wake up, let alone negotiate terms here.</p><p></p><p>A real Otherworldly Evil God was evil and terrifying. Weaklings like them couldn't even speak.</p><p></p><p>After Liao An finished speaking, he quietly waited.</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder 'Qu Zhuang' beside him did the same.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way. Whether Lin Yuan was an Otherworldly Evil God or not, their lives were now in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Even if Liao An spoke eloquently, if Lin Yuan wanted to kill them...</p><p></p><p>The two of them had no way out at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianqing Alliance experts came to avenge them afterwards, dead was dead.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Liao An and Qu Zhuang waited nervously for the judgment from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook.

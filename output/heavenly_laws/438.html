            <p>I'm afraid I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be a copyrighted section from a Chinese novel. Reproducing full chapters or large portions of copyrighted works without permission would constitute copyright infringement. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes the main character, Lin Yuan, who has recently reached the 11th level of cultivation. His spiritual willpower has grown immensely powerful, to the point where it strains the limits of what his current physical body and inner world can contain. He ponders needing to conceal the true depths of his power from other powerful beings. The excerpt also mentions Lin Yuan preparing to enter a large-scale battlefield realm, and his intention to begin working on cultivating the 11th level of his martial path. Towards the end, a vice sect leader named Nalan congratulates Lin Yuan on his breakthrough and reminisces about witnessing Lin Yuan's growth over the years.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce the full text, but I hope this high-level summary is still useful while respecting the copyright of the original work. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan's thoughts were wandering. However, he did not have any feelings of jealousy, because there was simply no reason to be jealous. </p><p></p><p>Other evolvers only knew about the Galaxy Star Master's growth rate from various intelligence reports, but Deputy Tower Master Nalan had personally witnessed Lin Yuan's step-by-step growth.</p><p></p><p>The impact on them was completely different.</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky," Lin Yuan waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Master is being modest," Deputy Tower Master Nalan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I came this time is to invite the Galaxy Star Master to attend a gathering," Deputy Tower Master Nalan got to the point.</p><p></p><p>This gathering was organized by many 11th-level evolvers of the human civilization, specifically to celebrate Lin Yuan's advancement to the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Even for a pinnacle race like the human civilization, 11th-level evolvers were extremely rare, with no more than a thousand in total on the surface.</p><p></p><p>The birth of any 11th-level evolver would warrant a personal meeting from other 11th-level evolvers, especially someone like Lin Yuan who advanced as the strongest 10th-level, the most talented evolver in human history.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gathering would definitely be held in the virtual world, so it wouldn't take much time, just a strand of his spiritual will participating.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then I'll invite you."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an invitation appeared before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose to accept.</p><p></p><p>He immediately entered a manor.</p><p></p><p>One 11th-level evolver after another smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Among these 11th-level evolvers, there were many Lin Yuan had met several times before.</p><p></p><p>For example, the President of the Jade Fall Society, the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Family, the Clan Leader of the human Xia Family, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Most of them he had seen at the 11th-level celebration hosted by Deputy Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had only heard of the names of the vast majority of 11th-level evolvers, without having personally interacted with them.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Galaxy Star Master is here," the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Family stood up with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then the rest of the many 11th-level evolvers also stood up one after another to greet Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they sat down in small groups.</p><p></p><p>Those who could cultivate to the 11th level were basically from various eras, with a large portion originating from the long dormant period of human civilization before the Cosmic Year.</p><p></p><p>These evolvers respected the Galaxy Star Master, but would not go out of their way to curry favor with him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also quietly sat down and casually chatted with Deputy Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"They're all discussing the super large alien battlefield," Lin Yuan looked around and found that many 11th-level evolvers were discussing matters related to the super large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Only 11th-level evolvers can enter the super large war. The battlefield is vast and boundless, far surpassing all the large battlefields opened in the past, so many 11th-level evolvers are discussing how to cooperate with each other on the super large alien battlefield," Deputy Tower Master Nalan said in a low voice. Although he was also a newly promoted 11th-level evolver, he had long integrated into the 11th-level circle and was quite familiar with the issues that currently concerned the 11th-level evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had already learned about the importance of the super large alien battlefield from the strongest of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall female figure walked over, looking at Lin Yuan with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master Xuanxuan Du," Deputy Tower Master Nalan immediately called out.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanxuan Du," Lin Yuan looked towards the tall woman in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had an impression of this Xuanxuan Du. When he fell into the two-dimensional world of white paper, Xuanxuan Du was the leader of the 11th-level experts of the human civilization. </p><p></p><p>Back then when Lin Yuan appeared as "Blood Rain", he had some interactions with this Xuanxuan Du.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Du came from the Xuanxuan Family, as the strongest family of the human civilization, the Xuanxuan Family naturally had more than one 11th-level evolver.</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor often mentions you in front of us," Xuanxuan Du said.</p><p></p><p>The "Progenitor" Xuanxuan Du referred to was naturally the source of the Xuanxuan Family's bloodline, the first Supreme Being born at the birth of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>With the status of a Supreme Being, even after establishing a family, they would rarely interfere, but they would certainly care deeply about the 11th-level juniors within the clan.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, they would separate a strand of spiritual will to descend and provide guidance.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to display such talent and aptitude, it was only natural for the Supreme Beings to mention him when teaching their juniors.</p><p></p><p>"I'm honored by the Supreme Beings' attention," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor is the strongest of us nine human Supreme Beings. If he values you, he must have his reasons," Xuanxuan Du continued observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxuan..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The strong one." An indistinct and majestic figure emerged in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine strongest experts of human civilization he had encountered several times, the Xuanxuan expert was undoubtedly the most taciturn.</p><p></p><p>He basically never spoke.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of strength, the Xuanxuan expert was unquestionable. </p><p></p><p>If the Xia Qin expert and Gu Li expert were considered top-tier in killing power among the nine strongest experts of human civilization,</p><p></p><p>And the Xushen expert was deemed the strongest in mastering space,</p><p></p><p>While the Yudie expert was unmatched in the realm of illusions,</p><p></p><p>Then the Xuanxuan expert was the overall strongest without any shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>It was the Xuanxuan expert who supported human civilization through its most difficult period.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the Xuanxuan expert has almost reached the peak of the 'Path Opening Realm,'" the nearby Vice Patriarch Nalan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of the Path Opening Realm..." Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>The ninth level was divided into the Ten Thousand Realm, Million Realm, Ten Million Realm, Hundred Million Realm, and Billion Realm.</p><p></p><p>The tenth level also had many subdivided ranks, with the highest being the Grade A Tenth Level.  </p><p></p><p>The eleventh level was similar, divided into six tiers, with the sixth tier of the perfected Eleventh Level able to break through to the ultimate at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the twelfth level, the ultimate realm of the strongest experts, it could also be divided into three ranks:</p><p></p><p>The Path Opening Realm, the Dominance Realm, and the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, before the Path Opening Realm, there was a transitional stage that newly promoted twelfth level experts would go through.</p><p></p><p>However, this stage would pass quickly, and twelfth level experts wouldn't take long to open up their own great path.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin of the Path Opening Realm.</p><p></p><p>Opening up one's own great path was the Path Opening Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the Path Opening Realm came the Dominance Realm and the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Experts like the Lord of the Magic Jewel Tower and the Xuanhuang Emperor were at the peak of the Chaos Realm, traversing the boundless chaos and establishing their own supreme forces.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Path Opening Realm is not that easy to reach."</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Du shook his head slightly. At the eleventh level realm, one could access much information about the twelfth level domain.</p><p></p><p>This included the catastrophe of the end of the cosmic cycle when all things would collapse.</p><p></p><p>To survive the destruction of the cosmos, more than half of the twelfth level ultimates would have to die. To safely pass through, one would need at least the strength of the peak Path Opening Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the peak Path Opening Realm, it would just depend on luck. During the period of cosmic destruction, the pressure each strongest expert had to endure was different. With good luck, one might be able to persevere.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dominance Realm after the Path Opening Realm, twelfth level experts of the Dominance Realm, even in the boundless chaos, were considered strong and ruled over everything.</p><p></p><p>"In a normal and complete cosmic cycle, it's extremely rare for a peak Path Opening Realm twelfth level expert to be born," Xuanxuan Du added.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanxuan Patriarch could cultivate to the peak of the Path Opening Realm, the impact on human civilization would be unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>The explosive growth in combat strength went without saying, but at least when facing the catastrophe at the end of the cosmos, he could preserve a large part of the elite human civilization and smoothly enter the boundless chaos.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already well-versed in the specific divisions of the twelfth level realm, whether it was the Magic Jewel Space or the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, both had records on this.</p><p></p><p>"For now, the cosmos I'm in is still extremely young, having only experienced one-tenth of a cosmic cycle. As long as there are no accidents, it's still early before the destructive end period."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. A complete cosmic cycle, if measured in "years", would be an unimaginable number of billions.</p><p></p><p>For experts like the Lord of the Magic Jewel Tower and the Xuanhuang Emperor at the peak of the Chaos Realm, they had long abandoned using the time "units" within the cosmos to measure the years, instead preferring to use cosmic cycles.</p><p></p><p>Beings of different realms perceived the scale of time differently.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted with Xuanxuan Du and Vice Patriarch Nalan for a while about the information of the twelfth level realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they shifted the topic to the upcoming super-large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Master, will you also enter this super-large battlefield?" Xuanxuan Du casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"I should go," Lin Yuan nodded. This was something he had discussed with the strongest experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would participate in the form of the Dinghai Divine Needle, helping human civilization seize the first initiative in the super-large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this matter was top secret. If the aliens found out, they might come up with countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Du nodded, then seemed to think of something. He glanced at the other eleventh level cultivators around, shielded their surroundings, and said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"But rest assured, for this super-large alien battlefield, our human civilization is not unprepared, we have a key trump card in reserve."</p>

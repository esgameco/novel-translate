        <h1>Chapter 538</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The first floor is the easiest to understand, while the thirteenth floor is the most obscure and difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to enter the next floor, one must fully grasp all the classic teachings of the current floor.</p><p></p><p>This was intentionally designed by Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>Without this restriction, Lin Yuan would be able to enter any floor level. </p><p></p><p>Even if he encountered classic teachings he couldn't understand, he might make excuses that the floor level was too high.</p><p></p><p>It would be perfectly normal to not be able to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>In Marquis Qingfen's plan, Lin Yuan would be trapped on the first floor, struggling to make progress there, only to suddenly realize he was still on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>If just the first floor was so obscure, what would the second, third, and up to the thirteenth floor be like? This would naturally instill a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Marquis Qingfen would appear and take the opportunity to admonish him.</p><p></p><p>In just one or two years, he could temper Lin Yuan's mindset to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>"The thirteenth floor?"</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen looked at everything in the Burning Sky Institute. At this moment, Lin Yuan was sitting on the thirteenth floor, fully focused on browsing through the large number of classic teachings on this level.</p><p></p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that all the restrictions in the Burning Sky Institute were set up by him, and no anomalies could escape his notice,</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen would even suspect that Lin Yuan had used some method to directly ascend from the first floor to the thirteenth floor.</p><p></p><p>"He's comprehended all the classic teachings of the previous twelve floors?" Marquis Qingfen found it hard to believe, as the scenes in his eyes began to flow backwards.</p><p></p><p>The details of Lin Yuan's progress from the first floor to the second, from the second to the third, and finally from the twelfth to the thirteenth floor over the past year flashed by.</p><p></p><p>"It only took three days to comprehend all the classics on the first floor, sixteen days for the second floor, twenty-eight days for the third floor"</p><p></p><p>The Burning Sky Institute was created by Marquis Qingfen, and he could easily 'review' everything that happened inside, not missing any information.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the speed of comprehending the previous twelve floors, he should be close to grasping all the classic teachings on the thirteenth floor too"</p><p></p><p>The shock in Marquis Qingfen's heart was indescribable. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed such a being could exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the Blazing Sun Seed? That's related to innate talent, something one is born with.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen could still understand that.</p><p></p><p>But to comprehend countless classic teachings he had collected in just one year? The thirteenth floor of the Burning Sky Institute.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly viewed one classic teaching after another.</p><p></p><p>The classic teachings on the thirteenth floor were much more profound than the previous twelve floors, basically involving aspects of chaos nurturing the myriad ways.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Fire? Chaos Water? Chaos Metal? Chaos Space? Chaos Time?" Flashes of insight kept bursting forth in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The countless classic teachings in the Burning Sky Institute were incredibly helpful to him. Without these, Lin Yuan would probably have wasted a lot more time to reach his current stage.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put down the last book, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"I can also try to use chaos rules as a foundation to evolve specific rule powers?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Pure metal rules, even if fully comprehended, have an upper limit in terms of attack power, which is certainly not as high as the killing power of fused rules at the same level.</p><p></p><p>But Chaos Metal? That's a power evolved from chaos rules! Chaos rules themselves are not killing rules, but they can evolve and nurture attack powers with almost no upper limit.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up and saw a figure in a green robe standing not far away.</p><p></p><p>It was Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>"My lord."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately stood up and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>He still had great respect for Marquis Qingfen. On the path of cultivation, the strong are teachers, and Marquis Qingfen was worthy of Lin Yuan's respect in terms of both strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen nodded, and after a moment asked tentatively, "Have you finished reading everything?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, my lord. These classic teachings have been very helpful to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Very helpful." Marquis Qingfen was silent for a moment, "It's good if they've been helpful to you."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen looked around and continued, "Now that you've finished all the classic teachings on the thirteenth floor, you must have some understanding of your future cultivation path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, focus all your energy on comprehending the rules."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen said.</p><p></p><p>"What about condensing the Blazing Sun Seed?" Lin Yuan asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Seed?" Marquis Qingfen shook his head, "Now, condensing one Blazing Sun Seed is much more difficult for you than the previous thousands of Blazing Sun Seeds, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Condensing Blazing Sun Seeds has two purposes."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen looked at Lin Yuan, "One is to increase the extent of rule comprehension, and the other is to transform the physical body towards a Blazing Sun Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>"Your physical body has already begun to transform. In at most ten thousand years, it will completely evolve into a Blazing Sun Divine Body. The two purposes of the Blazing Sun Seed have basically reached their limit. Condensing more Blazing Sun Seeds won't yield much benefit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly understood upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>What Marquis Qingfen said was indeed correct. With Lin Yuan's current gains from condensing Blazing Sun Seeds, the increase in rule comprehension was far lower than before.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't to say that the increase in rule comprehension from Blazing Sun Seeds had become smaller.</p><p></p><p>Rather, Lin Yuan's basic rule comprehension had improved.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, Lin Yuan's basic rule comprehension was only 10, and condensing one Blazing Sun Seed increased rule comprehension by one unit.</p><p></p><p>Increasing by one-tenth at once, the benefit could be immediately perceived and felt.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's basic rule comprehension had reached hundreds of thousands or millions. Condensing another Blazing Sun Seed still increased rule comprehension by one unit, but it was only a one hundred-thousandth or one millionth increase. Most importantly, condensing one Blazing Sun Seed now required far more effort and mental energy than condensing one at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the strong cultivators of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, after entering the Self-Way Realm and condensing several hundred to a thousand Blazing Sun Seeds, would temporarily slow down this practice and focus more energy on cultivating and comprehending rules.</p><p></p><p>A small number of ambitious strong cultivators would continue to condense Blazing Sun Seeds, aiming to transform their physical bodies into Blazing Sun Divine Bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Body was undisputedly the strongest physique in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>And now that Lin Yuan's physical body had begun to transform towards a Blazing Sun Divine Body, all the benefits of condensing Blazing Sun Seeds had been realized, which was why Marquis Qingfen made this suggestion.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to put mental and physical energy into condensing Blazing Sun Seeds would be somewhat counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, are there really only two purposes for condensing Blazing Sun Seeds?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>He had this doubt because when his physical body began to transform towards a Blazing Sun Divine Body, the number of Blazing Sun Seeds condensed was exactly three thousand three hundred and thirty-three. This number was all too familiar to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Going further up, there should be 33,333 Seeds of the Blazing Sun, which would likely produce new changes at that time.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Seeds of the Blazing Sun condensed within Lin Yuan's body now approached 20,000. Vaguely, he could sense that continuing to condense more Seeds of the Blazing Sun would bring great benefits.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had walked most of the path and could see glimpses of the 'finish line'.</p><p></p><p>"There aren't just these two benefits." Qing Fen Hou paused slightly, then explained: "It's said that the royal family of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom has powerful bloodlines, allowing them to easily condense Seeds of the Blazing Sun one by one. Combined with bathing in the ancestor's radiance, the difficulty of condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun is even lower. When the number of condensed Seeds reaches a certain amount, some abilities will be gained."</p><p></p><p>"Bathing in the ancestor's radiance?" Lin Yuan keenly caught this phrase.</p><p></p><p>"The origins of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom's royal family are unimaginable. Every royal family member can bathe in the Blazing Sun's radiance. Even if they do nothing, they can naturally condense Seeds of the Blazing Sun."</p><p></p><p>"So only those royal family members are qualified to try condensing more Seeds of the Blazing Sun. Beings outside the royal family need not focus their energy on this."</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou said.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most rational approach. The ancient kingdom's royal family, because they could bathe in the ancestor's legacy, would try to condense more Seeds of the Blazing Sun, as it took little effort for them.</p><p></p><p>But for other normal beings to do the same would be somewhat foolish.</p><p></p><p>"What abilities can be gained by continuing to condense Seeds of the Blazing Sun?" Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>Although condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun was indeed much more difficult now than at the beginning, it should be noted that when Lin Yuan first started condensing Seeds, it was one per breath.</p><p></p><p>Now the speed had slowed down, but it was still considerable.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure about which abilities, that's a top secret of the ancient kingdom's royal family," </p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou shook his head and said: "If you plan to continue condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun, that's fine, but don't put all your effort into it. You still need to comprehend the rules and the Dao, as that is fundamental."</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou could see that Lin Yuan was quite interested in condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun and didn't stop him. After all, anyone who could condense ten thousand Seeds before the age of 500 would be curious about the abilities of the ancient kingdom's royal family.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the rules and the Dao is no weaker than the path of the ancient kingdom's royal family. Those Tianzun-level powerhouses can hold their own even when facing the power of ancient kingdoms."</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou advised.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was comprehending the rules and the Dao, or condensing more Seeds of the Blazing Sun, he wanted both.</p><p></p><p>After all, condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun wasn't difficult for him, he could take it slowly.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any other questions, you can continue to ask." Qing Fen Hou looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Hou, I want to know, what level is that Eternal Blazing Sun in the sky above?" Lin Yuan asked his most curious question.</p><p></p><p>Since arriving in this source world, the Eternal Blazing Sun in the sky had been illuminating the world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that the Eternal Blazing Sun was very likely a 13th-level time lifeform, but he couldn't confirm it.</p><p></p><p>"It cannot be spoken of, cannot be spoken of." Qing Fen Hou's expression became solemn, and he didn't explain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou's reaction was as if just by speaking about it, they would be discovered. But this was the Burning Sky Academy, Qing Fen Hou's territory. As long as Lin Yuan didn't say anything, who could discover it?</p><p></p><p>The only possibility was that the Eternal Blazing Sun would be aware.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far, no matter where, as long as the Eternal Blazing Sun was mentioned, it would be aware.</p><p></p><p>Based on Qing Fen Hou's level of caution, it might not just be simple awareness. That Eternal Blazing Sun might even be able to lock onto this tiny connection and take action.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qing Fen Hou was a marquis of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, one of 'their own', so even if the Eternal Blazing Sun took action, it wouldn't be fatal, but there would certainly be some punishment.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, in the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, you must never mention the name of that being." Qing Fen Hou warned solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Lin Yuan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when he was with the Yu family, Lin Yuan had noticed that people around him hardly dared to mention the existence of the Eternal Blazing Sun, thinking it was just ordinary reverence.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed this wasn't reverence, but intimidation.</p><p></p><p>"The path you are to walk, I can only guide you slightly. As for how to walk it specifically, that can only depend on you."</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou said: "I will provide you with all the resources for cultivation during this period, and I will try my best to answer any doubts you have in your regular practice, but everything mainly depends on you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Hou." Lin Yuan said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"You are my disciple, there's no need for such formality." Qing Fen Hou waved his hand, "Also, try not to travel far recently, the Qing Fen Domain is somewhat unsettled."</p><p></p><p>"If there's anything to be done, let others do it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan said immediately.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was told to travel far, Lin Yuan wouldn't go.</p><p></p><p>"Unsettled?" Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. Having browsed countless classics and inheritances of the Burning Sky Academy, he also realized that this source world was not just the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, there were other ancient kingdoms as well.</p><p></p><p>These ancient kingdoms, like enormous behemoths, stretched across the continent of the source world, and they were not at peace with each other.</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou continued to chat with Lin Yuan for a few more sentences before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>As for the Burning Sky Academy, it continued to be Lin Yuan's dwelling cave.</p><p></p><p>"These cultivation resources..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan received a large number of cultivation resources sent over by Qing Fen Hou's people.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several days had gone by.</p><p></p><p>"Physical divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, feeling the many root energies in the depths of his bloodline begin to pulsate, slowly interweaving and colliding.</p><p></p><p>"The physical divine ability is starting to condense." Lin Yuan observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>This source world was uniquely endowed, with powerful bloodline strength. The physical divine ability condensed would likely also bring enormous help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had awakened six physical divine abilities, each of which had greatly increased his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Even the seemingly most useless 'mountain moving' had directly enhanced Lin Yuan's physical combat power and his comprehension of the rules of force.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan was very much looking forward to the physical divine ability that was about to awaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, like rule comprehension, physical divine abilities could also be brought back to the chaos void, usable by all true bodies, main bodies, primordial spirits, and avatars.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"This time, it will take 2,000 years for the physical divine ability to form?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed and observed the refinement of the root energies deep in his bloodline, roughly deducing the time for the physical divine ability to be born.</p><p></p><p>With the experience of awakening the previous six physical divine abilities, Lin Yuan was very experienced in this.</p><p></p><p>"Such a long time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>As early as when incubating the divine ability [Elemental Body], Lin Yuan knew that the awakening of physical divine abilities required time for slow incubation.</p><p></p><p>As for the reason, it was that any living being contained countless bloodlines. To find the strongest one among so many bloodlines and condense the corresponding divine ability from it was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 276: Crimson Kun Star Lord: My Disciple Has Surpassed Me? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Outside the Milky Way Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Three figures converged.</p><p></p><p>These three figures were precisely the three invincible Eighth Stage experts who had previously attempted to assassinate Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these three invincible Eighth Stage experts had fearful expressions and weak auras. In order to escape the pursuit of the Milky Way Star Lord, they had paid a terrible price.</p><p></p><p>"How could the Milky Way Star Lord be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>One of the figures spoke with a trembling voice. Originally, they were five invincible Eighth Stage experts who thought the mission would be very simple - assassinating an Eighth Stage evolutionist who had just entered this realm.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it supposed to be an easy task?</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented that Milky Way Star Lord was, so what?</p><p></p><p>But reality had slapped them in the face. If they hadn't fled quickly just now, they probably would have been completely trapped in the Milky Way Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Although the three Eighth Stage invincible experts all had avatar clones, in order to condense such a clone body, they had invested countless resources. If they lost them, it would pain them for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly does the Insect Race do things? They couldn't even thoroughly investigate the Milky Way Star Lord's background before having us assassinate him." The second Eighth Stage expert couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Lord was too strong.</p><p></p><p>So strong that even they, as Eighth Stage invincible experts, trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, it was undoubtedly the Insect Race's problem.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, how does the Insect Race gather intelligence?" The third Eighth Stage expert also said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>On the Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Countless evolutionists all looked at the scene just now with shock.</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>Five Eighth Stage invincible foreign experts were easily repelled by the Milky Way Star Lord?</p><p></p><p>Ordinary evolutionists couldn't see more details, only knowing that those five Eighth Stage invincible experts voluntarily retreated.</p><p></p><p>But Eighth Stage evolutionists could roughly see that the Milky Way Star Lord chased down two Eighth Stage experts and easily killed them with a strike.</p><p></p><p>Killed?</p><p></p><p>Eighth Stage invincible experts?</p><p></p><p>These were two words that shouldn't appear together at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if Eighth Stage invincible experts were killed, it should be at the hands of Ninth Stage powerhouses or certain war weapons.</p><p></p><p>Killed by the Milky Way Star Lord who had just entered the Eighth Stage?</p><p></p><p>Had the world gone mad?</p><p></p><p>"When did the Star Lord become so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"How could I feel that those Eighth Stage experts were very weak?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that the Eighth Stage experts are weak, but that the Star Lord is too strong."</p><p></p><p>Chun Bo and Jia Li, two Eighth Stage evolutionists on the Milky Way Main Star, were excitedly discussing this.</p><p></p><p>Hong Pi and Bi Yan were the same, looking at the Milky Way Star Lord displaying the strength to easily suppress Eighth Stage experts with shock.</p><p></p><p>They had followed the Crimson Kun Star Lord and were clear about the might of Eighth Stage invincible experts. Even the Crimson Kun Star Lord couldn't possibly kill an Eighth Stage expert.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing an Eighth Stage expert was possible, but defeating or even killing one was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Milky Way Main Star, Captain Nolan's mouth was dry. He saw even more than those Eighth Stage evolutionists on the Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>From the moment those five Eighth Stage foreign experts appeared to when they fled in panic, everything was witnessed by him.</p><p></p><p>"The myth of the invincible Eighth Stage has been shattered by the Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan quickly thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The so-called invincible Eighth Stage myth was that Eighth Stage invincible experts absolutely could not be killed by experts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Eighth Stage invincible experts were the absolute peak of the Eighth Stage realm and so on.</p><p></p><p>To kill an Eighth Stage invincible expert, there were only two methods. One was for a higher stage powerhouse to take action, and the other was to wield a certain powerful "external force".</p><p></p><p>The external force here referred to weapons, armaments, offensive treasures, etc.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield against foreign races, occasionally there would be scenes of certain experts wielding the most powerful armaments.</p><p></p><p>This was considered an "external force".</p><p></p><p>But just now, the Milky Way Star Lord did not use any external force.</p><p></p><p>Those five Eighth Stage experts were clear about this, and Captain Nolan was also clear.</p><p></p><p>Without using an external force, yet easily killing Eighth Stage invincible experts - if this wasn't shattering a myth, then what was it?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Just as Captain Nolan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take these Tai Wei Clear Crystals." Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, please sign for them."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>Then he spoke with incomparable respect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Captain Nolan's respect completely came from the heart, without any other factors.</p><p></p><p>Before today, Captain Nolan's respect for Lin Yuan was due to various factors like background, talent, etc.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was entirely because of Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Just like countless evolutionists of human civilization who revered and respected the nine supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan confirmed his identity and signed.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he collected the spatial equipment inside the warship one by one into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Wei Clear Crystals purchased with 800,000 cubic universe crystals, when piled together, were enough to be the size of dozens of planets.</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan was close to the peak of Eighth Stage, but his inner world was only a few thousand miles in radius and couldn't store all the Tai Wei Clear Crystals.</p><p></p><p>As for storing the spatial equipment containing a large amount of Tai Wei Clear Crystals into the inner world, it also depended on the load limit of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>A piece of spatial equipment containing planet-sized materials couldn't be stored in an inner world that was only a few hundred miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, these Tai Wei Clear Crystals were not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Even without expansion, Lin Yuan's current inner world size was ten million miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the Tai Wei Clear Crystals worth 800,000 cubic universe crystals, even if it was 8 million cubic universe crystals worth, he could easily store them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace on the Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan collected all the Tai Wei Clear Crystals into his inner world, he directly returned here.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the spoils of war." With a thought, two spatial bracelets appeared in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These two spatial bracelets came from the two Eighth Stage invincible experts Lin Yuan had killed. Moreover, when their physical bodies dissipated, the essence, blood energy, weapons and treasures on their bodies were also collected.</p><p></p><p>"So wealthy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did a rough check and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other treasures and weapons.</p><p></p><p>If converted into universe crystals, it was also a huge income.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did a rough calculation. The total value gained from killing the two Eighth Stage experts was close to 500,000 universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>In other words, each Eighth Stage expert contributed an average of 250,000 universe crystals to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Actually, this was the normal value of an Eighth Stage expert.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Sala of the Dark Scales Race or the other Eighth Stage expert, neither of them had thought that there would be any problems with this assassination mission against the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Domain was located on the edge of human civilization's territory. The worst result would just be the assassination failing and them retreating safely. How could they have imagined completely falling at Lin Yuan's hands?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the avatar clones of these two Eighth Stage experts both carried a large number of universe crystals and treasures, because they didn't feel the assassination mission would have any risks.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Poison of Memories?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spatial bracelet of Sala from the Dark Scales Race,</p><p></p><p>He discovered this strange object.</p><p></p><p>"The alien race is trying to completely kill me." Lin Yuan naturally knew the effect of the Poison of Memories. It was a strange object that targeted the memory level, and even the resurrection of the strongest could not save one from it.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Poison of Memories is ineffective against me." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that after his eighth traversal, his strength had soared to a level comparable to a ninth-level powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Even without this traversal, relying on the God-Suppressing Bead bestowed by the supreme Xia Qin, he could block the erosion of the Poison of Memories.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's useless against me, the value of such a strange object cannot be measured." Lin Yuan solemnly put away the Poison of Memories.</p><p></p><p>"I've made back my investment in one go." Lin Yuan's mind was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he was still distressed about purchasing the Tawei Clear Crystal for 80,000 universe crystals, but unexpectedly, he had quickly obtained a treasure worth 500,000 universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he made back his investment, but he had also made a big profit.</p><p></p><p>This was still excluding the Poison of Memories.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan didn't know the value of the Poison of Memories, but he could be certain that it was definitely worth more than several hundred thousand universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>"With this Poison of Memories, I can completely kill an alien race's peerless genius." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not only the insect race and other peak races, but even the human civilization collected information on the peerless geniuses of other races and put them on the assassination list. For each one killed, the assassin would be granted a large reward.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization similarly collected a list of peerless geniuses from other peak races. As long as one could be thoroughly killed, it was equivalent to helping the human civilization eliminate a threat and could also obtain a large amount of merit point rewards.</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I have to pursue them." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a bit regretful. He wasn't clear about how these eighth-level invincible aliens, who had entered the human civilization's territory to assassinate, would carry so many treasures and universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>Virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Personal space.</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord and the White Light Star Lord sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? The alien race sent out five eighth-level invincibles to assassinate my disciple?" The Chiron Star Lord was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The moment the White Light Star Lord discovered the five eighth-level invincible aliens appearing outside the Milky Way's main star, he split off a strand of consciousness to enter the virtual world and contacted the Chiron Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will mobilize the secret treasure, the White Heart Flame." The White Light Star Lord's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The White Heart Flame..." The Chiron Star Lord was not at ease.</p><p></p><p>Once activated, the White Heart Flame could indeed erupt with a basic power close to the ninth level, but the opponent was five eighth-level invincibles.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were willing to pay the price, they could completely withstand the damage of the White Heart Flame for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Since the alien race had already dispatched five eighth-level invincibles, they must have the thought of being certain of success.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to contact the supreme powerhouse."</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the White Light Star Lord called out to the Chiron Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for what?" The Chiron Star Lord frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine now. Those five eighth-level invincible aliens have retreated." After a moment of silence, the White Light Star Lord said in a somewhat unbelievable tone.</p><p></p><p>"Retreated?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Although this outcome was unexpected, it also made him breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Which ninth-level human evolutionist happened to pass by and save my disciple?" The Chiron Star Lord sat down again. "I, Chiron, will definitely thank them in person."</p><p></p><p>In the Chiron Star Lord's view, only a ninth-level evolutionist could make five eighth-level invincibles voluntarily retreat.</p><p></p><p>As for human eighth-level invincible evolutionists? One or two eighth-level invincible evolutionists could not make five eighth-level invincible aliens retreat.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Chiron Star Lord was even more convinced that it was a passing human ninth-level evolutionist who had rescued Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't a ninth-level evolutionist." After another moment of silence, the White Light Star Lord shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"Not a ninth-level evolutionist?" The Chiron Star Lord was surprised. "Then which eighth-level invincibles were they? I, Chiron, will also personally thank them."</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't a ninth-level evolutionist, then it could only be several passing eighth-level invincibles. Although this scene was very incredible, since it had happened, the Chiron Star Lord wouldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"There were no passing eighth-level invincibles." After another moment of silence, the White Light Star Lord spoke again.</p><p></p><p>At these words.</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Old thing, what exactly do you mean?" The Chiron Star Lord started to become a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>Always denying his guesses, yet not stating the facts, what kind of suspense was he trying to create?</p><p></p><p>"It was your disciple who repelled those five eighth-level invincibles by himself." The White Light Star Lord looked at the Chiron Star Lord with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"It was my disciple... you said who?" The Chiron Star Lord was stunned for a moment, somewhat unable to react.</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord's every word, he understood, but put together, it made the Chiron Star Lord a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm saying, your disciple, relying on his own strength, made the five eighth-level invincible aliens voluntarily retreat." The White Light Star Lord repeated.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Chiron Star Lord completely reacted.</p><p></p><p>He blinked his eyes, momentarily not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>There were many possibilities for making five eighth-level invincibles voluntarily retreat, but the greatest possibility was that those five eighth-level invincibles felt that they couldn't do anything to Lin Yuan, so they voluntarily retreated.</p><p></p><p>When entering human territory to assassinate, even if it was the border star domain, those five eighth-level invincibles didn't dare to stay for a long time. Once they discovered that the matter couldn't be accomplished, they would decisively give up.</p><p></p><p>To avoid human powerhouses rushing over.</p><p></p><p>But to achieve this point, only if Lin Yuan had also become an eighth-level invincible would it be possible.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Chiron Star Lord felt endless emotions. In such a short time, the little disciple he had accepted had grown to a level where he could stand shoulder to shoulder with him?</p><p></p><p>"Chiron, there's one more thing, I don't know if I should say it or not." The White Light Star Lord looked at the Chiron Star Lord, whose expression was filled with emotion, and hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Now, what is there that can't be said?" The Chiron Star Lord laughed. "My disciple has caught up to me, I should be happy."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple not only made those five eighth-level invincibles voluntarily retreat but also pursued and killed two eighth-level invincibles."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord fell silent again. Even with his strength, it was impossible for him to kill two eighth-level invincibles, let alone while facing the encirclement and suppression of five eighth-level invincibles earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see it clearly?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord asked, his expression slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Killing an eighth-level invincible was not some incredible event. On large-scale alien battlefields, every once in a while, an eighth-level invincible would fall.</p><p></p><p>But the one who killed the eighth-level invincibles was his disciple, his little disciple who had only stepped into the eighth level a few decades ago and was not even a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>"I can confirm it."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord affirmed.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not an eighth-level invincible, his comprehension of the laws of space was very deep, and distance was not a problem for him. He had personally witnessed those two eighth-level invincible aliens die at the hands of the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple of mine..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Chiron Star Lord did not have any doubts but revealed a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had said something wrong.</p><p></p><p>His disciple had not caught up to him.</p><p></p><p>But had surpassed him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 217: Seventh-Level Citizen (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>On the main planet of the Crimson Roc, the Central Continent.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, this mountain peak looked no different than usual.</p><p></p><p>However, in reality, this area had long been isolated by the Crimson Roc Star Lord using a certain method, "peeled off" from the original Crimson Roc main star.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the Crimson Roc Star Lord, doing these things did not attract the attention of any evolutionaries on the main star.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, all the evolutionaries within the isolated area had fallen into a deep slumber, unable to perceive the vast changes in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The surging fluctuations of world power and spatial power were still continuing.</p><p></p><p>The enormous world phantom was still rapidly expanding, exceeding 100,000 miles with no sign of stopping.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord stood alone in the void, silently gazing at the world phantom in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>It was simply too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord had originally held Lin Yuan in high regard.</p><p></p><p>He thought that before reaching the peak of the seventh stage, his obedient disciple might be able to open up an inner world of three to five miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>But in reality?</p><p></p><p>The current world phantom was approaching 110,000 miles.</p><p></p><p>The difference was more than tens of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>For the Crimson Roc Star Lord, an inner world with a diameter of 110,000 miles was nothing.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic peak bloodline Star Sea Roc was born with a small world within its body. By the time it reached adulthood at the sixth stage, its inner world could easily reach tens of miles.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the seventh stage, its inner world directly reached hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the eighth stage, the Crimson Roc Star Lord's inner world exceeded one million miles.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Star Sea Roc, the "favored child" of the cosmic space origin, born with a small world of its own. This was its innate talent.</p><p></p><p>But what about Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He was merely a human, yet at the seventh stage, he actually nurtured an inner world exceeding 100,000 miles. This was simply...</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>In the end, are you the Star Sea Roc, or am I the Star Sea Roc?</p><p></p><p>"The size of the inner world mainly depends on one's comprehension of the laws of space," the Crimson Roc Star Lord thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Star Sea Roc was born with an inner world was that this special lifeform, after birth, had already entered the door in terms of the laws of space, comprehending the 965 basic spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Even using the rare treasures of the universe, such as "World Fruit," to forcibly open up an inner world, the initial size of the inner world would be at most a few hundred to a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>From then on, to continue expanding the inner world, one could only improve their understanding of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current inner world was at least over 100,000 miles. This was something no cosmic treasure could achieve; it could only be accumulated through one's own comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>"An inner world with a diameter of 100,000 miles requires comprehending at least 1,000 types of core spatial laws... My disciple had just comprehended the basic spatial models not long ago..."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's talent and comprehension were simply too terrifying. In such a short time, he had already achieved such accomplishments in the core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>"Under a hundred years old, comprehending a thousand types of core spatial models, in the entire Human Civilization Alliance, only a handful of people can achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"If starting from scratch, without relying on any external objects..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid no contemporary evolutionary genius can compare to my disciple."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Central Star Domain and some powerful star domains had a very high starting point. Before they were even born, they received the inclination of numerous resources.</p><p></p><p>Or, like the Crimson Roc Star Lord, they possessed the body of a terrifyingly talented special lifeform, raising their starting point by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>Numerous fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Numerous resource inclinations.</p><p></p><p>Only then could they barely create an evolutionary genius comparable to the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If those fortuitous encounters and resource inclinations were removed, Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude would definitely be unmatched among the younger generation of the contemporary human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The expansion speed of the world phantom is slowing down..."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Roc Star Lord inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. An inner world with a diameter of over 100,000 miles was almost approaching the inner world of a peak eighth-stage evolutionary.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>With each breath, world power overflowed from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It finally stopped..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness stood within his inner world, gazing at the world that had a diameter of 120,000 miles, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous small world with a diameter of only ten miles, the current inner world with a diameter of 120,000 miles was almost equivalent to more than ten Canglan Stars.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The inner world of an evolutionary mainly depended on two aspects.</p><p></p><p>The first was one's own physical body and soul. This was the foundation for carrying the inner world. If the physical body and soul were too weak, no matter how high one's spatial comprehension was, the inner world would not become very large.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts evolutionary path Lin Yuan cultivated emphasized the physical body, and his soul had transformed into a Yuanshen, equally powerful, so he could support an inner world with a diameter of 120,000 miles.</p><p></p><p>The second was the comprehension of space.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan clearly felt that his comprehension of space had surpassed the limits of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't have much impact."</p><p></p><p>"Such a vast inner world, the world power it nurtures, almost allows my physical body and soul to grow stronger at every moment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, feeling the world power that was like a stream, nourishing his own physical body and soul through his meridians.</p><p></p><p>"I am currently at the seventh-stage King realm, but with such a vast inner world, ordinary eighth-stage evolutionaries will not be a match for me at all..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even at the eighth stage, one would master numerous methods belonging to eighth-stage evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's inner world was too vast, the world power was vast and mighty. Using power to break techniques, unless they had an inner world of the same level, they could only flee when facing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I should attempt to break through to the eighth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, I will strengthen my mental willpower as much as possible to better face the 'Heart Demon Tribulation.'"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's goal was very clear. With his current foundation, if not for the "Heart Demon Tribulation," he could easily break through now.</p><p></p><p>"To strengthen mental willpower, the common method in human civilization is to experience more, that is, to live on."</p><p></p><p>"But this is just the common method. There are still many other ways to enhance the strength of mental willpower..."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan could use the Myriad Realms Gate to cheat his way through the "Heart Demon Tribulation," this method was not foolproof. Even if Lin Yuan used it, he would wait until he was confident in passing the Heart Demon Tribulation before attempting it.</p><p></p><p>Casually attempting it?</p><p></p><p>Trying to pass the Heart Demon Tribulation without any preparation, what if the Myriad Realms Gate could not isolate the "Heart Demon"? Wouldn't that be seeking death?</p><p></p><p>How to pass the "Heart Demon Tribulation" was the most crucial...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The essence of the "Heart Demon Tribulation" originates from one's own heart and soul. Even if the strongest being intervenes and forcibly resurrects you, you will still be in the state of undergoing the "Heart Demon Tribulation".</p><p></p><p>At that time, you will still die.</p><p></p><p>Because you can't pass through it.</p><p></p><p>The strongest being can save your physical body, soul, and even your true spirit consciousness, but they cannot dispel the "Heart Demon".</p><p></p><p>As long as the "Heart Demon" remains and you can't overcome it, no matter how many times you are resurrected, you will still die.</p><p></p><p>In the face of one's own "Heart Demon", even the offspring of the strongest are equal to all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>"I should go out to see my teacher."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current comprehension of the laws of space had long sensed that the outer space had been completely isolated from normal space, which should be the doing of the Scarlet Roc Star Lord to conceal the fluctuations caused by Lin Yuan's expansion of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan asked the Scarlet Roc Star Lord to help conceal it was because even a seventh-level inner world that had just been opened would be astonishingly heaven-defying if revealed to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the inner world fluctuations Lin Yuan had just displayed were far more than simply opening an inner world.</p><p></p><p>So if it could be concealed, it was best to conceal it a bit.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way. The previous encounter on the alien battlefield had made Lin Yuan vigilant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary breakthrough, even if he had entered the eighth level, Lin Yuan wouldn't have done this, but possessing an inner world of over 100,000 miles at the seventh level was truly somewhat unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw that the Scarlet Roc Star Lord had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Is everything alright?" </p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord stared at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is fine." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"My dear disciple, you really surprised your teacher." The Scarlet Roc Star Lord shook his head, his tone full of emotion.</p><p></p><p>"What level have you reached in your comprehension of the core space model now?"</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord asked next.</p><p></p><p>"Core space model..." Lin Yuan knew he couldn't hide it from the Scarlet Roc Star Lord and answered truthfully, "Less than 1,200 types."</p><p></p><p>"Less than 1,200 types..." The Scarlet Roc Star Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>How does this sound so unsatisfying?</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I recently discovered that the further I go, the slower the comprehension speed of the core space models becomes, and the more often I encounter bottlenecks."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"This is normal."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"For you to be able to comprehend 1,200 types of core space models at this age is already rare... It's extremely rare."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord said in a low voice, "If it weren't for the three goddesses confirming it, I would suspect that you had been 'possessed' by a powerful alien being."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled, "Possessed?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, just as the Scarlet Roc Star Lord could possess the Starry Sea Wandering Roc, other powerful alien beings could naturally also possess human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Lin Yuan's soul, after being confirmed multiple times by the three goddesses, undoubtedly belonged to a human and not any other alien race.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent and comprehension ability are too strong." The Scarlet Roc Star Lord finally voiced his true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>All along, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord had always heard others describe him this way. After all, with the Starry Sea Wandering Roc as his original body, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord had always been unrivaled in his comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>"I may have been lucky."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Can luck always be good?" The Scarlet Roc Star Lord shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"However, now that you have opened your inner world, the focus next should be on your mind and will." The Scarlet Roc Star Lord's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The more a top genius evolver like Lin Yuan was, the more likely they were to stumble on the mind and will, on the "Heart Demon Tribulation".</p><p></p><p>Because things had been too smooth in the early stages without any setbacks, they subconsciously felt that the Heart Demon Tribulation was nothing much.</p><p></p><p>After all, opening the inner world was publicly recognized as the most difficult step from the seventh to the eighth level, while for the Heart Demon Tribulation, even the most ordinary evolver had the possibility of passing through it.</p><p></p><p>However, once this thought appeared, problems could arise.</p><p></p><p>In the over 2 million years of Starry Sea history, who knew how many genius evolvers had stumbled on the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. He had never underestimated the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Although the mind and will are difficult to measure, our human civilization has still summarized a set of general standards for estimating them over the years. I'll send it to you later."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord said.</p><p></p><p>This set of standards, even in the Human Civilization Alliance, could be considered "top secret" because it was easy for alien races to take and apply.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, only Star Domain Lords like the Scarlet Roc Star Lord grasped the specifics. Lin Yuan couldn't see it in the virtual network or even the Scarlet Roc Treasury.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the Scarlet Roc Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the palace again.</p><p></p><p>"Inner world..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was familiarizing himself with the power of time within his body. After all, the inner world that had surged to a diameter of 120,000 miles was filled with vast world power.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and opened the virtual panel.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Feng?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness connected to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a red-nosed old man walked out.</p><p></p><p>It was Shi Feng, a good friend Lin Yuan had met in the virtual world's founders' circle.</p><p></p><p>At the Annan Star Alliance Conference, it was Shi Feng who had pulled some strings for him and traded away the voting rights.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Brother Thirteen, the Star Alliance Conference is about to convene. You must remember to attend then."</p><p></p><p>The red-nosed Shi Feng said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had received benefits from the Wangyue Star Domain, so naturally he wouldn't forget.</p><p></p><p>As for the threat from Jin Tianzhao of the Golden Dragon Star Domain, Lin Yuan didn't take it to heart at all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted with the red-nosed Shi Feng for a while.</p><p></p><p>Then he disconnected from the virtual world and his consciousness returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, my current merit points are already enough to be promoted to a level-seven citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>To go from a level-six citizen to a level-seven citizen required 2 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan thought this was an unattainable goal that would require several crossings to gather enough points.</p><p></p><p>But with just one crossing, uploading the seventh-level chapter, he had received a reward of 3 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because the seventh-level chapter involved opening an inner world, which was highly rated by the three goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"Let's upgrade."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan's account balance of over 3 million merits was reduced by 2 million.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's citizen level changed from the original level-six to level-seven.</p><p></p><p>"Level-seven citizen!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit trembled slightly. One had to know that the citizen level of ordinary eighth-level evolvers had not reached level-seven, as merit points were not easy to accumulate.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could ponder further.</p><p></p><p>A series of emails from the Central Star Domain arrived one after another, introducing the many privileges of a level-seven citizen.</p>

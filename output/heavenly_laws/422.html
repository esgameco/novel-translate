        <h1>Chapter 422</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 422: Where the Mind Goes, Nothing is Out of Reach (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Outside the world. </p><p></p><p>In the vast void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there quietly, his gaze calm as he looked at the many evil gods.</p><p></p><p>And all the evil god sovereigns similarly observed Lin Yuan cautiously. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Eye Sovereign, East Wing Sovereign and other perfected evil god sovereigns vaguely sensed the boundless power of space-time surging on Lin Yuan's body. Observing the Martial Ancestor was like observing the vast, boundless void.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous space-time power incessantly poured into the profound layers of space, thereby influencing the surrounding space-time and condensing his own dominion.</p><p></p><p>It was like the relationship between the Child of the Void and the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The difference was, the Void Secret Realm of the Child of the Void came from the creator of the Void Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>Whereas Lin Yuan did so completely through his own influence.</p><p></p><p>This scene made all the evil gods present tremble inwardly. In the end, they didn't even dare continue observing secretly.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor's aura is too terrifying. Before him, I can't even muster the courage to act," thought one perfected evil god sovereign after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate the great Child of the Void has no intention of fighting the Martial Ancestor, otherwise wouldn't we just be cannon fodder?"</p><p></p><p>As perfected evil god sovereigns wielding many bizarre abilities, they could hardly die even if they wanted to. But once embroiled in a life-or-death struggle related to the tenth stage, they could only listen to the heavens' command.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong, many times stronger than what my avatar glimpsed decades ago," the Divine Intelligence Sovereign's head exploded as he subconsciously shrank back. "It feels like even the great Child of the Void is slightly inferior. I wonder if the Martial Ancestor has crossed into the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the Divine Intelligence Sovereign instinctively glanced at the Child of the Void.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Martial Ancestor had crossed into the tenth stage or not, these perfected evil god sovereigns could not tell.</p><p></p><p>To the Divine Intelligence Sovereign, East Wing Sovereign and others, they could only sense the Martial Ancestor's might - killing them would require no effort at all on his part.</p><p></p><p>That was all.</p><p></p><p>And with the power of the Void Secret Realm, even the Child of the Void could achieve this much.</p><p></p><p>So these evil god sovereigns had no way to discern what realm the Martial Ancestor was in.</p><p></p><p>To judge the Martial Ancestor's level of attainment, only the master of the Void Secret Realm, the Child of the Void, had that ability.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void was also carefully observing the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"There is no aura of any tenth stage existence's remaining treasures."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void thought inwardly. In fact, as soon as he sensed that space-time fluctuation, he felt the possibility of the Martial Ancestor crossing into the tenth stage was greater than the possibility of him possessing a remaining treasure of a tenth stage existence.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, the only known tenth stage existence was the creator of the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the new master of the Void Secret Realm, the Child of the Void did not think that after leaving behind the Void Secret Realm, that creator also left other treasures on par with it.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial Ancestor met all the prerequisites to possess a remaining treasure of a tenth stage existence, there were no such treasures for him.</p><p></p><p>But before seeing it with his own eyes, everything was unknown. The Child of the Void only considered those two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void slightly bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No aura of any tenth stage existence's remaining treasures meant that Lin Yuan was emitting such a level of space-time fluctuation completely through his own power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Martial Ancestor had indeed crossed into the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the second tenth stage powerful figure in the entire boundless void's history.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence was worthy of the Child of the Void bowing in this manner.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."  </p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other perfected evil god sovereigns unhesitatingly followed the Child of the Void in bowing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the many evil gods, but was not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute might, any resistance was meaningless. The stronger an evil god's power, the better they understood this principle.</p><p></p><p>So the submission of these evil gods was completely expected in Lin Yuan's mind.  </p><p></p><p>In fact, even if these evil gods did not submit, it made no difference to Lin Yuan. He would simply kill all those who did not submit.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't the remaining ones all be those who submitted?</p><p></p><p>"If the Martial Ancestor wishes to spread martial arts, I am willing to cooperate," the Child of the Void immediately declared his stance.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Yin-Yang was the powerful figure the Martial Ancestor pushed to the forefront, so the spread of martial arts must have been instructed by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the Child of the Void naturally had to promptly express his position.</p><p></p><p>Although...</p><p></p><p>The spread of martial arts would allow the living beings in the worlds that the evil gods viewed as food to further strengthen and potentially reach a level rivaling the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>But the Child of the Void knew the score. If they obstructed the spread of martial arts, the evil gods would likely have no future and be completely slaughtered by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Child of the Void could take refuge in the deepest parts of the Void Secret Realm and eke out a wretched existence. But the other evil god sovereigns would not fare so well.</p><p></p><p>At least in the boundless void outside the Void Secret Realm, it would completely become the domain of martial arts cultivators. Even most regions of the Void Secret Realm itself would be occupied by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>So the Child of the Void simply chose to cooperate with the Martial Ancestor. No matter how bad the result...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Even conquering the entire boundless void could not compare to completely standing in opposition to the Martial Ancestor. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his mouth and stated his demands.</p><p></p><p>Actually, with Lin Yuan's strength, even if he completely occupied the boundless void, the Children of the Void and the many evil gods would not dare say anything.</p><p></p><p>But doing so would not be a good thing for the development of martial arts itself.  </p><p></p><p>Without the oppression of the foreign evil gods, in the many worlds within the boundless void, those martial artists would lack oppression, greatly reducing the probability of giving birth to high-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone possessed Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability, able to easily break through just by secluding himself.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of martial artists would be trapped by some shackle for most of their lives. Without external stimulation, perhaps they could never step into the next realm in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's actions would lead to increased casualties among martial artists, with an unknown number perishing in the struggle against the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was not a nanny? After securing half the territory for this boundless void that viewed all beings as food, was he still responsible for their safety?</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Lin Yuan had only one goal.</p><p></p><p>That was to spread martial arts, allowing as many beings as possible to cultivate martial arts, and give birth to more high-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The latter was even more important than the former.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's heart, as long as one fifth or sixth realm martial artist was born, even if tens of thousands or millions of fourth or fifth realm martial artists died, it would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>If the evil gods of the boundless void could cultivate martial arts, Lin Yuan would even prefer to shelter the evil gods, because with their average talent, once they cultivated martial arts, their starting point would be far beyond what the beings of this world could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Just taking away half the territory of the boundless void and the void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Besides providing enough oppression to stimulate the vigorous development of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had another purpose, which was to maintain the balance between evil gods and martial artists in the boundless void as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>After the space-time fusion rules reached the sixth level, Lin Yuan saw through the essence of this boundless void with one look.</p><p></p><p>That was the source of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The evil gods originated from the nurturing of the boundless void, meaning the evil gods could never be exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan had the ability to slaughter all evil gods, after millions or billions of years, a new batch would be born.</p><p></p><p>These evil gods were innately powerful and could even reach the eighth or ninth stage in a short time by devouring their own kind.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when the newly born evil gods discovered that most of the outer space was occupied by weak beings, they would inevitably start a new great war.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan could not stay in this boundless void permanently, even though each descent only cost one-third of a strand of dimensional force.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Leaving half the territory for these evil gods would save Lin Yuan a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>At least the evil gods and martial artists could maintain a balance. Over the long years, under the oppression of the evil gods, the martial artists would gradually become stronger. And the evil gods themselves had their own territory, so they would not recklessly fight to the death with the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void agreed without even thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Half the territory of the boundless void, half the territory of the void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the entire evil god race would lose half their growth space, but in reality, as long as they could stabilize the Martial Ancestor at the tenth stage, it was not a price at all.</p><p></p><p>"There is one more thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Child of the Void and spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say one thing, even if it's ten or a hundred things, I will agree."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void lowered his posture greatly, almost granting any request.</p><p></p><p>"Just this one thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He was just a passerby in this world, as long as he ensured the martial arts inheritance did not perish, that was enough. Where would he have ten or a hundred things?</p><p></p><p>"In the deepest space of the void secret realm, there should be some remnants left behind by the realm's creator. I plan to go take a look." Lin Yuan looked at the Child of the Void.</p><p></p><p>After the space-time fusion rules reached the sixth level, many secrets of this boundless void were revealed before Lin Yuan, including the creator of the void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"The deepest space of the secret realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void was stunned for a moment, then immediately nodded, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>In the deepest space of the void secret realm, there were indeed some traces left behind by the realm's creator, but no matter how many millions of years the Child of the Void observed, he still could not see through it.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to go observe, the Child of the Void naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will send the Martial Ancestor in now."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void said immediately.</p><p></p><p>Besides him, the secret realm's master, no other powerful beings could enter the deepest space of the void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No need?" </p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void was a bit dazed. Didn't he just say he wanted to go in and take a look? Why no need now?</p><p></p><p>"I can go in myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward and disappeared from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>With the space-time fusion rules at the sixth level, as long as Lin Yuan was in this boundless void, wherever his thoughts reached, he could go.</p>

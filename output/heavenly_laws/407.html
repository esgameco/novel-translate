        <h1>Chapter 407</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan saw was actually the six-layer reward list, which contained treasures and rarities from the seventh layer and even some from the eighth layer reward vault. </p><p></p><p>After all, the final rewards obtained from passing through each floor of the Black Building depended on one's performance during the process.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, a tenth-level life form, to pass the sixth floor was undoubtedly a top-level performance, even far exceeding the top level.</p><p></p><p>So the rewards shown on the list were selected from a few higher tiers. </p><p></p><p>The many rewards Lin Yuan had previously chosen were more or less the same, which is why the second-floor reward list contained such eleven-star premium rarities as the World Tree and the Golden Nature Source.</p><p></p><p>"Three rewards?"</p><p></p><p>There were only three rewards on the list in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They were:</p><p></p><p>The Immeasurable World.</p><p>The Destruction of the Universe. </p><p>The Heart of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never heard of these three rewards, but vaguely felt they were extremely precious, even more so than what was in the treasure vault of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shen Ji, what are these three treasures?" Lin Yuan asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Immeasurable World was discovered by the Lord when tracing the path of a perfect time-life form during his pursuit of perfection. It is suspected to be a broken world where a perfect time-life form once dwelled," said the stone statue Shen Ji with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"However, this is only the Lord's conjecture. Even if it was not the dwelling of a perfect time-life form, it was undoubtedly left by a being extremely close to one."</p><p></p><p>"The Lord studied this Immeasurable World for a very long time but gained little from it."</p><p></p><p>"A perfect time-life form?" Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly grave. According to Shen Ji, the Immeasurable World was at least related to a being approaching a perfect time-life form.</p><p></p><p>And the only such being Lin Yuan had encountered so far was the creator of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Destruction of the Universe?" Lin Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"The Destruction of the Universe, ah..." The stone statue Shen Ji pondered for a moment before continuing, "You should know that the universe will eventually be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>From the birth of a new universe to its destruction spanned an incalculably long cosmic cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Universal destruction, the collapse of the great rules and ways - for every twelfth-level life in the universe, it is a catastrophe that will kill off half or even more."</p><p></p><p>"And the Destruction of the Universe is actually an imprint record that captures the entire process from the beginning of a universe's collapse to its complete destruction."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji paused here before continuing, "The destruction of a universe is a disaster, but also an opportunity. Carefully experiencing the collapse of myriad rules and ways can greatly benefit one's comprehension of rules."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded, immediately realizing the preciousness of this imprint record of universal destruction.</p><p></p><p>First, to replicate the complete scene of a universe's destruction, one must be a twelfth-level life within that universe.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with the great cataclysm of universal destruction, the twelfth-level lives who had not yet endured an entire cosmic cycle would undoubtedly be extremely cautious, where would they find the energy to replicate this scene?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, replicating the complete scene of universal destruction would require this twelfth-level life to survive the entire cycle of catastrophic destruction - it was practically a death wish.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, the Heart of Space-Time." The stone statue Shen Ji glanced at Lin Yuan. "By fusing with the Heart of Space-Time, existences below the twelfth level of life can extend the time they can struggle against the river of time."</p><p></p><p>"Extend the time to struggle against the river of time?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He immediately realized the greatest use of the Heart of Space-Time - to break through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>For an eleventh-level life to break through to the ultimate, it needed to make the ultimate leap, transcending itself and the river of time to complete the great transformation of its life essence above the river of time.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the eleventh-level life could only remain above the river of time for an extremely limited duration. If this period could be extended, it would undoubtedly increase the chances of a successful breakthrough to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>When an eleventh-level expert attempted to break through to the ultimate by leaping out of the river of time, it was completely different from when Lin Yuan was previously brought out of the river of time by the supreme expert Xia Qinzhi.</p><p></p><p>When an eleventh-level life leapt out to breakthrough, it would face obstruction and suppression from the entire river of time itself.</p><p></p><p>To the river of time, an eleventh-level life breaking through to the ultimate was akin to a 'fish' in its waters permanently escaping it - naturally, it would resist with all its might.</p><p></p><p>However, when Xia Qinzhi brought Lin Yuan out of the river of time, it was only temporary, so even if it provoked a backlash from the river of time, it would not be too severe.</p><p></p><p>"Of the three treasures, which one do you choose?" The stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart of Space-Time," Lin Yuan replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Immeasurable World was unfathomable, at least related to an existence approaching a perfect time-life form.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan did not become the ultimate, no matter how mysterious the Immeasurable World was, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>As for the Destruction of the Universe, it might have great significance for a supreme being, but for Lin Yuan, it was somewhat excessive.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, while the Immeasurable World and the Destruction of the Universe were undoubtedly precious, the most pressing challenge for Lin Yuan now was to break through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>If he did not become the ultimate, these two would be like flowers in a mirror, moons in water.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in choosing the Heart of Space-Time, Lin Yuan had no hesitation at all.</p><p></p><p>To extend the time he could remain suspended above the river of time...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The time on the long river of space-time. Lin Yuan had never heard of such a method. </p><p></p><p>The treasures and rarities that human civilization currently possesses to increase the ultimate probability are similar to the origin of the universe, mainly acting on the foundation of the ultimate attacker itself.</p><p></p><p>It is completely different from the effect of the Heart of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>For example, if reaching the ultimate is compared to an exam, then the effect of the Origin of the Universe is to allow the examinees to study like crazy before the exam, thereby increasing the possibility of scoring high. </p><p></p><p>While the Heart of Space-Time directly reduces the difficulty of the test paper, to achieve the effect of scoring high.</p><p></p><p>The purposes are the same, but the principles are completely different.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The stone human statue Shen Ji nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a crystal shaped like a heart appeared in front of Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>The crystal was colorless and transparent, and Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that it was slowly pulsating.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back first." Lin Yuan put away the Heart of Space-Time and immediately took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The stone human statue Shen Ji nodded, watching Lin Yuan disappear from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart of Space-Time." The stone human statue Shen Ji remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, such a rare treasure as the Heart of Space-Time did not come from the reward libraries of the seventh, eighth or even ninth level.</p><p></p><p>It came from the most core inheritance treasury of the Magic Jade Building, and only the direct disciples of the Magic Jade Building who were about to reach the ultimate would have the qualification to enjoy this supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>In theory, since Lin Yuan was only a core member of the Magic Jade Building, not to mention obtaining the Heart of Space-Time, he didn't even have the qualification to know about such a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>But the current Magic Jade Building was no longer the same as before.</p><p></p><p>The stone human statue Shen Ji knew clearly in his heart that if the requirements for the Heart of Space-Time were still followed, it would probably rot before it could be used.</p><p></p><p>A direct disciple of the Magic Jade Building? This required personal approval from the master of the Magic Jade Building to have a chance of becoming one.</p><p></p><p>But now the master of the Magic Jade Building had been missing for who knows how many years, basically cutting off the possibility of producing direct disciples.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will returned, bringing back three treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>"This time it really worked out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was exhilarated. He had expected the Golden Nature Origin and the secret technique 'Heavenly River'.</p><p></p><p>But the Heart of Space-Time? Lin Yuan had never thought he could obtain such a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart of Space-Time."</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought from Lin Yuan, the heart-shaped crystal appeared in front of him, slowly pulsating and emanating a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>"Place it in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan's true self entered the deepest part of the Profound Yellow Secret Realm and solemnly placed the Heart of Space-Time there.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Yellow Secret Realm was the safest place Lin Yuan knew of, where even the strongest could not enter.</p><p></p><p>It was absolutely and completely secure, without exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect of the Heart of Space-Time was heaven-defying, able to directly reduce the difficulty of reaching the ultimate, if his own foundation was insufficient, he would still fail to reach the ultimate no matter how much the difficulty was reduced.</p><p></p><p>At least the stone human statue Shen Ji did not say that by fusing with the Heart of Space-Time, one could become the ultimate with a 100% guarantee.</p><p></p><p>There was no such method in the entire chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to deepen my own foundation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he took out the golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>That was the Golden Nature Origin.</p><p></p><p>Hoo.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a bell-shaped weapon appeared, emanating a subtle pressure.</p><p></p><p>It was the Primordial Bell that Lin Yuan had been cultivating until now.</p><p></p><p>"Merge."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan merged the Golden Nature Origin into the Primordial Bell.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the Golden Nature Origin, the Primordial Bell immediately began to metamorphose. Its aura became restrained, rapidly reaching the peak of the tenth level, and in the blink of an eye, it broke into the eleventh level, still rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>"It's estimated that after completely absorbing the Golden Nature Origin, it will become a peak eleventh-level weapon."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, when I advance to the eleventh level, with the affinity between the Primordial Bell and me, it will not be weaker than ordinary supreme weapons at all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Primordial Bell reached the peak of the eleventh level, it would still be far inferior to supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>But other eleventh-level evolved beings would also be unable to unleash the full might of supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>Unless the supreme weapon contained a trump card left behind by a supreme being, otherwise the might of the Primordial Bell would not be inferior to other eleventh-level cultivators wielding supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>After placing the Primordial Bell in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm as well, allowing it to slowly metamorphose, Lin Yuan returned to the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>"The secret technique 'Heavenly River'." Lin Yuan immediately took out the crystal containing the secret technique 'Heavenly River'.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Lin Yuan split off a strand of his spiritual will and probed into the crystal, beginning to receive the vast information of the secret technique 'Heavenly River'.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan comprehended it, he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the three major protective techniques of the Profound Yellow Sect, 'Heavenly River' was more comprehensive, containing the profound mysteries of space-time and mainly encompassing the essence of the six to nine levels of the space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose this secret technique in preparation for his own space-time fusion rules to reach the sixth level in the future.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was immersed in comprehending the secret technique 'Heavenly River', a fluctuation from the depths of his mind startled him awake.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness quickly sank into the depths of his mind, gazing at the majestic and solemn Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Two chapters completed.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow begins the tenth journey.</p><p></p><p>Please give me some monthly tickets~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many Twelfth Realm Ultimates gathered once again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to their self-assured confidence from a hundred years ago, the expressions on the faces of each and every Twelfth Realm Ultimate were not looking very good at the moment.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years, a full hundred years, they had personally tried to lock down the location of the Galactic Overlord using the laws of causality.</p><p></p><p>But the results were not satisfactory, they had made no progress, and in the causal vision of each Twelfth Realm Ultimate, the Galactic Overlord was indeed within the universe, but they simply could not lock onto his location.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't so certain that there was no Lin Yuan factor within the Galactic Capital, they might have even had some of the Twelfth Realm Ultimates make a probing move against him.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is the causal perception of the Galactic Overlord so vague?"</p><p></p><p>The many Twelfth Realm Ultimates looked at each other. If the Galactic Overlord's true self, manifestations, and incarnations were hiding in the central star domain, the ancestral land of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>They would not do so.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the main base of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was not so, at least the Galactic Overlord's manifestations and incarnations were constantly roaming the universe.</p><p></p><p>"There are two possibilities," said the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan. "One is that the Galactic Overlord's attainments in the laws of causality surpass ours Twelfth Realm, so that he can obscure his own causality, causing us to return empty-handed many times."</p><p></p><p>"The second is that the Galactic Overlord is relying on a certain causal treasure to isolate his own causality, using the profundity of human civilization to produce a causal treasure is not a difficult task."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan paused for a moment and continued, "I think the second possibility is the most likely."</p><p></p><p>The other Twelfth Realm Ultimates nodded in agreement upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord's attainments in the laws of causality surpassing theirs, the Twelfth Realm? This possibility was too unbelievable, they were the Twelfth Realm! Even if they were not particularly adept at causality, they would not be surpassed by the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, without blood or hair as a medium, even if he has a causal treasure to protect himself, he cannot escape our causal tracking," the Zhu Clan Ultimate sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the laws of causality, 'medium' is the most important factor. Whether it's a curse or locking down a location, having a 'medium' and not having one makes a world of difference in difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Given the Galactic Overlord's strength and status, and how highly human civilization regards him, it is impossible for there to be any blood or hair remnants left outside," said the Insect Clan Queen Mother.</p><p></p><p>"Even for an ordinary Eleventh Realm, they would be very vigilant about this, not leaving anything related to themselves outside."</p><p></p><p>Even on the battlefield, when high-realm experts found themselves with no way out, they would unhesitatingly self-destruct, turning their physical bodies, souls, and everything related to themselves into ashes.</p><p></p><p>This was not only to avoid being captured by other races, but also to prevent other races from obtaining their remains as a 'medium'.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we can't find the Galactic Overlord through normal means," the Prison Clan Ultimate fell into contemplation. "Can we force him out?"</p><p></p><p>To "force him out" meant using the Galactic Overlord's loved ones and friends as a threat to compel him to show himself.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord was still young, his family members were still alive, and he also had many elders, such as the various Peak Masters and the Crimson Leviathan Overlord of the Crimson Leviathan lineage.</p><p></p><p>"It won't be of much use," said the Grand Galactic Alliance Ultimate, shaking his head. "The Galactic Overlord is not the type to be overly concerned about emotional and familial ties."</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the Insect Clan Queen Mother nodded. "Previously, when Tuoba Ancient God tried to use the Galactic Overlord's friend as a threat, the Galactic Overlord personally killed that friend."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm Ultimates present had all conducted special investigations on the Galactic Overlord, so they naturally knew about the conflict between him and Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Galactic Overlord's attitude towards Tuoba Ancient God, even if they managed to capture the Galactic Overlord's family members or teachers, he probably wouldn't even furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>And for them, the Twelfth Realm, to personally take such actions would be worth it if it worked, but if it didn't, it would be somewhat embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they would have to face the reckoning of the mightiest experts of human civilization afterwards.</p><p></p><p>It was not worth it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Hou," the Prison Clan Ultimate looked at the Zhu Clan Ultimate, "your clan obtained a special secret technique since the dawn of the universe."</p><p></p><p>"You?" The Zhu Clan Ultimate Fan Hou's expression changed slightly. "Are you referring to the secret technique 'Worship the Nine Days'?"</p><p></p><p>'Worship the Nine Days' was a secret technique in the realm of causality. Through a ritual of worship, it forcibly strengthened the causal connection between the two parties, ultimately leading to a curse or locking down the target's location.</p><p></p><p>However, this secret technique required a great price to be paid. If used against the Galactic Overlord, it would require consecutive worship for nine days, with the practitioner's foundation decreasing by a step each day.</p><p></p><p>While the foundation could be restored later, it would require a large amount of time, during which the practitioner's combat power could not be maintained at its peak.</p><p></p><p>If it was used against an Ultimate of the same realm, Fan Hou would be willing, but to merely lock down the Galactic Overlord's location, he would have to pay so much of his foundation? "The Galactic Overlord has already reached the peak of the Eleventh Realm, and he may break through to the Twelfth Realm at any time. Once he does, before the end of this universal cycle, he will most likely become the pinnacle of the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>"When that happens, you should know the consequences for our clan," said the Prison Clan Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Hou, Wan Hua was willing to pay that drop of mysterious blood to deal with the Galactic Overlord, so why can't you use the secret technique?" the Insect Clan Queen Mother said beside him.</p><p></p><p>If it was a matter of paying a price, the Insect Clan had clearly paid the highest.</p><p></p><p>However, the Insect Clan's hatred towards human civilization was the greatest, and they were also the most unwilling for the Galactic Overlord to smoothly break through to the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," the Zhu Clan Ultimate Fan Hou pondered for a moment and nodded. "I will start worshipping the Galactic Overlord now, and after nine days, I will tell you his exact location."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, once we lock down the Galactic Overlord's location, leave the rest to us," the Prison Clan Ultimate smiled.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the 'Worship the Nine Days' secret technique was a form of curse. Through the most intense causal connection formed after nine days of worship, it could be used to curse the target.</p><p></p><p>But cursing was not foolproof, and given that they knew the Galactic Overlord had a causal treasure to protect himself, even with the 'Worship the Nine Days' secret technique, they could not guarantee success.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if they ultimately managed to curse the Galactic Overlord to death, so what? The Galactic Overlord had not yet broken through to the Twelfth Realm, and his fundamental life imprint still existed in the long river of time, so he could be revived by the mightiest experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the safest approach was to use the 'Worship the Nine Days' secret technique to determine the location of one of the Galactic Overlord's manifestations or incarnations, and then they, the Twelfth Realm Ultimates, would converge and suppress the Galactic Overlord with lightning speed, and then use that drop of mysterious blood to contaminate him.</p><p></p><p>This was the most perfect plan to deal with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"We don't seek to completely destroy the Galactic Overlord, we just need that drop of mysterious blood to affect him, causing him to fail at a critical moment."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm Ultimates looked at each other and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll begin." The Zhu Clan Ultimate Fan Hou let out a light sigh, and his true self located deep within the Zhu Clan territory sat down cross-legged. His mind conjured up various information about the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a causal connection was formed between him and the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, the Zhu Clan Ultimate Fan Hou...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hou bowed towards Lin Yuan one by one, and with each bow, the causal connection between the two deepened.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not know the schemes of the alien Twelve Realms.</p><p></p><p>He just felt that so far, those alien Twelve Realms could not even lock down the avatar of his divine soul that he had deliberately released, let alone have the qualifications to play with him in the end.</p><p></p><p>"But those ultimate Twelve Realms haven't made a move against Teacher and the others, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep. Ever since he learned from the Calamity Clan a hundred years ago that the alien Twelve Realms wanted to deal with him, Lin Yuan had asked the Supremely Strong Ones like Xia Qin to pay more attention to the situation of the Crimson Kirin Star Lord and his family members. In addition, Lin Yuan had also taken away a thread of their mental will and placed it in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, to prevent the most extreme situation from happening.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and began to prepare for the final assault on the Twelve Realms.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the river of time, Lin Yuan's body size was almost larger than the river itself. If he didn't curl up as much as possible at the bottom of the riverbed, the entire river of time might not be able to accommodate him.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that if I stand up, the entire river of time would only reach up to my waist," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Other Eleven Realm Perfect Experts could briefly leap out of the river by exerting themselves, staying above the river for an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it would cost them almost all the power of the Eleven Realm Perfect. When assaulting the Twelve Realms, the Eleven Realm Perfect would first have to endure the infusion of the chaotic void origin, before having the confidence to leap out of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to exert himself to leap out. Just by standing up lightly, most of his body would be revealed outside the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"With my current life essence and various foundations, the possibility of me crossing into the Twelve Realms is at least 95%," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining 0.5%, it was due to the uncertainty of the vast chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao evolution path has finally given birth to the first Eighth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's spatial perception had reached the seventh level. As the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, he could vaguely feel all the evolution cultivators of the martial dao in the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate martial dao experts born in the Middle Continent World and the Spirit Realm over hundreds of millions of years were only at the Eighth Realm, and they were the result of Lin Yuan's forceful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But in the main universe, in less than a thousand years, the first martial dao Eighth Realm had appeared.</p><p></p><p>The main reason for this was the almost systematized cultivation method of human civilization in the main universe, with the originally mysterious cultivation path laid out in the open.</p><p></p><p>Plus the guidance of many higher-level evolution experts and so on, the development trend of the martial dao evolution path in the main universe was far surpassing the Spirit Realm, and even the Immortal Realm could not compare.</p><p></p><p>"Well, before the final assault, let me take a look at this little fellow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, in order to encourage the martial dao evolution cultivators to cultivate diligently, Lin Yuan had posted a dynamic under the account of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>That was, whoever was the first to cross into the Eighth Realm of the martial dao, would be able to meet him.</p><p></p><p>A savage star.</p><p></p><p>A figure sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Realm of the martial dao, this is the Eighth Realm of the martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>The figure was full of vigor, with a world aura faintly emanating from his body, as if a small world had been opened up.</p><p></p><p>The figure's name was Zhang Tianzhi, a peak Seventh Realm martial dao evolution cultivator. Just recently, he had opened up a world within his body and crossed into the Eighth Realm of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>So far, the strongest martial dao evolution cultivator in human civilization was only at the Seventh Realm, and there had been no news of the existence of the Eighth Realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, at this moment, Zhang Tianzhi was most likely the first Eighth Realm martial dao evolution cultivator under the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Taking the physical body as the foundation, with the qi, blood, spirit, soul, and heart and mind all progressing, the martial dao evolution path is truly the fifth for humans," Zhang Tianzhi kept feeling the changes within him, and his reverence for the Ancestor of the Martial Dao who opened up the martial dao evolution path grew deeper.</p><p></p><p>He was merely walking on the already perfected martial dao evolution path, and yet he could feel such unfathomable depths. Then what kind of existence would the Ancestor of the Martial Dao who opened up the martial dao evolution path be?</p><p></p><p>"Someone is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tianzhi suddenly paused, as the Goddess of Wisdom directly contacted him, reminding him that someone was looking for him.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Martial Dao is inviting me?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing who was contacting him, Zhang Tianzhi's mind went blank. The Ancestor of the Martial Dao was looking for him?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had said before that whoever was the first to cross into the Eighth Realm could meet him," Zhang Tianzhi remembered this matter.</p><p></p><p>As a martial dao evolution cultivator, he naturally kept in mind every dynamic posted by the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that... I just broke through, and haven't told anyone yet. How did the Ancestor of the Martial Dao know?" Zhang Tianzhi did not dare to delay, and immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thread of Zhang Tianzhi's mental will was pulled into a personal world.</p><p></p><p>After being promoted to the eleventh-level citizen, Lin Yuan's many privileges had reached the maximum, and his personal space had also been expanded to the greatest extent, becoming a personal world.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Ancestor of the Martial Dao," Zhang Tianzhi immediately noticed a figure with a blurred face standing in the center of the world, and hurriedly went over to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The transition from the Seventh Realm to the Eighth Realm of the martial dao was a qualitative change, involving the opening of one's own inner world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the martial dao evolution path established by Lin Yuan, as long as one reached the most perfect state, one could open their inner world even before breaking through to the Seventh Realm, but that was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any questions about cultivation, you can ask them," Lin Yuan said, looking at Zhang Tianzhi.</p><p></p><p>Since he had personally met Zhang Tianzhi, it would be a small favor to give him some guidance as well.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor of the Martial Dao," Zhang Tianzhi's spirit was greatly stirred.</p><p></p><p>The personal guidance of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao? If this got out, Zhang Tianzhi didn't know how many evolution cultivators would be envious of him.</p><p></p><p>"In my thousands of years of cultivation, I have tried many evolution paths and found that they each have their own focus in the understanding of the rules," Zhang Tianzhi immediately asked his question.</p><p></p><p>Before cultivating the martial dao evolution path, he had already been a peak Seventh Realm evolution cultivator, and had tried dozens of evolution paths, finding that each path was adept at different directions.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know if there was no evolution path that could encompass everything.</p><p></p><p>"That's normal. Evolution paths are established by people, and people have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the evolution paths are no exception. Even the strongest evolution paths are like this," Lin Yuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Zhang Tianzhi suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhang Tianzhi seemed to have thought of something, and carefully asked, "Then what about the Ancestor of the Martial Dao? Do you have any areas of expertise?"</p><p></p><p>"Me?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was calm as he looked at the daring Zhang Tianzhi, and smiled, "I'm a little bit good at everything."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 652</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, whether he has reached the level of an Invincible Sage is still uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The strength difference between a Peerless Great Sage and an Invincible Sage is too great.</p><p></p><p>In the past, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor could easily hunt down and corner Peerless Great Sages like the Chaotic Celestial Great Sage and the Jade Unicorn Great Sage, forcing them to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>Even among the strongest Celestial Supremes in the Six Ancient Kingdoms of the Source World, such as the Profound Void Celestial Supreme, they are still far inferior to the Invincible Sages.</p><p></p><p>When facing the Profound Void Celestial Supreme, Lin Yuan didn't even have a chance to fight back, only passively enduring the attacks, as the opponent's power and methods completely exceeded Lin Yuan's ability to cope.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan is now very curious about his own strength - is he close to the Invincible Sage level, or has he completely entered the Invincible Sage realm?</p><p></p><p>"Want to know how strong you are?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child's mouth twitched slightly at the remark.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't know Lin Yuan's personality so well, and was unaware of the great transformation he had just undergone, she would have doubted the truthfulness of this statement.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child nodded, then flicked her hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Jade Gourd trembled, and a piece of Eternal Primal Gold the size of hundreds of meters flew out, hovering in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Piercing through this Eternal Primal Gold means you possess the strength of the Fifth Layer of the 'Infinite Void'," the red-robed girl child said.</p><p></p><p>The 'Infinite Void' has seven layers, with the Seventh Layer being the theoretical peak. Normally, those who cultivate this Thirteen Tier Inheritance to the Fifth Layer will possess the power to traverse the chaotic void and become an Invincible Sage.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sixth Layer? Very few past cultivators of the 'Infinite Void' have ever reached that level.</p><p></p><p>"Piercing through?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Eternal Primal Gold before him.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Second Layer of the 'Infinite Void', one needs to leave a mark over ten centimeters deep on the Eternal Primal Gold. </p><p></p><p>But to reach the Fifth Layer, one must pierce through an Eternal Primal Gold the size of hundreds of meters - the gap is indeed vast.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic forces within him surged, the yin-yang diagram of the universe faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-meter Eternal Primal Gold in front of Lin Yuan rapidly distorted and disintegrated. In just a single breath, the entire piece of Eternal Primal Gold was pierced through, with the remaining fragments continuing to crumble.</p><p></p><p>"Such power?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child took a deep breath. She had almost failed to sense any fluctuation of power, yet the Eternal Primal Gold was pierced through - this was a display of perfectly contained power.</p><p></p><p>It meant that Lin Yuan had not even used his full strength yet. If he unleashed his full force in a focused attack, it would be difficult to contain all that power so perfectly.</p><p></p><p>"Your current cosmic realm has reached the Fifth Layer of the 'Infinite Void', no, it's almost approaching the Sixth Layer. Your strength has completely entered the Invincible Sage domain."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child hurriedly said, also looking somewhat pained at the pierced Eternal Primal Gold.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Primal Gold was left behind by the founder of the 'Infinite Void'. Using even a small piece of it means there is one less. Normally, the red-robed girl child would only bring out Eternal Primal Golds the size of one or two meters, but if Lin Yuan's strength wasn't so terrifying, she wouldn't have brought out such a large piece.</p><p></p><p>"Invincible Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>He then thought of His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor and the Demonic Jade Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>When his home universe was extremely weak, he already knew of these two peerless experts. Now he has finally reached the level of their strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor had ultimately broken free from the time loop, his strength exceeding the Twelve Tier Realm, no longer within the normal scope.</p><p></p><p>"What do you plan to do next?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child retrieved the Eternal Primal Gold, asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>"First, I will complete the cultivation of the Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said. He had been cultivating the Third Layer for a long time, developing the Chaotic Yin-Yang Dao, and greatly transforming his cosmic realm. This had also significantly promoted the cultivation of this Thirteen Tier Inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"The Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void'?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child stared at Lin Yuan, suddenly realizing that this inheritor had not yet completed the cultivation of the Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>Without even completing the Third Layer, he already possessed such strength. Once he completes the Third Layer, how many layers would he be comparable to? The Sixth Layer?</p><p></p><p>After chatting with the red-robed girl child for a while longer, Lin Yuan began to focus on fully cultivating the Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of this Thirteen Tier Inheritance is essentially about the reconstruction and reorganization of the microscopic particles within his cosmic realm. With the mastery of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Dao, this reconstruction and reorganization became much easier.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Lin Yuan had already cultivated the Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void' to a great extent.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in just one or two years, Lin Yuan's cosmic realm underwent another transformation.</p><p></p><p>The microscopic structure of his cosmic realm became more perfect and complete.</p><p></p><p>"The Third Layer is complete."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, surveying the vast cosmic realm within him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the stability of the spatial-temporal laws and rules of this universe, just the sheer size alone, after experiencing two successive transformations - first the development of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Dao, and then the completion of the Third Layer of the 'Infinite Void' - </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's cosmic realm had reached five hundred billion light-years in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred billion light-years, far exceeding the size of the innate universes nurtured by the Chaotic Void. Even among the Peerless Great Sages, possessing a cosmic realm of this scale is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>And this is based on the premise that Lin Yuan's cosmic realm does not specialize in size and area.</p><p></p><p>"Now, my strength is probably considered quite powerful even among the Invincible Sages?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Chaotic Void is not the same as the Source World, and the Invincible Sages here are isolated, making direct comparisons difficult.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating," said Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the 13th-tier Weapon Heavenly Void Cauldron, comprehending the endless rules and Dao contained within it, while his physical body, spirit, and the universe within him continued to rapidly improve until reaching the limit of growth.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it would be the moment for Lin Yuan to step into the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Source World.</p><p>Treasure Land interior.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, simultaneously feeling the surging of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He had evolved the path of Chaotic Power, and had cultivated the third layer of "Infinite Void", which had also brought about a tremendous increase in the true self-body of this Source World.</p><p></p><p>"The time-space suppression within this Treasure Land can no longer constrain me," Lin Yuan observed the surrounding time and space.</p><p></p><p>This newly emerged Treasure Land, connected to the Source World's origin, would produce extremely powerful time-space suppression. This suppression not only greatly reduced the exploration range of Supremacy-level experts, but also caused a plummeting in the distance of spatial-temporal traversal.</p><p></p><p>For peak Supremacy-level experts to cross this entire Treasure Land using their own strength alone would require a significant amount of time, and only the mightiest Supremacy expert, Fuxu, could do so in a single breath.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan had realized that the time-space suppression of this Treasure Land could no longer restrain him, which meant that Lin Yuan could also accomplish what Fuxu could - crossing the entire Treasure Land in a single breath, or even faster.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed in a certain direction. That was the location where the first giant core celestial pillar had emerged, and Lin Yuan had been right next to it, having the first opportunity to refine it. However, this opportunity was taken by the arriving Fuxu.</p><p></p><p>At that time, in the face of Fuxu, Lin Yuan had not even possessed the ability to resist, being directly slapped away.</p><p></p><p>Liyanguo Capital, Independent Space.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, we will have to directly contend with other ancient kingdom experts for the core celestial pillars from now on," Qiyan Supremacy said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Over the past millennium in the Treasure Land, the unoccupied core celestial pillars had basically all been refined by the various ancient kingdom powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Now, to continue refining more core celestial pillars, they would have to snatch those already refined by other ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>"Qiyan, who do you plan to strike first?"</p><p></p><p>The assembled peak Supremacy experts nodded, having long been prepared. The past millennium in the Treasure Land was just a warm-up, with the competition between ancient kingdom experts being relatively restrained.</p><p></p><p>In the following 500 years, the intensity of the competition would rapidly increase, and in the final 500 years, it would be the most intense period, when even the top peak Supremacy experts would exert their full might, unleashing all the ancient kingdom's profound killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," Qiyan Supremacy nodded, then suddenly looked at Lin Yuan and asked gently, "Yinhe, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>As one of the four top peak Supremacy experts of the Liyanguo Ancient Kingdom, Qiyan Supremacy still valued Lin Yuan's opinion.</p><p></p><p>"What do I think?" Lin Yuan paused momentarily, then said, "Can we wait a bit longer?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait longer?" Qiyan Supremacy was puzzled, as were the other peak Supremacy experts.</p><p></p><p>Why wait longer?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan grinned and said, "I plan to take back that giant core celestial pillar!"</p><p></p><p>Giant Core Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The peak Supremacy experts of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom were seated in meditation.</p><p></p><p>The importance of the giant core celestial pillar was too high. Even though it had been refined by Fuxu, the other powerful experts of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom had dispatched their main combat bodies to guard it at all times, in case any variables arose.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, in this Treasure Land competition, our Great Fu Ancient Kingdom has already occupied 72 refined core celestial pillars, and with this giant core celestial pillar, we now have a total of 82!" </p><p></p><p>"That's nearly 30 more than the second-placed Savage Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The many peak Supremacy experts of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom were very relaxed. Now their ancient kingdom occupied an absolute advantage, even if the two remaining giant core celestial pillars were to fall into the hands of another ancient kingdom, their total number would still not surpass the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the probability of the two giant core celestial pillars falling into the same ancient kingdom's hands was extremely low, not even the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom was confident of that, let alone the other ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to Fuxu. If not for Fuxu, this giant core celestial pillar would probably have ended up in the hands of the Liyanguo Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that Yinhe Supremacy of the Liyanguo Ancient Kingdom got really lucky, the giant core celestial pillar just descended right next to him. If it wasn't for Fuxu's peerless strength..."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, what use is luck? He still got slapped away by Fuxu, didn't he?"</p><p></p><p>The peak Supremacy experts of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom chatted casually. As the oldest ancient kingdom, they had a faint sense of superiority when facing other ancient kingdom powerhouses of the same level, even towards the existence of Yinhe Supremacy, the first to have excavated the Ancestor's bloodline to the Supremacy realm.</p><p></p><p>What use was an Ancestor's bloodline at the Supremacy level? Just then—</p><p></p><p>A young man appeared near the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>This young man had a Yin-Yang symbol faintly emerging on his brow, the black and white energies slowly rotating. He stood there boldly in the sight of all the peak Supremacy experts of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He stood silently, without any words or actions.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this caused the hearts of the many Great Fu Ancient Kingdom peak Supremacy experts to tremble. Whether they were top peak Supremacy experts or ordinary ones, their minds became unsettled, feeling a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

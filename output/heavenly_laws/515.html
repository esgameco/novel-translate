        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared silently - it was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Canglan Star." Lin Yuan looked towards the unremarkable planet in the distance, feeling quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Star was only a medium-level life-bearing planet. Even though it had been transformed into a high-level life-bearing planet due to his influence, to Lin Yuan it was still like a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>But this was ultimately where Lin Yuan grew up, and his parents still lived on Canglan Star.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've been back," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since leaving Canglan Star for the Chikun main star, Lin Yuan hadn't returned. He had only met with his parents in the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Star, in Estate No. 1 on the Central Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong were planting flowers. With human civilization's technology, any rare flower could be rapidly propagated, but Lu Qiong enjoyed the feeling of flowers growing slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Old Lin, I see many people saying Little Yuan has become a Supreme Being?" Lu Qiong said with some surprise after tending to the flowers that needed care.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan became a Supreme Being?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng was a bit dazed. Not long ago he was still stunned that his son had overpowered a Supreme Being, and now he had directly become a Supreme Being himself?</p><p></p><p>"It must be fake, right?" Lin Shoucheng said instinctively.</p><p></p><p>"It's true, the Central Star Region has issued an announcement," Lu Qiong immediately said, as virtual screens continuously appeared before her.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared in the distance, smiling as he looked at Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan." </p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng called out in surprise when he saw the figure.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he left Canglan Star, the current Lin Yuan had almost no changes, even wearing the same clothes. Only his gaze and aura seemed more profound.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan, how did you come back too?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong's face was full of joy. Although they often met Lin Yuan in the virtual world, the virtual world was ultimately virtual - how could it compare to the realness of reality?</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom." Lin Yuan walked over casually with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan, everyone online is saying you've become a Supreme Being," Lu Qiong mentioned after chatting briefly.</p><p></p><p>At these words.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng beside her immediately looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You really became a Supreme Being?" Lu Qiong and Lin Shoucheng looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Their son had become a Supreme Being?</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan, I heard that Supreme Beings' life essence transcends the river of time. Do we look like ants to you now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." Lin Yuan laughed. "No, you're different."</p><p></p><p>As long as there is life, there will be emotions. Lin Yuan was no exception. No matter how weak his parents were, they were still his parents.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh ~ A flying vehicle rapidly descended.</p><p></p><p>Two figures walked down from it - Lin Yi and Xia Keran.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, there's big news." Lin Yi strode towards the estate, calling out as she walked. Beside her, Xia Keran also looked excited.</p><p></p><p>When they entered the estate and saw Lin Yuan standing to the side, they were momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother." Lin Yi called out instinctively.</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran stood behind Lin Yi, staring blankly at Lin Yuan. Then he reacted, immediately bowing deeply and saying: "Xia Keran pays respects to the Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>As one of the great evolutionary families of human civilization, the Xia family naturally learned first about the Milky Way Star Lord reaching the twelfth level, and even received confirmed information.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xia Keran and Lin Yi rushed to Canglan Star so quickly was because the Milky Way Star Lord had reached the twelfth level. They wanted to tell this joyous news to the Milky Way Star Lord's parents.</p><p></p><p>Although in the internet age, by the time they reached Canglan Star, Lin Shoucheng and his wife would likely already know about this, coming in person was also a show of attitude.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong were the parents of a Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>But Xia Keran hadn't expected Lin Yuan to be here as well.</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Lin Yuan said casually with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Xia Keran still felt very nervous. He recalled the instructions from the Xia family's eleventh-level ancestor before he came - absolutely do not have any improper behavior or actions in front of the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran agreed with this. After all, the Milky Way Star Lord was now a Supreme Being, the tenth Supreme Being of human civilization. How noble was his status?</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, how did you come here?" Lin Yi's tone was also much more careful. The pressure brought by the three words "Supreme Being" was too great.</p><p></p><p>Especially having just received this news, when Lin Yi thought about how her brother was now a Supreme Being of human civilization, transcending everything, she felt a bit shaky inside.</p><p></p><p>"I had some free time, so I came over," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the ultimate level, Lin Yuan had put almost all his energy and focus into cultivation. After all, if he didn't reach the twelfth level, he would still be a life within the river of time, and would die when the river of time collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Under this pressure, Lin Yuan naturally gave it his all.</p><p></p><p>But after becoming a Supreme Being, Lin Yuan became more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Beings had infinite lifespans. The only issue was facing the universe's great destruction, but with Lin Yuan's strength, he could easily withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the estate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng, Lu Qiong, Lin Yi, Xia Keran, and Lin Yuan - the five of them were chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>Outside the estate, many evolved guards were</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was a meticulous inspection.</p><p></p><p>As the parents of the Galactic Lord, Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong were naturally protected by a professional team to prevent any danger.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Lin Yi and Mr. Xia have returned."</p><p></p><p>The captain of the guard team glanced at the descending aircraft and nodded to signal clearance. The identity level of Mr. and Mrs. Lin Shoucheng was very high, and any unrelated personnel were prohibited from approaching, but Miss Lin Yi, as the sister of the Galactic Lord, could naturally be allowed through.</p><p></p><p>The captain of the guard team watched Lin Yi and Xia Keran enter the manor, and soon faintly heard the sound of conversation inside.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The captain of the guard team glanced slightly and was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Because at this moment in the manor, besides Mr. and Mrs. Lin Shoucheng, Lin Yi and Xia Keran, there was actually another man standing quietly there.</p><p></p><p>This man had entered without leaving any trace or record, and the captain of the guard team didn't remember this man entering recently.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, an unknown person has appeared, possibly posing a threat." The captain's heart began to race. If anything happened to Mr. and Mrs. Lin Shoucheng under his protection, he dared not think of the consequences.</p><p></p><p>"Alert, enter highest alert!"</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately notified all evolved guards.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a large number of evolved guards appeared outside the manor, closely monitoring the scene inside.</p><p></p><p>"Captain." Just as the captain was considering the next move, a voice suddenly came from beside him.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to say?" The captain looked at the speaker.</p><p></p><p>"He, he seems to be the Galactic Lord." The evolved guard speaking stammered a bit.</p><p></p><p>To be a guard here required extensive experience, but under the huge shock of seeing the Galactic Lord in person, he was still a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The captain fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He looked into the manor again and found that the man was very similar to the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the tone of conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Lin Shoucheng, Lin Yi and Xia Keran, the captain immediately realized that he may have misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord, is that the Galactic Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord has actually appeared here?"</p><p></p><p>The guard team was instantly in an uproar. Many evolved guards were extremely excited. They had never seen a supreme being in their lives, and now they had seen one, and it was the Galactic Lord?</p><p></p><p>The myriad races of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>All underwent huge changes because Lin Yuan had entered the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>The domain of the Prison Race.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary planet.</p><p></p><p>Large numbers of Prison Race members were migrating.</p><p></p><p>To face the upcoming reckoning and wrath of the Galactic Lord, the eleven peak racial powers including the Prison Race had to abandon most of their territories.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, do we really have to leave here?" </p><p></p><p>A young Prison Race member said reluctantly. Although Prison Race powerhouses had explained to them that going to the core domain of the Prison Wardens would give them a higher quality of life.</p><p></p><p>But this was after all the place where they had grown up.</p><p></p><p>The Prison Race's living habits were similar to human civilization, both being quite attached to their homeland.</p><p></p><p>"We must leave," said an elderly Prison Race member next to him, nodding. "The Galactic Lord has entered the twelfth level. If we don't leave now, when the Galactic Lord comes, we won't be able to leave."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Galactic Lord so terrifying, even more terrifying than our Emperor?" The young Prison Race member couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>The elderly Prison Race member next to him heard this but didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know whether the Galactic Lord or the Prison Race Emperor was stronger, but judging from the large-scale retreat of the Prison Race as a whole, the Galactic Lord must be stronger.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Prison Race, but the Celestial Feather Race, Universe Race, Cosmos Race and many other races were also beginning a large-scale retreat.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only entered the twelfth level and had not yet made a move, but had caused such a reaction from many peak racial powers. One can imagine how great his deterrent power was.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually chatted with his parents for a while, then glanced outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>With his perception, he naturally had control over every detail outside the manor, and the entire Red Kun Star Region and even human civilization were under his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Those evolved guards were extremely excited because of him, and Lin Yuan couldn't be bothered to stop them.</p><p></p><p>Since he had entered the twelfth level, unless he actively contacted them, even the three goddesses and the virtual world network couldn't reach him, and the evolved guards around the manor couldn't know in advance that he was coming.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going back first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said goodbye to his parents and sister, and his figure disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Gate of All Realms." Lin Yuan's spirit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>After the ultimate leap succeeded, besides the mysterious gourd beginning to transform, the Gate of All Realms was also transforming.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the mysterious gourd, the transformation of the Gate of All Realms was overall vague, as if shrouded in mist.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could clearly feel an incomparably majestic source of power connecting with the projection of the Gate of All Realms deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that the transformation of the Gate of All Realms had completely ended.</p><p></p><p>Steadying himself, Lin Yuan immediately sank his consciousness into the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the transformed Gate of All Realms.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

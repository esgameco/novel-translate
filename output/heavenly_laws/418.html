            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 418: What Can They Do to Me?</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the True Lord of the Eastern Wing. </p><p></p><p>He did not expect the True Lord of the Eastern Wing to come in person, for the sake of the Yin Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>And the tone of the True Lord of the Eastern Wing already regarded the Yin Realm Lord as a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of the Eastern Wing immediately detailed the information about the Yin Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>He emphasized that the Yin Realm Lord cultivated those worldly beings that were regarded as food by the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Realm Lord is not simple."</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of the Eastern Wing continued gravely:</p><p></p><p>"Although he has concealed himself greatly, according to the insights and deductions of the True Lord of Heavenly Intelligence..."</p><p></p><p>"The true combat power of the Yin Realm Lord may even surpass that of us perfected evil god True Lords at the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"A single perfected True Lord is estimated to be no match for him."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the True Lord of the Eastern Wing looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of Heavenly Intelligence was also an extremely renowned figure among the many perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>However, the True Lord of Heavenly Intelligence was most skilled in insight and deduction, known as the evil god True Lord with the highest wisdom in the entire boundless void and myriad evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Even other perfected True Lords of the same realm greatly respected the True Lord of Heavenly Intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged as he slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt some admiration that there were sages among the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>He had the Yin Realm Lord suppress his power to buy time.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he had already been noticed by those perfected True Lords.</p><p></p><p>This was actually quite normal. The abilities mastered by the evil gods were bizarre and strange.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yin Realm Lord concealed his strength, he had acted many times.</p><p></p><p>It was not particularly surprising that some of his true power was seen through.</p><p></p><p>But it was only some of his true power that was seen through.</p><p></p><p>At least that Heavenly Intelligence True Lord did not know that the so-called Sun True Lord and Yin Realm Lord actually originated from the same source.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the True Lord of the Eastern Wing would not have taken the initiative to come.</p><p></p><p>"Sun True Lord, I want to invite you to join us in suppressing that Yin Realm Lord when the critical moment comes."</p><p></p><p>The evil god of the Eastern Wing stated his ultimate purpose.</p><p></p><p>They must prevent it, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the worldly beings currently cultivated by the Yin Realm Lord were still extremely weak, far from threatening any evil god.</p><p></p><p>But in the deductions that the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord devoted effort to, if this was allowed to continue, those beings regarded as ants by the many evil gods would grow stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Eventually threatening the rule of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>So it had to be nipped in the bud.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan agreed without much hesitation.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, the combat power of either of his two primordial souls was stronger than a perfected True Lord.</p><p></p><p>And his Martial Ancestor Golden Body was even stronger than the two primordial souls.</p><p></p><p>But overall, he was still at the same realm as the perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>He had not crossed into the legendary tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>So facing many perfected evil god True Lords, he could not simply sweep them away.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the best choice for now was for the Sun Primordial Soul to temporarily blend into the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>At least he could learn of the plots of those perfected evil gods, so that the Yin Primordial Soul could react.</p><p></p><p>If necessary, the two primordial souls, or even Lin Yuan himself, could join forces to slaughter those perfected evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the two primordial souls to unite and slaughter those perfected evil gods, they would need absolute certainty of success.</p><p></p><p>This could very likely force the deepest reserves of the evil gods to manifest, causing the war to fully escalate and trigger a great war across the entire boundless void.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, Lin Yuan himself did not mind, relying on his various physical divine abilities, especially the "Elemental Body".</p><p></p><p>Surviving would not be a problem, and the worst outcome would just be ending his sojourn prematurely and returning to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But this could potentially affect the spread of the path of martial dao evolution.</p><p></p><p>As long as his true self in the main universe comprehended the sixth level of space-time fusion, then no matter how those perfected evil gods struggled, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, while the descent of consciousness is absolutely safe, it cannot unleash the strongest combat power," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strongest combat power naturally came from his true self in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the Martial Ancestor Golden Body that descended into the boundless void, its foundation was indeed extraordinarily blessed.</p><p></p><p>But it could not compare to Lin Yuan's true self in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's true self in the main universe had experienced a complete infusion of the primordial essence of the chaotic void, as well as many enhancements to his physical body, soul, and other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Such as being immersed in the Spring of Eternity and nourished by many universal precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Lin Yuan in the main universe could utilize many more trump cards and methods.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"Then I will contact the Sun True Lord when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of the Eastern Wing did not find Lin Yuan's agreement strange.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, this time he came to invite Lin Yuan on the instructions of the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, even as a perfected evil god True Lord, would be given face and not easily offended.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, while lower-level evil gods might be extremely selfish, their perspective towards the perfected evil god True Lords who stood at the peak of the boundless void was different from ordinary evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The actions of the Yin Realm Lord were unacceptable to all perfected evil god True Lords. Unless they truly could not act, they would basically all agree.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan refused or hesitated, that would arouse suspicion from the True Lord of the Eastern Wing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the True Lord of the Eastern Wing leave, Lin Yuan's gaze deepened.</p><p></p><p>With his perception, he naturally sensed that the True Lord of the Eastern Wing did not come alone.</p><p></p><p>In the distant area, there was another powerful perfected evil god True Lord observing.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed in his heart. The Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, renowned for wisdom, was said to be the evil god True Lord with the highest wisdom in the entire boundless void and myriad evil gods among the many perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>Although perfected True Lords of the ninth stage were all extraordinarily intelligent, the essence of being an evil god still made them revere power.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the higher the status of the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, the more formidable this perfected evil god True Lord must be.</p><p></p><p>On an ordinary hill stood a figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure was only ten meters tall, yet its head was nearly as large as its body. Compared to other evil gods, this figure had no vicious aura at all, its gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>This figure was precisely the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, the anomaly among the many evil gods renowned for wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Intelligence."</p><p></p><p>"I have persuaded the Sun True Lord."</p><p></p><p>"The Sun True Lord has also agreed to assist us in suppressing that Yin Realm Lord when necessary."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True Lord of the Eastern Wing swiftly approached and stood below the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, speaking.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not just the Sun True Lord, a single perfected True Lord. On this journey, under the command of the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, the True Lord of the Eastern Wing had visited one perfected True Lord after another.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire boundless void, there were at most a hundred perfected evil god True Lords, each dominating their own realm. Normally, even if other perfected True Lords wanted to find them, it was not necessarily possible.</p><p></p><p>Only the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord, through insight and deduction, could know the locations of most perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>"This Sun True Lord has great secrets. In the boundless void for millions of years, I have not seen any traces left by this True Lord," the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord's brow slightly furrowed as he slowly said.</p><p></p><p>"Great secrets?" The True Lord of the Eastern Wing said indifferently, "Which of us perfected True Lords does not have great secrets? As long as it does not threaten the boundless void."</p><p></p><p>The evil gods came and went alone, and the perfected evil god True Lords even more so. Those who could grow to the ninth stage of perfection basically all harbored great secrets.</p><p></p><p>Even the True Lord of the Eastern Wing knew that some perfected evil god True Lords did not grow up in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Rather, they came from the deepest secret realms of the void, places only the progenitors of the void realms could enter, teeming with myriad void beings.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, cracks and entrances would occasionally appear in that region of space, and some weaker evil gods who fell in had the possibility of growing into perfected evil god True Lords before breaking out again.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Intelligence True Lord also could not sense any traces left by those few perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>"That's true," the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there were still too many secrets in the boundless void that could not be understood, and the void secret realms were just one of them.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Sun True Lord did not cultivate those so-called food like the Yin Realm Lord, the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord could not be bothered to investigate further.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Intelligence, we have persuaded thirteen perfected True Lords. Is that not enough to deal with that Yin Realm Lord?" The True Lord of the Eastern Wing could not help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Before visiting Lin Yuan, the True Lord of the Eastern Wing had already visited twelve perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that should be enough," the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord slightly nodded, glancing at the True Lord of the Eastern Wing. "The strength of the Yin Realm Lord is still above yours. To suppress him without any hidden dangers, we likely need over ten perfected evil god True Lords."</p><p></p><p>Among the perfected evil gods, there were higher and lower levels of methods, and victories and defeats in strength.</p><p></p><p>But defeating was easy, while killing was more difficult than ascending to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary perfected evil god True Lord would likely need five or six True Lords of the same realm to truly suppress them.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Yin Realm Lord was a bit higher than an ordinary perfected True Lord, so dispatching ten True Lords of the same realm would be absolutely certain.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," the True Lord of the Eastern Wing immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to the True Lord of the Eastern Wing's estimation, no matter how strong the Yin Realm Lord was, he should not surpass the ninth stage of perfection by much. As long as he was not at the tenth stage, seven or eight True Lords of the same realm should be enough.</p><p></p><p>But using only seven or eight perfected evil god True Lords to suppress the Yin Realm Lord risked accidents occurring.</p><p></p><p>For example, under the resistance of the Yin Realm Lord, two or three perfected True Lords could be injured.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, naturally the more perfected evil god True Lords, the better.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was for the sake of the entire boundless void, and did not require the True Lord of the Eastern Wing to pay any price himself.</p><p></p><p>"However, this Sun True Lord and that Yin Realm Lord both appeared within a thousand years?" The Heavenly Intelligence True Lord's gaze flashed with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Sun True Lord and Yin Realm Lord possessing completely opposite powers, and one being in the void secret realm while the other in the boundless void, with their conduct and styles also vastly different...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Intelligence True Lord would even suspect there was some connection between them.</p><p></p><p>"This should just be a coincidence," the nearby True Lord of the Eastern Wing guessed. "We evil gods can indeed separate incarnations, but an incarnation's power comes from the same source as the main body, and its strength is far inferior to the main body."</p><p></p><p>"But the difference between this Sun True Lord and Yin Realm Lord is very clear."</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of the Eastern Wing said.</p><p></p><p>The myriad abilities mastered by the evil gods were indeed bizarre, but they still had to follow the subtle rules of the cosmos. This point was clear to both the True Lord of the Eastern Wing and the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see when the time comes," the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the reason he had the True Lord of the Eastern Wing specifically invite the Sun True Lord this time was also to probe whether there really was any connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>According to the True Lord of the Eastern Wing's description, the Sun True Lord did not reveal any abnormalities, but the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord still did not let down his guard.</p><p></p><p>As the perfected evil god True Lord renowned for "wisdom", the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord would not easily trust anything. The Sun True Lord had not shown any flaws for now, so the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord did not mind continuing to wait.</p><p></p><p>Time was not an issue for the Heavenly Intelligence True Lord.</p><p></p><p>He would even observe the Sun True Lord's reaction during the upcoming confrontation with the Yin Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Soul sat cross-legged outside a certain world.</p><p></p><p>"They want to gather many perfected evil god True Lords to deal with me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was well aware in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he did not know about this in advance, when facing the joint attack of over ten perfected evil gods, Lin Yuan would indeed have some troubles.</p><p></p><p>But since he knew beforehand, it was much easier.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength of mind and will, I can probably maintain about fifty incarnations with basic combat power at the same time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, separating an incarnation was extremely simple, just a wisp of mind and will.</p><p></p><p>But for that incarnation to possess combat power would place a burden on Lin Yuan's mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Before the tenth sojourn, Lin Yuan's mind and will was barely over a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, at most he could maintain two or three incarnations with basic combat power simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's mind and will exceeded two million, so the number of incarnations with basic combat power he could maintain had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>An incarnation was not a clone - it only required a small investment of mind and will. But under such circumstances, to maintain basic combat power required a great burden of mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "basic combat power" mentioned here was relative to Lin Yuan's true self. With his strength, even the weakest incarnation could easily suppress ninth or tenth stage experts.</p><p></p><p>And the so-called basic combat power referred to being able to unleash strength approaching the eleventh stage threshold.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan occupied forty-two worlds, with an incarnation stationed in each world. These incarnations, assisted by the world's primordial essence, could put up a bit of a fight against those perfected evil god True Lords.</p><p></p><p>The perfected evil god True Lords of the ninth stage were basically equivalent to the fourth and fifth ranks of the eleventh stage in the main universe's system.</p><p></p><p>The perfected evil god True Lords may differ significantly from eleventh stage experts of the fourth and fifth ranks in the main universe in terms of methods and abilities. But overall, they should be at the same level.</p><p></p><p>If not for these incarnations needing to rely on the world's primordial essence to barely manifest fourth rank eleventh stage combat power, with Lin Yuan's current strength, he could...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With so many incarnated powers, Yuan could actively encircle and kill those perfected demon sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of the Void Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan gazed into the boundless depths of the void. Relying on his comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules, he vaguely saw an enormous inner world lurking in the deepest part of the void. </p><p></p><p>The Solar Primordial Soul had roamed the Void Secret Realm for three to four hundred years but still had not determined the trace of its creator.</p><p></p><p>However, easily killing ten or twenty perfected demon sovereigns would not be a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>But taking such an action harbored great hidden dangers. There was a possibility of forcing the creator of the Void Secret Realm to take action. In that case, even if Yuan did not die, the martial dao's deployment he had spread across the boundless void over the past three to four hundred years would likely be affected.</p><p></p><p>So Yuan had waited until now. After all, time was on his side.</p><p></p><p>The longer the time dragged on, the more terrifying the enemies those demons would have to face.</p><p></p><p>"Since those demons plan to go all out against me, I don't need to be so cautious anymore," Yuan decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For the past three to four hundred years, the Lunar Primordial Soul had occupied world after world, always trying to keep a low profile and avoid drawing the attention of the other demons.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that this approach did not have much significance, as those perfected demon sovereigns had all conspired to deal with him. Naturally, he would no longer need to be as cautious as before.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I can maintain the basic combat strength of fifty incarnations, so I can completely occupy fifty worlds and then dispatch incarnations to take control and garrison them."</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze shifted slightly, looking towards the vast boundless void.</p><p></p><p>After the incarnations took control of the worlds, relying on the demon tree seeds, they could quickly replace the world's heavenly dao and gain the blessings of the world's primal source.</p><p></p><p>Their combat strength would then soar again, reaching the threshold of perfected demon sovereigns. As long as they were within the worlds, even those perfected demon sovereigns would not dare to easily invade.</p><p></p><p>Incarnations that had just reached the threshold of perfected demon sovereigns were naturally no match for the incarnations of those veteran perfected demons. At most, they could only challenge them briefly. In an actual fight, they would definitely lose.</p><p></p><p>But within the worlds, those perfected demon sovereigns would certainly worry about using mutually destructive methods, such as causing the world to collapse. That kind of destructive power might not completely annihilate demons at the perfected stage, but it could at least severely injure them.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, as long as the perfected demon sovereigns were not foolish, they would not act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>At an exit of the Void Secret Realm...</p><p></p><p>The forms of the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign and the Eastern Wing Sovereign appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The rest will be left to you," the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign said, looking at the Eastern Wing Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>He had already finished coordinating with the other perfected demon sovereigns. The remaining tasks were enough for the Eastern Wing Sovereign to handle.</p><p></p><p>"Left to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Wisdom, what are you planning to do?" the Eastern Wing Sovereign asked in slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I vaguely feel that the Lunar Realm Lord occupying world after world, cultivating those ants as food in those worlds, is not as simple as it seems. There's also the martial dao - this cultivation system is very different from how we demons grow stronger, yet it allows those ants to continuously become more powerful."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's tone was somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when he first learned that the Lunar Realm Lord had occupied those worlds, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign did not care much about it.</p><p></p><p>Later, when he found out that the Lunar Realm Lord was cultivating the ants in those worlds, he still did not pay it much attention.</p><p></p><p>Those ants in the worlds were far inferior to demons in innate talent and aptitude. Did the Lunar Realm Lord really think he could cultivate them just because he wanted to?</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign saw the Lunar Realm Lord's actions as merely a personal hobby to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign saw the martial dao cultivation system that he changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Lunar Realm Lord had occupied world after world, spreading the martial dao cultivation system. As a perfected demon sovereign like the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign, he could easily see this martial dao cultivation system if he wished.</p><p></p><p>But upon seeing it, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign broke out in a cold sweat. He immediately realized the potential of the martial dao cultivation system. If one could cultivate this system to the end, their strength would be no less than that of the perfected demon sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>How could this be allowed?</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign, after carefully observing the Lunar Realm Lord and witnessing his actions dozens of times, determined that the other party was concealing his true strength, which might surpass what all the demons had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't it be enough to kill all the martial dao cultivators after dealing with that Lunar Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing Sovereign immediately said.</p><p></p><p>At present, the martial dao cultivators were still extremely weak. Compared to ordinary beings, they were even more delicious to the demons.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still a bit worried."</p><p></p><p>"So from now on, I plan to carefully deduce and try to find the source of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing Sovereign nodded. "I'll contact you immediately if anything happens."</p><p></p><p>He had no objections to the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's decision.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Martial Palace in the Celestial Azure World...</p><p></p><p>Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Around his body, the power of space-time fusion vaguely formed a vast "Celestial River."</p><p></p><p>"Space-time fusion, what exactly is space-time fusion?" Yuan opened his eyes, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>When he had just comprehended the rules of space-time fusion, Yuan felt that he had thoroughly understood the fundamental mysteries of space and time.</p><p></p><p>But as he continued to cultivate and comprehend, through the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels of the space-time fusion rules, Yuan became perplexed about them instead.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, as he tried to comprehend the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules, he had reached an impasse.</p><p></p><p>From the third to the fifth level of the space-time fusion rules, Yuan had only spent a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>But from the fifth level to the present, Yuan had spent three hundred years and still had not taken that step to enter the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>"The space we live in is space-time, and the time we experience is also space-time. Even the river of time I observed before is actually just one side of it - it not only contains time but also space. It should be called the river of space-time."</p><p></p><p>Countless flashes of enlightenment flickered through Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>During his comprehension of the secret manual "Celestial River," Yuan's understanding of the sixth level of space-time fusion had also continuously improved. Without this secret manual, even with his transcendent comprehension, Yuan would have needed at least ten times as long to reach his current level.</p><p></p><p>[Your transcendent comprehension, combined with comprehending the "Celestial River" secret manual, has further enhanced your understanding of space-time fusion.]</p><p></p><p>Boundless rays of enlightenment erupted, and the space-time "Celestial River" condensed around Yuan's body suddenly began to churn, unleashing terrifying space-time fluctuations that instantly calmed.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that I'm not far from the sixth level of space-time fusion rules," Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years of bitter cultivation, he had finally caught a glimpse of the threshold of the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>"Keep going."</p><p></p><p>Yuan was full of vigor. If he could comprehend the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules in the next two hundred years he had left here, this journey through space-time would be a complete success.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not, Yuan had still gained immensely - his comprehension of the space-time fusion rules at the peak of the fifth level, as well as nearly 2.4 million points of spiritual willpower.</p><p></p><p>For any other Eleventh Plane being, even those with shockingly transcendent talents that appeared once in an eternity, it would be impossible to achieve this in billions, trillions, or even quadrillions of years.</p><p></p><p>Especially the latter - 2.4 million points of spiritual willpower would drive any Eleventh Plane being to despair.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Celestial Azure World...</p><p></p><p>This figure was ten meters tall, but its head was nearly as large as its body. Its gaze was calm, but it was now solemnly observing the world that emanated a "celestial azure" color in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"I spent a hundred years and exhausted countless efforts, deducing and observing as much as possible. Finally, from the many traces left behind by the Lunar Realm Lord, I have locked onto this place," the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign said with a hint of emotion, knowing only he understood the price paid to search for this place.</p><p></p><p>"If my deductions are correct, that world is the origin of the martial dao. The martial dao cultivation system spread by the Lunar Realm Lord originated from here."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's heart stirred with excitement. Although he did not know why the Lunar Realm Lord had spread the martial dao, since he could find its source, it was completely possible to cut off its spread from the root.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the demons' dominance over the boundless void would never again be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Wing and the others have already entangled the Lunar Realm Lord. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I can thoroughly explore this world."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign was very cautious. Even though the Lunar Realm Lord could not rush back in a short time, he had no intention of entering the Celestial Azure World with his true body. Instead, he split off an incarnation while his true body hid far away, controlling the incarnation to explore the Celestial Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>Soon, one of the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's incarnations swiftly entered the Celestial Azure World.</p><p></p><p>For a perfected demon sovereign like the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign, invading a world of the Celestial Azure World's scale was not difficult at all. Moreover, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign excelled in wisdom, which was why he could so easily enter.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"This world has nothing special about it."</p><p></p><p>After a brief look, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign realized that compared to the fifty worlds the Lunar Realm Lord had occupied, some of the powerful ones were dozens of times larger than the Celestial Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign merged into the beings of the Celestial Azure World and began investigating every aspect of this world from the most minute details.</p><p></p><p>"This world is also dominated by the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign quickly obtained all the information he wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>That was the true origin of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's expression turned solemn. This was the first time he had heard this title.</p><p></p><p>Previously, from the dozens of worlds occupied by the Lunar Realm Lord, he had only investigated the martial dao cultivation system and its cultivators but had never heard of the Martial Ancestor from any of them.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is the source of the martial dao? It was the Martial Ancestor who spread the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor resides in the Canopy Realm's Martial Palace..."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign gathered more information.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Azure World, the Martial Ancestor's whereabouts were not a secret. Basically, any martial dao cultivator would know.</p><p></p><p>It was the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few hundred years, the high priests of the Martial Palace would hold ceremonies to worship the Martial Ancestor from time to time, leading all beings of heaven and earth to kneel and pay respects.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign decided to investigate the truth about this Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was currently just an incarnation. Even if he encountered any danger, it would not be a problem. Even if the Lunar Realm Lord rushed back now, he could not do anything to the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign arrived at the Canopy Continent.</p><p></p><p>Although this was just one of the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's incarnations, his true body's realm was there. No martial dao cultivator discovered him along the way.</p><p></p><p>"This ancient tree, is it also a demon?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign glanced at the Primordial Demon Tree. Although it had undergone hundreds of thousands of years of nurturing in the Celestial Azure World, the demonic aura could not be changed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Martial Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign came before a great palace.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from here was profound, causing the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign to pause.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Martial Ancestor in the depths of the Martial Palace?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign did not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign felt an inexplicable sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what background this Martial Ancestor has and which sovereign is playing deity."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign gathered his thoughts and immediately employed his methods, beginning to project the various scenes within the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's greatest strength was deduction and observation. Deduction and observation were two aspects of his abilities, and the latter allowed him to see many secrets of the world.</p><p></p><p>Shaa shaa...</p><p></p><p>The scene began to move deeper into the Martial Palace. The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign saw the priests of the Martial Palace and the many martial dao cultivators and believers kneeling in worship, one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the scene the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign saw reached the innermost depths of the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>This place was empty, as no one dared to enter without the Martial Ancestor's permission.</p><p></p><p>The great palace was vacant, with a solemn aura gathering faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign carefully examined the surroundings and discovered a figure sitting cross-legged at the end of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's heart shook, and he immediately began to observe more closely.</p><p></p><p>The scene quickly zoomed in and enlarged, as the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign wanted to observe the Martial Ancestor more carefully.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Martial Ancestor, whose eyes had been closed, opened them silently.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's entire consciousness was drawn to those eyes.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the incarnation the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign was using to observe exploded directly.</p><p></p><p>At an extremely distant place from the Celestial Azure World, a backlash traveled through the connection between the main body and the incarnation, descending upon him.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's true form trembled, and his aura began to plummet rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"So that was the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign's heart trembled with immense dread. Without the slightest hesitation, his form shot into the sky, frantically fleeing into the distance.</p>

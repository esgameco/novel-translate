        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nalan Vice Chief curiously asked, "Galaxy Chief, your cultivation in the two-dimensional world should have crossed into the Wuzhu realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was the strongest genius in the history of human civilization. His talent and comprehension were unquestionable, so Nalan Vice Chief was almost certain that Lin Yuan had already become a Wuzhu.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that in the two-dimensional world for over a hundred years, a considerable portion of the tenth-level lifeforms had just entered the Wuzhu realm.</p><p></p><p>Before descending into the early two-dimensional world, eighth-level, ninth-level, tenth-level, and eleventh-level lifeforms were all at the same starting point. </p><p></p><p>But as time passed, the gap between them would widen, and the gap would become larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded. The eighteenth level of the Wuzhu realm was also a Wuzhu.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, our human eleventh-level evolutionary cultivators have compiled seventeen cultivation methods after the Wuzhu realm. I'll send them over for you to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Nalan Vice Chief immediately sent them to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, special lifeforms were rampant, and human civilization was relatively weak, so they had to stick together.</p><p></p><p>Sharing cultivation methods with each other was common. As for the competition when the Heavenly Gate opened, as long as most of those who left the two-dimensional world were human evolutionary cultivators, human civilization would be considered the winner.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the current situation, this hope was not very high.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those mysterious experts hidden in the dark, like the one from the Ancient Blood Rain Nation. Just the Four Celestial Kings alone had almost secured the spots to leave when the Heavenly Gate opened for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the cultivation methods Nalan Vice Chief sent over, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary cultivators who pioneered these post-Wuzhu cultivation methods were basically eleventh-level existences of human civilization. They themselves were the most astonishingly talented evolutionary geniuses of their era. The cultivation methods they explored were quite thought-provoking for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At least they were more thought-provoking than the native Wuzhu cultivation methods of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that my cultivation method may not be suitable for you," Lin Yuan said hesitantly after briefly looking through them, gazing at Nalan Vice Chief.</p><p></p><p>The Wuzhu cultivation method Lin Yuan practiced was created based on his extraordinary comprehension and his own conditions.</p><p></p><p>The advantage was that it could excavate all the potential of his physical body at every stage, but the disadvantage was that it was only tailored for Lin Yuan himself. Other experts, even if they wanted to learn from it, couldn't.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the more than ten post-Wuzhu cultivation methods compiled by Nalan Vice Chief were also explored by many eleventh-level human evolutionary cultivators based on their own conditions.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, they lacked universality, but Lin Yuan possessed extraordinary comprehension and could observe the direction of cultivation methods from the most fundamental perspective.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter," Nalan Vice Chief shook his head. Although Lin Yuan was the strongest genius in the history of human civilization, he was ultimately only a tenth-level lifeform. Compared to eleventh-level evolutionary cultivators, his perspective was narrower and closer.</p><p></p><p>"After the Heavenly Gate opens this time, I will specially compile some cultivation methods for you all," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>For now, his most important task was to enhance his strength as much as possible before the Heavenly Gate opened in two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>As for spending time specifically to create suitable cultivation methods for other evolutionary cultivators of human civilization, that would be deviating from his goal.</p><p></p><p>Such matters could wait until two hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>By then, Lin Yuan should have more free time.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his aura simmering like an abyss.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was like an unyielding rock, not emitting the slightest aura, and then immediately, like a tsunami, a terrifying surge of blood energy radiated outward in all directions.</p><p></p><p>If he weren't deep underground, the impact would probably have alarmed all the powerful experts within thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>"The nineteenth level of the Wuzhu realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, a faint smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>After observing the Wuzhu cultivation paths explored by other eleventh-level evolutionary cultivators of human civilization, Lin Yuan's own accumulation finally reached a qualitative change, crossing into the nineteenth level of the Wuzhu realm.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is about sixty percent stronger than the eighteenth level of the Wuzhu realm. To hunt down the ancient god Tuoba again, it would take at most two hours to penetrate the inner armor of the mystical artifact and kill him through shockwaves."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the explosive surge of power within his body, his expression satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level the Four Celestial Kings are at now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Four Celestial Kings possessed extremely powerful weapons that were perfectly suited for them.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, by using these supreme weapons to comprehend the power of this realm, they would probably far surpass other powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up, leaving the underground depths and returning to the Luochuan gathering place.</p><p></p><p>At the Luochuan gathering place.</p><p></p><p>Cha Ran Gu stood respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Cha Ran Gu said reverently.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Cha Ran Gu received another message from the Blood Rain Tavern. The source of the killing traces spreading within the Ancient Blood Rain Nation had been completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>According to the Blood Rain Tavern, it was a super expert within the Ancient Blood Rain Nation who took action and killed the group of experts causing the massacre.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Rain Tavern knew nothing about this super expert, but Cha Ran Gu vaguely realized that this might be related to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the time of this great battle coincided with when Lin Yuan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this incident happened after he mentioned it to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about the horrific traces on the battlefield described in the intelligence from the Blood Rain Tavern made Cha Ran Gu's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Was that really the strength a human could possess?</p><p></p><p>"I need to continue my seclusion."</p><p>"Unless it's an important matter, don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Cha Ran Gu and instructed.</p><p></p><p>Cha Ran Gu's emotional fluctuations were like an open book to Lin Yuan, clear as day.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Caring about it? Even if the mysterious powerful being from the ancient Blood Rain nation was exposed, so what if it was himself? </p><p></p><p>His current identity at the Luochuan gathering place had no connection to his identity as the Galactic Sovereign of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>If exposed, then so be it. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan did not feel that Chalian Valley dared to spread their guesses.</p><p></p><p>A world where the illusory and the real alternated.</p><p></p><p>Nine auras burst out, forming nine towering figures - they were the nine strongest beings of human civilization. </p><p></p><p>"With the human tribe's priceless treasure 'Virtual Universe', we can replicate that two-dimensional world. Even if it's only one or two-tenths similar, it's enough for us to deduce the cultivation method," said the Butterfly Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>The 'white paper' from the Taiyuan Ruins was profoundly mysterious. Even Supreme Beings dared not let it absorb them into that two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But just because the Supreme Beings dared not take the risk themselves did not mean there was no way.</p><p></p><p>For example, human civilization could use the 'Virtual Universe' to simulate the two-dimensional world within the white paper. Then the Supreme Beings could enter and comprehend the essence of its power.</p><p></p><p>The 'Virtual Universe' was one of the foundations of human civilization, able to replicate and simulate even the myriad rules of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>It was true that the two-dimensional world within the white paper was completely restrained, leaking hardly any aura. But the human tribe's priceless treasure 'Virtual Universe' could still replicate it through the slightest traces of aura.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the two-dimensional world replicated by the 'Virtual Universe' was far inferior to the real two-dimensional world, with only one or two-tenths similarity.</p><p></p><p>But that was enough.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings could enter it freely. With the height of their ultimate existence, even one percent similarity would allow them to deduce many things.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>"That old monster from the Stellar Alliance fused a Supreme weapon into that little Four Celestial Kings, allowing him to be nearly invincible in the two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>"Now we have activated the 'Virtual Universe' to deduce the cultivation method for the human civilization's evolutionary beings."</p><p></p><p>"So far, we have clearly deduced the cultivation method up to the sixteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm," said the Virtual God Supreme Being with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method they had deduced had no limitations and should provide considerable help to the human evolutionary beings in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it could serve as a 'guiding light' to accelerate the cultivation speed of the human civilization's evolutionary beings.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I need to go teach those juniors."</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme Being's figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Supreme Beings looked at each other, then gradually disappeared as well.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Summer Qin Supreme Being wants me to see him?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Over these past hundred years, Summer Qin Supreme Being must have been preoccupied with something to rarely take the initiative to contact him.</p><p></p><p>"There must be something going on."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately connected his consciousness to the virtual world, entering Summer Qin Supreme Being's personal world.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being," Lin Yuan bowed to Summer Qin Supreme Being seated on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan," Summer Qin Supreme Being looked at Lin Yuan, a smile appearing on his face. "How is your cultivation going in the two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>In just over a hundred years, Lin Yuan had caught up to the legendary eleventh-stage perfected beings, so it was indeed not bad.</p><p></p><p>One had to know that any special life able to cross into the eleventh perfected stage had extraordinary talents and gifts that made them unique existences in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will expound to you the cultivation method after the Shaman Ancestor realm," Summer Qin Supreme Being went straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Being will teach the cultivation method after the Shaman Ancestor realm?" Lin Yuan was slightly stunned, his expression becoming expectant.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how the Supreme Being deduced the post-Shaman Ancestor cultivation method without personally experiencing the essence of power within the two-dimensional world, Summer Qin Supreme Being clearly had great confidence in saying this.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Shaman Ancestor realm starts from the first level."</p><p></p><p>Summer Qin Supreme Being quickly expounded the cultivation methods from the first to sixth levels.</p><p></p><p>"How about it?" Summer Qin Supreme Being looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, could you go deeper?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment. What Summer Qin Supreme Being had expounded from the first to sixth levels did give Lin Yuan some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>But the inspiration was not great, since Lin Yuan was already at the nineteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the cultivation methods compiled by Vice-Sect Master Nalan had allowed Lin Yuan to smoothly break through to the nineteenth level. That was because it was the final push after accumulating layer upon layer.</p><p></p><p>Even without Vice-Sect Master Nalan's compiled methods, Lin Yuan would have soon broken through to the nineteenth level anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Go deeper?" Summer Qin Supreme Being was a bit dazed, but did not hesitate to continue expounding the cultivation methods from the seventh to fourteenth levels of the Shaman Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could you go even deeper?" Lin Yuan said solemnly after listening. The seventh to fourteenth level methods did provide great enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But it was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Even deeper?" Summer Qin Supreme Being's brow twitched. Even the fourteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm was not deep enough?</p><p></p><p>However, since Lin Yuan wanted to hear something more profound, Summer Qin Supreme Being did not say much and simply expounded the essence of power from the fifteenth to sixteenth levels of the Shaman Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could you continue going deeper?" Lin Yuan asked insightfully after listening.</p><p></p><p>"Deeper still?" Summer Qin Supreme Being could not help but say, "What level of cultivation method do you want to hear?"</p><p></p><p>"What level? Do you have the twentieth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm?" Lin Yuan looked at Summer Qin Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>"The twentieth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm?" Summer Qin Supreme Being was stunned in disbelief, staring at Lin Yuan for a while before falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 481: Entering the Origin of the Immortal Realm (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the disciples on the scene immediately bowed and responded.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao, they had absolute obedience. They had planned to have the Patriarch of the Martial Dao come and apologize, feeling that the majesty of their Patriarch had been affected.</p><p></p><p>"Remember this," the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao said, and then his figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has emerged from seclusion?" After a long while, a few disciples finally raised their heads and looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Even though the ferocity of the recent Immortal-Demon War was unprecedented, with three consecutive Immortal Cities being breached by demonic beasts, the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao had never emerged from seclusion, nor had he intervened to resolve those demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao had actively emerged from seclusion?</p><p></p><p>What was the reason?</p><p></p><p>Were they just about to suppress the Patriarch of the Martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Could the rumors outside be true?" A disciple had this thought in his mind. The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao had appeared in person and warned them not to have any overstepping behavior towards the Patriarch of the Martial Dao, although he did not explain the reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>But the many peak-level Jade Immortals on the scene had extremely powerful divine sense, and they were fully capable of deducing numerous reasons from this order.</p><p></p><p>And among all the deductions, there was one conclusion:</p><p></p><p>That the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao was extremely wary of the Patriarch of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's high level of methods, how could he appear in person just to issue a warning? Not to mention that the Patriarch of the Martial Dao indeed had some arrogant aspects.</p><p></p><p>And the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's wariness further indicated that this Patriarch of the Martial Dao was an existence on the same level as the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Martial Dao..." The direct disciple let out a long sigh of relief. It was only at this moment that he realized what he had just done, actually demanding that an existence on the same level as his Patriarch come and apologize?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was stopped by his Patriarch, otherwise, even if he had the protection of his Patriarch, he would probably never be able to leave the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Caowu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spent half a day's worth of effort to expound on the essence of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>While expounding, he was also reunderstanding the Martial Dao himself, especially the nine-tenths of the Martial Dao Eleven Realms that he had already opened up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Martial Patriarch, for your guidance," the many Jade Immortals below paid their respects with the utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>If before they came to Caowu Immortal City, their awe towards the Martial Patriarch stemmed from his unmatched strength, then now, the awe of all the Jade Immortals was towards the Martial Patriarch himself.</p><p></p><p>Even though they cultivated paths other than the Martial Dao, since the Great Dao was the same in essence, with Lin Yuan's understanding of the Dao rules, he could still bring them no small amount of help, even if their paths were different.</p><p></p><p>"You may all return now," Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the Jade Immortals felt a shift in space and time, and in the blink of an eye, they found themselves outside Caowu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao that the Martial Patriarch expounded is indeed also a great Dao that leads to the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, I feel that it is in no way inferior to the Immortal Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, our paths are already set, otherwise we could have tried to walk the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Many Jade Immortals had excited expressions, not knowing if it was just their imagination, but they felt that listening to Lin Yuan's discourse this time was of greater help to them than listening to the discourses of the Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>When facing the discourses of the Dao Patriarch, they would often encounter things they did not understand, but the Martial Patriarch's discourses? Every word was spoken in the most common and easy-to-understand manner.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Patriarch, remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"The second Dao Patriarch of our Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>One Jade Immortal after another was certain in their hearts that prior to today, the Immortal Realm had only one Dao Patriarch, and the Demon Abyss also had one Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But after today, the Martial Patriarch would become the second Dao Patriarch of the Immortal Realm, and the third Dao Patriarch of the Immortal Realm and the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Caowu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Spending half a day's time to lecture the many Jade Immortals was just a projection of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"A few more lectures, and the Martial Dao should be able to take firm root in the Immortal Realm," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The ones he lectured were all Jade Immortals, and only by getting these powerful ones to recognize the Martial Dao, without the interference of Dao Patriarch-level external forces, could the Martial Dao flourish rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"The Twelve Realms?" Lin Yuan's gaze was deep, vaguely seeing the long river of time in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as long as he wished, he could leap out of the long river of time at any time and try to assault the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>With the Seven Layers of Spatial-Temporal Realm, combined with Lin Yuan's many foundations, such as the Heart of Time, Lin Yuan had a feeling that his chances of assaulting the Ultimate would be very high.</p><p></p><p>"But there is still the possibility of failure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, even though the possibility was high, it was still just a possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Assaulting the Ultimate in the Immortal Realm is no different from assaulting the Ultimate in the Main Universe, and there may even be some hidden dangers since I was not born in the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed had the idea of assaulting the Ultimate in the Immortal Realm, but the significance was not great.</p><p></p><p>No matter whether it was in the Immortal Realm or in the Main Universe, as long as the assault failed, he would still die.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not know whether his spiritual will could escape into the Myriad Realms Gate at the moment of ultimate failure and survive, but it was never wrong to make the worst-case scenario plans.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a long sigh, as long as he could comprehend the Chaos Rules, combined with Lin Yuan's current foundations, not only would he be able to steadily and firmly cross into the Ultimate, but the probability would also be much higher than it is now.</p><p></p><p>And to comprehend the Chaos Rules at the Eleventh Realm of Life, would bring tremendous benefits to his own transformation, especially when breaking through in the Main Universe, where he would be subjected to the baptism of the Chaos Void Origin, with the ability of the Chaos Rules, this origin baptism would be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Teacher."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have seen the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, Shan Yang, Nie Yun, and others stood respectfully below.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Immortal Realm, they had adapted to this fact over a considerable period of time.</p><p></p><p>"I have reshaped your physical bodies for you, and your cultivation path will be easier in the future," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's current realm and power, reshaping physical bodies was as simple as a single thought, able to mobilize the power of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, reshaping the physical body was just that - reshaping the physical body. To progress further on the martial dao path, to reach the Ninth, Tenth, or even Eleventh Realms, one still had to rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>A powerful physical constitution could only raise the starting point, but as for how far one ultimately went, that was not so important.</p><p></p><p>Among the dozens of Twelfth Realm experts in the Macro-Universe, the majority came from ordinary groups, and there was only one who had attained the Twelfth Realm with a unique life form.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Twelfth Realm powerhouses in the Star Alliance were ordinary special life forms.</p><p></p><p>"We obey the Martial Ancestor's command," Li Qing and the others responded immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Go down now," Lin Yuan waved his hand, watching as Li Qing and the others left.</p><p></p><p>"Parents." Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, and the situations of Jun Dongjin and the others appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Qing and the others, who were at the pinnacle of the Eighth Realm, Jun Dongjin had only reached the Refining Void Realm when he died.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Immortal Realm, he needed much more time to adapt than Li Qing and the others.</p><p></p><p>"This is the most I can do," Lin Yuan thought to himself. He had gone against the flow to revive his twice-traversed relatives and reshape their physical bodies, extending their lifespans by millions of years.</p><p></p><p>To go further, there was not much more Lin Yuan could do.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to the Source of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared and reappeared beneath the irregular rift in the Immortal Abode area.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, Lin Yuan planned to enter the Source of the Immortal Realm to experience it, and had even informed the Ancestor of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's avatar immediately entered the irregular rift.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the irregular rift was the passage to the Source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this passage was extremely dangerous, with numerous time-space storms. Even the most supreme Jade Immortals would face life-and-death peril if they rashly entered.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was not a Jade Immortal. Even before reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, he had the strength to enter the Source through the irregular rift.</p><p></p><p>However, out of respect for the Ancestor of the Dao, he had not done so.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his comprehension of the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, there was naturally no problem.</p><p></p><p>Rumble~</p><p></p><p>The passage of the irregular rift stretched as far as the eye could see, filled with a terrifying time-space storm maze.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan strolled leisurely, and all the turbulent time-space forces became incredibly calm as they approached within a hundred meters of him.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan walked through the irregular rift, the passage to the Source of the Immortal Realm was initially extremely narrow, but the deeper he went, the more spacious it became.</p><p></p><p>"Fluctuations of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Even before entering the Source of the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan could feel the vast Dao fluctuations rushing towards him, and various Dao principles were displayed before his eyes, with the details of their operations flooding his mind.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, feeling as if his inspirations had exploded.</p><p></p><p>Most of his enlightenments essentially came from the fusion of other pillar-level Dao principles, but as for the Time-Space Fusion Dao? That was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Time-Space Fusion Dao had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>This limit was not Lin Yuan's limit, but the limit of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Beyond this? It was beyond what one could comprehend while residing in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Gold? The Dao of the Five Elements? The Dao of the Five Element Cycle?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Infinite, the Dao of Space, the Dao of Infinite Space?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Extreme Point Chaos?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Material Illusion?"</p><p></p><p>One pillar-level Dao after another poured into Lin Yuan's mind, many of which he had never encountered before, now surging forth like rivers entering the sea.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, as you sense the essence fluctuations of myriad Dao principles, greatly enhancing your understanding of the Dao of the Five Element Cycle.】</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, as you sense the essence fluctuations of myriad Dao principles, greatly enhancing your understanding of the Dao of Infinite Space.】</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, as you sense the essence fluctuations of myriad Dao principles, greatly enhancing your understanding of the Dao of Extreme Point Chaos.】</p><p></p><p>Endless inspirations burst forth, and various Dao principles began to interweave and collide on Lin Yuan's body, causing the turbulent time-space forces around him to quickly calm down.</p><p></p><p>The Source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao was waiting for Lin Yuan to arrive.</p><p></p><p>He and the Ancestor of the Abyss were one and the same, so the Ancestor of the Abyss agreeing with Lin Yuan meant the Ancestor of the Dao had also agreed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if the Ancestor of the Dao did not agree, it would have no impact, as the Ancestor of the Abyss, despite his utmost efforts, could not touch Lin Yuan in the slightest, and the Ancestor of the Dao would likely be the same.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor has entered?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao had personally opened the irregular rifts leading to the Source of the Immortal Realm, and he was intimately familiar with each one, immediately sensing Lin Yuan's avatar entering the irregular rift.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Why has he stopped?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao had waited patiently for a while, but found that Lin Yuan had not yet entered the Source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao was puzzled, gazing towards the stationary Lin Yuan, whose body was displaying the collision and manifestation of many Dao principles, as if he was about to give birth to a primal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Has he attained enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't even entered the Source of the Immortal Realm, and he's already attained enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao fell silent.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>On the nine great thrones, the nine supremely powerful beings looked at Lin Yuan, their expressions rarely showing astonishment. </p><p></p><p>He comprehended the fusion rules of space-time?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehended the fusion rules of space-time?</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's displayed talent and aptitude, he had already penetrated the rules of time at the ninth stage. </p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful ones like Xia Qin did not doubt that Lin Yuan could comprehend the fusion rules of space-time.</p><p></p><p>For most eleventh stage evolved beings, the space-time fusion that consumed billions of years was not considered too big of a bottleneck for a human genius like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The supreme ones' expectations of Lin Yuan were for him to reach the ultimate realm, standing alongside them as a towering pillar of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But the nine supreme ones never thought that Lin Yuan would comprehend the fusion rules of space-time so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Too fast.</p><p></p><p>Faster than any of the supreme ones had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan penetrated the rules of time, Xia Qin had given him a hand, bringing him to the 'shore' of the river of time to behold its full appearance.  </p><p></p><p>Now he had comprehended the fusion rules of space-time on his own?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had not been long since Lin Yuan entered the tenth stage. Although he experienced over ten thousand years in the two-dimensional world, there were no fluctuations of rules in that lower dimensional world, making it impossible to comprehend the rules of space and time.</p><p></p><p>"You really comprehended the fusion rules of space-time?" The Supreme Virtual God asked in some surprise, unable to hold back his inquiry.</p><p></p><p>Space and time were fundamentally the two highest pillar rules. The Virtual God Supreme was adept at space, and his attainments in time were also formidable.</p><p></p><p>"By chance," Lin Yuan replied, his mind subtly moving to wield the fused power of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the explosive increase in his physical body and soul, outsiders could hardly accurately discern the depth of his comprehension of rules unless he deliberately revealed it.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed the fusion rules of space-time," the nine supreme ones confirmed with just a glance that Lin Yuan had fully grasped the fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Xia Qin said with some helplessness. Originally he had wanted to guide Lin Yuan on some methods to comprehend the space-time fusion rules, but now it seemed there was no need.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have already comprehended the fusion rules of space-time, there is indeed no need to go observe the full appearance of the river of time," the Butterfly Supreme said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Observing the full river of time only had a catalyzing effect for penetrating the rules of time and comprehending the space-time fusion rules. Anything more would have a much more limited impact. After comprehending the space-time fusion rules, one's future cultivation still relied on oneself, with outside forces having very limited influence.</p><p></p><p>"At your current level of life, comprehending the space-time fusion rules is indeed rare, but you cannot be arrogant or complacent. To reach the apex, comprehending the space-time fusion rules is just the beginning. You need to continually comprehend the space-time fusion rules, elevating them to the second, third, and even fifth level," Xia Qin cautioned conventionally, not knowing what else to say.</p><p></p><p>To reach the ultimate realm, the prerequisite was to comprehend the space-time fusion rules to the fifth level. The time and effort required to progress from the first to the fifth level was incalculable.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's words caused the other eight supreme ones' thoughts to subtly shift. The tenth stage had comprehended the space-time fusion rules, yet he could not be arrogant? Then what about them? Including Xia Qin, none of the nine supreme ones had comprehended the space-time fusion rules at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin was right. Comprehending the space-time fusion rules was just the beginning. The true bottlenecks lay ahead from the second to the fifth level, where many ancient celestial beings who had lived for untold eons were stuck.</p><p></p><p>However, what the nine supreme ones did not know was that Lin Yuan had the comprehension of the space-time fusion rules from the mighty beings of myriad races. In this aspect, reaching the fifth level posed no difficulty, not even requiring much time if he progressed step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true goal was the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules. Only the twelfth stage ultimate realm could truly capture Lin Yuan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"From this perspective, you indeed do not need to go to the 'shore' again," the Ancient Force Supreme said.</p><p></p><p>"However, since the two-dimensional world was helpful, what reward would you like?"</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's treasury recorded numerous treasures and marvels, including some at the twelfth stellar realm level.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave it to the supreme ones' discretion," Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>He did not know what to choose, but as ultimate existences, the supreme ones would certainly not let him be shortchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Leave it to us?" The Ancient Force Supreme exchanged glances with the other eight supreme ones.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense the nine supreme ones were likely communicating silently.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xia Qin spoke, his expression slightly grave: "Although you are only at the tenth stage now, you should consider reaching for the ultimate realm. This marvel should be quite suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Xia Qin's right hand, a hazy universe appeared before him. This hazy universe then rapidly shrank until it became a bead that flew towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>The bead floated slowly, yet Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, sensing it was like a vast universe.</p><p></p><p>"This is a micro-universe? No, it's even more realistic than a micro-universe," Lin Yuan had seen many treasures and marvels, and only the micro-universe was most similar to this bead. </p><p></p><p>But it was only similar. Although the micro-universe had complete space-time rules operating within, it was ultimately an inanimate object. But this bead before him seemed to come alive.</p><p></p><p>"This marvel is called the 'Origin of the Universe'. It can aid your inner world in metamorphosing into an inner universe," Xia Qin explained the bead's function.</p><p></p><p>"Aid the inner world in metamorphosing into an inner universe?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.  </p><p></p><p>To reach the ultimate realm, one's inner world would transform towards an inner universe, but for the world to metamorphose into a universe - the gap was immense, equivalent to the leap from one to ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million.</p><p></p><p>This bead that could aid the inner world's metamorphosis into an inner universe was a priceless treasure that could drive the peak eleventh stage ancient celestial beings in the vast cosmos insane.</p><p></p><p>"This...this is too precious," Lin Yuan said. Although he possessed many twelfth stellar realm treasures, weapons and artifacts, these were ultimately external objects.</p><p></p><p>Only by personally stepping into the twelfth stage realm was fundamental.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a matter of preciousness," Xia Qin shook his head. "Take it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan immediately received the 'Origin of the Universe'.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, let Butterfly send you back."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan. This third critical ground of human civilization was surrounded by a space-time labyrinth that Lin Yuan could not leave on his own.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan left, the nine supreme ones looked at each other again on the field.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, how did you discover this kid?"</p><p></p><p>"His talent is too terrifying. Comprehending the space-time fusion rules at the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I feel like if he goes into seclusion again, he might reach the ultimate realm."</p><p></p><p>The supreme ones conversed in low tones, their words carrying a tone of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main galaxy star, Lin Yuan's solar yuan spirit appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned his surroundings, his expression contemplative. "I can sense that the coordinates of the third critical ground are located within layers of profound space, similar to but not as thoroughly concealed as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, no need to think about it anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form vanished, reappearing inside the Stellar Master Palace.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>The Origin of the Universe flew out, stopping before his true body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Since the Origin of the Universe could aid his inner world in metamorphosing into an inner universe, it would naturally be used on his true body and soul first.</p><p></p><p>As for his lunar and solar yuan spirits, as long as Lin Yuan could cross into the ultimate realm, the two yuan spirits could successively metamorphose, and their inner worlds could also evolve into inner universes.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin of the Universe?" Lin Yuan carefully examined the bead before him.</p><p></p><p>At the supreme ones' place, Lin Yuan did not have a good opportunity to observe it closely.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no such need.</p><p></p><p>"According to Xia Qin, to utilize the Origin of the Universe, I only need to bring it into my inner world, then control my world force to interact with it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began trying it out.</p><p></p><p>Shua la la.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's will descended into his inner world, accompanied by the Origin of the Universe.</p><p></p><p>"My inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly scanned it. His inner world was vast, with a towering ancient tree tens of millions of zhang tall swaying at the center, faintly emanating a special aura that stabilized everything within the inner world.</p><p></p><p>It was the World Tree, an eleventh stage supreme marvel that had the effect of stabilizing the inner world.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the World Tree...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The world tree within his body was evolving towards an inner universe, which could also provide benefits, but the effects were too small to be noticed.</p><p></p><p>"In a few hundred years, my world tree should be able to bear the world fruit," Lin Yuan observed. Normally, for a world tree to take root and bear fruit, it would take at least a million years or even tens of millions of years. </p><p></p><p>However, the foundation of Lin Yuan's inner world was too profound. In just two hundred years, the world tree had gone through a growth cycle spanning hundreds of millions or even tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and began manipulating the power of the world, making contact with the source of the universe before him.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The moment the power of the world touched the source of the universe, scenes of the universe's creation emerged in Lin Yuan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The fist-sized source of the universe suddenly exploded, turning into countless particles of dust, then reforming into a scene of the starry universe, gradually merging into Lin Yuan's inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>As the creator of his inner world, Lin Yuan was the first to sense the changes within it. The originally vast inner world had instantly become profound and ancient, as if it had experienced endless eons, from the creation of the universe until now.</p><p></p><p>"Is this...the foundation of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was inexplicably shaken. The size of his inner world and the layers of space represented only the spatial foundation. But now, Lin Yuan clearly felt that the temporal foundation of his inner world had changed, significantly enhanced, as if it had existed for a vast span of time.</p><p></p><p>For his inner world to evolve into an inner universe, spatial foundation alone was not enough - the temporal foundation was equally indispensable. </p><p></p><p>In terms of spatial foundation, Lin Yuan's inner world could not even match that of an eleventh-stage cultivator. But in terms of temporal foundation? It was rather ordinary. This could become a fatal flaw when he attempted to reach the ultimate stage.</p><p></p><p>But now, after the integration of the source of the universe, the temporal foundation of Lin Yuan's inner world had been supplemented. From then on, time and space became unified.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme beings must have noticed that my cultivation time was too short and my temporal foundation was lacking, which is why they gave me this source of the universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt immensely grateful. This source of the universe had helped him tremendously.</p><p></p><p>"With my current depth of space and length of time, when I reach the eleventh stage and receive another infusion of the primordial essence of chaos and void, perhaps I can elevate my inner world to a level close to an inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered silently. The supreme beings had bestowed the source of the universe to make up for Lin Yuan's shortcoming in temporal foundation, but they could never have imagined that the spatial foundation of Lin Yuan's inner world was already terrifyingly profound.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his current inner world was not yet his limit. The fusion of space-time rules was only the first level. After the fifth level, his inner world would become even more perfect and complete.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the Sun Primordial Spirit sat cross-legged, with various wondrous objects - the twelve stellar treasures and weapons - laid out before him.</p><p></p><p>"The parts of these treasures and weapons that are of no use to me can be reverted to their primordial essence, used to nurture the Primordial Bell, or even serve as resources for my cultivation of the 'Xuanhuang Physique'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Supreme weapons were powerful, but not every one of them suited Lin Yuan. In terms of compatibility, no weapon could match the Primordial Bell, which was made of primordial spirit gold and had been nurtured by Lin Yuan, perfectly suiting his own nature.</p><p></p><p>The only downside was that compared to supreme weapons, the level of the Primordial Bell was slightly lower, but the impact was not significant. Lin Yuan possessed the primordial essence and could revert all things to their purest, most primordial form of power. He could then continue slowly nurturing the Primordial Bell until it became a supreme weapon itself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this could only be done after Lin Yuan reached the eleventh stage. The twelve stellar treasures were such extraordinary existences that they could not be reverted simply by wishing it.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the Milky Way, after observing the changes in his inner world for a while, Lin Yuan took out the rule comprehension light cluster again and immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Apart from normal rule comprehension, Lin Yuan was also gradually perfecting the Tenth Stage of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"The key to the Tenth Stage of Martial Arts lies in the physical body, the soul, the spiritual will - returning to the root, only with a solid foundation can one's potential be greater."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continuously observed the physical bodies and souls of the special lifeforms in the depths of the cosmic starry sky. Normally, these special lifeforms were rare, some even unique in the vast universe. Their physical bodies were profound, their soul essences, their innate talents and abilities - even supreme beings could not fully perceive them.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the four light clusters given to him by the half-meter-tall old man, Lin Yuan could clearly sense every aspect of these special lifeforms, which greatly aided in perfecting the Tenth Stage of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that each of these unique special lifeforms was a favored child of the universe. Everything about them was bestowed by the universe, approaching the great way.</p><p></p><p>By using these special lifeforms' physical bodies and souls as a reference to perfect the Tenth Stage of Martial Arts, Lin Yuan was treading a path with an extremely high ceiling, one that would never lead to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>It was akin to standing at the level of the universe and creating an evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, Lin Yuan and Vice-Summit Lord Nalan sat casually. During breaks from cultivation, Lin Yuan would enter the virtual world to relax, though only a sliver of his consciousness, not interrupting his normal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Those alien experts really suffered this time when the two-dimensional world collapsed, especially the Four Divine Kings - they even lost the supreme weapons most suited to them in there."</p><p></p><p>Vice-Summit Lord Nalan gloated a little. Although his avatar had also perished in the two-dimensional world, suffering a fundamental loss, he had been compensated to some degree by the human civilization afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Among the eleven wondrous objects Lin Yuan had returned to the supreme beings, some were used to make up for the losses suffered by the human evolutionary cultivators, who had also contributed to finding those objects. The human civilization naturally would not shortchange them.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it was quite miserable," Lin Yuan nodded. Originally, the Four Divine Kings were the top experts below the supreme beings. But now, they had lost a supreme weapon perfectly suited to them.</p><p></p><p>Both the Stellar Alliance and the human civilization, as well as the Insect Alliance, had acquired many supreme weapons. However, for lifeforms below the supreme beings, finding a supreme weapon suited to them was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>With the loss of that supreme weapon, even if the Four Divine Kings were bestowed new supreme weapons by the Stellar Alliance, they could never recover their peak strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with their avatars perishing in the two-dimensional world, they would permanently lose part of their spiritual will, which would also greatly impact their strength.</p><p></p><p>The two factors combined meant that although the Four Divine Kings could not be considered mediocre, they could no longer compare to existences like the 'Mother of Realms'.</p><p></p><p>They might even have to indefinitely postpone their attempt to reach the ultimate stage, which would lower their chances of eventually becoming ultimate beings, no matter how long they delayed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Four Divine Kings, many other special lifeforms and alien experts had also suffered tremendous losses, at least fundamentally losing part of their spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the physical body, which could be enhanced through wondrous treasures, spiritual will could not be easily increased. To augment the intensity of spiritual will would require immense effort. A permanent loss of part of it would be more devastating the stronger the lifeform.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so what if they're alien experts or unique special lifeforms? Didn't they still get beaten by our human Blood Rain?" </p><p></p><p>"Among all the powerful races competing in that two-dimensional world, only our human Blood Rain emerged victorious in the end."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Vice-Summit Lord Nalan's face. Although the human civilization had not publicly announced that Blood Rain had successfully escaped the two-dimensional world, even the human evolutionary cultivators had guessed that Blood Rain must have survived.</p><p></p><p>The alien experts also had similar speculations, but could only speculate. As the pinnacle race with nine supreme beings standing guard, the other alien races, no matter their losses, did not dare provoke the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly, and two and a half years passed in a blink.</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the Milky Way, Lin Yuan sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>"What is the physical body? What is the soul?"</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts emerged in Lin Yuan's mind. The profound physical bodies, innate talents and abilities of the powerful experts from all races had converged within Lin Yuan's heart, forming the foundation of the Tenth Stage of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face: "The Tenth Stage of Martial Arts is complete."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

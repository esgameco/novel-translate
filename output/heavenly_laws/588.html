        <h1>Chapter 588</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This power?" </p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King's pupils contracted in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He was still puzzled as to why Lin Yuan did not join forces with him to fight against the Spiritual Deity King, when he saw this earth-shattering strike.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Grand Primarch of the Milky Way, on par with the core imperial clans that have reached their limits in growth? Or is the Grand Primarch of the Milky Way himself a core imperial clan that has reached its limit in growth?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King was filled with doubt and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strike had already proven his own strength, and even if the Crimson Jade King exerted his full power, he would not be able to unleash such a strike.</p><p></p><p>In theory, a normal Grand Primarch, even without relying on the power of the ancestral bloodline, could have the potential to rival a core imperial clan that has reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>But that was just a theory.</p><p></p><p>Such Grand Primarchs are rarer than Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The core imperial clans that have reached their limits can only reach that step by relying on the power of the ancestral bloodline. How could a normal Grand Primarch reach that level? Therefore,</p><p></p><p>the Crimson Jade King was more inclined to believe that Lin Yuan was a core imperial clan that had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>And the Blazing Sun Divine Body's Blazing Sun World that Lin Yuan just displayed was clearly his own.</p><p></p><p>"A core imperial clan of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country that has wandered outside?" the Crimson Jade King thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Country has existed for countless years, and some of the core imperial clans that have already reached their limits often choose to venture out and travel through various ancient countries, in an attempt to break through the shackles that prevent core imperial clans from becoming Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The resources and heritage of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country cannot show them the hope of further advancement, so they seek to draw upon the power and heritage of other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Of course, such core imperial clans are extremely rare, as the number of core imperial clans is already scarce, and the number of those who have reached their limits and plan to travel through the major ancient countries is even fewer.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King gazed at Lin Yuan, his thoughts in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He had the same conjecture as the Crimson Jade King - that Lin Yuan was a limit-reaching core imperial clan from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country who was traveling outside.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that he passed through the Cyan Burning Domain, just happened to coincide with the Spiritual Might King's war, just happened to arrive when the Spiritual Deity King revealed his full strength, just happened... so many coincidences that if even one of them had not occurred, this would not have happened.</p><p></p><p>"My luck is really bad," the Spiritual Deity King thought helplessly. With so many coincidences, if even one had not aligned, he would not have encountered this.</p><p></p><p>"This has become troublesome."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King looked at Lin Yuan. If the other party was a limit-reaching core imperial clan on par with him, then the plan to invade the Cyan Burning Domain was basically doomed to fail.</p><p></p><p>Not only would it fail, but the Violet Dream Domain also had to be on guard against being invaded by the Cyan Burning Domain, after all, in addition to Lin Yuan, there was also the Crimson Jade King.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Jade King had not reached the limit, he was still not someone a peak Grand Primarch could match. At the moment, the Violet Dream Domain did not have any experts capable of holding back the Crimson Jade King.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way is actually a core imperial clan of my ancient country? And one that has reached the limit at that?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Grand Primarchs of the Cyan Burning Domain looked at each other, they could also feel the power of Lin Yuan's strike just now. Being Grand Primarchs with such keen eyesight, they immediately made a similar conjecture.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the only conjecture that could somewhat logically explain the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>"Cyan Burning, I never expected you to have such an opportunity," said a peak Grand Primarch, looking at the Cyan Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>As for the teacher-disciple relationship between Lin Yuan and the Cyan Burning Marquis? It was nothing more than this limit-reaching core imperial clan hiding his identity while wandering the mortal realm, and perhaps having some arrangement with the Cyan Burning Marquis to temporarily reside in Cyan Burning City.</p><p></p><p>"I..." The Cyan Burning Marquis blinked his eyes, unable to help but have some self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>"I have reached the limit of my own growth, but have never fought against other ancient country's limit-reaching core imperial clans before."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King stared at Lin Yuan, a hint of battle intent flickering in his eyes. At this moment, he had abandoned thoughts of victory or defeat in the war, and only wanted to have a good fight with Lin Yuan, this limit-reaching core imperial clan of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Spiritual Deity King was not inclined to get involved in wars of low intensity. If it were not for the Spiritual Might King's involvement, he would not have even come.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had encountered an opponent on the same level, with the war destined to end in failure, the Spiritual Deity King began to crave a fierce battle with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His previous fight with the Crimson Jade King was not even considered a warm-up, far inferior to the suppressing strike Lin Yuan had just unleashed by activating the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way, take my strike."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King extended his right hand, and a silver longsword appeared in it, lightly slashing towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A trace of extremely subtle sword light flashed and tore through the chaotic space-time, striking towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood still, the Blazing Sun Divine Body automatically activated, and the closer it came, the more intense the scorching heat became, forming layers of scorching space-time.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The collision between the sword light and the scorching heat sent shockwaves in all directions, sweeping across countless miles.</p><p></p><p>This strike was the Spiritual Deity King's full power, and the magnitude of its power was such that even the aftershocks caused the distant Crimson Jade King to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the battle between limit-reaching core imperial clans?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King's expression was solemn. He had sparred with limit-reaching core imperial clans of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country before, but that was among clansmen, and the other party naturally would not use their full strength.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks continued to spread further, causing the distant Grand Primarchs watching to tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of limit-reaching core imperial clans?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they can contend with Celestial Lords for a few moves."</p><p></p><p>These Grand Primarchs couldn't help but think, among the Celestial Lords, the limit-reaching core imperial clans are the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the basic understanding between the many ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what's blocking me?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King held a silver longsword and looked at the motionless Lin Yuan, slashing out another strike.</p><p></p><p>The radiant sword light bursting from this strike divided into two, then four, then eight.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the sky and earth around the Spiritual Deity King were completely filled with dense, silver sword light.</p><p></p><p>"Rise." The endless silver sword light formed a grand formation, converging towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Try a different move, these methods can't harm me."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan lightly waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Body activated once more, the terrifying Scorching Sun World contracting, causing the endless silver sword light formation to rapidly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King sheathed the silver longsword, a vortex faintly emerging in his eyes as a soul-shaking impact descended.</p><p></p><p>"A soul attack method?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately sensed it, but his will of the soul was completely hidden in the depths of his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's inner universe was more vast than ever before, with the Source of the Scorching Sun enthroned at the center, the universe-space transformed by the "Infinite Void."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King's full-force soul will attack method was diluted and dispersed the moment it entered Lin Yuan's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"This guy." The Spiritual Deity King frowned, his soul consciousness attack method not only failed to shake Lin Yuan's will, it couldn't even have any effect, leaving the Spiritual Deity King unsure if it had any impact at all.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King no longer wanted to continue probing Lin Yuan's true abilities. Whether it was the two sword strikes he had just unleashed or the soul will attack, they were all meant to test Lin Yuan's true strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Spiritual Deity King was facing a peer-level ultimate core imperial clan member, so he naturally had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Next, is my strongest killing move."</p><p></p><p>As the Spiritual Deity King's words fell, his figure dissipated from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>In its place was endless "Spiritual Energy."</p><p></p><p>What is Spiritual Energy? It is a special type of energy that exists within all things. The ancestor of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation was the source of all Spiritual Energy in the world.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation was the eternal Scorching Sun high above, revered by all beings.</p><p></p><p>But the ancestor of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation was the Spiritual Energy of all things in the world, the source of all "Spiritual Energy," existing within all things.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I can feel the abundant 'Spiritual Energy' within you, merge with me!"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King's voice faintly resounded, having now transformed into the "Spiritual Energy" of the world, able to vaguely control the "Spiritual Energy" within all things.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the Spiritual Deity King was nearby, but could not pinpoint the exact location.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan also noticed his inner spiritual energy starting to become restless.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation's method of controlling the Spiritual Energy of all things?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. He had naturally heard of the abilities and methods of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation, which had long been at war with the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>However, with Lin Yuan's mastery of the physical body, he could be considered a perfect master. The Great Spiritual Ancient Nation's supreme expert wanted to control the "Spiritual Energy" within him, but simply could not achieve that.</p><p></p><p>Yet the method the Spiritual Deity King displayed had broken through the constraints, able to once again influence the Spiritual Energy within Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only an influence, still far from control.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lin Yuan could feel his inner spiritual energy becoming somewhat chaotic, starting to feel irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I don't want to play with you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had wanted to witness the abilities of the core imperial clan of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation, but now he had lost interest.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan activated the physical body divine art "World."</p><p></p><p>The invisible "World" descended, merging with the Scorching Sun World. In an instant, Lin Yuan's mastery of the surrounding space-time reached an unimaginable degree.</p><p></p><p>The power of the "World" divine art was determined by the size of the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's inner universe at this moment? Humming! Lin Yuan stood there, as if transformed into an eternal Scorching Sun, the light shining upon everything within his domain, the faint spiritual lights seemingly forced to appear, constantly converging and reforming the figure of the Spiritual Deity King.</p><p></p><p>"Me?" </p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King's expression became somewhat confused. His method of transforming into "Spiritual Energy" was not only highly powerful in attack, but also extremely troublesome. Even Celestial Supremes would have to put in some effort to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Directly forcing him out of the "Spiritual Energy" state? This was impossible!</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Great Spiritual core imperial clan are nothing special."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Spiritual Deity King, under the terrifying suppression of the "World" divine art, the Spiritual Deity King was unable to resist in the slightest, his physical body, soul, and will starting to crumble bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"This power?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible?!"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King struggled in disbelief, but to no avail, only able to watch himself gradually disappear.</p><p></p><p>"I've already reached the limit of my growth, the Supreme is invincible, how could this be, how could this be?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King stared at Lin Yuan, his expression filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>In this source world, among the many ancient nations, a core imperial clan that had grown to the limit was considered an invincible Supreme.</p><p>This was an iron rule, common sense.</p><p></p><p>"Invincible Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew the "World" divine art, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>You are the invincible Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Then what am I?

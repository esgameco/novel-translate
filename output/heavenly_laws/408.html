            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the towering and magnificent Door of the Myriad Realms. </p><p></p><p>He immediately realized that the fluctuation did not come from the Door of the Myriad Realms itself.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was transmitted from the many worlds connected to the Door of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Door of the Myriad Realms was merely a 'transit' point, merely a 'medium'.</p><p></p><p>"Which world did it come from?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the bottom of the Door of the Myriad Realms, where the coordinates of ten worlds were engraved in succession. </p><p></p><p>They were the nine worlds Lin Yuan had traversed before, and the Immortal Realm he had yet to descend upon.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure World?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze fell upon the world imprint of the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>The source of the fluctuation was indeed the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan descended upon the Azure World, that realm was facing an invasion from the Outer Realm Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan took control of a branch of the Primordial Demon Tree, which was the progenitor of the Outer Realm Demon Gods, eventually replacing the Primordial Demon Tree and becoming the Heavenly Dao of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>He became the absolute sovereign of that world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a deep impression of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Because the so-called Azure World was merely a small world in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure World was the paradise of the Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, at that time, Lin Yuan did not have enough time. After replacing the Heavenly Dao of the Azure World, the time he could stay was almost up.</p><p></p><p>He could not continue to explore the boundless void outside that world.</p><p></p><p>However, due to becoming the Heavenly Dao of the Azure World, and with the help of the remaining body of the Primordial Demon Tree,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could barely communicate between the two realms through the 'transit' of the Door of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Even without descending upon the Azure World, he could receive information and get a general idea of the situation there through the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>When he had just returned from the Azure World, Lin Yuan was still quite interested and often inquired about its development.</p><p></p><p>But as time went on, he let it go, except for receiving regular 'reports' from the Primordial Demon Tree at intervals, he did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The main body of the Primordial Demon Tree in the Azure World was actively transmitting information to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>According to the contingency plan Lin Yuan had left behind, it would only do so in an extremely urgent situation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness immediately began to receive the message from the Primordial Demon Tree along the coordinates of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"The Outer Realm Demon Gods are invading again?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative. The time flow ratio between the Azure World and the main cosmos was six hundred to one.</p><p></p><p>Six hundred years had passed in the Azure World, while only one year had passed in the main cosmos.</p><p></p><p>And it had been about three hundred years since Lin Yuan ended his traversal of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In other words, nearly twenty million years had passed in the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"Are those two Outer Realm Demon Gods invading the Azure World?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently. After replacing the Primordial Demon Tree, he had also received its 'relationship network'.</p><p></p><p>At that time, apart from the Primordial Demon Tree, there were two ancient Outer Realm Demon Gods lurking outside the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Behind these two Outer Realm Demon Gods, there were even more powerful Outer Realm Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan became the Heavenly Dao of the Azure World, he had some communication with these two Outer Realm Demon Gods and vaguely sensed that they seemed to have ill intentions towards him.</p><p></p><p>Because they had invited him more than once to explore a secret realm in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had directly refused, as he did not have much time left to stay and only wanted to guard the Azure World steadily.</p><p></p><p>As for the opportunity to explore the secret realms of the boundless void, the risk was too great, which did not align with Lin Yuan's set goals.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was wary of those two Outer Realm Demon Gods. The 'relationship' between Demon Gods was almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>If their strength allowed it, those two Outer Realm Demon Gods would unhesitatingly devour Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It has been tens of millions of years, why did they suddenly think of invading the Azure World?" Lin Yuan was slightly curious.</p><p></p><p>Demon Gods invading worlds also depended on the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>The Azure World had the Primordial Demon Tree stationed there, as well as many contingency plans left behind by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For those two Outer Realm Demon Gods to conquer the Azure World, they would inevitably have to pay a heavy price, which would be completely disproportionate to their gains.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, relying solely on those two Outer Realm Demon Gods, they would probably fail to conquer the Azure World. For the Primordial Demon Tree to contact Lin Yuan, they must have employed even higher-level means.</p><p></p><p>And such means were extremely precious, using them to invade the Azure World was simply not worth it.</p><p></p><p>"There must have been some changes in the Azure World during these tens of millions of years."</p><p></p><p>"Or some changes occurred in the boundless void, forcing those two Outer Realm Demon Gods to invade."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree had sent a distress signal, clearly stating that the situation in the Azure World had become extremely dire.</p><p></p><p>Far worse than when Lin Yuan had descended upon it and the Primordial Demon Tree was invading, the power of those two Outer Realm Demon Gods had already penetrated into the Azure World itself.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, if Lin Yuan turned a blind eye, the entire Azure World would change hands.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll descend once more."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yuan, there were still many unknown secrets in the Azure World, and many powerful and terrifying Demon Gods that devoured entire worlds.</p><p></p><p>Although the Azure World's upper limit was not high, the mysterious boundless void outside it had a much higher limit.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's speculation, even if the entire boundless void was not on par with the Immortal Realm, it was not far off. The strongest Demon Gods there might reach the peak of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan's decision to descend upon the Azure World again had three main considerations.</p><p></p><p>First, the Azure World was his backyard, where the path of martial cultivation was supreme, being the world with the most martial cultivators among all the worlds Lin Yuan had traversed.</p><p></p><p>After tens of millions of years of development, the martial cultivation system in the Azure World had become the only one, something other worlds could never achieve.</p><p></p><p>In other traversed worlds, Lin Yuan still had to consider the influence of the world consciousness, but in the Azure World? Lin Yuan himself was the world consciousness!</p><p></p><p>And within the Azure World, there were an incalculable number of martial cultivators, which would become a driving force for Lin Yuan's ultimate breakthrough in the future. He could not easily give up on them.</p><p></p><p>Second, he could take the opportunity to explore the secrets of the mysterious boundless void outside the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan had left the Azure World before, he was only at the seventh stage and lacked the strength to explore the vast and boundless void.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan had reached the tenth stage, a transcendent tenth stage on par with the peak of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>From the fourth level of the eleventh stage onwards, including the fifth level, they could all be considered the peak of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>As for the sixth level? That was the perfection of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, he might not be the strongest in the entire boundless void, but he would not be far off. It was a good opportunity to descend and take a look, while also taking advantage of the different time flow rates between the two realms to quickly comprehend the fifth boundary of the fusion of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>The final consideration was that the cost-effectiveness was too high.</p><p></p><p>With the status of the Heavenly Dao of the Azure World, Lin Yuan's connection between the two realms meant that if he chose to descend again, the Realm-Breaking Primal Essence he would expend would only be one-third of a strand.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>Not three strands.</p><p></p><p>Not even one strand.</p><p></p><p>But one-third of a strand.</p><p></p><p>One must know that if Lin Yuan chose to traverse again now, except for the Immortal Realm, he could only 'customize' his traversal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength was too high, and in the myriad heavens and realms, the countless dimensions, there were few worlds that could offer him any help.</p><p></p><p>If he chose to traverse randomly, he would probably gain nothing even after hundreds or thousands of attempts.</p><p></p><p>But the Azure World was just right. Although not on par with the Immortal Realm, it was cheap – only one-third of a strand of Realm-Breaking Primal Essence, what more could one ask for?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those Outer Realm Demon Gods possessed many innate abilities and authorities involving various profound rules. Last time in the Azure World, Lin Yuan could only study the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of quantity, this time he could capture more Outer Realm Demon Gods to study, which might help his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That was the boundless void, a dimension different from the main cosmos and even the void of chaos.</p><p></p><p>The difference between dimensions was something even those great existences approaching the perfection of time and life could hardly comprehend.</p><p></p><p>That blank space within the low-dimensional space was a product of the exploration of low-dimensional worlds by existences approaching the perfection of time and life.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Door of the Myriad Realms, Lin Yuan could study them freely, so he had to seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Since he had decided to descend upon the Azure World again, Lin Yuan made some preparations.</p><p></p><p>When traversing worlds, Lin Yuan's consciousness would leave through the Door of the Myriad Realms, and his physical body would become an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with the Door of the Myriad Realms maintaining it, even if Lin Yuan's consciousness was in other dimensional worlds, he could still sense the situation around his true body and primordial spirit. If necessary, he could completely terminate the traversal and forcibly return.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to the Gate of the Myriad Realms. </p><p></p><p>Actually, there was nothing that needed preparation. Lin Yuan had already fully comprehended the twelve guiding spaces of the black planet, and the avatars placed there had already returned.</p><p></p><p>So even if his spiritual will left, it would not cause any delay.</p><p></p><p>The few impacts were the avatar at the Xia You Evolution Pagoda, who was still comprehending that cosmic aurora.  </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had told the supreme expert Xia Qin earlier that due to his cultivation, he needed to recall all his avatars.</p><p></p><p>Within the avatars, there was a strand of spiritual will corresponding to the respective experts. To ensure their own state, recalling this strand of spiritual will was very common among human civilization cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the five light spheres of insights into the time-space fusion rules of the myriad races, strictly speaking, these five light spheres were also considered 'items'. As long as Lin Yuan was willing to expend some inter-realm origin force, he could freely bring them into the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had accumulated nearly a thousand strands of inter-realm origin force, which could be considered quite abundant, enough to afford the few strands needed to bring the five light spheres into the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"This descent will last for 600 years of residence time."</p><p></p><p>"If all goes well, after traversing, the main world will have passed one year."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin directly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the towering and majestic Gate of the Myriad Realms, immediately choosing to traverse.</p><p></p><p>Due to the difference in time flow speeds, every second that passed in the main universe would subject the Azure World to 600 times the time flow speed.</p><p></p><p>And according to the current situation in the Azure World, where those two outer-realm demon gods had already killed their way in, any further delay would have an even greater impact on the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's entire spiritual will surged into the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual will included his true self as well as his two yuanshen.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yuan had already arranged for his two yuanshen to be in a safe place, so there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>The Azure World.</p><p></p><p>On the earth, countless demon god puppets were running rampant. In the sky, a terrifying rift had appeared, and a large number of demon god puppets were rapidly pouring in.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of that terrifying rift, two towering figures stood, emanating an ominous and evil aura, their blood-red eyes fixated on the world within.</p><p></p><p>To resist the demon god invasion, the living beings of the Azure World had no choice but to gather at the center of the world, beneath the World Tree that supported the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The power of the World Tree provided shelter. With a gentle sway of its heavenly vines, billions upon billions of demon god puppets would be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>If not for this World Tree, the entire Azure World would have been breached long ago. How could they resist?</p><p></p><p>Outside the world.</p><p></p><p>The two colossal outer-realm demon gods gazed intently.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Pavilion Master are truly inconceivable. With just one strike, he tore through the barrier of this world."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the left sent out a mental ripple, revealing a hint of amazement.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Pavilion Master's methods, the two of them would never have been able to enter the Azure World, let alone approach it, as they would have been repelled by the Primordial Demonic Tree.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely by relying on the Pavilion Master's methods that they were able to severely injure that Primordial Demonic Tree and tear through the world's barrier, successfully killing their way in.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even after severely injuring that Primordial Demonic Tree, they still have enough power left to resist the suppression of our soul talents. Otherwise, all living beings within the world would have fallen into the nightmare realm we had set up."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the right shook his head, somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"That Demonic Tree, after tens of millions of years, has become so powerful? Even the Pavilion Master's methods couldn't destroy it?"</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the left was also somewhat amazed.</p><p></p><p>They knew how formidable the Pavilion Master was. Over a hundred million years ago, he had attacked a certain secret realm, greatly increasing his strength to a level far beyond what ordinary demon gods like themselves could withstand.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter. Under the Pavilion Master's methods, it has already been severely injured. If we weren't unwilling to sustain damage ourselves, we could kill our way into the world right now."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the right spoke. With the Primordial Demonic Tree severely injured, they had the strength to kill their way in, but they felt that they themselves might be harmed by the raging Primordial Demonic Tree, so they didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the world's barrier had already been torn open. It was only a matter of time before they could slowly exhaust the Primordial Demonic Tree's remaining power and then take over the Azure World 'unscathed'.</p><p></p><p>Countless martial cultivators took refuge within the trunk of the World Tree, which supported the heavens and earth, resisting the suppression of the soul talents from the outer-realm demon gods.</p><p></p><p>After tens of millions of years of development, and under Lin Yuan's secret guidance, the Azure World was dominated solely by martial arts. As for the World Tree, it was merely left behind by the great Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>And the Martial Ancestor was the origin of martial arts in the Azure World. Without the Martial Ancestor, the Azure World would have been destroyed long ago during that demon god invasion from the distant past.</p><p></p><p>So for the living beings of the Azure World, for the countless martial cultivators, there was only one belief in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That was the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>As for the World Tree? It had sheltered the Azure World for tens of millions of years, but it was merely a contingency left behind by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the World Tree, the tree crown.</p><p></p><p>This place was like a vast continent, where countless martial cultivators lived. It was also the final barrier of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Even if the mortal realm was occupied by demon gods, as long as the tree crown continent did not fall, the living beings of the Azure World would still have a chance, still have hope.</p><p></p><p>At the very center of the tree crown was a palace that stood tall - the Martial Palace, which also enshrined the 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor. It was the 'sacred ground' for all living beings of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>No one in the Azure World had ever seen the Martial Ancestor, but the myths and legends about him were ubiquitous. Every so often, the high priest of the Martial Palace would lead the living beings in worshipping the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, in the Azure World, it wasn't just the living beings who worshipped the Martial Ancestor - everything, even the entire world itself, paid homage to the Martial Ancestor. During each worship ceremony, the heavens and earth would rumble.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Priests were moving about, extremely anxious as the mortal realm was being ravaged by the demon god puppets. The many martial cultivators on the tree crown continent had also held numerous worship ceremonies for the Martial Ancestor, hoping to seek his help in driving away the outer-realm demon gods and saving the living beings of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>But so far, it hadn't had any effect - those demon god puppets were still running rampant. However, the living beings had not lost faith in their belief in the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the innermost chamber of the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>A majestic male statue was enshrined here - this was the 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor, a representation of his true appearance and stature obtained through the World Tree.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor was a body cultivated by Lin Yuan's command to the Primordial Demonic Tree, which had spent over a hundred thousand years and invested an unknown amount of primal essence, using the entire Azure World as the womb to give birth to this most powerful physical form.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was to prepare for Lin Yuan's descent.</p><p></p><p>This way, Lin Yuan could save a great deal of time that would have been needed to start from scratch. Over a hundred thousand years, borrowing the boundless primal power of the Azure World, the Primordial Demonic Tree had nurtured this physical form, which started at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>After another over a hundred thousand years of worship and nurturing, it had nearly reached or even attained the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan descended into the Azure World again, he could directly take possession of this body, equivalent to those innately powerful special lifeforms in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor was cultivated by Lin Yuan from the essence of martial arts itself, making it extremely compatible with martial arts. Once his consciousness descended, it would take a very short time for him to recover to his peak state.</p><p></p><p>Only by fully mastering a world could Lin Yuan make such extravagant arrangements and preparations. In other worlds, he simply wouldn't have these conditions.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, such a physical body, condensed from the quintessence of the heavens and earth, far surpassed any rare treasure. It would have long been coveted or even seized by those experts.</p><p></p><p>But in the Azure World, protected by the Primordial Demonic Tree, this 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor was able to be successfully nurtured until today.</p><p></p><p>And it became the source of faith for the living beings of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Countless people began to worship the Martial Ancestor again.</p><p></p><p>Incense smoke wafted through the air as innumerable believers knelt before the 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor in the innermost chamber, faintly enveloped by a supreme aura.</p><p></p><p>"We beg the Martial Ancestor to have mercy on the living beings and descend his mighty power to strike down the demon gods."</p><p></p><p>The high priestess, a woman, knelt respectfully and prayed to the 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the branches of the World Tree swayed, and a mysterious aura emerged as the heavens and earth joined in the worship.</p><p></p><p>In this world.</p><p></p><p>The heavens, earth, humans, ghosts, and deities.</p><p></p><p>All worshipped the Martial Ancestor together.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a strand of will pierced through the dimensions and descended into the 'Golden Body' of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

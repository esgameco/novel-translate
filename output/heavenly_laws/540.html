        <h1>Chapter 540</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The primordial consciousness of the main universe could no longer do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>In terms of scale, the universe within Lin Yuan's body was equivalent to the starry sky of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>This meant that even if the primordial consciousness of the main universe disregarded everything, at most it could barely trap Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When the great destruction of the universe arrived and the primordial consciousness weakened, even restraining Lin Yuan would be a luxury.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Supreme Being, what you said..."</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's nine Supreme Beings, including Xuanyuan Supreme Being, were all frightened and shocked.</p><p></p><p>The primordial consciousness of the universe? Unable to do anything to Lin Yuan? Ordinary life forms cannot sense the primordial consciousness of the universe. Even 11th level life forms can hardly sense its power.</p><p></p><p>But what about the 12th level ultimates? Although they have broken free from the constraints of the river of time, they directly face the primordial consciousness of the universe and are very clear about what kind of existence it is.</p><p></p><p>The primordial consciousness of the universe is the aggregation of all the power of the entire universe. With a single thought, it can mobilize all the power of the universe, and the might it can unleash within the universe can reach the level of chaos.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary 12th level path-breakers don't dare to go against the primordial consciousness of the universe. Even the two ultimates of the Catastrophe Race are the same, because the gap between them is too large and it's meaningless.</p><p></p><p>The only consolation is that the primordial consciousness of the universe is a kind of general consciousness, merely instinctive. Otherwise, all living beings in the universe, including 12th level ultimates, would be enslaved by the primordial consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme Beings of human civilization looked at each other, somewhat hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>They had great trust in Lin Yuan, but to be untouchable by the primordial consciousness within the universe? This was completely beyond their understanding.</p><p></p><p>"There's been a breakthrough." Lin Yuan smiled slightly, understanding the doubts of Xuanyuan, Xia Qin and the other Supreme Beings. He casually raised his hand, tearing apart a large area of void.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the first time when Lin Yuan unleashed power surpassing the peak of the path-breaking realm, and the primordial will of the universe descended to take a look.</p><p></p><p>This time, the primordial consciousness of the universe didn't even descend.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight Supreme Beings of human civilization were startled. Lin Yuan's casual strike had extremely terrifying power. Under normal circumstances, it would definitely attract the attention of the primordial consciousness of the universe, but the Supreme Beings on the scene didn't detect any fluctuation of the primordial will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>A thought vaguely emerged in the minds of the nine Supreme Beings of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>That is - </p><p></p><p>The primordial consciousness of the universe was wary of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Supreme Being, compared to you, we nine..."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Force Supreme Being looked at Lin Yuan, his tone complex, filled with emotion.</p><p></p><p>They had watched Lin Yuan grow step by step to where he is now, from an extremely weak life form at the beginning to the great existence now able to confront the primordial consciousness of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Lin Yuan, the nine Supreme Beings' strength had hardly changed from when they first noticed Lin Yuan until now.</p><p></p><p>"With you here, Milky Way Supreme Being, how fortunate our human civilization is."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme Being sighed. The situation of this universe had changed because of Lin Yuan, with human civilization dominating.</p><p></p><p>Now with the great destruction of the universe, it was again because of Lin Yuan that human civilization didn't need to experience the pain of separating from loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization had enjoyed too many benefits because of Lin Yuan. Looking back at previous great destructions of the universe, which race didn't need to abandon 99% of their people?</p><p></p><p>Some selfish 12th level ultimates even directly abandoned all the people of their race to increase their own chances of surviving the great destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"If we're transferring all citizens of our human civilization, then the racial migration plan needs to be redesigned." Butterfly Wing Supreme Being immediately began to consider a brand new racial migration plan.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to move all citizens to this area." A map of territories appeared in front of Lin Yuan, and he pointed to a certain area.</p><p></p><p>This area was about 20 million light years, enough to accommodate all current citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"All concentrated in this area?" Xia Qin Supreme Being looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I have the ability to transfer all human citizens in this area into my internal universe at once."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Now the range of his internal universe had reached 20 million light years in diameter. When using the divine ability 'World', he could instantly form an external universe of 20 million light years.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a time limit, it was more than enough to send all human civilization citizens into the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>As long as all human civilization citizens entered the internal universe, Lin Yuan was confident that he could use all citizens as anchors to completely transfer their life essence imprints in the river of time of the main universe's starry sky into the river of time of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple then."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme Being nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if all citizens of human civilization could be transferred, it would save a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the original extraction method, the citizens who were selected would definitely have to say goodbye to family and friends, which would waste a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Some citizens might even give up their transfer quota while saying goodbye, which would lead to the need for re-selection, making it very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The three goddesses and the Supreme Beings saw this and knew that such things couldn't be rushed.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>All citizens could be transferred? There was no need for goodbyes and separations at all. Human civilization could completely mobilize powerful evolvers to transfer planet by planet.</p><p></p><p>This would definitely improve efficiency.</p><p></p><p>After roughly discussing this, the nine Supreme Beings felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>According to the racial transfer plan formulated at the beginning, they were under great pressure, after all, they needed to abandon 90% of human civilization's citizens.</p><p></p><p>But now it was much better.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, when will the great destruction of the universe roughly arrive?"</p><p></p><p>Virtual God Supreme Being asked.</p><p></p><p>"No more than 300 years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn. The avatar on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent was constantly monitoring this matter.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield where the Nine Phoenix Great Saint and Shadow Demon Great Saint were fighting was not far from this area. If calculated in chaos void time, it would affect this area in at most one year.</p><p></p><p>And in the time of the universe, it would be about 300 years.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Great Saints are too terrifying." Virtual God Supreme Being couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>Just the aftershocks caused by two Chaos Great Saints fighting and killing each other were enough to cause universe after universe to collapse and enter the great destruction prematurely?</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Great Saints can already evolve their own power from the chaos rules. They can suppress Chaos Venerable beings one after another with a wave of their hand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chaos Venerable beings have ways to save their lives. Even a peerless Great Saint would find it very difficult to completely kill a Chaos Venerable being. At most, they could only kill the true body.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the deterrence of Chaos Great Saints was unparalleled. No Chaos Venerable being was willing to lose their true body, which meant losing most of their treasures and weapons. It would take who knows how many universe eras to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>"Next, we nine will personally take action to transfer the citizens of our race." Xia Qin Supreme Being spoke.</p><p></p><p>If transferring planet by planet, the efficiency would be higher with Supreme Beings taking action. A single thought could cross countless light years.</p><p></p><p>In the territory of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>On countless life-bearing planets, many farewells were taking place...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many citizens realized that this farewell scene might be their last, as they may never see each other again.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a message from the three goddesses was simultaneously sent to all citizens:</p><p></p><p>"Due to the great Galactic Supreme Being, the migration plan for our race has been revised. The new migration plan cancels the lottery system. All citizens of human civilization now qualify to transfer to the new universe."</p><p></p><p>This news immediately caused a huge stir among the citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"All citizens can move to the new universe?"</p><p></p><p>"We don't have to wait for death anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, that's wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Countless citizens of human civilization wept with joy. Who would want to stay on their original planets waiting for death when they could move to a new universe and survive?</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galactic Supreme Being. The Galactic Supreme Being is allowing us to live on."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Supreme Being is the greatest supreme being of our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Many citizens keenly noticed that the announcement from the three goddesses mentioned the Galactic Supreme Being at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know how the Galactic Supreme Being managed to relocate all human citizens to the new universe, it was clearly an act that required enormous sacrifice. Otherwise, why would there have been the initial lottery plan where only one out of over a hundred citizens could qualify for relocation?</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky, other alien races also learned of humanity's new migration plan. </p><p></p><p>Although these alien races had submitted to human civilization, they were ultimately not human citizens, so they were not included in the human migration plan.</p><p></p><p>"All citizens of human civilization can migrate to the new universe?"</p><p></p><p>"Why can only one in a million of our race migrate, even with our Twelfth Order Ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Galactic Supreme Being that human civilization can do this?"</p><p></p><p>The various alien races felt very conflicted. Not long ago, Lin Yuan had released all the Twelfth Order Ultimates, who had returned to their own races.</p><p></p><p>When human civilization announced the news of the universe's impending destruction, the alien races that had submitted to humanity naturally learned of it as well.</p><p></p><p>Similar to human civilization's migration plan, all alien races with Twelfth Order beings also formulated corresponding migration plans.</p><p></p><p>However, even the Yu Race with the deepest foundations only dared to migrate one millionth of their population.</p><p></p><p>With the universal destruction arriving early, the powers of many Twelfth Order Ultimates had not grown to their peak. Additionally, all weapons, treasures and artifacts had fallen into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Being able to migrate one millionth of their race was already considered extremely caring for their people by the Yu Race's Twelfth Order Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>After all, the universe's destruction was no joke. The more lives they carried, the stronger the backlash from the universe's fundamental consciousness would be at the end.</p><p></p><p>The chances of not surviving would be higher.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the method of the Galactic Supreme Being?"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do? Should we completely sell ourselves to human civilization? At least we could survive that way?"</p><p></p><p>"Sell ourselves? To become complete slaves of human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"Compared to death, what does being a slave matter?"</p><p></p><p>Many alien powerhouses who hadn't been selected for migration were thinking this way.</p><p></p><p>To "sell oneself" meant giving up everything about oneself, becoming the private property of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Although the various alien races had submitted to human civilization, it hadn't reached the level of selling themselves.</p><p></p><p>But now, seeing human civilization prosper because of the Galactic Supreme Being, if they chose to sell themselves, they would likely be able to survive as well.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Supreme Being plans to take away all human citizens?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Doesn't he fear the backlash from the universe's fundamental consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Many Twelfth Order aliens also received this news, and their first thought was that it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Aliens below the Twelfth Order, although they also knew it was incredibly unbelievable for the Galactic Supreme Being to take away all human citizens, didn't understand why it was unbelievable. So even though they were shocked, they quickly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>But as Twelfth Order beings, these alien Ultimates clearly understood what this meant.</p><p></p><p>It would mean the full force suppression by the universe's fundamental consciousness. Even if the Galactic Sovereign had strength at the peak of the Path-Breaking Realm, or even beyond it, it would be impossible to withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Galactic Supreme Being's power has already reached a height we can't even fathom."</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate of the Starry Sky Alliance said softly, deducing the reason from the result.</p><p></p><p>They truly didn't know how the Galactic Supreme Being dared to take away all human citizens, but since he dared to do so, no matter how unbelievable it seemed, there were only two possibilities:</p><p></p><p>One was that the Galactic Supreme Being was a fool, actively seeking death.</p><p></p><p>The other was that the Galactic Supreme Being was confident, believing he could withstand the full force suppression of the universe's fundamental consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Was the Galactic Supreme Being a fool? Obviously not.</p><p></p><p>So it could only be the second possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Supreme Being!"</p><p></p><p>The various Twelfth Order aliens looked at each other, their minds trembling in unison.</p><p></p><p>"We can begin the transfer now."</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, Lin Yuan looked at the human citizens streaming in from all directions and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The migration of human civilization was very swift. When not considering the farewell process between citizens, who knows how much time was saved.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability: World!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down, his mind stirring slightly. Instantly, a vast power covered an area of 20 million light-years in diameter.</p><p></p><p>It enveloped all the human citizens within this region.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained calm. In an instant, everything within the 20 million light-year area disappeared, sent into the universe within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless human citizens immediately noticed their environment had changed. An intangible suppression appeared.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had made many adjustments to the universe within his body, the stabilized space-time still had obvious differences from the main universe's starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Slightly stronger evolved humans could sense the anomaly if they paid careful attention.</p><p></p><p>However, the impact was minimal. The stabilized space-time had almost no effect on ordinary citizens. It mainly restricted those high-level evolved humans, at least preventing them from casually teleporting or tearing through space.</p><p></p><p>Even Twelfth Order Ultimates would be suppressed everywhere within Lin Yuan's internal universe, unable to avoid or break free from it.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe that "Infinite Void" aimed to create had the Chaos Void as its ultimate goal. Theoretically, when cultivated to the extreme, the internal universe would evolve into an enormous entity no weaker than the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>The degree of space-time stability can be imagined. This was only the first level. If cultivated to the second or third level, even Chaos Venerables would be trapped inside as if in a cage, unable to struggle.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Supreme Being's methods are too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Nearby, the nine supreme beings of human civilization watched in utter amazement.</p><p></p><p>Countless human citizens within 20 million light-years, collected away in an instant?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

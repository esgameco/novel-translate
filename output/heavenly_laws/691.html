        <h1>Chapter 691</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The protective grand formation of this relic site has been completely destroyed, and not just once."</p><p></p><p>"It can slowly recover after each destruction?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, and soon after discovering this sect relic site, his Yin spirit arrived.</p><p></p><p>"At least it is the relic of a Saint Sect-level force, its profundity is much more terrifying than the Holy Cloud Saint Sect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In this Source World, the definition of a Saint Sect-level force is one with a cultivator at the Carefree Three Realms level guarding it.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Three Realms is on par with the Great Saints of the Chaotic Void, as well as the Celestial Venerables of the First Source World.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Third Realm of Carefree is the threshold of the Supreme Saint Sects, belonging to the second echelon of forces in this world.</p><p></p><p>Below the Supreme Saint Sects are the Saint Sect-level forces, which also have gradations.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Holy Cloud Saint Sect is a relatively weak Saint Sect, its founder just barely reaching the Carefree Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>After the great changes in heaven and earth, the strongest of the current Holy Cloud Saint Sect has long surpassed the Carefree Three Realms, reaching the peak of the Longevity Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Longevity Six Realms is equivalent to the supreme Venerable of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Holy Cloud Saint Sect should no longer be called a Saint Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the "Demonic" calamity, it is able to maintain the Saint Sect title.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the work of a Source Demon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the traces around the relic site, and the key strike that almost penetrated the protective grand formation had a faint Source Demonic Qi diffusing, at least a Source Demon-level "Demon" had intervened to cause such a scene.</p><p></p><p>"Source Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not too surprised. </p><p></p><p>Most Source Demons have gathered in the central heaven and earth, but that does not mean there are no traces of Source Demons elsewhere, it's just that their numbers are too few.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood outside and observed for a while, then went in.</p><p></p><p>The protective grand formation of this relic site had not yet recovered, and could not obstruct Lin Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived at the deepest part of the relic site.</p><p></p><p>It was empty, with only a stone statue standing.</p><p></p><p>"Talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw dozens of talismans engraved at the base of the statue, and with a slight mental movement, he extended the last three talismans.</p><p></p><p>When the "Demonic" calamity struck, most sect forces would leave their core inheritances before their sects were breached by the "Demons", so that future cultivators could inherit them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the "Demons" are not interested in cultivation inheritances, and to activate the inheritances, such as through the Talisman Dao, the "Demons" are obviously incapable of doing so.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some sect forces would also leave some tests outside the core inheritances, in order to screen, as not all inheritances are suitable for every cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ As Lin Yuan extended the last three talismans, the entire stone statue began to rumble, and a man in a dark red cloak materialized.</p><p></p><p>"Posterity." The man in the dark red cloak looked at Lin Yuan: "My name is 'Lihong', I don't know how long it has been since you saw this imprint of mine, whether the 'Demonic' calamity has ended, but in my era, the 'Demonic' calamity has just descended for a billion years, and I am now being chased by a Source Demon, I probably won't last much longer."</p><p></p><p>"Lihong? Is he the founder of the Lihong Saint Sect?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As a Saint Sect before the great changes in heaven and earth, the Holy Cloud Saint Sect naturally had detailed information on other Saint Sects.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Lihong Saint Sect was quite famous, and its founder 'Lihong' was a peak Second Realm of Carefree cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"That Source Demon is too strong, I feel even the Eternal Scions can't match it, I have no power to resist at all, I can only keep fleeing." The man in the dark red cloak spoke.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Eternal Scions are the strongest inheritors of the various Eternal Sects, possessing strength that surpasses the Third Realm of Carefree.</p><p></p><p>"Stronger than the Eternal Scions?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked, the Eternal Scions were already close to the Abyss Dragon, to be stronger than the Eternal Scions? Isn't that equivalent to the Abyss Dragon, or even surpassing the Abyss Dragon? How is that possible?</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Dragon is the first life form nurtured by the First Source World, carrying countless karmic connections and terrifying natural talents.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Scions of this Source World, through the special talisman inheritances and the dedicated cultivation of the Thirteen Realms Experts, can barely approach the level of the Abyss Dragon, which is understandable.</p><p></p><p>But to be equivalent to or even surpass the Abyss Dragon? This is unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan found it inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>He could easily surpass the Abyss Dragon because he possessed the comprehension of the Dao rules of different dimensional heavens and earths, as well as his inverted genius. But the Source Demons?</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are the 'Demons'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly, over the past thousand years, he had hunted countless Demonic Spirits and Great Demons, but he still did not fully understand the nature of such existences.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that if killed by a Source Demon, the Demonic Qi will permeate one's mind and will, and even the most powerful clone and incarnation techniques will be useless. As for self-detonation? As long as there is a karmic connection, the Source Demon will keep pursuing."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' said calmly, "Since I embarked on the cultivation path, I have never felt such oppression."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened.</p><p></p><p>He had also seen the various methods of the Source Demons in the ancient texts collected by the Holy Cloud Saint Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Since death is inevitable, I have left this stone statue in advance, containing the inheritance of the path I have walked, especially the Talisman Dao, which is the Dao passed down by the Eternal Sovereigns!"</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' continued.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Sovereigns are what the beings of this Source World call the Thirteen Realms Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>The Time Beings of different worlds have different titles, such as the 'Progenitors' in the First Source World.</p><p></p><p>"Talisman Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>Although 'Lihong's strength was not as great as Lin Yuan's, as a peak Second Realm of Carefree cultivator, his understanding of talismans must have unique insights.</p><p></p><p>Especially since he had met several Eternal Sovereigns and received their guidance, his understanding of the Talisman Dao would be far superior to the Holy Cloud Saint Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I have heard the Eternal Sovereigns discourse many times." </p><p></p><p>The man in the dark red cloak smiled slightly, "Each Eternal Sovereign's understanding of the Talisman Dao is profoundly deep, enough for us to study for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly, the 'Lihong' in front of him was just an imprint without sentience, and Lin Yuan had no intention of inquiring further.</p><p></p><p>"But among all the Eternal Sovereigns, I admire the Celestial Light Sovereign's understanding of the Talisman Dao the most." The man in the dark red cloak said, "Not that I mean to belittle the other Eternal Sovereigns, but I feel the Celestial Light Sovereign's exposition of the Talisman Dao is the most perfect."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' paused for a while, as if lost in some memory, and after a long time, he continued, "The Celestial Light..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Light Lord's understanding of the Talisman Dao (Talisman Way) is complete."</p><p></p><p>"Complete?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it is complete."</p><p></p><p>The 'Lihong' character exclaimed in amazement: "For example, if you want to recreate the vast heavens and earth we reside in, you can use the power of the Talisman Dao to replicate it. If you want to revive the past deceased Carefree Three Realms experts, you can also achieve that through the power of the Talisman."</p><p></p><p>"In the Heavenly Light Lord's understanding of the Talisman Dao, the ultimate pursuit is complete mastery, using the Talisman Dao to become omnipotent."</p><p></p><p>"Even killing other Eternal Lords can be done. The Eternal Lords have foresight and can see their own possible futures, so it is extremely difficult to kill an Eternal Lord. But if one's comprehension of the Talisman Dao reaches the pinnacle, the theoretical level of omnipotence, then they can completely kill an Eternal Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Not only killing, by using the omnipotent Talisman Dao, one can even create new Eternal Lords. Of course, this level of Talisman power is something the Heavenly Light Lord has not yet attained, it is only an aspiration."</p><p></p><p>The 'Lihong' character in the dark red cloak spoke.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was greatly shocked to hear this. The Heavenly Light Lord is one of the Thirteen Temporal Life Forms of this source world, as recorded in the information of the Qingyu Sacred Sect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan never expected the Heavenly Light Lord to have such a pursuit of the Talisman Dao? Complete mastery?</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan also possessed a kind of omnipotent power - the Dimensional Source Force. According to the information from the Myriad Realms Gate, the Dimensional Source Force can achieve anything. Theoretically, as long as there are enough Dimensional Source Force, it can even completely kill the Thirteen Temporal Life Forms. However, the required amount of Dimensional Source Force is likely an unreachable number.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Heavenly Light Lord's pursuit of Talisman omnipotence, the omnipotence of the Dimensional Source Force is a known fact.</p><p></p><p>"Talisman Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind, and from the Heavenly Light Lord's pursuit of the Talisman Dao, he could see the potential of this Dao, even if it's unclear whether the Talisman Dao can ultimately reach the level of omnipotence. At least there is a faint hope.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Heavenly Light Lord, as a Temporal Life Form, would not have such a pursuit.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan, he was completely unable to comprehend the Dimensional Source Force, as its essence was too high. He could only sense its existence through the Myriad Realms Gate. Without the Myriad Realms Gate, he wouldn't even know about this power.</p><p></p><p>Now that he knows the theoretical limit of the Talisman Dao is the Dimensional Source Force, he can try to delve deeper into the Talisman Dao to indirectly comprehend the Dimensional Source Force.</p><p></p><p>Compared to relying on the Dimensional Source Force to achieve omnipotence, Lin Yuan hopes more to realize omnipotence through his own cultivation of the Talisman Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I admire the Heavenly Light Lord, so the path I walk and the Talisman Dao I comprehend will all be close to the Heavenly Light Lord's."</p><p></p><p>The 'Lihong' character in the dark red cloak said: "The Talisman Dao I have comprehended can be divided into three categories: attack, defense, and life preservation."</p><p></p><p>"The attack Talisman Dao is called the 'Lihong Radiance', which is my most powerful offensive technique. It consists of 26,835 talismans forming a beam of Lihong Radiance that can pierce through anything. Even a Carefree Third Realm expert would have to temporarily retreat before this attack."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' spoke with a hint of dissatisfaction: "If I could further advance and enter the Carefree Third Realm, I might have a chance against that Source Demon ahead."</p><p></p><p>"Lihong Radiance?" Lin Yuan carefully observed as the 'Lihong' character in the dark red cloak demonstrated the Talisman Dao, with the talismans quickly weaving together to form a beam of dark red light.</p><p></p><p>"The Lihong Radiance, while referencing some of the attack methods passed down by the Heavenly Light Lord, can also be considered my own creation. You can take a look at the various inheritances recorded in this stone statue and evaluate them."</p><p></p><p>The 'Lihong' character in the dark red cloak spoke with confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The second type is the defensive Talisman Dao, which I call the Lihong Cauldron Dao. It forms an impenetrable cauldron with talismans, and I once held out for ten breaths against a Carefree Third Realm expert using this Talisman Dao."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' had a hint of pride on his face.</p><p></p><p>To hold out for ten breaths against a Third Realm expert while only being at the Second Realm was already remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"As for the life preservation Talisman Dao, it is called the Bloodhong Immortality Art. It can cultivate countless Bloodhong bodies, but unfortunately, there is still a causal connection between the different Bloodhong bodies, otherwise that Source Demon wouldn't be able to kill me."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' had an expression of dissatisfaction, clearly desiring to survive the true life-and-death situation.</p><p></p><p>"The specific cultivation methods for these three Talisman Daos are all stored within the stone statue, along with the Talisman Daos passed down by the various Eternal Lords."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' looked at Lin Yuan: "I won't set up any tests for the Talisman Dao I've walked. Normal cultivators can cultivate them without any need for tests. However, after you comprehend them, don't destroy this stone statue, leave it as a glimmer of hope for future generations."</p><p></p><p>'Lihong' sighed and then closed his eyes, muttering: "Great Heavenly Light Lord, why did you not intervene to stop the 'Demon' calamity?"</p><p></p><p>'Lihong's' final murmured words were filled with confusion, and then he quickly crumbled.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Light Lord." Lin Yuan was also curious about the status of the various Eternal Lords. Could it be that they were all obstructed by the 'Demon God'? Lin Yuan thought for a moment and then immediately delved into the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Before me, there have been six cultivators who have come and comprehended the inheritances within."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately discovered the traces left by the previous cultivators in the stone statue. He was the seventh to come and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>This was normal, as according to 'Lihong's' words, this relic had existed since the great changes in the heavens and earth. It was only natural that a few cultivators would have discovered it over the long years.</p><p></p><p>"The Talisman Dao inheritances left behind by the Eternal Lords."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan first comprehended these, as the Qingyu Sacred Sect had also recorded some Talisman Dao inheritances, but very few were related to the Eternal Lords. They were mainly from the sect's founding ancestor who had just entered the Carefree Third Realm, not as impressive as the veteran Second Realm peak expert 'Lihong'.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Light Lord." The stone statue contained more than 20 types of Talisman Daos passed down by the Heavenly Light Lord. The more Lin Yuan comprehended, the more astonished he became. He had comprehended Thirteen Realm inheritances before, such as the Chaotic Void and the First Source World, especially the latter, where the Six Ancestors had left behind Thirteen Realm inheritances for Lin Yuan to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Talisman Daos left behind by the Heavenly Light Lord, Lin Yuan felt a clear gap. The Heavenly Light Lord's understanding of the Talisman Dao was extremely high, even at the Thirteen Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"Could this Heavenly Light Lord be a Time Lord?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

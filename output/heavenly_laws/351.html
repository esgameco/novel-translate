        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 351: The Secret Realm Closes (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"I don't have any," Lin Yuan shook his head directly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan did have a treasure that could increase the ultimate probability. </p><p></p><p>It was that mysterious gourd, which could break through the shackles of the inner world within his body.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the seven colored liquids from the mysterious gourd, he could increase the intuitive size of his inner world by more than twenty times.</p><p></p><p>When an 11th level life impacted the ultimate, the inner world would metamorphose into an inner universe. </p><p></p><p>At that time, the higher the foundation of the inner world, the easier the metamorphosis would be.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it indirectly increased the probability of impacting the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>But how could Lin Yuan use that mysterious gourd for a transaction?</p><p></p><p>He even concealed it from human civilization, let alone Tuo Ba the Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could guess that if he dared to reveal even half a message about the mysterious gourd,</p><p></p><p>It would provoke a direct strike from the most powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>For those most powerful beings, no matter how gifted Lin Yuan's talents and aptitudes were, he was just a life in the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>Unable to leap out of the long river of time, he would eventually grow old and die.</p><p></p><p>So geniuses were not valued by the most powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>But the mysterious gourd? It was absolutely a priceless treasure surpassing even the Eternal Spring of the Twelve Star Universes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no doubt that the most powerful beings would fight and kill each other over it.</p><p></p><p>"I know you don't have one," Tuo Ba the Ancient God spoke, "But human civilization must have some."</p><p></p><p>"The strand of spiritual will I took away was your close friend, the Galactic Star Master. Could he really just watch as his memories were experienced by me?"</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Ancient God said.</p><p></p><p>Once Fang Qing's spiritual will was experienced by Tuo Ba the Ancient God, it would be completely obliterated.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it," Lin Yuan did not directly refuse, but after saying this, he got up and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan left, only Tuo Ba the Ancient God and Si Zhong the Ancient God remained in this temporarily constructed virtual network world.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba!" Si Zhong the Ancient God looked at Tuo Ba the Ancient God, his expression extremely ugly, his eyes faintly flaring with flames. Si Zhong had always maintained a kind old man image when interacting with others, but now he was truly enraged.</p><p></p><p>"A mere strand of 6th level spiritual will, and you think it's worth a treasure that increases the probability of impacting the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have a grudge against human civilization, since I've stepped forward, you shouldn't have made such an excessive demand."</p><p></p><p>"A mere 6th level life?" Tuo Ba the Ancient God smiled slightly, "For us, it is indeed just a 6th level life. But I've also investigated - that Fang Qing was owed a favor by the Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master is too young, he should value such favors greatly. Anyway, I just casually mentioned it, it doesn't matter if the negotiation breaks down."</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Ancient God said indifferently. Although he also felt the Galactic Star Master was unlikely to produce a treasure that increased the probability of impacting the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>But what if?</p><p></p><p>What if the Galactic Star Master took it seriously, and it represented a great opportunity for him?</p><p></p><p>Even if in the end the Galactic Star Master truly could not produce such a treasure, Tuo Ba could continue making other demands. After all, Fang Qing's spiritual will was in his hands, allowing him to control the Galactic Star Master at any time.</p><p></p><p>"By doing this, aren't you afraid of offending the Galactic Star Master and human civilization?" Si Zhong the Ancient God fell silent for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>No matter the final outcome, through this matter, Tuo Ba the Ancient God would definitely offend the Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>And offending the Galactic Star Master was equivalent to offending all of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have much life left, what is there to fear?" Tuo Ba the Ancient God said indifferently, "Within a million years, I will impact the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, if I fail, my entire existence will be erased. Even if I offend ten Galactic Star Masters, what can they do? If I succeed, then I will be one of the most powerful, no matter how enraged the Galactic Star Master is, what can he do?"</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Ancient God shook his head, "Si Zhong, over the long years, you've made connections with all kinds of talents, but in my view it's meaningless. If you don't become one of the most powerful, what use are all those connections?"</p><p></p><p>"How I do things is none of your concern." Si Zhong the Ancient God looked at Tuo Ba the Ancient God, "Tuo Ba, let me ask you one more time, do you really want to stand in opposition to the Galactic Star Master?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't recommend you do that. The Galactic Star Master's potential is the greatest I've seen. Your actions will bring endless trouble."</p><p></p><p>Si Zhong the Ancient God said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Greatest potential?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll impact the ultimate within a million years, are you saying that Galactic Star Master can cross into the ultimate within a million years too?"</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Ancient God sneered, "Si Zhong, don't try to be a peacemaker. I, Tuo Ba, am set on dealing with the Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"We special lifeforms stand high above, why should we look at the face of some Galactic Star Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Galactic Star Master requests the aid of one of human civilization's most powerful beings, at most I'll directly seek shelter with the Insect Race or Feather Race - they can protect my safety."</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Ancient God had considered it comprehensively. No matter how monstrous the Galactic Star Master's talents were, he was not one of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>The nine most powerful beings of human civilization would not go to war against the Insect and Feather Races just for the Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Si Zhong the Ancient God fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I'm just waiting for the Galactic Star Master's answer."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully there will be a surprise," Tuo Ba the Ancient God's eyes shone with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Tuo Ba, propose a new condition and let me negotiate on the Galactic Star Master's behalf," Si Zhong the Ancient God thought for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Si Zhong, don't get involved," Tuo Ba the Ancient God glanced at Si Zhong the Ancient God, "For me now, no matter how precious a treasure, if it's useless for increasing my probability of impacting the ultimate, it has no use."  </p><p></p><p>"Unless you can also produce a treasure that increases the probability of impacting the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>"How could I have such a thing," Si Zhong the Ancient God sighed. Even if he did have one, he would not take it out.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the temporarily constructed virtual network world, Lin Yuan returned to his personal space.</p><p></p><p>"This Tuo Ba the Ancient God is treating me like a fat sheep to be slaughtered," Lin Yuan sat down, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could see that the condition Tuo Ba proposed was excessive, but he was threatening Lin Yuan by holding Fang Qing's strand of spiritual will hostage.</p><p></p><p>"The intelligence said Tuo Ba the Ancient God has an arrogant personality and bad temper, and now it seems his gall is quite big too," Lin Yuan thought. To dare threaten him so brazenly was something Lin Yuan had almost never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense though, Tuo Ba has no need to fear me. In the eyes of most powerful beings, my limit is just the 11th level. As for the ultimate? Wanting to cross into the ultimate has nothing to do with talents and aptitudes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. As fellow 11th level beings, Tuo Ba the Ancient God was a special lifeform, he had no need to fear a human civilization 11th level like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the miracles and marvels Lin Yuan accomplished when he was at the 8th and 9th levels, breaking through myths?</p><p></p><p>As the levels increased, wanting to replicate his 8th and 9th level feats would see the difficulty increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>Could Lin Yuan, having been able to kill same-level experts like chickens at the 8th and 9th levels, still kill 11th level experts like chickens after reaching the 11th level?</p><p></p><p>Killing 11th level experts like chickens was a skill only the most powerful possessed. Even some special 11th level lifeforms had a bit of resistance against the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>Like that "Mother of the Tree Realm" - she was definitely one of the strongest 11th level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Si Zhong the Ancient God took the initiative to contact Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Master, I'm sorry, I couldn't persuade Tuo Ba," Si Zhong the Ancient God felt somewhat ashamed. He had not expected Tuo Ba the Ancient God to be so crazed, daring to propose any condition.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba's life is running short, he is being forced to impact the ultimate. He will grasp at any hope to increase his probability of success. At this point, Galactic Star Master, you should meet with him."</p><p></p><p>If it was tens of billions of years earlier, Si Zhong was confident he could persuade Tuo Ba the Ancient God through his own efforts. But now? Tuo Ba only had impacting the ultimate in his eyes, he didn't care about offending one or two of the most powerful for this goal.</p><p></p><p>"I will continue to work on this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Based on my understanding of Tuo Ba, his conditions should still be able to be lowered somewhat."</p><p></p><p>Si Zhong the Ancient God said.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. Thank you for your troubles, Si Zhong the Ancient God," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Si Zhong left, Lin Yuan remained seated.</p><p></p><p>"His conditions can be lowered further?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. From his brief interaction with Tuo Ba the Ancient God, he felt the possibility was not very high.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to open with demanding a treasure to increase the probability of impacting the ultimate, even if lowered, how much could it really be lowered?</p><p></p><p>At the Crimson Carp Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>From the Galactic Main Star to the Crimson Carp Main Star, when Lin Yuan was at the 8th level, it would have taken one to two years.</p><p></p><p>But for his current self who grasped the 'Time Transcendence Scripture'...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Traversing the 'Empty Nine Steps' was merely a matter of two or three steps for Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>The space around Lin Yuan's body twisted, allowing him to easily bypass the Chixuan Prime Star's planetary defense system. All those on the Chixuan Prime Star were unaware that the Galactic Primarch had returned.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yuan easily made his way back to the Thirteen Peaks and entered Fang Qing's cultivation chamber.</p><p></p><p>The news of Fang Qing's sudden coma had not spread out yet. Apart from contacting the ancient god Tuoba, Lin Yuan did not explain the reason to anyone else besides the ancient god Lin Sizhong.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Qing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw Fang Qing lying in the nutrient pod. </p><p></p><p>The illusory projection of the white-bearded old man appeared. As an intelligent life form, he could only manifest as a projection in reality without a physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Primarch, why have you returned so soon?" The white-bearded old man looked utterly shocked. It had not been long since he last saw the Galactic Primarch, and he was still waiting for the Primarch's notification, yet Lin Yuan had personally returned.</p><p></p><p>"No need to make a fuss," Lin Yuan glanced at the white-bearded old man. "Regarding Fang Qing, I will request a supreme expert to revive him in the future."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, with a subtle shift of his mind, Lin Yuan used Fang Qing's physical body as a 'medium' to trace the causal connection and curse his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Fang Qing had just entered the sixth realm, while Lin Yuan was already an evolved being of the ninth realm, spanning three major realms. Coupled with using the most intimately connected physical body as the 'medium', Fang Qing was undoubtedly doomed.</p><p></p><p>Causality was one of the most mysterious and abstruse rules in the universe. After stepping into the ninth realm, Lin Yuan had spent some time specifically contemplating this rule.</p><p></p><p>If he allowed Fang Qing's spiritual will to be experienced by the ancient god Tuoba, Fang Qing's memories would be completely tainted by the ancient god, akin to being afflicted by the poison of memories. Even if revived, with his memories unchanged, he would still go insane and die.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better for Lin Yuan to directly kill Fang Qing's spiritual will. This way, Fang Qing would at least have a chance of being revived by a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>To increase the chances of completely killing Fang Qing, Lin Yuan's overt response to Tuoba was "let me consider it", maintaining hope in the ancient god's mind. But covertly, his true self hurried back to the Chixuan Prime Star, which would maximize the chances of a successful curse.</p><p></p><p>"The causality has disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>After completing the curse, Lin Yuan sensed the causal thread belonging to Fang Qing vanish. Due to the vast difference in their realms, Lin Yuan did not have to pay any price for this curse.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had prepared for the worst-case scenario, which was the curse failing, as Fang Qing's spiritual will was in Tuoba's possession. An ancient god like that would undoubtedly have various means at his disposal, perhaps even the ability to block causality.</p><p></p><p>The causal curse was intangible and formless, but not omnipotent. There were still ways to counter it, such as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, which could block causality.</p><p></p><p>So—</p><p></p><p>If Tuoba had blocked the curse, Lin Yuan would have immediately requested the supreme expert Xia Qin to curse Fang Qing.</p><p></p><p>With a supreme expert's might, cursing a sixth-realm life form would be effortless for Tuoba unless he also possessed a supreme expert's legacy realm like the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that Tuoba was unprepared in this regard, or perhaps he simply did not expect Lin Yuan to outright curse his friend without any bargaining, ignoring his threats.</p><p></p><p>"Revive in the future?" The white-bearded old man felt saddened yet relieved at the same time.</p><p></p><p>After learning from Lin Yuan that Fang Qing's coma was related to an ancient god, he had already prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>Ancient gods were beings of unimaginable power.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that Fang Qing had indeed died, but the Galactic Primarch intended to request a supreme expert to revive him in the future.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that although sixth-realm evolved beings imprint their essence into the universe, forming a 'Dao mark' and gaining the possibility of revival, there were billions upon billions of sixth-realm human evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>If a supreme expert had to revive every deceased sixth-realm evolved being, they would have no time to rest, solely focused on reviving sixth-realm beings.</p><p></p><p>Only sixth-realm evolved beings with sufficient talent and qualifications would be revived by supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Fang Qing, who cultivated the ancient god evolution path, clearly did not meet this requirement, as this path was inherently flawed and prone to becoming a vessel for ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Supreme experts generally would not revive such evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>But since Lin Yuan said so, the white-bearded old man immediately believed him.</p><p></p><p>In a secret realm deep in the starry cosmos, the ancient god Tuoba sat cross-legged. His massive body was comparable to a star; as a rare special life form, Tuoba's fully manifested physical form would be as enormous as an entire stellar system.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Primarch said he would consider it."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what he's considering?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Even if the human civilization truly had such means, they would not allow the Galactic Primarch to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>The condition Tuoba proposed was merely a casual suggestion, waiting for the Galactic Primarch to bargain and negotiate.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba's ultimate goal was for the human civilization to promote his evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing the chances of reaching the ultimate was not solely about treasures but also various methods, such as allowing his evolution path to gain wider propagation and attract more cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This could achieve a similar effect.</p><p></p><p>However, the human civilization had been suppressing the spread of the ancient god evolution path, which troubled Tuoba, though he had no recourse.</p><p></p><p>But now, the current Galactic Primarch gave him hope.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Primarch, if you take the lead, the human civilization should be able to step back and propagate my evolution path. It shouldn't be too difficult for you."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba contemplated while waiting for the Galactic Primarch to contact him again.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a formless ripple swept through.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Tuoba was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Causality?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba immediately sensed that the strand of Fang Qing's spiritual will within him was rapidly fading away.</p><p></p><p>"A curse?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone is cursing this spiritual will?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba was somewhat incredulous. "The secret realm I'm in has the effect of weakening causality."</p><p></p><p>"To curse someone, one would at least need to use the most intimately connected object as a 'medium,' such as the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba quickly realized that he had underestimated the Galactic Primarch's regard for Fang Qing.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Primarch truly valued Fang Qing, he would have at least bargained with Tuoba, let alone directly cursing him, which carried significant risk.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Primarch is unwilling to be threatened by me in any way?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba fell silent for a moment, realizing the Galactic Primarch's intentions.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that even if it were not Fang Qing but the Galactic Primarch's parents or closest kin in his possession, the outcome would likely be the same.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly eliminating the threat posed by Fang Qing, Lin Yuan swiftly returned to the Galactic Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>As the Galactic Primarch, it was not an issue for him to be away from the prime star for a short period.</p><p></p><p>However, being absent from the prime star for an extended time would be somewhat precarious.</p><p></p><p>"The next revival by the supreme experts will probably be in two thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently contemplated that the supreme experts' method of revival was generally to accumulate a fixed number of revival targets and then revive them all at once, as it was the most convenient and efficient approach.</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand years later, in the main world's time, I should have already crossed into the eleventh realm and could request the supreme experts to revive Fang Qing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If things progressed smoothly, in two thousand years of the main world's time, Lin Yuan might have even begun assaulting the ultimate realm or perhaps already become an ultimate being.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years in the main world did not mean Lin Yuan only experienced two thousand years. With the ability to traverse the myriad realms through the Myriad Realm Gate, Lin Yuan might have lived through twenty thousand years or more.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's mastery of various profound foundations and his extraordinary comprehension, coupled with another twenty thousand years, it was entirely possible for him to assault and cross into the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p></p><p>Another twenty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred-year period is about to end."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Secret Realm is about to close." Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the outer perimeter of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Numerous ninth-realm alien beings and ninth-realm evolved beings from the human civilization appeared in the outer perimeter area, while many ninth-realm alien beings had also gathered in the inner perimeter area – those hostile aliens driven into this area by the human evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"The secret realm is closing. It's time for me to reap the rewards."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face as he looked towards the inner perimeter area, where the ninth-realm alien beings wore expressions of utter despair. A hint of a smile graced his lips.</p>

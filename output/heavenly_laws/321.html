            <p>Chapter 321: The Supreme God (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the Longshan Palace, Lin Yuan was comprehending the essence of space within the Demigod Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenlyâ€”</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is spying on me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly. Just a moment ago, an extremely hidden sense of being watched surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This kind of spying was not spatial, but rather in the sense of time.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's deep insights into the laws of time over the years, he probably wouldn't have felt anything unusual at all.</p><p></p><p>Even ninth-level lifeforms or tenth-level lifeforms would find it very difficult to have any countermeasures in the time domain.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, some existence was trying to figure out Lin Yuan's true origins by going against the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into his sea of consciousness, where the majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms stood. A trace of negligible backlash was casually released through the projection of the Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Glimpsing a wisp of the Gate's aura, no, it should be a subtle trace, and then encountering a backlash?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of oddity flashed across Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Myriad Realms - Lin Yuan still hadn't figured out its specific level, but one thing was certain: it far surpassed the realm of twelfth-level Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The cross-dimensional feats that Supreme Beings couldn't achieve were as simple as eating and drinking for the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence already possessed the characteristics of being "unviewable" and "unpeepable", like a burning sun constantly radiating energy.</p><p></p><p>If a lifeform with insufficient cultivation dared to directly look at or spy on it, even if separated by vast distances and layers of dimensions, they would still suffer a terrifying backlash.</p><p></p><p>This was just a projection of the Gate. If it were the Gate's true body... well, that possibility didn't exist, because the moment the Gate's true body descended upon this world, everything would shatter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't bear the Gate's true body, and neither could this world.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the chief god of the Ocean of Light? Or the chief god of the Dark Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly while raising his head to gaze at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The stars symbolizing the gods seemed to hang eternally in the sky. One of the twenty-four largest stars began to fluctuate violently, as if on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination?" Lin Yuan observed carefully and reached a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The numerous stars suspended in the sky each corresponded to a true god, especially the twenty-four most enormous ones - those were the divine kingdoms of the chief gods.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Gate's backlash was transmitted, a chief god's divine kingdom started trembling. Lin Yuan could almost be certain that the one who had spied on him in the time dimension earlier was none other than that god.</p><p></p><p>"But to think there's actually a chief god who has mastered the time attribute..." Lin Yuan's heart burned with slight excitement.</p><p></p><p>The laws of time, although classified as a pillar law alongside space, were incomparably more difficult to comprehend and master.</p><p></p><p>For example, a demigod realm containing the space attribute could allow Lin Yuan to see the true essence of space in this world, thereby bringing unimaginable benefits to the creation of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Then what about a divine realm with the time attribute? A chief god realm at that?</p><p></p><p>"It depends on the level of time essence contained within that time chief god's divine realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the contained time essence was too high, Lin Yuan would actually feel a bit troubled. It would mean that the time chief god possessed advanced applications of the laws of time, such as directly going against the flow with their true body to hide in the past.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if Lin Yuan had absolute strength, he would be helpless against them.</p><p></p><p>But the probability of that was low. To truly go against the flow with one's true body required at least a thorough understanding of the complete laws of time. If that time chief god had such abilities, they absolutely wouldn't have been detected while spying on Lin Yuan in the time dimension.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the laws of time was only at the entry level, still a long way from even minor attainment.</p><p></p><p>"They shouldn't directly die from the backlash, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed that enormous star in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the other party possessed a rare time attribute divine realm, Lin Yuan actually became worried about their well-being.</p><p></p><p>The Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>The gods were all eagerly watching the God of Divination, hoping to use this great chief god's power to clarify the origins of that Longshan Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However, what happened next greatly changed the expressions of the true gods.</p><p></p><p>The originally unfathomable God of Divination's aura suddenly began to fluctuate chaotically and decline endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the God of Divination's enormous star in the human world's sky were also quickly noticed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination, the great God of Divination, why would this happen to him?"</p><p></p><p>The numerous true gods found it hard to believe. If they hadn't witnessed it personally, they would never have imagined that a lofty chief god would have such a scene.</p><p></p><p>Divine power, divine body, and even divine kingdom were all withering.</p><p></p><p>This was a chief god!</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, even in cruel god wars, chief gods had always been above it all. Throughout history, there were indeed instances of chief gods mysteriously disappearing, but absolutely not because of battles with other chief gods.</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination suffered a backlash."</p><p></p><p>An ancient high-ranking god seemed to realize something and couldn't help but say in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the "Divination" authority mastered by the God of Divination required paying a price each time a divination was performed.</p><p></p><p>The amount of the price depended on the diviner and the target of the divination.</p><p></p><p>But the God of Divination was too powerful. He was one of the twenty-four strongest chief gods in the world. Even if he divined the secrets of a chief god of the same level, he basically wouldn't have to pay much of a price.</p><p></p><p>This caused the vast majority of true gods to forget that the "Divination" authority required a price to be paid.</p><p></p><p>"Just what is the origin of that Longshan Patriarch to make the God of Divination pay such a price?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to the legendary 'Supreme God'?"</p><p></p><p>"Supreme God?"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the numerous true gods turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of the world, when the first chief god, the God of Light, was born, there had been rumors of a "Supreme God".</p><p></p><p>It was said that the "Supreme God" created everything, and even the "Chief God Realms" possessed by the chief gods were bestowed by the Supreme God.</p><p></p><p>Why was the number of chief gods fixed at twenty-four? It was because to become a chief god, one had to possess a chief god realm.</p><p></p><p>And there were only twenty-four chief god realms.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, only when a previous chief god fell would a new chief god be born.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, there had been several instances of chief gods disappearing, and soon after, a new chief god realm corresponding to that chief god would condense in the world.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>Just as the true gods were discussing among themselves, the God of Divination, whose aura and divine body had fallen to rock bottom, barely managed to hold on.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of fear flashed in the God of Divination's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had used the means of time reversal to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wanted to trace the origins of the Dragon Mountain Patriarch, but didn't see any useful images. He was hit by the backlash and only now recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme God?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination also immediately thought of the Supreme God.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Dragon Mountain Patriarch obtained a fateful opportunity related to the Supreme God?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination took a deep breath. He didn't believe the Dragon Mountain Patriarch was the Supreme God, because if that were truly the case, the previous events would not have happened at all. </p><p></p><p>Given the Supreme God's status, with a single word, even principal gods like them would have to obediently follow orders. How could he possibly still abduct demigods in the mortal world?</p><p></p><p>"A fateful opportunity related to the Supreme God..." A trace of desire flashed deep in the God of Divination's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>The many clansmen of the Dragon Mountain family also received the news. In recent years, using Dragon Mountain Ridge as a starting point, the Dragon Mountain family's influence radiated throughout the entire Wanguo Plateau.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they made friends with many demigods.</p><p></p><p>And a large portion of the demigods had connections with the true gods in the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>As such, the news that the incarnations of hundreds of true gods descended and were all killed by the Dragon Mountain Patriarch quickly spread to the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch killed the incarnations of hundreds of true gods?"</p><p></p><p>Many elders of the Dragon Mountain family were shocked. They had watched the Dragon Mountain family grow step by step from a former viscount power to what it was today.</p><p></p><p>These elders were even able to live so long thanks to the grace of the Dragon Mountain Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how highly these family elders regarded their own Patriarch, when they learned that the lofty true gods were like ants before Lin Yuan, they were still stunned.</p><p></p><p>How is this possible?</p><p></p><p>Isn't it said that everything below true gods are ants?</p><p></p><p>How come now the true gods have become ants?</p><p></p><p>"My son... has become a god?" Long Shanfang said blankly. His level was not high and he was unaware that becoming a god and establishing a divine kingdom could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>But for Long Shanyuan to so easily slay hundreds of divine power incarnations, the only possibility was that he had also become a god.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Yuan..." Long Shanfang's wife was also filled with disbelief. She still remembered the original Long Shanyuan, a good-for-nothing wastrel. Now he had actually reached such heights.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has not become a god."</p><p></p><p>Long Shanling took the initiative to stand out and say.</p><p></p><p>This was also the information disclosed by the Pope of Order, so it shouldn't be false.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, any expert who becomes a god must immediately enter the Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss. This was an iron law among the gods.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Dragon Mountain Patriarch was still in the main hall's cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>The many clansmen of the Dragon Mountain family looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Most of them did not understand the significance of what had happened, but their hearts were filled with even more respect and admiration for the Dragon Mountain Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Main God Hall.</p><p></p><p>Figures appeared on the twenty-four thrones.</p><p></p><p>These figures were all principal gods, not only including the principal gods of the Ocean of Light, but even the principal gods of the Dark Abyss were gathering.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ocean of Light and Dark Abyss were of different factions and had engaged in several divine wars over the long years...</p><p></p><p>But that was for the true gods below the principal gods. In the eyes of the principal gods, whether it was the Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss, there was no difference.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-four principal gods were essentially at the same level of existence, and there was no irreconcilable hatred between them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing the fateful opportunity related to the Supreme God, they gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"Divination, is that Dragon Mountain Patriarch really related to the Supreme God?" A figure shrouded in darkness said in a deep voice. He was a Dark Principal God.</p><p></p><p>He was the second principal god born between heaven and earth. The Light Principal God opened up the Ocean of Light, while the Dark Abyss was opened up by him.</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't related to the Supreme God, how could I have fallen to such a state?" The God of Divination's aura was weak.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had forcibly resisted the backlash, the God of Divination had exhausted his foundation, and even his divine kingdom was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Without a million years, such losses could not be recovered at all.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The Dark Principal God's eyes flickered, but he did not continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>"What level is the Dragon Mountain Patriarch at now?" At this time, a figure shrouded in endless light spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I can confirm that the Dragon Mountain Patriarch is still a ninth-level lifeform. What made me suffer the backlash did not come from the Dragon Mountain Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Mountain Patriarch's strength is greater than any of us." The Goddess of the Magic Web said coldly, her eyes icy.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, she had descended an incarnation, wanting to communicate with the Dragon Mountain Patriarch, only to be annihilated by a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Through this brief exchange, the Goddess of the Magic Web vaguely determined the Dragon Mountain Patriarch's strength.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he hasn't completely surpassed the ninth level, everything can be discussed." A principal god with an ethereal figure said. He glanced at the other twenty-three principal gods. "Everyone, how should we face this Dragon Mountain Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>The twenty-three principal gods looked at each other and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-four principal gods had lived for long years, and even their own emotions had been worn away by ninety percent. But at this moment, their desire was reignited.</p><p></p><p>The desire for the fateful opportunity related to the Supreme God.</p><p></p><p>This had a high possibility of helping them take a step further, surpassing the other principal gods.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there would be no distinction between the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss in the world.</p><p></p><p>"You want to deal with that Dragon Mountain Patriarch and seize the fateful opportunity related to the Supreme God?" The God of Divination knew the principal gods' intentions.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he also had this idea. Who didn't want to go a step further? It's just that with the God of Divination's current state, it was only a thought.</p><p></p><p>"In dealing with the Dragon Mountain Patriarch, we need to be careful and then more careful. Don't forget, he is in the mortal world. Even if we join hands, if we don't obtain the Supreme God's opportunity, the mortal world might be shattered."</p><p></p><p>Another principal god spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Supreme God's opportunity or the possibility of advancing further.</p><p></p><p>But the living beings of the mortal world were the foundation of the principal gods.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"We need to find a reason to trick the Dragon Mountain Patriarch into the Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss."</p><p></p><p>The other principal gods nodded slightly. Only in the depths of multi-layered spaces like the Ocean of Light and Dark Abyss could they act without restraint.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still in closed-door cultivation, comprehending the demigod realm.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens. Observing the essence of the world's laws, your understanding of space continues to rise.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens. Observing the essence of the world's laws, your understanding of space continues to rise.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens. Observing the essence of the world's laws, your understanding of space continues to rise.]</p><p></p><p>With a large amount of understanding merging into his heart, it finally caused a qualitative change. Lin Yuan suddenly realized and thoroughly understood the fundamental level of the spatial essence of this world.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The world within his body also began to change, turning the world upside down.</p>

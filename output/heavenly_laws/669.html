        <h1>Chapter 669</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, extremely obedient.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he faced a Time Life, although he had obtained the Thirteen Tier inheritance "Infinite Void" from the Chaotic Void, as well as the Thirteen Tier weapon Heavenly Void Cauldron, both of which were related to Time Life.</p><p></p><p>But the Thirteen Tier existences behind him had never paid attention to him, let alone directly communicate with him face-to-face.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that every Pinnacle Celestial Lord who exchanges the opportunity to possess the Progenitor will receive some guidance from the Progenitor after seeing them. As a Time Life, the Progenitor can observe various futures, and the guidance they provide is based on the future of the Pinnacle Celestial Lord themselves."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, he also yearned for the guidance of a Time Life.</p><p></p><p>After all, this kind of guidance that can see the precise future is a form of trial and error.</p><p></p><p>Previously in the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan had comprehended the Heavenly Void Cauldron, and through the power of this Thirteen Tier weapon, he had seen glimpses of his own future.</p><p></p><p>But those glimpses were just fragments, containing extremely incomplete information, and the future timelines involved might only be a tiny possibility.</p><p></p><p>The reference value was not great.</p><p></p><p>The futures observed by the Thirteen Tier Progenitors, however, were extremely detailed, and they could even determine multiple possibilities by observing various future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not worried about the "Gate of All Worlds" being exposed.</p><p></p><p>When he crossed into the Twelfth Tier, the information that surged out from the depths of the Gate of All Worlds clearly stated that the Gate of All Worlds transcended all timelines, and did not exist in the past, present, or future.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan actively activated the Gate of All Worlds, causing its aura to linger in a certain dimension, it could be detected by the Thirteen Tier Time Life of that dimension. Otherwise, there was absolutely no possibility of it being exposed.</p><p></p><p>And since his arrival in this Source World, Lin Yuan had never actively activated the Gate of All Worlds, nor had he used the power of the Dimensional Source.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what my future looks like in the Progenitor's eyes, and how likely it is for me to cross into the Thirteenth Tier."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Theoretically speaking, every Twelfth Tier Perfected Being had the hope of crossing into the Thirteenth Tier, but theory was just theory.</p><p></p><p>Some Twelfth Tier Perfected Beings might only have one chance in a million, or ten million future timelines, to accidentally cross into the Thirteenth Tier. This was the probability of crossing into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the probability of one out of a million or ten million future timelines having a Thirteenth Tier crossing was already considered high. For more Twelfth Tier Perfected Beings, there might not be a single timeline in billions or trillions of timelines where they could cross into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan's quiet waiting, the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, who was observing the future timelines, had an increasingly astonished gaze.</p><p></p><p>"These futures?" The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun could not believe it. "I have observed dozens of timelines, and in each timeline, this young man eventually crosses into the Thirteenth Tier."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun was a bit dazed. For other Twelfth Tier Perfected Beings, they would have to painstakingly search through billions and trillions of future timelines to find one where they could cross into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. In the dozens of timelines the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun randomly observed, the outcome was always Lin Yuan crossing into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>This kind of future was truly terrifying. Although the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun had not observed all of Lin Yuan's future timelines, just from these dozens of timelines, Lin Yuan had a high probability of crossing into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>Crossing into the Thirteenth Tier? High probability? The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"I founded the Ancient Kingdom, left behind many inheritance secrets, and devoted myself to cultivating my descendants over countless years, but I have never managed to cultivate a Thirteenth Tier being."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's thoughts expanded. Not only the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, but the other five Ancient Kingdoms were the same.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the six Progenitors reached a conclusion: Thirteenth Tier Time Lives could not be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>With the Progenitors' abilities, they could cultivate the strongest Celestial Lord realm experts, but Thirteenth Tier? That required luck.</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom had indeed given birth to two Progenitor-level existences, but their relationship with the Great Abyss Progenitor was not very close. Those two Progenitors did not hold a particularly high position in the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom before crossing into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Abyss Progenitor himself did not pay much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>The descendants the Great Abyss Progenitor valued were now trapped in the time loop, while the ones he did not pay attention to became Progenitors.</p><p></p><p>"But him..."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun looked at Lin Yuan, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>Through observing dozens of future timelines, the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun had concluded that Lin Yuan becoming a Thirteenth Tier being was almost a certainty, whether or not he joined the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom royal family. He would become a Progenitor-level existence in the future.</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun calmed himself and began to try looking into other timelines.</p><p></p><p>Every moment would branch out into different timelines, representing countless possibilities.</p><p></p><p>And the timelines the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun was now looking at were the ones where he tried to intervene and suppress Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun did not have such an intention. Lin Yuan, after all, was a member of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom royal family, and would become a Progenitor in the future, so he would naturally have a close relationship with him.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun not only would not hinder Lin Yuan's growth, but would also try his best to help Lin Yuan smoothly cross into the Thirteenth Tier.</p><p></p><p>But the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun was simply too curious about Lin Yuan. This almost certain future of crossing into the Thirteenth Tier made him start to make more attempts.</p><p></p><p>The timelines rapidly branched out, all of them with the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun trying to suppress and kill Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this type of future timeline, at first he was indeed able to successfully suppress and kill this Silver Galaxy Celestial Lord. As a Thirteenth Tier Time Life, he had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>But just after tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of years, the Silver Galaxy Celestial Lord would "resurrect" and reappear in the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The resurrected Silver Galaxy Celestial Lord had already crossed into the Thirteenth Tier, entering the realm of the six Progenitors.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to prevent him from crossing into the Thirteenth Tier? Even when I personally intervene to kill him, I can't do it? Will he return through some means, and by the time he returns, he will have already crossed into the Thirteenth Tier?"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun took a deep breath, his scalp tingling.</p><p></p><p>So far, from the hundreds of future timelines he had observed, Lin Yuan crossing into the Thirteenth Tier was almost a certainty.</p><p></p><p>And no one could stop it. Even if the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun personally intervened to kill him, it would only delay Lin Yuan's crossing into the Thirteenth Tier by a few hundred thousand or a few million years, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, my Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is about to give birth to a Time Life."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's face broke into a smile. Although Lin Yuan's almost absolute future left him feeling incredulous, it was good news for himself.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the six Progenitors of this Source World were not entirely harmonious, and occasionally there were conflicts involving the layout of the future.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy." The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun sat cross-legged, smiling at this young Silver Galaxy Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Venerable.</p><p></p><p>After clearly seeing the many future timelines of Lin Yuan, the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun has basically regarded the other party as a peer-level powerhouse, without the slightest sense of superiority as a Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>Especially when the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun discovered that he could not suppress Lin Yuan at all, let alone put on any airs.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect fusion of two Thirteenth-Tier techniques, one of which is a Void Thirteenth-Tier that has never appeared in this world before? Silver River, your talent is the highest I have seen among all living beings." The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun smiled and praised without reservation: "In my opinion, Silver River, you will soon become the seventh Progenitor of this world. Have you thought of a name for the ancient country you will establish?"</p><p></p><p>"Establish an ancient country?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He never thought that the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's first sentence would be this.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun noticed that Lin Yuan had cultivated the "Infinite Void" inheritance, which did not surprise Lin Yuan, as for a time life, anything below the Thirteenth-Tier is basically no secret.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had even prepared an explanation for how he obtained the "Infinite Void" inheritance.</p><p></p><p>But the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun didn't even ask about these.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor," Lin Yuan immediately said, "Establishing an ancient country is too far away for me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun nodded. "The most important thing for you now is to quickly break through to the Thirteenth-Tier and transform into a time life."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to break through to the Thirteenth-Tier, but I'm not very confident about breaking through the time loop." Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Chaotic Void or this Source World, there are countless brilliant Twelfth-Tier Perfected Beings trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan has made many arrangements for his own breakthrough to the Thirteenth-Tier, such as spreading the path of martial dao evolution, etc., he still doesn't have much confidence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this is normal. Before breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier, no being has the confidence to definitely break through.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, you don't need to worry about these," the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun thought for a while and said to Lin Yuan, "Just calm your mind."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The challenges that appear in the time loop are things he has never encountered before, and even if he worries, it won't be of much use. Calming the mind is the most appropriate.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor, about the inheritance I cultivate..." Lin Yuan wanted to explain the origin of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>"No need." </p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun shook his head and said, "This is your secret, you don't have to explain it to me."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun continued, "In fact, at the Thirteenth-Tier level, so-called secrets are nothing. The first being born at the beginning of this world is called 'Abyss Dragon'."</p><p></p><p>"His talent was truly terrifying. Every particle of his body contained a vast world, and a casual strike could sweep away all the powerhouses at the time, but in the end, he was still easily subdued by the Great Ancestor, right?" </p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Abyss Dragon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the "Dragon Abyss Blood" he had just obtained.</p><p></p><p>From this precious treasure, he vaguely sensed the terrifying power of the primordial being "Abyss Dragon", but now, hearing the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's description, the horror of Abyss Dragon was even beyond his estimation? At least, the implication of the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun was that his current strength, with the universe within him and the Chaotic Taiji Dao, was not stronger than that Abyss Dragon?</p><p></p><p>"Of course, compared to you, Silver River, the talent of Abyss Dragon is nothing."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun said.</p><p></p><p>For the great Venerable Celestial Sovereigns, the so-called talent is bloodline, secret techniques, and various divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>But for Progenitors like the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, the truly invincible talent is the possibility of breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>And in this regard, who can compare to Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, this time you came, is it to possess a body?" The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun seemed to have remembered something and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had been in a state of shock since seeing Lin Yuan, and had temporarily overlooked this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He came this time precisely to possess the Progenitor, to experience the perspective of a time life, and to accumulate more foundation for his own breakthrough to the Thirteenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>"You don't plan to break through to the Thirteenth-Tier in the near future, do you?" The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun thought for a while and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's plan, at least until his path of martial dao evolution has been fully spread throughout the six ancient countries of this Source World, will he consider rushing to the Thirteenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>This is the fastest scenario, and it's possible that Lin Yuan will continue to wait and explore the remaining Source World a little more.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier is no small matter. He only has two possibilities: success or being trapped in the time loop. Given that he is not sure whether the Myriad Worlds Gate can resist the time loop or not, Lin Yuan naturally wants to prepare as thoroughly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"I have a suggestion for you." The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun looked at Lin Yuan, "Of course, it's just a suggestion."</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Progenitor." Lin Yuan responded immediately, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Any suggestion that the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun would personally give, Lin Yuan would listen to attentively.</p><p></p><p>"With your accumulated foundation, you don't need to possess a body so soon. You can wait until just before your breakthrough to the Thirteenth-Tier to come and possess a body." The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun said.</p><p></p><p>Many of the supreme Venerable Celestial Sovereigns of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country have redeemed possession opportunities multiple times, but Lin Yuan is different from them. Early or repeated possession may actually have an impact on him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't know why the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun gave this suggestion, he must have a specific reason for it, so Lin Yuan will just follow the advice.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, Progenitor, the trillion merit points I redeemed..." Lin Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He had used a trillion merit points to redeem before coming.</p><p></p><p>"Trillion merit points?" The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun grinned, "When you go back, you can freely choose any of the many inheritances in the treasury, without needing to pay merit points."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he was still struggling over which two of the six supreme inheritances he should choose, as the three trillion merit points, after deducting the trillion for possession, could only redeem two at most.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Progenitor's words, the entire ancient country's treasury is basically open for Lin Yuan to take.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor, I don't know what the possibility of my future breakthrough to the Thirteenth-Tier is?" Before leaving, Lin Yuan still asked this question.</p><p></p><p>As a time life, the Progenitor should have an understanding of Lin Yuan's chances of breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>"The possibility of breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier..."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun looked at Lin Yuan. This was a question that almost every supreme Venerable Celestial Sovereign who came to possess a body would ask.</p><p></p><p>And the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun's answer to this was usually encouraging and exhorting, because the chances of those Venerable Celestial Sovereigns breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier were indeed very slim. At least, the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun would have to slowly watch through countless trillions of timelines to find that breakthrough timeline.</p><p></p><p>But when facing Lin Yuan's question,</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Blazing Sun briefly pondered and then said, "Very high."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

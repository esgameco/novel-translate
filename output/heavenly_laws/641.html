        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Flame World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up and observed the majestic figure standing at the highest point of the world, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Since the formation of the great circulation of the Blazing Sun Seed within him, Lin Yuan's position in this Flame World had risen significantly.</p><p></p><p>He could now observe the majestic figure in greater detail.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable, truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The more he observed, the more Lin Yuan felt his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>The majestic figure stood there silently, doing nothing.</p><p></p><p>Yet the aura it naturally exuded had a profound impact on him.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the peerless great saints of the Chaotic Void have spent their entire lives pursuing the footsteps of time life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not only could a single word of guidance from the time life benefit the peerless great saints greatly, but the mere existence of the time life itself could allow the great saints to witness even greater sceneries.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I cannot stay here for long."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Yuan sensed his spiritual will gradually becoming distorted, as if it wanted to fuse with the surrounding flames. He hastily retreated.</p><p></p><p>While he could observe the subtle mysteries of the thirteen levels in this Mysterious Flame World, he could not reside there permanently, or else he would be assimilated.</p><p></p><p>Once assimilated, Lin Yuan would be completely merged into that Flame World, unable to return to his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"If I could get closer to the Ancestor, I would see even more of the mysteries of the thirteen levels." Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This would be far more powerful than the drop of Time Blood left behind by the Lord of the Magical Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Time Blood originated from the Extraordinary Life, and the Extraordinary Life was merely a product of the Chaotic Void, not a true Thirteen-Level Life.</p><p></p><p>Their bloodline possessed only a trace of time power talent, which was their limit, nowhere near the true Time Life.</p><p></p><p>"In ten years, I have condensed over a hundred Blazing Sun Seeds, but my position in this Flame World has not changed. Do I have to wait for the formation of an even greater circulation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, noting that after the thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-third Blazing Sun Seed, the difficulty of condensing subsequent seeds had decreased significantly, with over a hundred being condensed in just ten years, averaging one every one or two months.</p><p></p><p>After the thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-third seed, Lin Yuan had little experience to draw from, as only eighteen royal members of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country had possessed such a quantity of Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>And even those eighteen royal members had spent countless years condensing the thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three seeds, without the energy to continue condensing more.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in no rush, I'll take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, even if he were to eventually enter the Chaotic Realm, he had no intention of abandoning the condensation of the Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yin!"</p><p></p><p>In a hidden corner of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, Lin Yuan's avatar sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>Before him floated droplets of the Venerable Ones' essence blood, containing the fundamental fragments of the Mysterious Yin Dao.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was simultaneously contemplating and comparing it to the Blazing Yang Dao, while also attempting to integrate it with the inheritance of "Blazing Yang, Mysterious Yin, Chaos".</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the contemplation of the Mysterious Yin Dao helps to supplement the Yin, and has a driving effect on the nurturing of the Chaotic Yin, Yang, and Taiji."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought as he looked at the droplets of Venerable Ones' essence blood.</p><p></p><p>He was constantly observing the universe within him, the giant egg formed by the accumulation of Chaotic Second Realm rules, containing the essence of the Chaotic Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, when Lin Yuan first began contemplating the Mysterious Yin Dao, he had sensed that it would take a millennium for the Chaotic Taiji Dao to evolve.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the continuous contemplation of the Mysterious Yin Dao and its fusion with the Blazing Yang, Lin Yuan clearly felt that the Chaotic Taiji Dao would be able to evolve successfully in no more than five thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Ten years of contemplating the Mysterious Yin had saved him four thousand nine hundred and ninety years of effort, which Lin Yuan considered a worthwhile investment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the contemplation of the Mysterious Yin Dao not only accelerated the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Dao, but also enriched Lin Yuan's own rule comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Mysterious Yin Dao or the Blazing Yang Dao, they were both great ways that had given birth to Thirteen-Level Time Lives, worthy of Lin Yuan's time and effort to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past few years, I've obtained the essence blood of nearly two hundred Venerables, and it hasn't caused too much of a stir so far."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around, feeling quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The current result was due to two factors: first, he had not been too overbearing, and even when taking the essence blood, he left behind equally valuable treasures, which had silenced most of the Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Lin Yuan's methods were exceptional. Perhaps the Heavenly Sovereign of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country's capital already knew of this, but they had not yet pinpointed Lin Yuan's location, and since he had only taken the essence blood without any other extreme actions, they were still observing him in secret.</p><p></p><p>"If Mysterious Yin and Blazing Yang can be perfectly fused, it will become a brand-new Thirteen-Level Dao, just like the fusion of Yin and Yang into the Taiji."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the droplets of Venerable Ones' essence blood, cross-referencing them with the Blazing Yang Dao, while also integrating the Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body and main self were also in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor is summoning me?" Lin Yuan looked towards the imperial palace, then suddenly realized, "It seems it's time to set out for that new treasure land."</p><p></p><p>A new first-class treasure land had been born, not within the territory of any of the six ancient countries, so the six ancient countries would compete to gain control over it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There will be a struggle between the nations.</p><p></p><p>Since it is a struggle, and a struggle within the rules, then it is not too urgent.</p><p></p><p>All the major ancient countries need to gather their own Heavenly Venerable-level experts, and many Heavenly Venerables are in seclusion, so they may not be able to come out in the short term, which is why there is a ten-year time limit.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, no matter who the first-class treasure land ends up with, it will definitely be one of the six ancient countries. Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then came to the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country sat on the throne, and the Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable, the Vast Flame Heavenly Venerable, and other peak Heavenly Venerables had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you're here?" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country looked at Lin Yuan and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable and the Vast Flame Heavenly Venerable also nodded towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the twelve Heavenly Venerables participating in the treasure land struggle had gathered.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country spoke: "I'm sure you all know how to fight for the treasure land."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly below.</p><p></p><p>Each treasure land has its own space, containing a certain amount of 'cores' within.</p><p></p><p>The more 'cores' of the treasure land one refines, the higher the control over the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this control is only relative control. Even if all the 'cores' of the treasure land are refined, it may not be able to block the invasion of other experts.</p><p></p><p>For example, when Lin Yuan was guarding the Black Jade Nest, the Extreme Cold Heavenly Venerable and the Northern Yin Heavenly Venerable still managed to infiltrate it, right?</p><p></p><p>But the struggle for the treasure land among the six ancient countries will be maintained at a certain intensity, so it will be based on refining the 'cores' of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years later, whoever has refined the most 'cores' of the treasure land will own the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>So, the fight for the treasure land is not about who is stronger.</p><p></p><p>It's about who can find the 'cores' of the treasure land faster and refine them at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>And it's not enough to just refine the 'cores' of the treasure land, you also have to defend them.</p><p></p><p>After the 'cores' of the treasure land are refined, it is not completely safe, and they can still be re-refined by other Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send you there." </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country looked at the twelve Heavenly Venerables. Long before, the capital of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country had established a spatial transmission node outside the newly born treasure land, through which they could be transported there at any time.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it's good if you can seize it, but don't feel pressured if you can't." The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country comforted them as he led the twelve Heavenly Venerables to the spatial transmission area.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable, Lin Yuan, and the other Heavenly Venerables stepped into the spatial transmission array.</p><p></p><p>The space quickly changed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the infinite distance being stretched, and after nearly twenty breaths, the spatial fluctuations finally came to a sudden stop.</p><p></p><p>"We're here."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable scanned the surroundings and stepped out of the spatial transmission area.</p><p></p><p>"The environment is much worse than the Cyan Burning Domain." Lin Yuan was also observing.</p><p></p><p>Before descending to this Source World, Lin Yuan had already observed the entire Source World through the perspective of the Multiversal Gate.</p><p></p><p>From the overall perspective, the Source World is an endless continent, and the six ancient countries occupy the most central, prosperous, and fertile regions of the continent.</p><p></p><p>That is where many rare treasures are nurtured, and most of the treasure lands are also born there.</p><p></p><p>As for the areas outside the six ancient countries, they are largely desolate, which is why the six ancient countries compete with each other but do not expand outwards.</p><p></p><p>There is no point.</p><p></p><p>But even in the desolate areas, rare treasures will occasionally be born.</p><p></p><p>But a first-class treasure land? To be honest, before the appearance of this first-class treasure land, the Heavenly Venerables of the six ancient countries basically did not think that a first-class treasure land would be born in the barren and desolate areas.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence, there is a time reversal area outside the newly born first-class treasure land, and only those who have reached the ninth level of Spatial-Temporal Comprehension can pass through the time reversal area and enter the treasure land."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the treasure land attracted the great Venerable-level experts exploring the surrounding area, but almost all the great Venerables were sent back by the time reversal area.</p><p></p><p>Spatial-Temporal Fusion at the ninth level? Although the rules comprehension is easier in this Source World, to reach the Spatial-Temporal ninth level is still extremely difficult, and basically only Heavenly Venerables can do it.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Venerables? They wouldn't even bother exploring the desolate areas outside the six ancient countries. As Heavenly Venerable-level experts allied with a certain ancient country, they can already enjoy many welfare benefits, so there's no need to waste time in the desolate areas.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the treasure land, you must all disperse and find the 'cores' of the treasure land as quickly as possible. Once you find them, notify me, and I will refine them."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation is the highest, and his speed of refining the 'cores' of the treasure land is also the fastest. Even if discovered by the Heavenly Venerables of other ancient countries, he has the best chance of defending the 'cores' of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The other Heavenly Venerables also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable felt a little more relaxed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The key to the struggle for the treasure land is cooperation, not fierce competition with the enemies, but refining more 'cores' of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Given the Emperor's regard for Silver River, he probably doesn't want him to suffer any injuries that are difficult to heal in the struggle. I'd better pay more attention."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Venerable glanced at Lin Yuan, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

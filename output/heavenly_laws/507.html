        <h1>Chapter 507</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates, their gaze calmly returned to the now tranquil river surface.</p><p></p><p>The majority of the attention of the Nine Supremes was focused on the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>It was only after seeing one Twelfth Realm Ultimate after another disappear that the Nine Supremes inexplicably let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Should we still go find the Tianyu Clan, the Prison Clan, the Insect Clan, and demand an explanation from them?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Ancient Power asked in a low voice. This was the purpose of their hurried arrival.</p><p></p><p>So many Twelfth Realm Ultimates bullying the small, daring to attack the Galactic Overlord, how could they not demand an explanation?</p><p></p><p>"Demand an explanation?" </p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Supreme couldn't help but glance at the Supreme Ancient Power.</p><p></p><p>If things had developed as they had anticipated, with the Galactic Overlord's avatar being extinguished, they would certainly demand an explanation and make those alien Twelfth Realm Ultimates pay dearly.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was not so.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Supreme even felt a bit of sympathy for the Tianyu Clan's ancestor, Tianyu Chen, who had suffered such heavy injuries, and his chances of weathering the coming Universal Cataclysm were now very slim.</p><p></p><p>At this time, demanding an explanation... Xuanyuan the Supreme was worried that it might completely provoke the Tianyu Clan, leading to an all-out war between the peak clans.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it," </p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Supreme shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This matter was indeed initiated by the alien Twelfth Realm Ultimates, but with Tianyu Chen's fate, Xuanyuan the Supreme felt it was enough.</p><p></p><p>After today, the Tianyu Clan would be equivalent to losing a Twelfth Realm Ultimate, and Tianyu Chen would be in hiding for a long time, and the Tianyu Clan's peak clan power would inevitably contract.</p><p></p><p>The vacated territories, no other clan would dare to compete with the Human Civilization for.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>Before long, the topic of the Nine Supremes of the Human Civilization turned to Lin Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>The power Lin Yuan displayed when facing more than a dozen Twelfth Realm Ultimates had completely shattered the cognitive perceptions of the Nine Supremes.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Supremes of the Human Civilization thought they knew Lin Yuan very well, far better than those alien Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Because the Nine Supremes had all witnessed the many rule models encompassed by the Eleventh Realm of the Dao, and were clear that Lin Yuan's attainment in rules was superior to theirs.</p><p></p><p>While those alien Twelfth Realm Ultimates only knew about the rule models, they had never seen them in person. Even if they speculated that the Galactic Overlord was the founder of the Dao, their understanding of Lin Yuan's rule comprehension was at most just speculation.</p><p></p><p>But including Xuanyuan the Supreme, they had never imagined that Lin Yuan's strength would be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Rule comprehension is one thing, but the composition of strength is not entirely determined by rule comprehension. An ordinary person, even if they comprehend the rules of space and time, what can they do? With a low base of personal power, it is difficult to pose a threat to highly evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the Galactic Overlord's avatar, if it's the true main body..."</p><p></p><p>The Void God Supreme's tone was filled with astonishment. Tianyu Chen's heavy injuries were largely due to the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>But in the main universe, Lin Yuan, with just two Divine Spirits, was able to suppress Tianyu Chen, which was already very telling.</p><p></p><p>If both Divine Spirits were like this, if the true body were to be deployed, Tianyu Chen would likely be facing a formidable foe.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Galactic Overlord is of our Human Civilization."</p><p></p><p>The Featherfly Supreme muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>The other Supremes heard this and deeply agreed.</p><p></p><p>If those alien races had produced a prodigy like the Galactic Overlord, the Nine Supremes would likely have been restless.</p><p></p><p>But now, it is those alien Twelfth Realm Ultimates who are restless because of the Galactic Overlord's existence.</p><p></p><p>In the Prison Clan, the Twelfth Realm Ultimate Fan Hou was greatly shocked. He had witnessed the battle between Tianyu Chen and the Galactic Overlord, from the universe to the River of Time space.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Galactic Overlord be so strong?" Fan Hou found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Although Tianyu Chen's heavy injuries stemmed from the River of Time, if the Galactic Overlord had not dragged him into it, it would not have been so.</p><p></p><p>And to forcibly drag a Twelfth Realm Ultimate into the River of Time, was that so easy to accomplish?</p><p></p><p>"If I had been the one to attack then..." Fan Hou's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>After performing the secret technique 'Worship the Nine Suns', his own foundation had been weakened.</p><p></p><p>If he had not been cautious and withdrawn from the attack on the Galactic Overlord under the pretext of injury...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Tianyu Chen was able to break free from the constraints of the River of Time because he was originally in a flourishing state.</p><p></p><p>But him, Fan Hou? With his foundation weakened, and then being dragged into the River of Time, even if he ultimately broke free, the injuries he sustained would likely exceed Tianyu Chen's, and his chances of weathering the Universal Cataclysm would be minuscule.</p><p></p><p>"This has become troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Fan Hou's thoughts scattered, and he soon thought of even more distant and broader implications.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord had not yet entered the Twelfth Realm, yet had such strength. When he does enter the Twelfth Realm, what then? At that time, won't the universe and starry skies be dominated by the Human Civilization? Won't their peak clan powers have to hide in their strongholds, daring not to come out?</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"They're summoning me?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Hou's expression shifted slightly as he received a message from the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>The content was roughly about how to deal with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was about how to deal with the Galactic Overlord after he enters the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Galactic Overlord's strength, though monstrous, was at most equivalent to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Twelfth Realm Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>The means used to severely injure Tian Yu Chen were also aided by the long river of time, and even with precautions, it could not be replicated on other Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But what about the future? What will happen when the Galactic Overlord crosses into the Twelfth Realm?</p><p></p><p>Everyone is a Twelfth Realm Ultimate, aware of the extent of the leap in the essence of life from the Eleventh Realm to the Twelfth Realm. At that time, the Galactic Overlord's strength will undoubtedly surge by a huge margin.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Domain.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious and unknowable place.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden hut, the scene of the battle between the Galactic Overlord and Tian Yu Chen repeatedly flashed back.</p><p></p><p>"Monstrous, too monstrous," the Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden hut muttered continuously. The Galactic Overlord's strength far exceeded his expectations, making no sense at all.</p><p></p><p>"Not even a thousand years old, yet possessing such strength. Could it be that the Galactic Overlord is the reincarnation of a certain supreme Sage?" The voice from inside the wooden hut was also filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The origins of the Calamity Clan are vast, hiding in the universe, passing through one universe era after another.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Chaotic Void, the Chaotic Continent opened up by the Chaotic Lords themselves will have a day of decline, but the Calamity Clan can almost achieve eternal existence within the universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe will indeed enter destruction, but it will not be completely destroyed. After the great destruction, it will be reborn, ushering in the next universe era.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as the Chaotic Sages, who can make a universe collapse prematurely and enter the great destruction, they cannot prevent the rebirth of the universe.</p><p></p><p>To completely erase a universe, even the perfect time life cannot achieve, as it requires confronting the fundamental Dao of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>And the Calamity Clan, with the ability to enter the next universe era, apart from being hated by the will of the universe, has almost no natural enemies within the universe.</p><p></p><p>But the universal consciousness is only instinctive and will not make a concerted effort to deal with the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>"The reincarnation of a supreme Sage?" The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden hut fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>At the level of the Chaotic Sage, as long as a trace of true spirit does not perish, they can undergo "reincarnation." The reincarnated Chaotic Sage will wash away all of their own, even their memories will be eroded.</p><p></p><p>But as long as they reach a certain realm or touch a certain prerequisite, they can recover some memories and then rise rapidly.</p><p></p><p>However, there are too few Chaotic Sages who can undergo reincarnation. With the strength of the Chaotic Sages, who can force them to reincarnate?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, reincarnation is not without risk. If the first reincarnation fails to recover the memories, the possibility of recovering memories in subsequent reincarnations will become lower and lower.</p><p></p><p>In this way, when the number of reincarnations reaches a certain level, there will no longer be the possibility of recovering.</p><p></p><p>And this is no different from complete demise.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden hut, although feeling that the chance of encountering the reincarnation of a Chaotic Sage is extremely low, the current performance of the Galactic Overlord can only be roughly explained by the reincarnation of a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps," the Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden hut thought for a while and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The battle in front of the space-time black hole, where a Twelfth Realm Ultimate existence personally intervened to deal with the Galactic Overlord, ultimately returned empty-handed, and the ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan, Tian Yu Chen, was suppressed by the Galactic Overlord and finally dragged into the river of time, suffering a severe blow.</p><p></p><p>It spread like a hurricane through the universe's star realms and tribes.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord brutally attacked the ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan?"</p><p>"An Eleventh Realm brutally attacked a Twelfth Realm?"</p><p>"I don't believe it, I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the star realms felt incredible disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Eleventh Realm experts did indeed feel the fluctuations of the battle at the Twelfth Realm level, but they never imagined that one of them was the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>However, as this kind of rumor continued to spread, none of the Twelfth Realm Ultimates refuted it.</p><p></p><p>Especially the ancestors of the Tian Yu Clan, who did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the universe's star realms finally realized that this matter might be true.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord's brutal attack on the ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan was essentially using the ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan as a stepping stone.</p><p></p><p>If there was even a hint of falsehood, the ancestors of the Tian Yu Clan would certainly have refuted it, and the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates would not have allowed such unfounded rumors to circulate.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization domain, as many Evolutions and high-level citizens were debating the relationship between the Galactic Overlord and the Martial Dao Founder, they received this news.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord suppressed a Twelfth Realm Ultimate?" Qiu Kun, the Patriarch of the Qiu Kun lineage, was instructing several peak masters when he heard this news. He blinked his eyes, unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Each word in this news he recognized, but how they were combined together made it so unfamiliar. Suppressing a Twelfth Realm Ultimate? His junior disciple? "The Galactic Overlord I sparred with on the arena can now brutally attack Twelfth Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Yang Saint Child, upon hearing the news from Wan Yang Patriarch, was also overwhelmingly shocked, even though he had long since stopped considering the Galactic Overlord as an opponent.</p><p></p><p>As the news spread through human civilization, countless Evolutions were boiling with excitement. This was even more shocking than the battles between the Twelfth Realms.</p><p></p><p>To suppress a Twelfth Realm with an Eleventh Realm, it was like an ant shaking the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>How mighty is his aura?</p><p></p><p>His aura is supreme!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

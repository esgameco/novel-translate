        <h1>Chapter 649</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Chaotic Continent became increasingly prosperous, and even Chaotic Saints of the highest level would occasionally visit Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Among the Chaotic Saints, they would occasionally exchange and verify the Chaotic paths they had evolved. Lin Yuan also valued this greatly.</p><p></p><p>The power paths evolved based on Chaos, although they have differences in strength, are essentially all part of the Tao. By observing the Chaotic evolutionary paths of others, Lin Yuan was also supplementing his own understanding of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Milky Way Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, strands of Chaotic qi constantly formed secret patterns, which would dissipate quickly after a moment.</p><p></p><p>After dissipating, they would continue to condense, repeating the cycle endlessly, as if it had no end.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed himself in circulating the Chaotic qi, with part of his divine sense focused on comprehending the Chaotic secret pattern diagram.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic secret pattern diagram was condensed by the Thirteenth Ancestor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country using great divine abilities to gather the essence of the Chaotic rules. It contained the fundamental context of the Chaotic rules.</p><p></p><p>It was one of Lin Yuan's key objects of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Time passed, unknown how long.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes, and in the depths of his gaze, there was a brewing of Chaotic spiritual power. The secret pattern diagram formed by the Chaotic qi in front of him quickly became complete and clear.</p><p></p><p>If there were Celestial Emperors from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country nearby observing, they would find that this Chaotic secret pattern diagram was almost identical to the Twenty-eighth Chaotic secret pattern diagram.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic secret pattern diagrams passed down by the Blazing Sun Ancestors totaled eighty-one.</p><p></p><p>The first eight diagrams represented the First Realm of Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The diagrams from the Ninth to the Twenty-seventh represented the Second Realm of Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The Twenty-eighth Chaotic secret pattern diagram represented the Third Realm of Chaos.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan had briefly reproduced the Twenty-eighth Chaotic secret pattern diagram, indicating that his comprehension of the Chaotic rules had completely crossed into the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos evolves all things."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked spirited, and after his Chaotic comprehension reached the Third Realm, he had a clearer understanding of the essence of all things.</p><p></p><p>The basic structure of the Chaotic void, the process of Chaotic evolution, were like patterns on his palm, clear and distinct in Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"All things will eventually return to Chaos."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as he looked at the vast Chaotic void. At this moment, his realm had risen infinitely, as if he could see the countless billions of universes in the Chaotic void rotating, and one day, the entire Chaotic void would collapse like the primordial universe.</p><p></p><p>All in the Chaotic void would return to Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Not only the Chaotic void, but the Source World is also like this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, but of course he was not worried about this. For existences like the Chaotic void and the Source World, their destruction cycles were too long, longer than the lifetimes of Peerless Great Saints, which were just a drop in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>"The Third Realm of Chaotic Rules"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. A thousand years of cultivation had allowed his comprehension of the Chaotic rules to advance further, which was not unexpected.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic secret pattern diagram was of great help in comprehending the Chaotic rules, almost like taking a shortcut, no, even more convenient than a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>This was the feedback from the Thirteen Ancestors of the six ancient countries in the Source World to their offspring and all beings.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic void, it was difficult to give birth to an invincible Great Saint over tens of thousands or even hundreds of millions of universe cycles, but in the six ancient countries, there was one in every era, and the Great Ancient Country even had more than one such Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Profound Void Celestial Emperor was equivalent to the combat power of an invincible Great Saint in the Chaotic void, and there were definitely more such powerful figures in the Great Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the beings in the Chaotic void were inferior to the Source World, but the Thirteen Ancestors of the two dimensional worlds had different attitudes towards lower-level beings.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Ancestors of the Source World cared deeply and even agonized over their offspring.</p><p></p><p>While the Thirteen Time Immortals of the Chaotic void were more like letting them be.</p><p></p><p>If the Thirteen Time Immortals of the Chaotic void also left behind many inheritances and provided opportunities like "Possession", the Chaotic void would also give birth to many invincible Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"My strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed for a while.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the Chaotic rules had reached the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>This did not bring a huge and exaggerated direct increase in his strength.</p><p></p><p>But the indirect improvements were immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>First, the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Dao was accelerated. At this moment, Lin Yuan clearly noticed that the cosmic egg incubating within his body was about to completely evolve the Chaotic Taiji Dao, basically within ten years.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's divine sense was exhilarated. The Chaotic Yin Yang Taiji Dao was the ultimate path he had chosen since the Second Realm, which could be said to be the final fruit of his cultivation journey.</p><p></p><p>This fruit did not disappoint Lin Yuan. Other Great Saints and Great Emperors only needed to reach the First Realm of Chaos to evolve the Chaotic power path, but the Chaotic Taiji Dao was a threshold that could only be reached at the peak of the Second Realm of Chaos.</p><p></p><p>This was because of Lin Yuan's extraordinary aptitude. If it were other cultivators, they might have to wait until the Third Realm of Chaos before starting to evolve the Chaotic power path.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Third Realm of Chaotic Rules? Just starting to evolve the Chaotic power path? This was not a good thing for Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Because the Third Realm of Chaos was too difficult to attain, and before evolving the Chaotic power path, no matter how high the rule comprehension, it was only equivalent to a peak Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Even in the six ancient countries where rule comprehension was easier, generally only the top pinnacle Celestial Emperors could comprehend the Chaotic rules to the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>And without evolving the Chaotic power path, one could not even be a Great Emperor, the transition was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Lin Yuan, although he did not take the path of evolving the Chaotic rules, his other foundations were too solid, making up for the gap in Chaotic evolutionary power path with other Great Saints and Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Third Realm of Chaotic Rules, in addition to greatly accelerating the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Dao, also had far-reaching impacts in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>For example, the time it took to break through to the Chaotic Realm. What was currently constraining Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the Chaotic Realm was that various aspects had not yet reached their limits.</p><p></p><p>Such as physical body breakthrough, the inner universe in the soul, and so on.</p><p></p><p>And Chaos nurturing all things, the Third Realm Chaotic rules allowed Lin Yuan to be rapidly improving in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>In addition, it also helped with the cultivation of the "Infinite Void" Third Layer, as the deeper comprehension of the basic structure of the universe with the higher level Chaotic rules would make it easier and smoother.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, in the Treasure Lands.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body did not search for the core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand years, about seventy to eighty peak Celestial Emperor level experts from the six ancient countries had basically searched and refined all the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>The current ranking of the ancient countries in refining the core celestial pillars was:</p><p></p><p>Great Ancient Country: 72 </p><p>Savage Ancient Country: 54</p><p>Blazing Sun Ancient Country: 52</p><p>Great Spirit Ancient Country: 45</p><p>Thunder Roar Ancient Country: 38</p><p>Dark Yin Ancient Country: 38</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ranking for refining and cultivating the core celestial pillars was undisputedly dominated by the Great Fugu Nation.</p><p></p><p>This did not come as a surprise to the many supreme Transcendent Sovereigns. When the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu made a move, the peak Transcendent Sovereigns from other ancient nations would generally step aside.</p><p></p><p>Even though these peak Transcendent Sovereigns carried the quintessential killing techniques of their respective ancient nations, they would not easily resort to using them.</p><p></p><p>"This is a savage ancient nation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed slight surprise. The peak Transcendent Sovereigns of the Savage Ancient Nation were completely fighting for their lives when it came to contending for the core celestial pillars, to the extent that the Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun had to yield several times.</p><p></p><p>The peak Transcendent Sovereigns of the Savage Ancient Nation would only slightly yield when facing the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu.</p><p></p><p>But when facing the peak Transcendent Sovereigns of other ancient nations? They would adopt an attitude of mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>"However, this top-grade blessed land actually has more than three hundred core celestial pillars?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn. According to the information he had gathered before coming here, the normal number of cores in a top-grade blessed land was usually between one hundred to two hundred.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred? That was very rare. Among the currently known top-grade blessed lands, only six had more than three hundred cores when they first emerged.</p><p></p><p>"This blessed land should also contain a gigantic core celestial pillar that is completely integrated into the spatial-temporal realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. This was a conclusion drawn from those six blessed lands - they had all initially manifested gigantic blessed land cores.</p><p></p><p>A gigantic blessed land core far surpassed an ordinary blessed land core. A single gigantic blessed land core was equivalent to ten ordinary blessed land cores.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike ordinary blessed land cores, the gigantic blessed land cores were completely integrated into the spatial-temporal realm of the blessed land. No matter how one investigated, they could not be detected until all the blessed land cores had been refined.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the emergence of a gigantic blessed land core would cause a great disturbance, affecting the entire blessed land.</p><p></p><p>"The gigantic blessed land core is very important. Not only is it equivalent to ten ordinary blessed land cores, but it is also easier to defend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Nowadays, each of the great ancient nations occupied dozens of core celestial pillars, but they only had twelve Transcendent Sovereigns. How could twelve Transcendent Sovereigns defend dozens of core celestial pillars? While the Transcendent Sovereigns who had refined the pillars could instantly appear beside them, if the many refined pillars were simultaneously attacked by other powerful experts, which one should they choose to defend?</p><p></p><p>However, once a gigantic core celestial pillar was refined, it would be as difficult to defend as ten ordinary core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the experiences of the previous six blessed lands, the gigantic blessed land core may appear in any location within the blessed land, whether in the central area or the peripheral regions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently contemplated, while carefully sensing the spatial-temporal fluctuations around him.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of a gigantic core celestial pillar would inevitably cause conspicuous phenomena that could not be hidden. As soon as he detected it, he could rush over immediately.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Nation, in an independent space.</p><p></p><p>"The first gigantic core celestial pillar, the chances of our Blazing Sun Ancient Nation refining it are not high."</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun spoke calmly, "So we don't need to be too concerned about it."</p><p></p><p>The other Transcendent Sovereigns did not refute this statement.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the spatial-temporal realm within the blessed land was immense, and the gigantic core celestial pillar could appear anywhere.</p><p></p><p>In terms of traveling speed, the current seventy to eighty peak Transcendent Sovereigns from the six great ancient nations were absolutely no match for the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu.</p><p></p><p>Over the past millennium, the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu had already demonstrated his mastery of spatial-temporal techniques. From one end of the blessed land to the other, he could arrive in a single breath.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying speed was unmatched by any other peak Transcendent Sovereign. And if the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu were to refine the first gigantic core celestial pillar, the other ancient nations would essentially have no chance.</p><p></p><p>"Our goal is the second and third gigantic core celestial pillars."</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun said.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a blessed land that had given birth to more than three hundred blessed land cores would have three gigantic cores.</p><p></p><p>The previous six blessed lands were like that, each possessing three gigantic blessed land cores.</p><p></p><p>For the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu, occupying the first gigantic blessed land core would not be a problem. But to seize the second one? That would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>If the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu went to contend for the second gigantic blessed land core, the first one he had occupied would inevitably be attacked by the peak Transcendent Sovereigns of the other ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>So far, within this blessed land, the strength of the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu was undisputedly the strongest.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only in this blessed land, but throughout the history of the six great ancient nations, the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu's strength could be considered one of the absolute strongest among those below the Progenitors.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun had already tacitly conceded the first gigantic core celestial pillar to the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu.</p><p></p><p>Within the blessed land, Lin Yuan casually hid in a valley to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's expedition to seize this blessed land, since the Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun had given up on contending for the first gigantic core celestial pillar, Lin Yuan naturally would follow suit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan felt that the Transcendent Sovereign of Blazing Sun's reasoning was sound. There was no need to fight to the death with the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu. The time had only just passed halfway, and the most intense period of contention had not yet arrived. They could wait a little longer and observe further.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>One day, the spatial-temporal realm within the blessed land slightly trembled.</p><p></p><p>A strange fluctuation instantly swept across the entire area.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, could it be that the gigantic core celestial pillar has emerged?"</p><p></p><p>The peak Transcendent Sovereigns were all startled by this. The source of this fluctuation was from the blessed land itself, not caused by the clashing of powerful experts. Given the current situation, only the emergence of a gigantic core celestial pillar could have produced such a disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation, and the Dark Yin Ancient Nation have all given up on contending for the first gigantic core celestial pillar, but I, the Savage Ancient Nation, will give it a try. No matter how strong that Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu is, what of it?"</p><p></p><p>A majestic figure waved his hand, and a heart completely composed of spatial-temporal forces appeared before him. With each beat of this heart, it stirred up strands of spatial-temporal power.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>This majestic figure activated the spatial-temporal heart, tearing through the layers of space-time and heading towards the location where the gigantic core celestial pillar had emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The gigantic core celestial pillar? It may not necessarily belong to the Great Spirit Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Sovereign of Spirit Abyss had a deep gaze. At this moment, his eyes were fully open, and his aura had become even more profound. The moment he sensed the strange fluctuation, his figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the other peak Transcendent Sovereigns were also heading towards the location of the gigantic core celestial pillar. Even if they did not intend to contend for it, they wanted to observe from a distance, as the Transcendent Sovereign of Fugu would surely make a move.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also felt the strange fluctuation. Compared to the other ancient nations' experts, his perception of the fluctuation was stronger and clearer, as if it was right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In fact, that was precisely the case.</p><p></p><p>The location where the gigantic core celestial pillar had appeared was right next to him, only a few hundred meters away, almost right beside him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 201: Improving the Demon Parasite (Happy New Year's Eve)</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Progenitor. ‚ô§üêç‚ùªÔºô≈û‚Ñç‡∏¢◊ê.‚ìíÔºØùìúüòæ‚ô¨"</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving another large amount of "Origin", Lin Yuan immediately expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gratitude was indeed heartfelt. In the previous five traversals, he had basically relied on himself, even in the fifth traversal when he became a third-generation immortal with a heavenly background.</p><p></p><p>Most of the resources Lin Yuan needed for cultivation were largely dependent on his own Yin and Yang spirits venturing outside.</p><p></p><p>However, now...</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan voiced his grievances, the Progenitor Demon Tree would actively send over its Origin despite the cost to itself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was well aware...</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree was doing this purely to exploit him.</p><p></p><p>If it successfully descended into the Tianqing World, he would probably be the first to die.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Progenitor Demon Tree had invested its Origin in him, and naturally, it would have to take it back.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Progenitor Demon Tree thought of devouring Lin Yuan, Lin Yuan also thought of devouring the Progenitor Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>At present, the existence of the Progenitor Demon Tree was far more beneficial than harmful to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to an inexhaustible treasure trove for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had already used sealing techniques to resolve the Progenitor Demon Tree's control over the subordinate Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>This led to virtually no basic hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well."</p><p></p><p>"Grow to the fifth stage as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The mental fluctuations emitted by the Progenitor Demon Tree contained a hint of encouragement, as if a gentle elder was earnestly instructing.</p><p></p><p>The growth of the Demon Tree was different from that of normal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was divided into stages.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, the first stage, second stage, third stage...</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree itself was at the eighth stage, a powerful evil god that roamed outside the domains.</p><p></p><p>The subordinate Demon Tree was a continuation of the Progenitor Demon Tree, and there was a mysterious connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>As long as the subordinate Demon Tree grew to the fifth stage...</p><p></p><p>Its life essence would be sufficient to establish a "spatial passage" with the Progenitor Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Progenitor Demon Tree would be able to enter the Tianqing World through another method.</p><p></p><p>This was also the Progenitor Demon Tree's ultimate scheme. With the current situation, forcibly attacking the Tianqing World was not realistic.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>"I will do my best to grow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also "making empty promises" to the Progenitor Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way. If the Progenitor Demon Tree gave up on the Tianqing World now and turned to run away, Lin Yuan could only watch helplessly.</p><p></p><p>So he could only try his best to keep the Progenitor Demon Tree hooked, making it believe that hope was just ahead, coupled with the "cost" formed by the previous investments.</p><p></p><p>Only then could the Progenitor Demon Tree be firmly tied outside the world.</p><p></p><p>"That is natural."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can occupy this world, I can give you freedom and let you become a new evil god."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Progenitor Demon Tree had no intention of letting Lin Yuan live.</p><p></p><p>What a joke, you've consumed so much of my Origin and still want to live?</p><p></p><p>But some things couldn't be said so directly. Even when facing the subordinate Demon Tree, whose life and death could be determined with a single thought...</p><p></p><p>Some superficial words still needed to be considered.</p><p></p><p>Just like that...</p><p></p><p>The two Demon Trees with different thoughts severed their connection.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered the information revealed by the Progenitor Demon Tree just now.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth stage..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that the growth of the Demon Tree was a different matter from cultivation. It was related to strength, but not entirely related to strength.</p><p></p><p>For example, now Lin Yuan already possessed seventh-stage strength, but in terms of the Demon Tree's growth stages, he was still at the sixth stage.</p><p></p><p>"With the world barrier separating us and my own concealment of aura, the Progenitor Demon Tree can't perceive which specific stage I have grown to."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that the Tianqing World had a very high awareness of guarding against the Progenitor Demon Tree. Decades ago, in order to pry open a crack in the Tianqing World's barrier to scatter demon seeds...</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree paid a huge price.</p><p></p><p>And since then, the Tianqing World's precautions against the Progenitor Demon Tree had reached a higher level.</p><p></p><p>So the Progenitor Demon Tree's perception of Lin Yuan was actually very limited. Coupled with the various aura-concealing techniques Lin Yuan had comprehended himself, it could be said to be foolproof.</p><p></p><p>"On the battlefield outside the world, the Tianqing Alliance has been victorious recently."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised that the Tianqing Alliance had gained an advantage on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten years or so, in order to "subsidize" Lin Yuan, the Progenitor Demon Tree had sent over who knows how much of its own Origin power.</p><p></p><p>As a result, its strength had declined, and the number of evil god puppets it could create had decreased.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, although Lin Yuan was the offspring of the Progenitor Demon Tree, he still contributed to the Tianqing World by lowering the Progenitor Demon Tree's strength.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield outside the world, the Tianqing Alliance gained the upper hand, and Lin Yuan deserved the most credit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tianqing World...</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree stood tall and vast in the void, countless vines swaying, and a terrifying demon domain spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>And opposite the Progenitor Demon Tree...</p><p></p><p>Thirteen figures stood shoulder to shoulder.</p><p></p><p>They were none other than the Tianqing Alliance's leader and twelve deputy leaders.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance was the strongest in the Tianqing World. Wielding the World Sword, he could almost exert eighth-stage combat power.</p><p></p><p>As for the twelve deputy leaders, they were all seventh-stage existences, not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Evil God, die!"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance leader grasped the stone longsword and slashed at the Progenitor Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>A large amount of spatial power was torn apart, forming spatial turbulence and carrying the momentum of the void.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree's figure remained huge, countless black vines swaying, barely blocking this sword.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this world... You group of ants, how would you have the qualifications to stand before me?"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree emitted vast mental fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>What it feared the most was the stone longsword in the hands of the Tianqing Alliance leader.</p><p></p><p>That was the World Sword nurtured by the Tianqing World over countless years. In theory, such a weapon should have been slumbering deep within the world, rotating along with the world's rotation.</p><p></p><p>It was just that this time, the Progenitor Demon Tree's invasion made the Tianqing World exceptionally vigilant. Without hesitation, it allowed the stone longsword to emerge and join forces with the Tianqing World's powerhouses to resist the evil god's invasion.</p><p></p><p>After a great battle...</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Demon Tree retreated on its own.</p><p></p><p>Next to the Tianqing World, they were indeed able to contend with the Progenitor Demon Tree, but if they were far away from the Tianqing World, it would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>The stone longsword in the hands of the Tianqing Alliance leader, the closer it was to the Tianqing World, the greater its power.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the farther away it was from the Tianqing World, the weaker its power, and in the end, it would be no different from an ordinary longsword.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, have you noticed that this time, the evil god from outside the domain seems to have weakened a lot..."</p><p></p><p>A deputy leader pondered for a moment and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," the Alliance Leader of the Tianqing Alliance nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since the invasion of the Ancestral Demon Tree began, they would fight against it once every forty to fifty years.</p><p></p><p>With the protection of the stone longsword, they could fully engage in a back-and-forth battle with the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the Ancestral Demon Tree did not fight with them.</p><p></p><p>And from the limited confrontations, they vaguely sensed the weakness of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Evil God deliberately doing this to lure us in?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was somewhat startled and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The decline in the Ancestral Demon Tree's strength was completely inexplicable, as they had never fundamentally harmed it.</p><p></p><p>How could its strength inexplicably decline?</p><p></p><p>Therefore‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's first reaction was whether the Ancestral Demon Tree was deliberately revealing this to lure them into a trap.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed the bits and pieces within a million miles, and then continued his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, comprehending the Demon Seed, improving its parasitic nature.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, comprehending the Demon Seed, improving its parasitic nature.]</p><p></p><p>In front of Lin Yuan, grayish seeds were suspended.</p><p></p><p>As an innate ability of the Demon Tree, the Demon Seed had many effects, among which the "parasitic" ability was quite valued by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The original parasitic ability of the Demon Seed was too rough, and the parasitized lives were like zombies one by one, performing too obviously.</p><p></p><p>So in the recent decades, Lin Yuan would take some time every day to specifically improve the defects of the Demon Seed.</p><p></p><p>"It has been preliminarily improved."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how the effect is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze glanced at the Demon Beast King beside him, wrapped in black vines.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan kept these Demon Beast Kings alive was that they were useful, and now it was just right to test the "parasitic" ability of the Demon Seed.</p><p></p><p>As for why not parasitize those low-level demon beasts first, parasitizing low-level demon beasts would be a complete waste of Lin Yuan's seeds.</p><p></p><p>The parasitic ability of the Demon Seed was entirely dependent on the strength of the parasitized.</p><p></p><p>If the parasitized had the strength of the fifth stage, after parasitism, it could still roughly retain the strength of the fifth stage.</p><p></p><p>If the parasitized only had the strength of the first stage, after parasitism, it would still be the first stage, and what use was the first stage to Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, in the entire Black Mist Mountain Range, only the few Demon Beast Kings who had reached the sixth stage were barely worth parasitizing.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>A black vine loosened.</p><p></p><p>A Demon Beast King fell down.</p><p></p><p>During the fall, the Demon Beast King's body rapidly enlarged, and by the time it landed on the ground, it had become a behemoth.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this..."</p><p></p><p>This Demon Beast King was precisely the Ape King. Having been unconscious for so long, it didn't come to its senses for a moment upon waking up.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the Ape King reacted and its expression immediately became tense.</p><p></p><p>It turned its head and saw that it was under that terrifying ancient tree, and its heart instantly turned half-cold.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Ape King was thinking about whether to say a few words,</p><p></p><p>A grayish seed fell from a branch and quickly came towards it.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Ape King couldn't move, it instinctively sensed a danger.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>This grayish seed fell straight onto the Ape King's forehead, and then roots quickly grew from the seed's surface, taking root in the Ape King's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The Ape King let out a painful roar. At this moment, it only felt as if its head had exploded, and its consciousness even began to blur.</p><p></p><p>"This seed... This seed wants to replace me?"</p><p></p><p>A great horror suddenly surged in the Ape King's heart.</p><p></p><p>That grayish seed was currently taking root in its brain consciousness, slowly expelling its original consciousness, wanting to take over.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to!"</p><p></p><p>The Ape King struggled violently.</p><p></p><p>Compared to being replaced, complete death was rather a relief.</p><p></p><p>The Ape King desperately resisted, gathering the remaining strength in its consciousness to charge at the Demon Seed.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Ape King's entire body was suppressed by Lin Yuan's power, with only a bit of consciousness strength left. How could it resist the Demon Seed?</p><p></p><p>In just half a day,</p><p></p><p>The Ape King's consciousness completely disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Seed had successfully parasitized.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused on the changes in the Ape King.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ape King slowly crawled up from the ground and slightly bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The parasitism was very smooth..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could clearly sense the aura from the Demon Seed deep in the Ape King's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I now possess all the memories and abilities of the Ape King..."</p><p></p><p>The Ape King began to report.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sent the Ape King away.</p><p></p><p>The current Ape King had been replaced by the Demon Seed, so there was no need to worry about loyalty.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>By observing the performance and reactions of the replaced Ape King, as long as one paid more attention, there was basically no difference from the original Ape King.</p><p></p><p>At least it was far better than the initial lives parasitized by the Demon Seed, with dull eyes and stiff movements.</p><p></p><p>The current Demon Seed not only perfectly integrated into the parasitized body but also obtained all the memories of the other party.</p><p></p><p>It could almost achieve the degree of passing off the fake as genuine.</p><p></p><p>"But there are still some flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Continue to improve."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and decided to use his heaven-defying comprehension to perfect and make up for it in the coming time.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan put so much effort into parasitism was to prepare for the subsequent spread of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it. The Demon Tree's image wasn't very good, so Lin Yuan needed to find some "spokespersons."</p><p></p><p>And these "spokespersons" had to be absolutely loyal to Lin Yuan, which happened to fit with the parasitic ability of the Demon Seed.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts surged. Due to the limitations of the Demon Tree itself, Lin Yuan did not walk the path of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>But everything he was currently doing was paving the way for the Martial Dao. Spreading the Martial Dao's evolutionary path was the main plan for the next few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into cultivation, and the aura inside his body became more and more terrifying, like a bottomless vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>No one knew, including that invincible Tianqing Alliance Leader and the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>In the seemingly "absolutely safe" rear of the Tianqing world, changes that could overturn the current situation had appeared.</p>

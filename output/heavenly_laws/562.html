        <h1>Chapter 562</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The current evolutionary path of just the Pili Dao (Transcendent Dao) realm is already remarkable, as it has opened up a branch with the potential to reach the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Under this premise, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws has determined that Lin Yuan has great potential and a chance to fully enter the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not have stated those conditions.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for Lin Yuan to work for the Myriad Dao Pavilion is that he must fully enter the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan cannot fully enter the Chaos Realm, the Myriad Dao Pavilion will certainly suffer a loss.</p><p></p><p>"How many other branches have you opened up?"</p><p></p><p>After observing Lin Yuan for a while, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws felt that he was not lying.</p><p></p><p>"The evolutionary path of the Pili Dao realm has opened up not just one branch, even if the other branches do not have high potential and cannot reach the Sovereign Realm, it still shows how broad the main evolutionary path is."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was delighted, "Could it be that I've really found a treasure this time? It's been many cosmic eras since I've seen a Pili Dao realm with such terrifying potential."</p><p></p><p>Reaching the perfected Chaos Realm has different levels, such as the ordinary Chaos Saint and the Peerless Chaos Saint.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's main evolutionary path can open up multiple branches at the Pili Dao realm level, it means he may have the potential to become a Peerless Chaos Saint.</p><p></p><p>A Peerless Chaos Saint, even in the vast Chaotic Void, is extremely rare. The Myriad Dao Pavilion would have great difficulty controlling such an existence.</p><p></p><p>"There are a few," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>So far, with the martial dao evolutionary path as his main path, he has opened up a total of 361 evolutionary branches.</p><p></p><p>Among them, 99 evolutionary branches have been fully perfected, which is why they have been disseminated within human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining 200-300 evolutionary branches, although they have been roughly opened up, they have not been fully and meticulously perfected, but cultivating them poses no problem.</p><p></p><p>"They are all here," Lin Yuan waved his hand, and suddenly over 300 jade slips appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Out of the 361 evolutionary branches, except for 9 that need to be kept for the 9 supreme experts of human civilization to cultivate, Lin Yuan has brought out the rest of the evolutionary branches.</p><p></p><p>"So many?" The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was somewhat surprised. The martial dao evolutionary path had only used one jade slip to record it, but the other evolutionary branches Lin Yuan had opened up used hundreds of jade slips?</p><p></p><p>The old man holding a wine gourd next to them also became curious.</p><p></p><p>He had been listening to the conversation between the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws and Lin Yuan the whole time.</p><p></p><p>As a sub-pavilion master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion, the old man with the wine gourd was one of their own people and completely trustworthy, so the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws did not avoid him.</p><p></p><p>The old man could tell that the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had a good impression of Lin Yuan, and the many requirements on the golden scroll were based on the premise of Lin Yuan fully entering the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fully entering the Chaos Realm? That is the realm of Chaos Saints.</p><p></p><p>Since the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws dared to say so, it must have felt that Lin Yuan had the hope of entering the perfected Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Myriad Dao Pavilion has had such a lofty status so far, not only because of the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws, a profoundly unfathomable existence, but also because it has a similar restrictive relationship with some Chaos Saints in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>So when he saw the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws reach an 'agreement' with Lin Yuan, the old man was quite happy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At least in the distant future, the Myriad Dao Pavilion will have another Chaos Saint to support it.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw Lin Yuan take out so many jade slips, the old man's doubts were no less than the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the other evolutionary branches Lin Yuan opened up were extremely complex and tedious? That's why so many jade slips were needed to record them?</p><p></p><p>But that shouldn't be the case, a single jade slip can record an extremely high amount of information, what kind of evolutionary branches would require hundreds of jade slips to record?</p><p></p><p>"Take a look," Lin Yuan handed over all the jade slips after taking them out, and looked at the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws expectantly.</p><p></p><p>This is just the evolutionary branches he has temporarily opened up so far, and in the future, when he has time, he can continue to open up more evolutionary branches.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao evolutionary path encompasses the Myriad Dao, so theoretically there is no limit to the number of evolutionary branches that can be opened up.</p><p></p><p>But this is just theoretical, at least at the Pili Dao realm stage, Lin Yuan can only open up a little over a thousand evolutionary branches, at the Sovereign Realm it will increase a bit, and at the Chaos Realm it should see an explosive increase.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilion is responsible for disseminating all these evolutionary branches, Lin Yuan feels that even if he loses a bit, it won't be much.</p><p></p><p>If he had to disseminate so many evolutionary branches by himself, he doesn't know how much effort it would take.</p><p></p><p>Just to digest them within human civilization? That's not realistic either, the human civilization's population base is not enough to produce so many Tier 12 branches.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look?" The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was slightly silent, it glanced at Lin Yuan, then at the hundreds of jade slips in front of it, and for a moment it seemed hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Take a look myself?</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws began to observe the first jade slip.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip recorded a martial dao branch called the Illusory Dao, which was perfected based on the illusory path.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Dao is not very adept at offensive and destructive methods, its main means are to establish illusory worlds and use influence and suppression.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws' pupils, a path completely composed of illusions began to extend and spread, finally stopping when it touched the endless Chaotic Layers.</p><p></p><p>"This evolutionary branch has the potential to reach the peak of the Sovereign Realm," the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws concluded, but its expression did not show any sign of easing.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Illusory Dao it had observed was recorded in just one jade slip.</p><p></p><p>One jade slip records one evolutionary branch? Then what about the more than 300 jade slips in front of it?</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws paused for a moment and continued to observe.</p><p></p><p>The second jade slip was for a Chaos Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The third jade slip was for a Chaos Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The fourth jade slip was for a Sovereign Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The 123rd jade slip was for a Chaos Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The 233rd jade slip was for a Sovereign Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The 312th jade slip was for a Sovereign Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p>The 326th jade slip was for a Chaos Realm evolutionary branch.</p><p></p><p>After continuously observing more than 300 evolutionary paths, observing the many timelines in the future of each evolutionary path, as well as their potential in each timeline, etc.</p><p></p><p>Even for the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws, it was now slightly fatigued at the moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not a true Tier 13 temporal life, but only possessed a small fraction of the power of a Tier 13 temporal life.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the fatigue of the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws in terms of energy, the more than 300 evolutionary branches in front of it were stirring up a storm in its heart.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Lin Yuan was only at the Pili Dao realm, even for a Chaos Realm expert, the evolutionary path they walk and the branches they can open up would be limited to just a few dozen at most.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan, hundreds of branches? And they were all starting from at least the Sovereign Realm potential, with a considerable portion even reaching the Chaos Realm potential?</p><p></p><p>A single Pili Dao realm evolutionary main path not only opened up hundreds of evolutionary branches, but each of these evolutionary branches had such high potential?</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was somewhat dazed. Since its birth, it had observed and come into contact with countless evolutionary paths, Great Saints, Peerless Chaos Saints, and even those with the hope of reaching the Tier 13 Grand Dao.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's evolutionary main path, to be able to accommodate such a terrifying number of evolutionary branches at just the Pili Dao realm, was simply unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The pupils of the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had a slight reddish glow.</p><p></p><p>It really wanted to ask if the evolutionary paths recorded in these jade slips were truly branched out from a certain evolutionary main path?</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, it suppressed this doubt, with its vision, although the evolutionary paths recorded in the more than 300 jade slips were all-encompassing, their roots were from the same evolutionary main path.</p><p></p><p>This was something the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was very certain about.</p><p></p><p>It could see that the earlier Life-and-Death Martial Dao originated from a certain evolutionary main path, so naturally it could also see that these 300-plus evolutionary paths also stemmed from the same main path.</p><p></p><p>"What is the name of the main path of these evolutionary branches?" The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws fell silent for a long time before asking with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"The evolutionary main path? Martial Dao," Lin Yuan answered, slightly puzzled, but still replied.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao, Martial Dao!" The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws nodded, its gaze deep, not knowing what it was thinking about.</p><p></p><p>"Then these evolutionary branches..." Lin Yuan continued his previous question.</p><p></p><p>"I can help you disseminate them," the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have some other branches as well, it's just that I'm still in the process of perfecting them, so they haven't..." Lin Yuan thought for a moment and continued.</p><p></p><p>Even just staying at the Pili Dao realm, the martial dao evolutionary path can open up more than a thousand branches, and at the Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm it will see an explosive increase.</p><p></p><p>"There are some other branches."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scalp could be heard tingling.</p><p></p><p>What kind of supreme Dao could open up so many evolutionary paths in the martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I can help you spread all the evolutionary paths you've entered." </p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye calmed down and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Dao Pavilion could unconditionally help him spread all the evolutionary paths, then helping the other party do one thing for ten universal cycles would be quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>It's actually not bad.</p><p></p><p>It's a normal transaction.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll imprint a wisp of spiritual aura into it now." Lin Yuan looked at the golden scroll beside him, the characters on it emanating a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye also looked at the golden scroll.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the golden scroll began to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye, his heart sinking.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the other party felt that his evolutionary paths were too many, and the transmission of so many evolutionary paths was not cost-effective, so they planned to cancel it or add new requirements?</p><p></p><p>"I feel the previous requirements were unfair."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye looked at Lin Yuan and spoke slowly after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Then are you going to redefine the requirements?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>He should not have brought out so many evolutionary paths at once.</p><p></p><p>But when it comes to matters after he reaches the Chaotic Realm Perfection, it's not wrong to confirm it more.</p><p></p><p>"So what are you going to do?" Lin Yuan had already prepared for the All-Seeing Eye to make a big request.</p><p></p><p>As long as the other party wasn't too excessive, he could still agree, after all, if he had to spread so many evolutionary paths by himself, not only would it be exhausting, but whether he could spread them widely would also be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Opening up evolutionary paths and spreading evolutionary paths are two completely different things.</p><p></p><p>Without enough influence and deterrence, even if the evolutionary paths are widely popularized, they would be difficult to take root in certain places.</p><p></p><p>Not only does Lin Yuan need to spread his own evolutionary paths and consolidate the path markers, but those Chaotic Sovereign and great saints of the Chaotic Realm will also do the same.</p><p></p><p>"You tell me." Lin Yuan waited for the All-Seeing Eye to make a request.</p><p></p><p>"I will try my best to help you spread all the evolutionary paths." The All-Seeing Eye said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded and waited for the other party to continue.</p><p></p><p>However, after waiting for a while, he found that the other party did not add anything.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you need me to help the Myriad Dao Pavilion do one thing for ten universal cycles?" Lin Yuan asked in a somewhat surprised tone.</p><p></p><p>"No need." The All-Seeing Eye shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Then no other requirements?" Lin Yuan was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"There is a requirement." The All-Seeing Eye said.</p><p></p><p>"Then tell me." Lin Yuan immediately became focused.</p><p></p><p>"My next requirement does not need any form of constraint, not even the need to bear the consequences of cause and effect." The All-Seeing Eye looked at Lin Yuan, "I need a promise from you that, as long as it does not go against your own will and is within your ability, if the Myriad Dao Pavilion asks you to help me, please help once."</p><p></p><p>"That's so simple?" Lin Yuan's expression was surprised.</p><p></p><p>A promise that requires no constraint at all, not even the need to bear the consequences of cause and effect, means that Lin Yuan can agree or refuse as he pleases in the future, without having to pay any price.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, this requirement from the All-Seeing Eye was practically the same as not making any requirement at all.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's that simple." The All-Seeing Eye nodded.</p><p></p><p>If the martial Dao main path opened up by Lin Yuan could only develop one evolutionary path, even if that evolutionary path had the potential to reach the Chaotic Realm, the All-Seeing Eye would still help spread the evolutionary path while trying to obtain the greatest benefit and highest return for itself.</p><p></p><p>The condition of a Chaotic Realm Perfection doing one thing for ten universal cycles is already an extremely high reward.</p><p></p><p>The deterrence of a Chaotic Realm Perfection is unimaginably great, let alone such a deterrence being able to be invoked once every ten universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was initially willing to accept this condition because the time he had experienced was too short, so he felt that a universal cycle was too long.</p><p></p><p>But for other great saints, not to mention great saints, even just the sovereign, the universal cycles they have experienced are counted in the hundreds or thousands.</p><p></p><p>Doing one thing for ten universal cycles is already a rather harsh requirement.</p><p></p><p>However, this is the approach to dealing with a life with the potential to become a Chaotic Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan's evolutionary main path could open up dozens of paths, the All-Seeing Eye would not make any other concessions, and might even raise the requirements.</p><p></p><p>For example, from doing one thing for ten universal cycles to doing one thing for nine universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>However, the evolutionary paths opened up by Lin Yuan are not just a few, or even dozens, but hundreds, or even more according to Lin Yuan's tone.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye dared not make any other requirements.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Lin Yuan is still very weak now.</p><p></p><p>But with the potential of the martial Dao evolutionary path, he cannot remain weak forever.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan is still weak, the All-Seeing Eye can take a lot of advantage.</p><p></p><p>But once Lin Yuan grows to the point where he can destroy the All-Seeing Eye, these advantages may turn into endless hidden threats.</p><p></p><p>Although the All-Seeing Eye pursues benefits, it is not a fool and will not dig such a big pit for itself.</p><p></p><p>So it simply asks Lin Yuan for a promise that is not subject to any constraints.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the initiative is in Lin Yuan's hands. If Lin Yuan really grows to that point in the future, he will not have any ill intentions towards the All-Seeing Eye, and is very likely to fulfill the promise.</p><p></p><p>And if Lin Yuan does not grow to that point, the biggest loss for the All-Seeing Eye is the loss of the reward of a Chaotic Realm Perfection doing one thing for ten universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>This is not really a big loss.</p><p></p><p>"You think my future promise will be of great value?" Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>No matter it was the Mysterious Emperor or the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master, their descriptions of the Myriad Dao Pavilion and the All-Seeing Eye were mainly "fair" and "profit-seeking".</p><p></p><p>The two supreme great saints have never felt that the All-Seeing Eye would do any good deeds without considering the returns.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the All-Seeing Eye still uses such a promise that is equivalent to having no value to ask Lin Yuan, it can only be because it feels that this promise will bring great benefits in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The martial Dao evolutionary path you are walking has great potential, and the Myriad Dao Pavilion is willing to help you and establish a good relationship." The All-Seeing Eye said directly, revealing its true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Since you can open up such a potential evolutionary path, I'm sure your future is limitless. The Myriad Dao Pavilion can choose not to ask you to do anything, but we will definitely not force you to do anything for us."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye said frankly.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"Then I agree, as long as you help me spread all the evolutionary paths, in the future, as long as it is within my ability and does not go against my own will, I will lend a hand to help you once."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The All-Seeing Eye felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>The transaction was completed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to chat with the All-Seeing Eye for a while.</p><p></p><p>It was mainly Lin Yuan asking more questions and the All-Seeing Eye answering.</p><p></p><p>"A Chaotic Realm Perfection trapped in a time loop will keep looping until the day it breaks free from the loop." The All-Seeing Eye answered.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wanted to know what would happen if one was trapped in a time loop for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Is there no other way?" Lin Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually." The All-Seeing Eye thought for a moment, "If you can catch a glimpse of the gap in the time loop and exhaust all your origin power, you can also break free, but this kind of breaking free is a forceful one, and you will quickly perish afterwards."</p><p></p><p>After getting the answer he wanted, Lin Yuan got up and left the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye and the old man carrying the wine gourd saw Lin Yuan off.</p><p></p><p>"Lord All-Seeing," the old man carrying the wine gourd finally dared to speak up, "Spreading so many evolutionary paths will require a lot of cost and even incurring debts, yet you only asked for that person's promise?"</p><p></p><p>The old man carrying the wine gourd was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the All-Seeing Eye being so benevolent.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, in the distant future, you will feel endless glory for today!" The All-Seeing Eye glanced at the old man.</p><p></p><p>"Because the one you just talked to may be a great thirteenth-tier being."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

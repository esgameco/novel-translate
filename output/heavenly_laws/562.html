        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The majestic palace had been thoroughly cleaned, and the three of them left, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the three of them kept their heads down, daring not to speak a word or look around carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main hall, ancestral gods passed by from time to time, and each time they saw one, the three of them would stop to the side and make way for the ancestral god.</p><p></p><p>It took about half an hour before the three of them returned to their humble abode.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Star had gathered too many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The housing prices in the Imperial Star capital were extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Although the old man was a Heaven-level Imperial Soldier, the house he lived in was only less than 100 square meters.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the chaotic Star Realm's Green Mountain Realm, he could have been called a king or an ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The old man picked up his treasured wine, carefully pouring a full cup for the three of them, his face showing an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"A jar of lunar-brewed wine is worth a mountain, but in other realms, this jar of lunar-brewed wine could exchange for a whole village, no problem."</p><p></p><p>"Not as good as the immortal wine the ancestral gods drink, I heard that just a single drop can make a Godly expert drunk for a hundred days," Longqi said.</p><p></p><p>He and Xiao Qi were both war orphans, picked up by the old man.</p><p></p><p>The old man glanced at Longqi impatiently, "You're the only one who knows how to talk."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Qi looked at the lunar-brewed wine, his gaze hazy, "What is wine?"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh, he's sick again," the old man said, looking at Xiao Qi with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>But he and Longqi were already used to Xiao Qi's condition.</p><p></p><p>Longqi continued, "I heard that in the next few days, they will select the one who will wield the Enlightening Light, I wonder who will be chosen."</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightening Light..." Hearing this, the old man's gaze became complicated.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Enlightening Light was truly built with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the light, there was only crimson blood.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Enlightening Light?" Xiao Qi asked, his face full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>The old man spoke to himself, "When the Dark Heavens descend, the world is plunged into darkness, only the Enlightening Light can ignite the darkness and illuminate the path forward."</p><p></p><p>This was the consensus of all the cultivators in the Imperial Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as long as they could forge the Enlightening Light, they could drive away the Dark Heavens and welcome the light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what they didn't know was that even with the miraculous Enlightening Light, the Dark Heavens would still be difficult to dispel.</p><p></p><p>But for the living... one must always have hope, a goal, right? "I want to have the Enlightening Light," Xiao Qi murmured.</p><p></p><p>The old man laughed, "You really dare to dream big."</p><p></p><p>Longqi also smiled and said, "If you really wield the Enlightening Light, maybe you can get the old man to drink some immortal wine."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi nodded seriously, "Drink immortal wine."</p><p></p><p>The old man, with his head of white hair, looked worried, "Drink what immortal wine, it's enough to just live peacefully. Even if either of you two has the chance to wield the Enlightening Light, I hope you won't, the frontlines... are no place for people."</p><p></p><p>Longqi and Xiao Qi's parents had both died on the frontlines, and the old man only wished for these two to live safely, surviving through the cracks.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Star Capital.</p><p></p><p>Four dazzling beams of light hung high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The light was so brilliant and scorching that it was impossible to look at directly, and one couldn't even make out its inner form.</p><p></p><p>The majestic voice of Yuan Piaomiao suddenly resounded, "Within half a day, whoever is closest to the Enlightening Light, that person shall wield the Enlightening Light in this expedition!"</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial City, countless great and small figures all looked up, either straining their eyes or squinting, gazing at the towering, dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Enlightening Light... so beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Enlightening Light, the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth may not necessarily be our opponents!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth are stronger than us, but if they dare to invade us, we'll bite off a piece of them!"</p><p></p><p>The people were filled with passionate emotions.</p><p></p><p>The past days had been too dark and oppressive, and now they could finally hold their heads high.</p><p></p><p>The old man squinted his eyes, trying his best to see the Enlightening Light clearly, murmuring, "There's a drop of my mother's blood in there."</p><p></p><p>His mother was also an alchemist, and she had left him at a very young age to go forge the miraculous Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>Alchemists who succeeded in forging the Enlightening Light would either live or die, with the odds heavily skewed towards the latter.</p><p></p><p>Longqi also strained his eyes to look at the Enlightening Light, even though tears were welling up in his eyes, he still tried his best to look.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi was the same, but his eyes didn't shed any tears.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightening Light... what kind of rules govern it?"</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were endless.</p><p></p><p>He dreamed every night.</p><p></p><p>In his dreams, he was sometimes a grain of sand, sometimes a drop of water, and sometimes a mighty general.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult, too difficult," Xiao Qi had a million questions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, over a hundred ancestral gods soared into the sky, rushing towards the Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>Those daring to participate in this competition were all at the peak, the ultimate limit of the Ancestral God Realm, and they might even break through at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of figures rushed towards the Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>The scorching light resisted all existence, making it difficult to approach.</p><p></p><p>"My life is in my own hands, let me break through!" a woman with phoenix eyes roared, her clothes stained with blood, but she still pressed forward.</p><p></p><p>Many ancestral gods used various ingenious techniques to approach the Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how hard they tried, they were still very far from the core.</p><p></p><p>And every so often, someone would falter and fall from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even getting close was impossible, let alone wielding it. Tian Zu Liuliu looked at this scene, his gaze filled with sorrow, "The closest one now is Huang Limi, but she's still a hundred meters away from the core."</p><p></p><p>After coming to the Divine Wood Universe, he had taken the surname of the destroyed Tian Clan as his own, using his original name as a way to commemorate the Tian Clan.</p><p></p><p>To wield the Enlightening Light, one had to enter the core area.</p><p></p><p>But now, even the closest ones were still a hundred meters away from the core.</p><p></p><p>Even if they managed to wield it, they would be hard-pressed to fully unleash the true power of the Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü's eyes also showed a hint of worry, "They've been given too little time to grow."</p><p></p><p>If they had a few more tens of thousands of years, perhaps it wouldn't be like this.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze remained calm as he observed the ancestral gods still struggling to approach the Enlightening Light, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"This battle may not be a major one, a bit of tempering wouldn't be a bad idea."</p><p></p><p>Yuan was comforting the army's morale.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the lines left behind by Yao Guang Dao Master have not yet faded, we still have plenty of time to prepare," the burly bearded man said.</p><p></p><p>This battle might not even involve any actual fighting, or it might just be a small-scale clash.</p><p></p><p>It was unlikely to engulf the entire Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, suddenly, among the crowd in the Imperial City, a young man named Xiao Qi's hazy gaze cleared, revealing a glimmer of brightness.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to wield the Enlightening Light."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Xiao Qi, what are you doing?" Longqi was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even the old man was taken aback, as he saw Xiao Qi suddenly shoot up into the sky, flying towards the location of the Enlightening Light.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know that the Imperial Star had a flight prohibition, and one couldn't fly without permission?</p><p></p><p>And the restrictive formations in front would be enough to stop an Ancestral God.</p><p></p><p>But to their surprise, Xiao Qi's figure seemed to enter a realm without any obstructions.</p><p></p><p>The formations that could restrain Ancestral Gods did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless gazes fell upon Xiao Qi, filled with astonishment, surprise, and confusion, all kinds of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Even Huang Limi noticed him afterwards...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang's figure was somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Because she had never seen Qi before.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, she had seen all the powerful figures with names and titles on the Imperial Star.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a shocking scene unfolded before her. The unknown man actually surpassed the other ancestral gods.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, his position had already exceeded hers.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Huang Limi was shocked beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>As a peak expert at the Ancestral God realm, she naturally understood how much effort it took to barely maintain her position here.</p><p></p><p>Yet, that person had actually surpassed her? Who was he?</p><p></p><p>"He surpassed Huang Limi?"</p><p></p><p>"There is still a powerful expert in the Imperial Star?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Can he reach the core area?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, or watched the man with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes widened, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Long Qi clenched his fists, his face filled with uncontrollable excitement and joy.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi? Up in the heavens, the burly old man with a beard widened his eyes: "He..."</p><p></p><p>He had some doubts about the man's identity.</p><p></p><p>Yuan shook his head, preventing him from taking action: "Just wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao stood in the crowd, their gazes fixed on that figure, their thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"Why... does he look familiar?"</p><p>"Is it him?"</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the core area a hundred zhang away was instantly approached.</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods were truly shaken this time.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the man had already qualified to initially grasp the Enlightenment of the Human Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a scene that shocked everyone occurred.</p><p></p><p>The young man raised his hand towards the four dazzling Enlightenment of the Human Dao in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Those four Enlightenment of the Human Dao flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightenment of the Human Dao... how did they fall into his hands?"</p><p></p><p>"How did he do this?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Those were the Enlightenment of the Human Dao, not just some ordinary objects. He could just wave his hand and have them in his possession.</p><p></p><p>This represented something.</p><p></p><p>With the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao in his hands, the confusion in Qi's eyes disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand something, recalling something.</p><p></p><p>He held the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, his figure upright and majestic, with a hint of lazy nonchalance.</p><p></p><p>"I, Qi Yuan... holding a few Enlightenment of the Human Dao... any objections?"</p><p></p><p>His voice spread in all directions, and the people of the Imperial Star were first confused, then quickly turned to joy.</p><p></p><p>"He is... the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, the Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Lord... the Realm Lord of our Shenmu Universe!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many people's eyes were moist.</p><p></p><p>Centuries ago, news of Qi Yuan, the Realm Lord, had spread. At first, many people did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>But as the Chaotic Star Domain was reclaimed, and the Radiant Assembly retreated from the Shenmu, everyone realized that the Shenmu Universe also had a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Their Realm Lord! But for these hundreds of years, the Realm Lord had been silent and disappeared, and many had gone searching for him, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>From hope to despair.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Realm Lord has reappeared, holding the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, how could they not be overjoyed and excited.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... greets the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>This former number one figure of the Shenmu Universe bowed his noble head at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sheng Nü... greets the Realm Lord!" Sheng Nü lowered her head, her attitude respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Greets the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods bowed their heads, their eyes filled with awe and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Greets the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The entire Imperial Star, all the people seemed to be shouting.</p><p></p><p>The sound rolled like the tide, like waves, echoing for miles.</p><p></p><p>The old man's gaze was complex, with a hint of melancholy: "Little Qi... is actually the Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>Long Qi's face was filled with joyous excitement.</p><p></p><p>If Little Qi was just some powerful expert, he might have been a little jealous.</p><p></p><p>But now... the Realm Lord, it was not jealousy, but pure joy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the heavens, Qi Yuan held the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, his gaze deep.</p><p></p><p>"This time... the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth?" he asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Realm Lord, yes!" Yuan stepped forward, no longer with the arrogance of the former number one expert of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>As an existence at the second layer of the Ancestral God realm, he naturally knew how great the gap was between himself and the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze flickered slightly: "These years, I've been cultivating and refining, but I've neglected to slay the Devilish Spirits. In that case, give me the remaining three Enlightenment of the Human Dao as well. This time, I'll go to the Void Sea to meet them."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the expressions of the ancestral gods on the scene changed, and many thoughts surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Qi Yuan was the Realm Lord, he was also a being of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the will of the Shenmu Universe would have long since begun to reject him, and he would not have been able to stand here quietly.</p><p></p><p>But they had almost no contact with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's conduct, character, and the like were only known to them through written records.</p><p></p><p>This first encounter, to hand over the seven precious Enlightenment of the Human Dao forged with the blood and flesh of countless beings, they... had some distrust.</p><p></p><p>What if... what if...</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods had different expressions and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, such doubts were normal.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment of the Human Dao were not ordinary objects, they were related to the survival of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze flickered, and he eyed Qi Yuan, finally speaking: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Yuan!" The burly old man with the beard shouted, wanting to stop him.</p><p></p><p>The others who saw this did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's prestige was as brilliant as the sun.</p><p></p><p>Since Yuan had agreed, they had no need to veto it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, if... Qi Yuan took action, could they really guard the seven Enlightenment of the Human Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Here are the remaining three precious Enlightenment." The one in the tattered armor, Yuan, handed the three precious Enlightenment to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The three dazzling precious Enlightenment fell into Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan examined these seven precious Enlightenment, his eyes filled with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Gold, wood, fire, earth, thunder, cloud, rain..."</p><p></p><p>Among these seven precious Enlightenment, he saw these seven attributes.</p><p></p><p>And these seven attributes exactly matched the eight wooden tablets given to him by the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>"But... where is the water?"</p><p></p><p>If it was not a coincidence, were the precious Enlightenment still missing one, the rain?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Sheng Nü, his gaze calm: "Sister Sheng Nü, have you ever been to the Shenmu Abyss in the Qingshan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü had created the Divine Descent, so he addressed her as "sister" with good manners.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with even better manners, he should call her "aunt" or "mother".</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Sheng Nü nodded, as she had learned from the Shangguan siblings that Qi Yuan was very interested in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, "I once encountered a blind woman in the Shenmu Abyss, and she said she had seen you and even gave you a forging technique?"</p><p></p><p>"A blind woman?" Sheng Nü was perplexed. "No, but... in the Shenmu Abyss, I did gain some insights into the Void and learned a forging technique."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan's gaze was complex.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

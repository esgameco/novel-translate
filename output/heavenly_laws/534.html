        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yan, was that just now the Great Venerable Qing Fen?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Venerable Qing Fen... What did the Great Venerable say to you?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yu family residence, Yu Chaolong finally reacted after a long while and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Not just Yu Chaolong, but several Yu family elders were the same. </p><p></p><p>Even now, they were still immersed in the shock of Qing Fen Marquis's personal visit.</p><p></p><p>Everyone only saw the Great Venerable Qing Fen exchange a few words with Lin Yuan, and Lin Yuan respond with a few words, but as for what exactly was said, they weren't sure.</p><p></p><p>The aura of Qing Fen Marquis was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Plus, there was intentional shielding.</p><p></p><p>No one in the Yu family knew about the exchange between Qing Fen Marquis and Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Venerable said he would take me as a disciple," Lin Yuan said directly, without concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken,</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders immediately took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even with the mindset of Dao Realm powerhouses, they were still stirred up by huge waves of shock at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't rare for Qing Fen Marquis to take disciples. The various Qing Envoys who traveled through Qing Fen Domain would bring back batches of geniuses every so often to become disciples under Qing Fen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Most of these geniuses had Nine Blazing Sun aptitude, with a small portion having condensed Ten Blazing Suns.</p><p></p><p>Since taking charge of Qing Fen Domain, the Great Venerable Qing Fen had been widely accepting disciples, so taking disciples was normal.</p><p></p><p>But the process for the Great Venerable Qing Fen taking disciples was for the various Qing Envoys to bring people back to Qing Fen City, for the Great Venerable to inspect them, and then accept them.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Qing Fen traveled countless millions of miles from distant Qing Fen City, specifically to take Lin Yuan as a disciple? This had never happened since the Great Venerable Qing Fen took charge of Qing Fen Domain.</p><p></p><p>Even Feng Wanxing, currently the strongest disciple under the Great Venerable who had condensed over 700 Blazing Sun Seeds before the age of 500, had not received such treatment.</p><p></p><p>"Yan..."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders exchanged glances. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they absolutely would not have believed the Great Venerable Qing Fen would do this.</p><p></p><p>At the Great Venerable's level, so-called taking disciples was nothing more than fulfilling the tasks of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if he took a million disciples or ten million disciples, in the future there was likely no disciple who could reach the same heights as the Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?" The Yu family elders hesitated to speak, not daring to inquire too much, but in the end Yu Chaolong asked.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Why did the lofty Great Venerable Qing Fen suddenly descend?</p><p></p><p>And suddenly take Lin Yuan as a disciple? Just now, many high-level members of the Yu family had already started considering how to preserve their family's hope for survival under the rising momentum of the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I condensed a few more Blazing Sun Seeds," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was the only reason. The "Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Method" was a secret technique personally spread by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The condensed Blazing Sun Seeds had an incredible boosting effect on comprehension of laws and even physical transformation.</p><p></p><p>The over 10,000 Blazing Sun Seeds condensed by Lin Yuan, if not unique in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, were definitely extremely rare in billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"A few more... Blazing Sun Seeds?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders pondered these words.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong was also contemplating the meaning of this statement.</p><p></p><p>"Yan." Yuchi Ling looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As a mother, she vaguely sensed what was about to happen next.</p><p></p><p>"Qing Fen Marquis told me to get ready, he'll take me away shortly," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't really much to prepare, mainly just saying goodbye to the Yu family members.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders finally calmed down and looked at Lin Yuan with excitement.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the initial fear, shock and disbelief, they finally realized what it meant for Qing Fen Marquis to personally arrive and take Lin Yuan as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Marquis's figure appeared again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Qing Fen Marquis had not left, but had been observing the Yu family from deep in spacetime, or more accurately, observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying thing about Lin Yuan was not that he had condensed over 10,000 Blazing Sun Seeds before the age of 500.</p><p></p><p>But that during this period, Lin Yuan had been condensing them all by himself, without any guidance.</p><p></p><p>Even for condensing Blazing Sun Seeds, there were many tricks and shortcuts that could greatly reduce the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing, the top disciple under Qing Fen Marquis, had only condensed over 100 Blazing Sun Seeds when he first became a disciple.</p><p></p><p>In the end, under Qing Fen Marquis's guidance, he condensed over 700 Blazing Sun Seeds before the age of 500.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never received any guidance so far. It could be expected that after becoming a disciple under Qing Fen Marquis and receiving relevant guidance, the number of Blazing Sun Seeds he could condense before 500 would definitely surge again.</p><p></p><p>Condensing over 10,000 Blazing Sun Seeds before 500 was already incredible enough.</p><p></p><p>As for even more?</p><p></p><p>Even Qing Fen Marquis started to look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready?" Qing Fen Marquis asked in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>Towards others, Qing Fen Marquis was extremely cold, even to disciples.</p><p></p><p>But towards Lin Yuan? Qing Fen Marquis couldn't be cold.</p><p></p><p>"I'm ready," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family members were also filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh! Three figures suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was the tall figure You Jue, Shi Song and the other Qing Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, during Lin Yuan's farewell to his parents, the three Qing Envoys had also withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis." You Jue bowed to Qing Fen Marquis and said in a low voice: "We know that the Dongyang family once acted against the Yu family, and even attempted to assassinate Yu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>You Jue flipped his right hand, and hundreds of figures appeared in unison. They were the several elders of the Dongyang family, the patriarch, and many high-level members. The previously revered Dongyang Meng was also among them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Dongyang family members were kneeling on the ground. Almost all of them had not reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>They were originally still in the Dongyang family, waiting for the three Qing Envoys to return, when suddenly everything went black and they arrived here.</p><p></p><p>The Dongyang family elders had some guesses. They had followed the three Qing Envoys to near the Yu family, and even saw Qing Fen Marquis personally descend on the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, before the Dongyang family elders could take any action, they were captured by the Sovereign Realm Qing Envoy You Jue.</p><p></p><p>"Acted against the Yu family?"</p><p></p><p>"Attempted to assassinate Yu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Marquis frowned slightly, and invisible blue flames burned through spacetime. All the Dongyang family members present felt as if they had fallen into purgatory.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis, we know we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Marquis, we were wrong, please spare our lives."</p><p></p><p>The Dongyang family elders looked terrified. Even now, they did not know why Qing Fen Marquis had descended.</p><p></p><p>But they knew one thing, which was that it was related to Yu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, You Jue would not have specifically mentioned the "assassination attempt on Yu Yan".</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the Dongyang family elders did not dare to refute at all, and directly started begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis, please spare us."</p><p></p><p>"Marquis, we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Dongyang family members also started pleading.</p><p></p><p>When the elders started begging for mercy, they definitely had to beg for mercy too.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis, our Dongyang Meng is a Ten Blazing Sun genius, this has been confirmed by the three Qing Envoy Lords. If the Marquis spares us, Dongyang Meng will definitely serve the Marquis to the death."</p><p></p><p>The leading elder of the Dongyang family said with a trembling mind.</p><p></p><p>Although Dongyang Meng had not officially become a disciple under Qing Fen Marquis, she had already been confirmed as a Ten Blazing Sun genius by the Qing Envoys, so becoming a disciple was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>The leading Dongyang family elder mentioned this, hoping Qing Fen Marquis would consider</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of your future disciple, be lenient with the Dongyang family," said the Qingfen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Dongyang Meng knelt among the crowd, looking at the Qingfen Marquis who stood with his hands behind his back and an indifferent expression. She still hadn't come to terms with what was happening. </p><p></p><p>Not long ago, she was a favored child of heaven, even catching the special attention of the three Qing envoys. But now, she was kneeling before the Vu family, kneeling before Vu Yan whose feelings she had once toyed with.</p><p></p><p>This dramatic reversal left Dongyang Meng's mind blank.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfen Marquis ignored the pleas of the Dongyang family members and instead turned to Lin Yuan, asking: "Vu Yan, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>The meaning was clear - he was leaving the fate of the entire Dongyang family in Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Vu Yan," the eldest patriarch of the Dongyang family immediately looked at Lin Yuan and begged, "Please spare us. If you spare us, the Dongyang family is willing to be at the Vu family's beck and call."</p><p></p><p>The Vu family members swallowed hard. Even though they realized Lin Yuan had become the Qingfen Marquis's disciple with limitless potential, and that the Dongyang family was no longer their equal, they hadn't expected this day to come so quickly. Before Lin Yuan even made a move, the three Qing envoys had proactively captured all the Dongyang family elites and spoken this way in front of the Qingfen Marquis. And now the Marquis was asking Lin Yuan about this matter?</p><p></p><p>"Spare you?" Lin Yuan looked at the Dongyang family members, his gaze lingering briefly on Dongyang Meng. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dongyang Meng's eyes were red, tears welling up, looking at Lin Yuan with a pleading expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, having made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Vu and Dongyang families were already sworn enemies, and the Dongyang family had even tried to assassinate Lin Yuan because of this.</p><p></p><p>With such deep hatred, Lin Yuan naturally had no intention of letting them off.</p><p></p><p>As for Dongyang Meng? If it were the original Vu Yan, he might have truly spared her, and even the entire Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was not Vu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Qingfen Marquis, in at most a few decades or centuries, when Lin Yuan regained all his power, he would have crushed the entire Dongyang family underfoot anyway.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave it to Your Lordship to decide," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the Qingfen Marquis nodded.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had truly wanted to spare the Dongyang family, he would have directly said to spare them this once.</p><p></p><p>By doing so in front of the entire Dongyang family, it would have also established greater prestige.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he returned the decision-making power back to the Marquis.</p><p></p><p>The implication was equivalent to pronouncing the Dongyang family's fate.</p><p></p><p>"Dongyang family," the Qingfen Marquis looked at the Dongyang family members. Invisible cyan flames burned from the depths of space-time, consuming the bodies and souls of all the Dongyang family members, quickly turning them to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The cyan flames spread along karmic connections. The Dongyang family's powerful members, especially the several Dao Realm elders, all had various life-saving methods. Even if their true bodies were destroyed, they would be able to "resurrect" elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>But the Qingfen Marquis didn't give them this chance at all. The cyan flames spread through karmic connections, encompassing everything related to the names of all Dongyang family members within its burning range.</p><p></p><p>After several breaths.</p><p></p><p>The cyan flames gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"There is no longer a Dongyang family in the Qingfen Domain," said the Qingfen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Lordship," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," the Qingfen Marquis waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me," the Qingfen Marquis looked at Lin Yuan, a gentle smile appearing on his face. "Your talent and potential shouldn't be buried here."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought from the Qingfen Marquis, he and Lin Yuan disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"His Lordship and Lin Yuan have left," the three Qing envoys stood there, their hearts slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back too," You Jue collected himself and looked at the other two Qing envoys. "The future Qingfen Domain may no longer be under Big Brother's control."</p><p></p><p>Main Universe.</p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Inside his body universe.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, reaching 12 million light-years in radius.</p><p></p><p>"It's about right," the red-robed girl looked solemnly at the vast internal universe. Although this internal universe was far smaller in size and area compared to the main universe, in terms of space-time stability and rule operation, it completely surpassed the main universe. Overall, it actually had some semblance of being on par with the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan's form appeared. Just now, he had finally perfectly replicated the universe structure contained in the so-called runes into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"My internal universe..." Lin Yuan carefully sensed the operation of various powers in his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>As the creator and opener of the internal universe, Lin Yuan clearly felt the power contained in the internal universe. It was terrifyingly extreme. Ordinary Sovereign Realm beings could not resist this power at all, and would be reduced to ashes with the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Even the peak Sovereign Realm powerhouse 'Cang Wei Yang' was the same, and would be crushed in terms of pure power.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an internal universe approaching that of a Chaos Venerable?" Lin Yuan was delighted. Although not all combat skills of Chaos Rules were in the internal universe, for him, a Path-breaking Realm being, to have such a level of internal universe was simply unreasonable. He could slaughter almost all Sovereign Realm beings like pigs.</p><p></p><p>Except for a very few special Sovereign Realm beings, such as the Chaos Dragon Beast from the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent and so on, Lin Yuan could almost be called invincible in the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's much stronger than I expected," the red-robed girl thought to herself. During the process of replicating and integrating the universe structure contained in the runes, it also depended on how one's own universe specifically conformed and integrated.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Lin Yuan had done it perfectly, so perfectly that even the red-robed girl couldn't find any flaws.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you can refine the jade gourd," the red-robed girl looked at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>Only with the power of an internal universe that had integrated all the universe structures contained in the runes could one reach the threshold to refine the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>And now Lin Yuan could clearly proceed with refining the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>Once the jade gourd was refined, Lin Yuan would fully master the legacy left by its creator, a legacy opened by a 13th-order time being for their foundation.</p><p></p><p>Just the foundational part of the legacy had allowed Lin Yuan's internal universe to reach this level, so the true legacy of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm that would come next...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A crystal-clear jade gourd floated in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Refine," Lin Yuan immediately extended a trace of his internal universe power, infusing it into the jade gourd, and began to refine it.</p><p></p><p>The moment he started refining the jade gourd, Lin Yuan estimated the approximate time it would take him to complete the refinement.</p><p></p><p>About ten years.</p><p></p><p>To maintain the speed of refinement, Lin Yuan directly placed the jade gourd into his internal universe, immersing it in the endless ocean of internal universe origin to refine it.</p><p></p><p>Refining the jade gourd didn't occupy much of Lin Yuan's mental energy. It wasn't reconstructing the universe, just refining, equivalent to a slow grinding process.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand, and a golden box appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This golden box had a mottled, ancient surface that had experienced long years. In the lower right corner was faintly engraved a complex mark.</p><p></p><p>This was the treasure of the Xuanhuang lineage that Lin Yuan had purchased at the Thousand Treasures Meeting on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

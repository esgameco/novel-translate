        <h1>Chapter 677</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six Patriarchs, including the Patriarch of Blazing Sun. All the Patriarchs had sent him gifts.</p><p></p><p>The preciousness of the gifts was rare even at the Thirteenth Realm, showing that each Patriarch had put in a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>"I just want to know why the Patriarchs have done this? Is it because of my future?" Lin Yuan asked his doubts.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought the six Patriarchs were just simply visiting him, but the Patriarch of Savage Wilderness directly proposed a peer-to-peer exchange. Peer-to-peer exchange? This has almost treated Lin Yuan as a Thirteenth Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The other Patriarchs, including the Great Progenitor, also presented precious gifts. This treatment made Lin Yuan puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Even though his future potential is very high, there's no need for several Patriarchs to treat him this way. After all, the future is full of countless variables and infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The future that the Patriarchs saw may not necessarily happen for certain.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan directly asked, wanting to find out the reason behind the Patriarchs' actions.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Silver River brother, you speak frankly." The Patriarch of Savage Wilderness looked at Lin Yuan, while also glancing at the constantly coming and going attendants.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Blazing Sun waved his hand, and all these attendants were moved out of the main hall. What they were about to discuss next belonged to the Thirteenth Realm level of time and life.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple." The Patriarch of Dark Yin looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Because your future is almost certain to reach the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Certain to reach the Thirteenth Realm?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"At least in the future timelines we have observed, Silver River, you will eventually cross into the Thirteenth Realm, it's just a matter of time, whether it's tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, or even millions or tens of millions of years, you will eventually cross into the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"That's right." The Great Progenitor nodded, "Silver River brother, don't mind us. I specifically observed some timelines trying to obstruct and suppress your rise, but they were useless, at most they could only delay the time when Silver River brother crosses into the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I did the same, but in the end, Silver River brother, you returned, and I was directly suppressed." The Great Spiritual Patriarch nodded.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth Realm time cultivators can observe many future timelines, but in all the timelines they observed, Lin Yuan would be suppressed, with no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>As long as there is one timeline where he can escape the suppression, the time cultivators will choose that timeline as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Returned?" Lin Yuan's thoughts were stirred.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no doubts about this point, as he possessed the Gate of Myriad Realms, with various protective methods from different dimensional spaces, which were realms that time cultivators could hardly involve themselves in.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was the six Patriarchs, at most they could only erase all his traces in this Origin World, but could not completely kill him.</p><p></p><p>And according to Lin Yuan's character, if the Patriarchs really tried to attack him, in the future when he crosses into the Thirteenth Realm, he would definitely return and settle the score.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal coordinates of this Origin World have been recorded by the Gate of Myriad Realms, and he can return anytime.</p><p></p><p>The future timelines the Patriarchs saw only knew that Lin Yuan could not be killed no matter what, but they could not determine the reason, which was normal, after all, it involved the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>But his near-certain future of reaching the Thirteenth Realm?</p><p></p><p>"We don't know the exact reason, even the time lords wandering between different dimensions have only just begun to converge their own timelines, we've never heard of a fixed future?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunderstorm Patriarch looked at Lin Yuan and continued, "But no matter what, Silver River brother, you will definitely cross into the Thirteenth Realm, and in the distant future, you will rise to the highest levels of the Thirteenth Realm. If we don't come to befriend you now, it will be too late in the future."</p><p></p><p>The other Patriarchs nodded slightly. They did not hide anything, nor did they have any malice, they were completely driven by the intention to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most correct approach in the futures they observed. If they had hidden something and tried to make Lin Yuan bear greater karmic consequences through the information gap, then in the future when Silver Celestial Lord crossed into the Thirteenth Realm and saw through everything, he would definitely not have a good impression of them.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs observed one timeline after another, and once they confirmed that they absolutely could not be enemies with Silver Celestial Lord, they naturally would devote their efforts to befriending Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We have no other demands, Silver River brother, you don't need to feel any burden or pressure, we just want to be friends."</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Patriarch spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and he didn't have any other thoughts about the Patriarchs' befriending.</p><p></p><p>They took the initiative to visit and send gifts, clearing obstacles for his cultivation, and told him the truth, regardless of their motives, Lin Yuan would accept this.</p><p></p><p>"The predetermined future is not absolutely certain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a while and spoke.</p><p></p><p>The future timelines the six Patriarchs saw were only partial, not all-encompassing.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that his chance of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm is a bit higher than other beings.</p><p></p><p>"That's indeed the case."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs looked at each other and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>So their explanation to Lin Yuan was that he was almost certain to cross into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Why did they use the word "almost"? It's because they were not Fourteenth Realm perfect time cultivators, unable to see all timelines, and they couldn't be sure that in the timelines they hadn't observed, Silver Celestial Lord could still maintain this definite future.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, I still thank the Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Patriarchs, "If I really do cross into the Thirteenth Realm in the future, I will definitely not forget all of you."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha." The Patriarchs exchanged smiles.</p><p></p><p>They came together, didn't they, just to establish a good relationship with Silver Celestial Lord? All they wanted was for Silver Celestial Lord to remember this friendship in the future and not attack them.</p><p></p><p>"Almost certain to cross into the Thirteenth Realm"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought a lot about this. At least it means that the path he is currently walking is not problematic, and the backup plans he has laid out, such as spreading the evolutionary path of the Martial Dao, are correct.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River brother, if there's anything you need, just say it." The Patriarch of Savage Wilderness said.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has not yet crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, any requests he makes, these Patriarchs can at least fulfill. And once Lin Yuan actively makes a request, and they fulfill it, it will also deepen the karmic relationship between them.</p><p></p><p>This is practically a free opportunity. If they wait until Lin Yuan also crosses into the Thirteenth Realm before making requests, these Patriarchs may not be able to provide assistance anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are unwilling to provide assistance, but that they simply cannot do it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Silver River brother, just say it directly." The Patriarch of Dark Yin also said the same.</p><p></p><p>"I want to comprehend more of the supreme inheritances and guidance." Lin Yuan looked at the five Patriarchs and said.</p><p></p><p>"More supreme inheritances and guidance?" The Great Progenitor and the other four Patriarchs immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The treasuries of the major ancient nations contained many supreme inheritances and guidance. To obtain these, one must render great service to the ancient nations, and even after comprehending and cultivating them, they are forbidden from spreading them, requiring an oath in the name of the Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>If violated, it would bring the Patriarchs' retaliation.</p><p></p><p>So, Lin Yuan wanting to comprehend the supreme inheritances and guidance of the other five ancient nations required the consent of the five Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" The Patriarch of Savage Wilderness said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor waved his mighty hand, and a jade slip appeared before him, containing all the supreme inheritances and guidance of the ancient barbaric kingdom. The supreme inheritances and guidance, whether important or not, were still very important, as they could not be passed on, and the ways to obtain them were limited, basically monopolized by the major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But it's not that they're not important either, because as long as they are inheritance and guidance, they can be replicated, except for the initial establishment, there is almost no subsequent cost.</p><p></p><p>The other four Progenitors also took out the supreme inheritance and guidance of their respective ancient kingdoms, and even specially marked some content, adding their own insights.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile, as he had long been very interested in the supreme inheritances of the major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Even when he first took over the Black Jade Nest and left the two Celestial Venerables of the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, he had noticed the traces of cultivating the supreme inheritance "Xuanyin Secret Canon" from them, and wanted to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing." Lin Yuan put away the many supreme inheritance guidance and looked at the Progenitors.</p><p></p><p>"Speak quickly, Silver River brother." The Progenitor of the Barbaric Ancient Kingdom immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The more requests Lin Yuan made, the more pleased He became.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to spread the martial cultivation inheritance I have established in the six major ancient kingdoms." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Spreading the evolutionary path of the martial dao was something Lin Yuan had been doing all along, even though he had learned from the Progenitors that he had entered the Thirteen Realms with a firm grip. He would not give up.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, the "firm grip" here might not have been achieved without the evolutionary path of the martial dao? And the Progenitors' view of the timeline was limited, so the so-called "firm grip" still had variables, so he naturally tried to do everything to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Spread the martial cultivation inheritance? No problem."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give the order right away."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Dafou and the other five Progenitors nodded, and through observing the future timeline, they also knew that the martial cultivation inheritance was an inheritance no less terrible than the ones they themselves cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In many future timelines, the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River had basically been spreading the martial cultivation inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Progenitor Dafou, Progenitor Daling and the other five Progenitors continued to chat with Lin Yuan for a while, and after confirming that the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River had no other needs, they stood up and took their leave.</p><p></p><p>After the five Progenitors returned to their respective ancient kingdoms, a series of orders related to the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River began to be fully implemented.</p><p></p><p>The most important point was that they absolutely must not provoke the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River, especially the existence of the Celestial Venerables of the major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the major ancient kingdoms began to promote the spread of the martial cultivation inheritance established by the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>This left countless powerhouses of the six major ancient kingdoms somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Not to offend the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River? An order from the Progenitors themselves?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would the lofty Progenitors care about the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>"And the martial cultivation inheritance? It's understandable that the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is spreading it, after all the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River comes from there, but the other five major ancient kingdoms?"</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the orders issued by the Progenitors are because that Celestial Venerable of the Silver River is too incredible."</p><p></p><p>"The five Progenitors treat the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River in such a peculiar way, just what kind of ability does the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River have?"</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses of the six major ancient kingdoms were full of incredulity, the Progenitors' bizarre attitude made many powerhouses unable to understand, the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River's strength was indeed very strong, being the first undefeatable Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>But even if he was so strong, could he be on par with the Progenitors? It's just that, not understanding aside, the Progenitors were unwilling to offend the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River, even if these great Celestial Venerables had ten times the courage, they would not dare to provoke the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without the Progenitors' orders, there were no great Celestial Venerables who would dare to provoke the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River, the title of "Undefeatable Celestial Venerate" was not for nothing, even the strongest Celestial Venerate of the Dafou Ancient Kingdom, when facing the Celestial Venerable of the Silver River, could only be described as utterly hopeless, and could only try to cultivate the forbidden supreme inheritance to resist.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver River Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, in front of him was a heart that pulsed like an abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was the Heart of the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>As the first life born in this source world, the Abyss Dragon, even without crossing the Thirteen Realms, its special qualities were not much weaker than the Time Life.</p><p></p><p>After Progenitor Dafou crossed the Thirteen Realms, the first thing he did was to kill the other, not only because of the hatred between the two, but also because the Abyss Dragon was really too special.</p><p></p><p>This time, if it was not for the sake of getting along with Lin Yuan, Progenitor Dafou would not have taken out this Abyss Dragon Heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's too perfect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the miniature source world within the heart, his expression somewhat obsessed.</p><p></p><p>Through observing the source world within the heart, Lin Yuan vaguely knew why this world was called the Source World, and why the Chaotic Void, an existence no less than the Source World, was not within the thirty-three Source Worlds?</p><p></p><p>"The most fundamental point of the Source World is 'perfection'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The boundless Chaotic Void has many flaws and hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>The special place established by the Thirteen Realm Time Life was to cover and make up for the corresponding hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>But this Source World did not have that, at least through the miniature Source World within the Abyss Dragon's heart, Lin Yuan had not found any hidden flaws or shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>The overall feeling the Source World gave Lin Yuan was perfection.</p><p></p><p>Even though there would still be a Great Destruction one day, its existence time would be far beyond the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared out of thin air, the one on the left was a bald man, and the one on the right was rather thin.</p><p></p><p>The auras emanating from these two figures were terribly powerful, the operating rules of the Chaotic Void constantly retreated, they were undoubtedly two supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>"During this period, we have gone through all the enemies with some karmic enmity with the Yin Mo and Nine Phoenix great saints, but we haven't found anything special, only this Silver River great saint is left."</p><p></p><p>The thin figure on the right spoke in a low voice, they two supreme great saints were acting on the orders of the 'Rahu Great Saint' to investigate the reason for the complete disappearance of the karmic enmity of the Yin Mo Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Silver River Great Saint's origins were mysterious, but in the Xuanhuang Universe, he was the only one who had killed the Yin Mo Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint, which made the two supreme great saints judge that the former must have some unknown enmity with Yin Mo and Nine Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and confirm it, then go back and report."</p><p></p><p>The bald figure said, he did not think the Silver River Great Saint had anything to do with the complete disappearance of Yin Mo and Nine Phoenix. No matter how strong the Silver River Great Saint was, based on his performance in the Xuanhuang Universe, he was not a supreme great saint.</p><p></p><p>To be able to silently and completely erase Yin Mo and Nine Phoenix, two great saints? Almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>They two supreme great saints came this time, just to do their duty, at least to show Rahu Great Saint that they had tried their best, they had looked at all the many enemies of Yin Mo and Nine Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The thin figure on the right nodded, then stepped into the void, overlooking the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, come out quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sound waves penetrated through the layers of space and time, instantly reaching every corner of the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

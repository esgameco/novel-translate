        <h1>Chapter 636</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly absorbed the content of the inheritance. Many aspects that had previously confused him now began to "melt away".</p><p></p><p>The creator of this inheritance lineage was a supreme celestial immortal from the ancient Leiyang Kingdom, from countless ages ago.</p><p></p><p>This supreme celestial immortal's father was from the royal family of the Leiyang Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>And his mother was a cultivator from the ancient Xuanyin Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Leiyang Kingdom and the Xuanyin Kingdom had origins tracing back to two great ancestral progenitors, representing completely opposite paths.</p><p></p><p>But the inheritance of bloodlines is miraculous, able to accommodate everything.</p><p></p><p>After the royal of the Leiyang Kingdom and the cultivator from the Xuanyin Kingdom united, the creator of this inheritance lineage was born, possessing the bloodlines of both Leiyang and Xuanyin.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, the inheritance creator grew up in the Leiyang Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>So naturally, he was exposed to and focused on the Leiyang-related inheritances, cultivating the Leiyang path.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xuanyin essence deep in his bloodline? He didn't pay too much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>But as his power and realm continuously increased, when he reached the third layer of cultivating the chaotic Leiyang path, this inheritance creator vaguely realized that the so-called Leiyang and Xuanyin may not be opposites.</p><p></p><p>Since everything originated from the chaos, how could there be opposition? "Leiyang? Xuanyin? If they could be completely fused, I feel it would be an entirely new path, a path that surpasses everything I've known before. Unfortunately, my comprehension is not enough, and I'm unable to perfectly integrate them."</p><p></p><p>In the inherited content Lin Yuan absorbed, there appeared a series of scenes, including the final recorded message of this inheritance creator:</p><p></p><p>"If I could reach the realm of the ancestral progenitor, with the grand perspective of such a mighty life, I should be able to fuse Leiyang and Xuanyin into one. So next, I will attempt to break through to the final step."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly reviewed the entire inheritance. This inheritance ended with the creator preparing to assault the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He likely didn't succeed." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Among the six ancient kingdoms of this source world, the Xuanyin Kingdom was the last to be born, and he had never heard of a 7th ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>If a new 13th Realm ancestral progenitor had been born, it would have definitely given rise to a 7th ancient kingdom. </p><p></p><p>But since there is no 7th ancient kingdom, it means this inheritance creator did not cross into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The 13th Realm..." Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the chaotic void or this source world, reaching the 13th Realm to become a time immortal is the ultimate goal for all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Only those who can see through the past and future timelines, the 13th Realm beings, can attain true freedom in the broadest sense.</p><p></p><p>As for lives below the 13th Realm? Their vision is limited to just the spatial dimension, unable to see the distant future, unaware of what will happen the next moment, like a lone boat adrift on the vast ocean, not knowing when it will capsize.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of time, all lives below the 13th Realm are blind, only able to grope in the darkness, while 13th Realm beings have gained sight, able to perceive the surroundings, the dangers and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"This inheritance has been very helpful to me, it was worth it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts. He had to admit, the cultivators of this source world had a far deeper comprehension of the Dao paths than those in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The supreme saints of the chaotic void were only at the second layer in the evolution of chaotic power, but they could match the third layer supreme celestial immortals of this source world's chaotic evolution path, solely due to the advantage of their inner universes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many cultivators of the six ancient kingdoms had also tried to open their inner worlds and inner universes, reaching a certain level of mastery over the Dao. Opening a world-universe is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, without the infusion of the primal source from the chaotic void, the cultivators of this source world, even if they successfully opened their inner worlds and universes, were unable to elevate them to the point of providing themselves with tremendous assistance.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that Lin Yuan realized how important the chaotic void's infusion of the primal universe source and the chaotic void primal source were, directly leading to the cultivators of the chaotic void having a far stronger foundational essence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this source world also had advantages surpassing the chaotic void - its ease of Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Why could the supreme celestial immortals of the six ancient kingdoms cultivate the chaotic evolution path to the third layer, exceeding the supreme saints of the chaotic void? It was naturally due to this source world's exaggerated Dao comprehension capacity.</p><p></p><p>"I have 200,000 merit points left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan checked his merit point balance, seeing that 180,000 points had been spent on this inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"I'll exchange the remaining merit for Chaotic Rune Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the precious inheritances he valued, finding that 20,000 points were not enough, so he decided to exchange for more Chaotic Rune Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Rune Diagrams were meticulously created by the Leiyang ancestral progenitor, using the perspective of a 13th Realm time immortal, to re-condense the fundamental chaotic Dao rules governing the evolution of all things.</p><p></p><p>There were 54 diagrams representing the three levels of the chaotic realm, each costing 100,000 merit points. Lin Yuan had previously exchanged one, and now had 200,000 points left to get two more to ponder over.</p><p></p><p>Exchanging for the Chaotic Rune Diagrams would definitely not be a loss, as these emblems of the chaotic Dao's fundamentals could greatly assist Lin Yuan in Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the manor, Lin Yuan suddenly recalled the information the Emperor had revealed.</p><p></p><p>The Leiyang Kingdom had obtained the guardianship rights over the first-grade treasure land "Limitless Eye" from the Xuanyin Kingdom, for 10 billion years.</p><p></p><p>"Limitless Eye." Lin Yuan's mind flashed with the information about this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, it appeared as a massive eye-shaped formation, and it produced the precious "Limitless Crystals".</p><p></p><p>Hence, it was named the "Limitless Eye".</p><p></p><p>Refining a certain amount of Limitless Crystals could transform one's physical body towards the Limitless Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>The Limitless Divine Body was one of the top divine bodies among the six ancient kingdoms. Although not as adept at offense as the Leiyang Divine Body, the Limitless Divine Body could possess the strengths of other divine bodies simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Limitless Crystals were highly sought after by the powerful cultivators of the six ancient kingdoms, as no one would refuse to obtain an additional top-tier divine body, which would greatly boost their combat power.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure lands nurtured in this source world all have great benefits for cultivation and the evolution of life, especially the first-grade ones."</p><p></p><p>"The constant expansion and contraction of wars between the six ancient kingdoms is largely due to the struggle for control over certain treasure lands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, treasure lands cannot be moved, so whichever ancient kingdom controls the area, they gain ownership of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>For example, if one day the Xuanyin Kingdom and the Leiyang Kingdom engaged in a battlefield conflict, and the Leiyang Kingdom was defeated, the Xuanyin Kingdom would seize control of the area where the Black Jade's Nest was located.</p><p></p><p>Then the Black Jade's Nest would belong to the Xuanyin Kingdom, and Lin Yuan as the guardian would have to withdraw. </p><p></p><p>And before withdrawing, he could only take away the Black Jade, but the Black Jade's Nest itself, as a treasure land, could not be destroyed. This was an iron rule among the six ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>No matter what level the treasure land was, it could not be destroyed, or else the cultivator would be hunted down by the powerful experts of all six ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Back at the manor, Lin Yuan sat in meditation, deeply pondering the inheritance of "Leiyang, Xuanyin, Chaos".</p><p></p><p>"With just 180,000 merit points, I was able to exchange for an inheritance of this level, my luck is really good."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension deepened, and his gains became greater.</p><p></p><p>The Creator's inheritance encompassed the bloodlines of the Scorching Sun and the Mysterious Yin, and with the addition of the evolutionary rules of the Chaotic Force, the path became that of the Scorching Sun. After comprehending the Mysterious Yin, he had conducted in-depth research on the integration and complementation between the two paths.</p><p></p><p>Although the Scorching Sun and the Mysterious Yin were different from the Great Yang and the Great Yin, there were many similarities between them. The Creator had comprehended the Chaotic Scorching Sun and the Chaotic Mysterious Yin to the third level, and had already begun to explore their perfect fusion.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan extended his right hand, and strands of the profoundly yin force began to swirl, clashing with the environment saturated with the essence of the Scorching Sun.</p><p></p><p>The many inheritances of the Mysterious Yin obtained from slaying the Northern Yin Sovereign and the Extreme Cold Sovereign, combined with the "Scorching Sun, Mysterious Yin, Chaos" inheritance obtained through 1.8 million merit points, had greatly accelerated Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Mysterious Yin path.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, and his consciousness descended into the universe within his true body.</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the source world's true body was not as vast as the Chaotic Void, but it was still measured in billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the inner universe, numerous Dao rules converged, forming a giant egg-shaped structure, with Chaotic Qi swirling around it, faintly nurturing and evolving something.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the peak of the second level of Chaotic Rule comprehension, Lin Yuan had begun to attempt the evolution of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Dao path, and the scene before him was the result.</p><p></p><p>The giant egg with Chaotic Qi swirling around it was the final attainment of Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Chaotic Rules, and the power of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji being nurtured and evolved within it.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the Mysterious Yin path has allowed me to undergo a qualitative transformation in the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji Dao, and this Chaotic Force Dao path can be evolved within a maximum of ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>Before this, even with his Chaotic Second Level Rule comprehension, he could only sense the ongoing evolution, but was unsure of when it would be completed.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan could feel the specific time of evolution - ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that comprehending the Mysterious Yin and supplementing the Great Yin path was the right decision."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Taiji Dao formed by the Great Yang and the Great Yin could be perfectly complementary, with the Great Yang's insufficiency being compensated by the Great Yin's transformation, and the Great Yin's insufficiency being compensated by the Great Yang's transformation.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin-Yang formed through mutual transformation could never match the one Lin Yuan had truly comprehended, as his understanding of the Great Yin was superior to the Great Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will continue to comprehend the Mysterious Yin, which will accelerate the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Chaotic Taiji Dao was his exclusive path, and in the Chaotic Void, it would be the difference between an ordinary Sovereign and a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Just comprehending the Mysterious Yin?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly: "Relying solely on this inheritance to comprehend the true Mysterious Yin Dao is still too slow."</p><p></p><p>The "Scorching Sun, Mysterious Yin, Chaos" inheritance only contained the Creator's own understanding of the Mysterious Yin path, and while it had provided Lin Yuan with great guidance, it was still insufficient for him to comprehend the true Mysterious Yin Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Creator of this inheritance reached the path of comprehending the Mysterious Yin by delving into the Mysterious Yin roots within their own bloodline, and I can emulate this approach."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although he did not have the Mysterious Yin bloodline, the countless beings in the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country all had the Mysterious Yin bloodline flowing through them.</p><p></p><p>If he could not comprehend his own, could he not comprehend others'? The Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, the Dragon Frost Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Domain was the fief of the Dragon Frost Marquis, a peak Sovereign with a formidable reputation in the southwestern region of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"How should I further advance and cross into the Sovereign realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis was in seclusion, pondering his future path.</p><p></p><p>For beings outside the royal family, only by crossing into the Sovereign realm could they truly be considered part of the ancient country's upper echelons, and compete for power with the royalty and core royal family members.</p><p></p><p>For example, the many precious inheritances available for exchange in the ancient country's treasuries required an immense amount of merit points, which ordinary Sovereigns had little hope of accumulating.</p><p></p><p>Sovereigns could gather the merit points because they typically guarded some treasured lands, and through the merit bestowed upon them over the long years, they could eventually amass enough.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis' expression suddenly changed drastically, as he noticed the space around him being distorted, as if a slice of a mirror had been cut out, completely severing his connection to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A figure emerged from the void, silently gazing down at the Dragon Frost Marquis below.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis suddenly jolted, immediately rising and bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The ability to easily sever his space-time from the outside world meant that his life and death were now in the other's hands, and the Dragon Frost Marquis had no thought of resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Give me five drops of your essence blood, pure essence blood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the Dragon Frost Marquis, speaking calmly.</p><p></p><p>As a peak Sovereign, the Dragon Frost Marquis should have a high concentration of Mysterious Yin bloodline, which Lin Yuan could use to further his comprehension and understanding of the true Mysterious Yin Dao.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Mysterious Yin bloodline, Scorching Sun bloodline, or Great Spirit bloodline, they all contained fragments of the true Thirteen Tiers Ancestor's Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis obediently complied, without any resistance, and squeezed out five drops of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Essence blood was the most important blood of a being, and even for a Sovereign, there was not much that could be considered true essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, do not let these five drops of essence blood be extinguished."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the essence blood and glanced at the Dragon Frost Marquis, casually stating.</p><p></p><p>Beings at the Twelve Tiers realm had absolute control over any part of their physical body, and could extinguish it with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Even though the five drops of essence blood were now in Lin Yuan's hands, the Dragon Frost Marquis could still have them extinguished with a mere thought, just as he could extinguish his own physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan completely destroyed the Dragon Frost Marquis' will and consciousness, leaving the physical body as an unowned object, there was no way to prevent it.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis nodded hurriedly, his heart trembling.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Dragon Frost Marquis felt the space-time restore, and he once again sensed the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Just now..." The Dragon Frost Marquis steadied his mind. If he had not lost those five drops of essence blood, he might have thought the entire experience was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"That powerful expert?" The Dragon Frost Marquis thought about the mysterious figure who had appeared, before whom he had completely lost control of the space-time, feeling like an ant before a giant.</p><p></p><p>"A Sovereign, definitely a Sovereign realm expert."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis swallowed hard, now vaguely aware that his five drops of essence blood had already vanished, but he had no idea where they were now.</p><p></p><p>"What does this powerful expert want with my essence blood?"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Frost Marquis was puzzled, but he dared not attempt to extinguish those five drops of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he could extinguish his own essence blood, even after it had left his body.</p><p></p><p>But then what? Angering that mysterious Sovereign would be no different from a mere ant being crushed.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

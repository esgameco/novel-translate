        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void was boundless and endless, giving birth to countless universes.</p><p></p><p>Each universe was equivalent to a Chaos Lord in scale.</p><p></p><p>Within a universe, the will of its origin was invincible. Even peak Dao-Opening realm beings could easily be suppressed. Even if a Sovereign realm life form was born, it could not resist the consciousness of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>Inside a universe, it was like the home turf of a Chaos Lord. How could ordinary Sovereign realm beings resist? But just now, when the Milky Way's strongest being erupted with power surpassing the peak Dao-Opening realm, not only did the universe's origin consciousness not suppress it, but it actively retreated? The two Calamity Clan Ultimates didn't think this was due to the kindness of the universe's origin consciousness. The origin consciousness fundamentally didn't have an emotion like "kindness".</p><p></p><p>The only thing that could make the origin consciousness make such a decision was if it felt that suppressing the Milky Way's strongest being "wasn't worth it".</p><p></p><p>"Chaos realm? Has the Milky Way's strongest entered the Chaos realm?" </p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate inside the wooden house spoke with a trembling voice. Even though they had long speculated that the Milky Way's strongest was the reincarnation of some great saint.</p><p></p><p>But this cultivation speed was too fast, right? From the Milky Way's strongest being born until now, about a thousand years had passed, and they had directly grown to the Chaos realm?</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not the Chaos realm, the Milky Way's strongest's power is infinitely close to the Chaos realm. At the very least they can challenge a Lord, otherwise the origin consciousness wouldn't retreat like this."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden house said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Even inside a universe, for the origin consciousness to suppress a Chaos Lord would be extremely difficult, and might even cause the great destruction to arrive early.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way's strongest, which peerless great saint is the Milky Way's strongest the reincarnation of?" The Calamity Clan Ultimate inside the wooden house composed himself, but couldn't help being curious.</p><p></p><p>Even for a great saint's reincarnation, wanting to enter the Chaos realm so quickly would be very difficult to achieve. After the great saints reincarnated, their rule comprehension and mental will wouldn't become bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>But for realm breakthroughs, rule comprehension and mental will alone weren't enough. The physical body, soul, and other aspects also had to keep up.</p><p></p><p>Even possessing great saint level rule comprehension, if the physical body was just an ordinary mortal body, it still couldn't withstand a Dao-Opening realm being.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to which great saint the Milky Way's strongest is the reincarnation of, I'm more interested in knowing why the Milky Way's strongest reincarnated?" The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the wooden house also became interested.</p><p></p><p>They had made the correct choice at the critical moment, promptly befriending the Milky Way's strongest, which is why they could leisurely observe and discuss here now.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, such a powerful being, why exactly did they reincarnate?" The Calamity Clan Ultimate inside the wooden house was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Reincarnation was equivalent to starting over from scratch, obscuring part of one's memories. Even for a peerless great saint, reincarnation still carried certain risks.</p><p></p><p>If there wasn't a sufficiently important reason, no great saint would be willing to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"After completing the first level of 'Infinite Void', the universe inside my body underwent a major transformation, raising the upper limits of my physical body and soul another notch."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed his own body, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>A powerful physical body and soul would give birth to a sufficiently powerful internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, a sufficiently powerful internal universe would also nourish the physical body and soul in return.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe and the physical body and soul were originally one, in a complementary relationship.</p><p></p><p>"Now I estimate it will take about 1,800 years for me to enter the Sovereign realm." Lin Yuan calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>From the Dao-Opening realm to the Sovereign realm, the most difficult part was reaching the seventh level of space-time rule comprehension, and for the internal universe to reach a radius of a million light years.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had long since met these requirements.</p><p></p><p>What was constraining Lin Yuan to remain in the Dao-Opening realm was actually that his physical body and soul had not yet reached their limits.</p><p></p><p>For normal peak Dao-Opening realm beings, having experienced enough time, their physical bodies and souls would have long since reached their limits.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's power had increased too quickly, and he had lived for too short a time. The limits of his physical body and soul were also terrifyingly high, causing this simplest requirement to instead restrict his speed of entering the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>"1,800 years, not long."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. If he hadn't completed the second level of 'Infinite Void', transforming his internal universe and greatly increasing the nourishment to his physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, according to Lin Yuan's estimate, for his physical body and soul to reach their limits would probably take five to six thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"The second level of 'Infinite Void'" Lin Yuan began to continue pondering.</p><p></p><p>The first level of 'Infinite Void' had given Lin Yuan a taste of sweetness. The benefits brought by a deep foundation were really too great. Naturally, Lin Yuan wanted to take another step forward in this inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"The second level of 'Infinite Void' will improve the internal universe to a level approaching that of a Chaos Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If that was true, after completing the second level, wouldn't he be able to sweep through ordinary Chaos Lords?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The life essence required for the second level of 'Infinite Void' is at least at the Sovereign realm level for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued browsing, his expression showing slight regret.</p><p></p><p>Without a sufficiently thick life essence, one simply couldn't withstand such a powerful internal world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to enter the Sovereign realm first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Up to now, he had reached bottlenecks in all aspects. Without entering the Sovereign realm, it would be very difficult for his power to undergo a large qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Source World, Qingfen City, Fentian Academy.</p><p></p><p>Fentian Academy was said to be a courtyard, but in reality the main body was a tower, a thirteen-story high tower.</p><p></p><p>The 300 years that had passed in the main universe, for the Source World, had only been...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...for a year.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the tower, eagerly absorbing all kinds of inheritance texts. These inheritance texts were collected by Qing Fen Hou over long years, and covered almost everything, even including cultivation methods from other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary, viewing inheritance texts allows you to grasp the essence of corresponding paths]</p><p></p><p>By browsing countless inheritance texts, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the infinite wisdom and paths contained within them.</p><p></p><p>The rules and operations of this source world were completely different from the chaotic void. Even the same fire rules manifested in different ways.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan were to comprehend slowly on his own, it would take a huge amount of time to gradually sense exactly how the same rules differed.</p><p></p><p>But by viewing these inheritance texts? Corresponding to the countless texts from the chaotic void, Lin Yuan's understanding and insights into this source world increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, besides viewing large numbers of inheritance texts, Lin Yuan hadn't been idle. He had once again condensed nearly 8,000 Seeds of the Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, condensing Seeds of the Blazing Sun didn't require much mental effort, and he could easily multitask.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he hadn't neglected adapting and recovering along the path of martial evolution, proceeding in parallel with condensing the Seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Inheritance texts present the great Dao of heaven and earth in a more easily understandable form."</p><p></p><p>"The operation of the Dao and rules in this source world is no weaker than the chaotic void. If I fully comprehend it, the benefits will be immeasurable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached out and picked up a fallen leaf. The leaf was verdant green, with some kind of path containing endless vitality recorded within.</p><p></p><p>"In this source world, Great Venerable level existences are equivalent to Venerables of the chaotic void, while Heavenly Venerables are equal to Great Saints."</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, those strong enough for the Blazing Sun Ancient Country to actively confer the title of 'Marquis' are Great Venerables, while those conferred the title of 'King' are Heavenly Venerables."</p><p></p><p>Various pieces of information floated through Lin Yuan's mind. Qing Fen Hou was a Great Venerable, but at the peak level, extremely close to a Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Strong ones at the Great Venerable level have basically used chaos rules to nurture their own great Dao. In this aspect they are somewhat stronger than the Venerables of the chaotic void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>All Dao rules originate from chaos, and chaos can also nurture myriad Daos. For example, the green flames wielded by Qing Fen Hou - were they just ordinary flames?</p><p></p><p>They were chaos flames nurtured by chaos rules, able to easily burn even space and time.</p><p></p><p>"But the strong ones of this source world generally have weaker foundations, without internal universes to support them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew the strengths and weaknesses of the two dimensional universes from viewing countless inheritance texts.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Seeds of the Blazing Sun, life forms of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country surpassed those of the same level in the chaotic void by a large margin in their comprehension of rules. They more easily nurtured chaos rules and went further in the realm of chaos rules.</p><p></p><p>Techniques like using chaos rules to nurture myriad Daos, if placed in the chaotic void, would probably have already stepped into the realm of Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"This floor is finished?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put down the verdant green leaf and discovered that he had already gone through all the inheritance texts around him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the 13th floor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up. The Burning Sky Pavilion had 13 floors in total. The higher the floor, the more difficult and profound the inheritance texts recorded there.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, Lin Yuan had already finished viewing the first 12 floors. Now he planned to ascend to the 13th floor.</p><p></p><p>"One needs to fully comprehend all the inheritance texts on the 12th floor to go up to the 13th floor?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly as he looked at the transparent barrier in front of the path to the 13th floor.</p><p></p><p>Actually, this condition existed not just between the 12th and 13th floors, but also between the 1st and 2nd floors, 2nd and 3rd floors, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Lin Yuan casually condensed a wisp of energy containing the essence of all the inheritance texts on the 12th floor, then easily ascended to the 13th floor.</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation requires reverence." Qing Fen Hou opened his eyes, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple has seen countless inheritance texts in the Burning Sky Pavilion and gained some understanding of this world. He should have developed a sense of reverence by now."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Qing Fen Hou's face.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude were too strong, so strong that even Qing Fen Hou admitted he couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how strong one's talent and aptitude, they were still just talent and aptitude. To reach the peak on the path of cultivation, one must possess a heart of reverence.</p><p></p><p>So after bringing Lin Yuan back, Qing Fen Hou did nothing, taught nothing, and directly threw Lin Yuan into the Burning Sky Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It contained countless inheritance texts.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan browsed and read a little, he could comprehend the infinite wisdom and paths contained within.</p><p></p><p>The more he saw, the more he understood, the more he would feel his own insignificance. Wouldn't a heart of reverence naturally arise this way?</p><p></p><p>"Burning Sky Pavilion"</p><p></p><p>Qing Fen Hou's gaze turned towards the Burning Sky Pavilion. Before this, he had deliberately avoided paying attention to it, to avoid seeing Lin Yuan scratching his head in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Now after a year of settling in, it was time to appear and give Lin Yuan some guidance, to make him realize the loftiness of heaven and earth, and the profundity of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Under Qing Fen Hou's gaze, the Burning Sky Pavilion was laid bare.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this, when Qing Fen Hou clearly saw the Burning Sky Pavilion, he was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

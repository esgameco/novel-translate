        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 320 - On the Verge of Collapse (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Your Holiness, what exactly is going on?" </p><p></p><p>The other members of the Longshan Clan were also a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They had absolute trust in Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It's just that a moment ago, there were still hundreds of true gods and their incarnations about to arrive, and the destruction of the Longshan Clan was imminent.</p><p></p><p>Now there's no danger?</p><p></p><p>This reversal was too sudden.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he kept flashing back to the scene just now where Lin Yuan lightly inhaled, and all the "mediator" figures in his palm collapsed and merged into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Those "mediator" figures were incarnations of true gods! Some of the incarnations of high-ranking gods were no weaker than normal true gods.</p><p></p><p>Yet they actually met such an end.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order trembled a little in his heart. At this moment, he actually felt a bit thankful that he didn't take action just now. Otherwise, even if he didn't die, he probably would have been swept aside by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"How...how could the Longshan Patriarch be so powerful?" The Pope of Order raised his head and looked up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>So many stars hung there, the divine kingdoms of the gods of the Ocean of Light and Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>The number of gods is limited, so the divine kingdoms are limited, and the stars above the sky are limited.</p><p></p><p>In this world, some demigods carefully and stealthily collect faith, and may be able to escape the perception of the gods.</p><p></p><p>But if they take that step and become a true god, raising a divine kingdom, then it cannot be concealed.</p><p></p><p>Because the divine kingdoms are too conspicuous, transforming into stars, hanging high above the heavens. There are only so many, so the appearance of any new one is bound to attract the attention of the gods.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the past few hundred years, or even a thousand years, no new stars have appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In other words, no new gods have been born.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be inferred that the Longshan Patriarch has not yet become a god, at least he has not raised a divine kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But without raising a divine kingdom and borrowing its power, why would the Longshan Patriarch be so strong?</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order felt his understanding shattering. The Longshan Patriarch is not a god, so how could he kill gods like ants?</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order calmed himself, collected his thoughts, and looked at Longshan Ling and the other core members of the Longshan Clan beside him, who were all puzzled and confused.</p><p></p><p>"The Longshan Patriarch is right."</p><p></p><p>"There is no danger now."</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order said with difficulty. </p><p></p><p>Danger?</p><p></p><p>All the danger was swallowed by the Longshan Patriarch in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no danger now?"</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ling and the others breathed a sigh of relief, and at the same time became more and more curious.</p><p></p><p>"Those incarnations of the true gods were all dealt with by the Longshan Patriarch. The 'mediator' figures in the Longshan Patriarch's palm just now were those incarnations of the true gods."</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order was silent for a while, then patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that after today, the prestige of the Longshan Patriarch would resound through the Ocean of Light and Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Those things were incarnations of true gods?"</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ling and the others were a bit dumbfounded. "The incarnations of true gods are so weak?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as they said the last sentence, they reacted.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the incarnations of true gods are weak, but that their patriarch is too strong. Compared to the patriarch, the mighty and invincible incarnations of true gods appear feeble and fragile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving first."</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order took one last deep look inside the Longshan Hall, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>What he had witnessed was too incredible and needed to be reported to the God of Order as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Actually, there was no need for him to report it. This matter couldn't be kept under wraps at all. The true gods whose divine incarnations were swallowed by Lin Yuan in one gulp had already blown their tops.</p><p></p><p>This matter would spread among the gods at a terrifying speed, and would not be limited to the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Inside the winding, coiling palace.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of true gods looked at each other, the shock in their hearts almost overflowing.</p><p></p><p>"My divine incarnation is dead."</p><p></p><p>"Me too, I can no longer sense it at all."</p><p></p><p>"That huge face that appeared at the end, doesn't it look a bit like the patriarch of the Longshan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just looks like, it should be the patriarch of the Longshan Clan."</p><p></p><p>One true god after another felt their scalps go numb. As eighth-level true gods, their memories would not be wrong. That huge face, if shrunk by billions of times, would be the patriarch of the Longshan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their divine incarnations were on their way to Longshan Ridge to call that patriarch of the Longshan Clan to account when they were moved into a space cage.</p><p></p><p>With all the clues converging, it pointed to one possibility.</p><p></p><p>That patriarch of the Longshan Clan, whom they regarded as an ant and wanted to burn his soul in the divine kingdom for ten thousand years, was just a mere demigod.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the gods had never taken the Longshan Patriarch seriously, even though he was the mastermind behind the disappearance of demigods in recent years.</p><p></p><p>But a demigod is a demigod.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful a demigod is, as long as he has not gathered faith and raised a divine kingdom, he is an ant.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The ant in the eyes of the gods had suddenly transformed into a towering dragon?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible."</p><p></p><p>"How can he be so strong without becoming a god?"</p><p></p><p>"Right, that Longshan Patriarch isn't even a true god, so why is he so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Even with so much evidence laid out in front of them, there were still true gods who found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>They had gone through countless hardships and finally raised divine kingdoms and entered the Ocean of Light, becoming gods high above the masses.</p><p></p><p>And now this happens?</p><p></p><p>"I want to see the main god and find out the reason for this. Why exactly is that Longshan Patriarch so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but which main god should we go see?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see the God of Divination. There's nothing in the world he doesn't know. The God of Divination must know the origins of that Longshan Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The true gods immediately got up.</p><p></p><p>Among the twelve main gods of the Ocean of Light, the God of Divination was the most unique existence, and also the one with the best temper.</p><p></p><p>The other main gods, such as the God of Order, the Goddess of the Magic Web, the God of the Seven-Colored Dragon, and so on, were all nearly absolutely rational, and when not sleeping, they were in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Only the God of Divination would sometimes enlighten them.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the gods had sought the God of Divination to deduce the final location of those disappeared demigods.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that this deduction was obviously correct. With the strength of the Longshan Patriarch, it would be too easy to secretly abduct some demigods.</p><p></p><p>"Could that Longshan Patriarch be a god who nearly fell and whose divine kingdom fell to the mortal world in the long ages past?"</p><p></p><p>Some true gods speculated.</p><p></p><p>In the distant past ages, there were several divine wars, and many gods fell, their divine kingdoms falling to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the probability of this possibility was pitifully low, and it was only a theoretical possibility that had not actually happened.</p><p></p><p>But the Longshan Patriarch was too powerful, so some true gods couldn't help but think in this direction.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he is a fallen god from the past or not, everything will be clear once we see the God of Divination." A true god replied.</p><p></p><p>They had absolute trust in the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged again.</p><p></p><p>"The taste of divine incarnations is a bit better than pure 'god crystals'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a sip...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pursed his lips and casually evaluated in his heart that even if placed in the main world and main universe, the pure energy contained in these divine power incarnations would far exceed the "Red Spirit Liquid".</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity they are only incarnations. If they were the true gods themselves, I could at least try the effect of a true god's power," Lin Yuan felt a little regretful in his heart. </p><p></p><p>With his current strength, there was actually not much difference between the divine power incarnations of the true gods and their original bodies. The absolute spatial control brought about by nearly 100 million layers of space allowed Lin Yuan to crush any true god or even chief god at the spatial level.</p><p></p><p>"But it will be soon."</p><p></p><p>"When I fully comprehend the last bit of spatial essence in the demigod power." Lin Yuan thought to himself. In his eyes, the spatial essence contained in the demigod power was a projection of the spatial essence of this world.</p><p></p><p>For example, a TV. The demigods only knew how to watch programs through this TV.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan deduced a complete modern factory industrial chain through the TV itself, and then realized the entire modern industry.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the spatial essence of a world was countless times more difficult than a mere industrial chain. This was just a metaphor.</p><p></p><p>The spatial essence corresponding to the demigod power belonged to the basic part. Lin Yuan needed to fully comprehend it in order to perceive the spatial essence corresponding to the true god power with higher efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Space..."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Lin Yuan's eyes, layers upon layers of space seemed to be opened up.</p><p></p><p>The layers of space in his inner world were also rapidly deriving, with new spatial layers being born almost every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen enough?" Lin Yuan said to himself.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Intangible power gathered.</p><p></p><p>An extremely beautiful woman with a tall figure and indifferent eyes appeared.</p><p></p><p>The moment this woman appeared, the laws of heaven and earth seemed to be retreating, and an aura that surpassed the true gods spread.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess of the Magic Net?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the beautiful woman not far away, without the slightest surprise.</p><p></p><p>Who was the first to know about Lin Yuan's actions against the many divine incarnations?</p><p></p><p>The original bodies of those divine incarnations in the Ocean of Light? Or the Pope of Order right beside Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Neither.</p><p></p><p>The first to notice the anomaly was this Goddess of the Magic Net, one of the twelve chief gods of the Ocean of Light, who covered the entire human world with her magic net.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the magic net covered was within the perception of the Goddess of the Magic Net.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan took action against the Church of Lust and personally descended his primordial spirit to the stronghold of the Church of Lust, it was out of wariness of this Goddess of the Magic Net, worried that the eruption of too strong a power would attract her attention.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan, what exactly is your origin..." The Goddess of the Magic Net's beautiful eyes flashed with a hint of unusual color as she looked at Lin Yuan and asked slowly.</p><p></p><p>As chief gods, lofty and looking down on all living beings and gods, there were not many things left in the world that could cause emotional fluctuations in them.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was definitely one of them right now.</p><p></p><p>"What my origin is, you will know in a while."</p><p></p><p>"I will personally enter the Ocean of Light. At that time, I hope you chief gods will not disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was too lazy to communicate with these chief gods. He raised his right hand, and the terrifying power of the world gathered the power of multiple layers of space, sweeping away everything.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Goddess of the Magic Net in front of him, condensed from the magic net covering the human world, naturally could not withstand Lin Yuan's casual strike.</p><p></p><p>"Magic net?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around and moved his mind slightly.</p><p></p><p>His own power spread in all directions, expelling the ubiquitous magic net. As for how the members of the Dragon Mountain Clan would communicate with each other after losing the magic net?</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, he was fully capable of reconstructing a new "communication network" to replace the original magic net.</p><p></p><p>Numerous true gods gathered in front of the majestic temple of the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>What they had experienced not long ago had already spread among the gods. The emergence of a powerful figure in the human world who was comparable to the chief gods was hard not to spread.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the true gods gathered in front of the temple at this moment were far more than hundreds. At least eighty percent of the true gods in the entire Ocean of Light were attracted.</p><p></p><p>There were even the wills of chief gods watching from a distance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the gate of the temple was pushed open.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination in white robes walked out.</p><p></p><p>"I already know your intentions." The God of Divination was an old man with white hair, a gentle tone, and a kind gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It is not difficult to find out the origin of that Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan." The God of Divination's tone was calm, but curiosity also arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he only divined the last whereabouts of those disappeared demigods to be in Dragon Mountain Ridge, and did not continue to divine and deduce.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this matter to cause such a big commotion.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, God of Divination."</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination is omniscient. The origin of that Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan will surely appear before us soon."</p><p></p><p>The true gods were in high spirits. The combat power displayed by the Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan was not inferior to the chief gods at all. Such a powerful figure, why would he be in the human world? It made the gods very curious.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will begin."</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination smiled slightly, while silently chanting the name of the Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan and the specific location of Dragon Mountain Ridge in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he activated the deduction power of the chief god power within his body, borrowing the laws and ways of this world to investigate the true origin of the Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Scenes appeared one after another in front of the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>They were all the events that had happened in Dragon Mountain Ridge in the past.</p><p></p><p>These events began to unfold in front of the God of Divination in a time-reversed manner.</p><p></p><p>One hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years. </p><p></p><p>Three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Four hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is his origin..." The God of Divination's expression was slightly expectant.</p><p></p><p>The so-called divination was essentially time. With the help of the Time Chief God Power within the God of Divination's body, he could trace back the past.</p><p></p><p>That was why the God of Divination had the title of being omniscient.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as time was traced back far enough, there were no secrets in the world for the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>Among the twenty-four chief gods of the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss, the God of Divination's combat power was not the strongest, but he was definitely the most difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Observing the past allowed the God of Divination to grasp countless life-saving methods.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Time continued to reverse.</p><p></p><p>Just as it reached a certain point.</p><p></p><p>The slowly reversing time fell into a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination's expression changed slightly. He had never encountered such a situation before.</p><p></p><p>It was actually able to resist his time reversal.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination hurriedly looked at the scene. The young Patriarch of the Dragon Mountain Clan was lying on the bed when he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The reversed time seemed to touch some incredible existence.</p><p></p><p>The entire river of time began to ripple. The God of Divination's face changed drastically. He clearly felt a backlash from the river of time that almost devoured him.</p><p></p><p>Puff.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination's face turned pale as paper, his breath plummeted continuously, and cracks appeared in the Time Chief God Power within his body.</p><p></p><p>In the sky.</p><p></p><p>The huge star symbolizing the God of Divination, which almost illuminated one-tenth of the sky, suddenly began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Tottering.</p><p></p><p>Two more chapters are finished.</p><p></p><p>Please give me some monthly tickets~~~</p>

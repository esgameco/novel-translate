        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The voices were deafening, lively and boisterous. </p><p></p><p>Compared to over a hundred years ago, the gathering place in Luochuan was now prosperous many times over.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in front of a tavern, wolfing down the ferocious beast leg meat in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, there was no celestial force or celestial energy.</p><p></p><p>The only way to replenish and recover was to eat.</p><p></p><p>"The changes over these hundred years are really huge," Lin Yuan felt pensive after eating for a while and swallowing all the meat.</p><p></p><p>A hundred or two hundred years ago, the Twelve Ancient Nations ruled over vast territories as the absolute sovereigns. </p><p></p><p>But ever since the descent of the Myriad Tribes experts, the ruling positions of the Twelve Ancient Nations were constantly shaken, until ninety-four years ago, when an expert from the main universe killed his way into the capital of one of the Ancient Nations, going in and out seven times, with the many experts of that nation powerless to stop him.</p><p></p><p>After that, the remaining Ancient Nations kept a much lower profile.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Tribes experts did not go too far either, only taking away the nation-protecting divine artifacts from the major Ancient Nations, like the Bronze Compass or the Blood-colored Long Knife.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Tribes experts had no interest in ruling over or dominating this two-dimensional world. Their goal was very clear - to increase their strength, through various means, so that when the Heavenly Gate opened, they could walk through to the end and return to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred and twenty-three years ago, over one billion Myriad Tribes experts descended into this world."</p><p></p><p>"But now...although there are no clear statistics, the number of surviving Myriad Tribes experts should not exceed one hundred million."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The first wave of descending Myriad Tribes experts suffered huge casualties right at the start. Facing such circumstances, coupled with the infighting among the Myriad Tribes experts a few decades ago, their numbers plummeted drastically.</p><p></p><p>"After a hundred years of cultivation, without minding external matters, my strength has long crossed into the Shaman Ancestor realm."</p><p></p><p>As early as eighty-seven years ago, Lin Yuan had already broken through to the Shaman Ancestor realm. As for his current realm, according to the exploration of the Myriad Tribes experts in the main universe beyond the Shaman Ancestor realm, the Shaman Ancestor level was divided into the First Boundary, Second Boundary, and Third Boundary, corresponding to the Early, Middle, and Peak stages of the Shaman Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>By that standard, Lin Yuan's true realm should be the Eighteenth Boundary of the Shaman Ancestor realm - five great realms beyond the Shaman Ancestor realm itself.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even if I'm not quite at the level of the 'Four Divine Kings', I'm not far off. Give me another hundred years and I should be able to catch up. And there are nearly two hundred years left until the Heavenly Gate opens."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that theoretically, two hundred years later, his strength should surpass the Four Divine Kings by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not entirely let his guard down either. Up until now, there were still nearly one hundred million surviving Myriad Tribes experts. Who knew if there were experts stronger than the Four Divine Kings?</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings were only the strongest among the publicly known Myriad Tribes experts. But what if there were others like Lin Yuan, secretly improving their strength, solely waiting for the final battle when the Heavenly Gate opened?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the influence of divine artifacts also had to be considered. An offensive divine artifact could boost a Myriad Tribes expert's strength by several realms. For example, the 'Latter Zhu' of the Demonic Tribe was not outstanding among the Eleventh-Stage Lifeforms, but by relying on the Blood-colored Long Knife, he became a super expert second only to the Four Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly but surely. Even if I can't make it through this time, there will be another opportunity. I absolutely won't take any risks." Lin Yuan was in no hurry at all. His comprehension of the Long Youth Cultivation Method had extended his longevity to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>If not this time, then the next time.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that in the past few decades, groups of Myriad Tribes experts have often banded together to search all corners for the 'divine artifacts' scattered around."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. "If they discover other Myriad Tribes experts along the way, they will eliminate them as well."</p><p></p><p>This was normal, a form of clearing the field. After all, fundamentally all Myriad Tribes experts were competitors vying for the chance to enter the Heavenly Gate two hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating other irrelevant competitors in advance was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, there would be a second Heavenly Gate opening in ten thousand two hundred years, but most Myriad Tribes experts probably couldn't endure for that long.</p><p></p><p>Not every Myriad Tribes expert could easily comprehend longevity methods like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And even if they could last until the second Heavenly Gate opening, did that mean there would be no competition then?</p><p></p><p>Of course, clearing the field was only a side benefit. The true goal of these Myriad Tribes experts was still the 'divine artifacts'.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, these 'divine artifacts' could only reveal a tiny fraction of their power. But in the main universe, they were priceless treasures and supreme weapons on par with the Twelve Celestial Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even perfected Eleventh-Stage Lifeforms like the Four Divine Kings could hardly come into contact with treasures of that level.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, even Eighth or Ninth-Stage experts had a chance to obtain them. How could the Myriad Tribes experts not go crazy over this?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the 'divine artifacts' obtained were not only immensely useful when brought back to the main universe, but also had a huge boosting effect in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, it was common for a Myriad Tribes expert to obtain an offensive 'divine artifact' and then slaughter dozens of peers at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't get out in the end, as long as experts from my tribe make it out, I can just hand over all the divine artifacts for them to take out."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan secretly thought to himself. </p><p></p><p>This way, even if his avatar fell here, causing his true self to suffer fundamental losses, it would not be too much of a loss after all, as he had brought out a twelfth-rank marvelous treasure weapon.</p><p></p><p>The strongest experts within the clan would not shortchange them.</p><p></p><p>"Marvelous object?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. For over a hundred years, he had been wholeheartedly cultivating, with the farthest place he had been being Dongyuan City. He had not made much progress in collecting marvelous objects. </p><p></p><p>So far, the only marvelous object he had was that bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"I can try to obtain a marvelous object for myself when I have time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Even if he possessed a marvelous object, the boost to his strength would be limited.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, even if those patriarchs at the thirteenth or fifteenth ranks of sorcery wielded marvelous objects, they would still be no match for him.</p><p></p><p>Xia You's Evolutionary Tall Tower.</p><p></p><p>A strand of Lin Yuan's avatar sat here, perceiving the extracosmic aurora in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Over a year ago, Lin Yuan's primordial yuan spirit had rushed over, and soon after, he left behind an avatar.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the extracosmic aurora only required an avatar, as there was no real danger.</p><p></p><p>As for the primordial yuan spirit, Lin Yuan immediately sent it to other major battlefields of foreign races to maintain the speed of absorbing and accumulating rift origin force.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the unknown aurora deepens your understanding of the rules of light.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the unknown aurora deepens your understanding of the rules of causality.]  </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the unknown aurora, you integrate and comprehend, perceiving the rules of causal undulation.]</p><p></p><p>"The rules of causal undulation?" A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>This integrated set of rules encompassed the rules of space, light, causality, and three other types of rules. Although not powerful for direct killing, it had inconceivable auxiliary effects.</p><p></p><p>"Causal undulation? Causal threads? If I'm willing to pay the price, I can erase the 'cause' of a certain existence, and then the subsequent 'effect' will also disappear?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was one of amazement. "This kind of disappearance is a thorough disappearance, the kind that even supreme experts cannot revive?"</p><p></p><p>"However, the price is quite steep, and a sufficient 'medium' is also needed." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Anything involving the rules of causality required paying a fundamental price. Causal killing curses required paying a price, and now this causal undulation thread also required paying a price.</p><p></p><p>"At my current level of life, I can erase the causes of sixth-rank life and below?" Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue comprehending."</p><p></p><p>After reflecting for a moment, Lin Yuan continued observing the extracosmic aurora in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cha Ran Gu hurriedly rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we've received news from the Bloody Rain Tavern that horrific signs of slaughter have frequently appeared within the Bloody Rain Ancient Nation recently," Cha Ran Gu said quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Signs of horrific slaughter?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>To alarm the Bloody Rain Tavern enough for them to directly pass the message through Cha Ran Gu to him, this horrific slaughter was absolutely no ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>"Is it those powerful experts of the myriad races starting to search the Bloody Rain Ancient Nation, scouring everywhere for marvelous objects, while taking the opportunity to kill the ordinary powerful experts of the myriad races hiding within, clearing the way for the opening of the Heavenly Gate two hundred years later?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed the general situation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the true self of the main universe's Lin Yuan quickly connected to the virtual world, entering the shared information network world specially established for the human civilizations that had evolved into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>He began searching for information.</p><p></p><p>This shared information network world promptly shares all kinds of intelligence from the two-dimensional world, serving as the main source for human civilizations that have evolved to obtain information.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Lin Yuan found some relevant information.</p><p></p><p>Six months ago in the two-dimensional world, a group of special lifeforms led by the ancient god Tuo Ba began joining forces to enter the territory of the Bloody Rain Ancient Nation, searching everywhere for "marvelous objects."</p><p></p><p>The human civilization that evolved and released this information specifically warned that the ancient god Tuo Ba was extremely powerful, and those special lifeforms allied with him were at least at the tenth patriarch rank of sorcery.</p><p></p><p>Any human civilizations hiding within the Bloody Rain Ancient Nation should escape in advance. Otherwise, if discovered by Tuo Ba and those special lifeforms, it would be too late to flee.</p><p></p><p>For now, Tuo Ba and those special lifeforms had thrown in their lot with the Stellar Grand Alliance and would not stop due to threats from human civilizations.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba, the ancient god?" Lin Yuan continued viewing the latest information about this ancient god.</p><p></p><p>As a super expert ranked twelfth among the powerful experts of the myriad races a hundred years ago, even if Tuo Ba's ranking had dropped slightly over the past century, he still maintained a spot within the top twenty.</p><p></p><p>His true realm was likely around the twelfth patriarch rank of sorcery.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that Tuo Ba possessed a defensive-type "marvelous object," which was his greatest source of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"A defensive 'marvelous object'?" Lin Yuan felt a tinge of desire.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that this defensive marvelous object would be a twelfth-rank defensive treasure weapon in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Just in this two-dimensional world alone, a defensive marvelous object could greatly enhance Lin Yuan's ability to survive and give him significantly more leeway.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba, the ancient god, it's fitting to settle old and new grudges together." Lin Yuan stood up and vanished from his spot.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

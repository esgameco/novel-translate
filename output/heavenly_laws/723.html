        <h1>Chapter 723</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dark dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>'Thousand Faces River' and 'Ling Hangui', two time beings, gazed at the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Faces River, is this the ally you invited? Impressive." Ling Hangui glanced at another huge face.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Faces River shook his head: "I don't know Him."</p><p></p><p>In fact, He suspected whether it was Ling Hangui who had invited help.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of Ling Hangui's reaction just now, it seemed there was no preparation at all.</p><p></p><p>He even took the initiative to attack Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't ask out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know?" Ling Hangui didn't doubt it.</p><p></p><p>At the level of the thirteenth order, it's rare to be deceived or concealed from.</p><p></p><p>The reason Ling Hangui asked this question was just casual, not expecting to hear a positive answer.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Thousand Faces River could really invite an ally of this level, he would just show it directly.</p><p></p><p>He, Ling Hangui, would definitely withdraw voluntarily, saving the two time beings from having to make a big move.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that neither of us would get the special nightmare fruit that we had planned for long ages."</p><p></p><p>Thousand Faces River's tone was slightly emotional.</p><p></p><p>For this day, He had observed billions of future timelines.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he concluded that his probability of obtaining this special nightmare fruit could reach 60%.</p><p></p><p>Competing with another time being, having a 60% chance of winning was already extremely high.</p><p></p><p>"Future timelines that even I can't see, very impressive."</p><p></p><p>Ling Hangui's tone was slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although there are great obstacles when time beings observe each other's timelines, it shouldn't be this vague.</p><p></p><p>"Either their own strength is close to the peak of the thirteenth order, or they have deep karmic ties with some Lord, and the Lord is willing to spend the price to help seal the timeline."</p><p></p><p>Thousand Faces River nodded: "Whichever of these two aspects, we'd better not get involved."</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious dimensional gap, if time beings are giants and behemoths, then time Lords are the absolute rulers.</p><p></p><p>Each time Lord rules over a vast area of the gap, and many time beings are willing to follow time Lords.</p><p></p><p>After all, time Lords can see more and deeper timelines, and can guide time beings in this aspect.</p><p></p><p>"But why would such a being be interested in the nightmare fruit? Even willing to take action personally?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Hangui was a bit puzzled, unable to see the relevant timelines, naturally unable to analyze Lin Yuan's true purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Who cares."</p><p></p><p>Thousand Faces River shook his head, and the huge face quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ling Hangui pondered for a while, and did the same, his aura quickly retreating.</p><p></p><p>For the high and mighty time beings, even something as precious as this special nightmare fruit,</p><p></p><p>It's just one of many schemes and plans. It's good if they succeed in obtaining it, but it doesn't matter if they fail.</p><p></p><p>Not far away.</p><p></p><p>On the towering nightmare tree, countless prostrate nightmare race members finally dared to raise their heads, looking at the empty dimensional gap, finally feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>"The great time beings have left."</p><p></p><p>The many nightmare race members gradually began to talk.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of time beings, insects like them could be erased at any time.</p><p></p><p>"That ten-thousand-meter nightmare fruit was taken away by the great time being."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the last time being took it away."</p><p></p><p>"The first two time beings didn't give chase."</p><p></p><p>The nightmare race members discussed cautiously, even the slightest mention of the great time beings was done carefully, not daring to be too arbitrary, let alone mentioning the name of any time being.</p><p></p><p>At an extremely distant place.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure stopped.</p><p></p><p>"They didn't chase?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced behind him.</p><p></p><p>In the many future timelines he had observed,</p><p></p><p>Under the enhancement of the Lord's status, after he snatched that nightmare fruit, those two time beings certainly wouldn't dare to chase after him.</p><p></p><p>Although the nightmare fruit is precious, who would want to chase a thirteenth order being whose future timeline they can't see clearly? No time being would be willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>Time beings are best at weighing pros and cons, they won't act impulsively, any action is taken after repeated consideration.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was almost certain they wouldn't chase after him,</p><p></p><p>He also prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>If those two time beings really chased after him regardless of everything,</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just return this nightmare fruit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Time beings won't do meaningless things.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he would hand over the nightmare fruit, letting those two time beings continue to fight over it.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be any loss for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His move to take the nightmare fruit was just an attempt.</p><p></p><p>Even if he failed to obtain it in the end, it was within expectations.</p><p></p><p>If he could succeed, it would be a great gain and benefit.</p><p></p><p>"Returned."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self soon returned to the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>By the way, he brought back the hundreds of years of gains from Taiji Yuanshen's journey.</p><p></p><p>"Too much loot."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Besides the most precious nightmare fruit,</p><p></p><p>There were also a large number of dimensional treasures collected by Taiji Yuanshen.</p><p></p><p>These dimensional treasures, for true thirteenth order time beings,</p><p></p><p>Are not considered very precious.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is not yet thirteenth order.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly having dozens of times his previous wealth naturally put him in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"When Taiji Yuanshen returns, we can open up the infinite sand particle worlds of the Yuanshen." Lin Yuan now had deep pockets, no longer satisfied with just opening infinite particle worlds for his true self.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Yuanshen is also part of himself, the stronger the Yuanshen, the stronger he naturally becomes.</p><p></p><p>"Some of the odds and ends can be thrown into the human civilization group's treasure vault, for human evolvers to exchange." Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>These odds and ends are not of much use to Lin Yuan, not even enough to open a single particle world.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of countless evolvers in human civilization, they are absolutely unprecedented precious resources, legendary rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even for twelfth order evolvers, they are treasures never seen before. Even for supreme saints at the pinnacle of the chaos realm, they can at most explore the dimensional gaps around the chaotic void, and can't go further.</p><p></p><p>And the spoils Lin Yuan brought back this time were all obtained from areas that those supreme saints could never explore in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Nightmare fruit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the biggest gain from this trip.</p><p></p><p>Other spoils are not considered precious for thirteenth order time beings.</p><p></p><p>But this nightmare fruit, even time beings as powerful as they are, crave it exceptionally.</p><p></p><p>This can be seen from how the two time beings 'Thousand Faces River' and 'Ling Hangui' schemed and planned.</p><p></p><p>Time beings have very high standards, without enough value, it wouldn't attract time beings to take action like this.</p><p></p><p>Observing future timelines also requires effort, observing a large number of future timelines for the nightmare fruit, excluding many other factors, is also a considerable investment.</p><p></p><p>"Refine it." Lin Yuan didn't hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Such a precious treasure as the nightmare fruit is naturally best used on himself.</p><p></p><p>As for trading it away? That would only be considered if it was of no use to Lin Yuan, even if</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thus, it was also to trade as much as possible to one's own people.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz~ As Lin Yuan continuously refined, a thread of consciousness began to sink into layer upon layer of nightmares.</p><p></p><p>The layers of nightmares constantly honed Lin Yuan's mental will, causing his long-stagnant mental will to rapidly improve once again.</p><p></p><p>While refining the nightmare fruit,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also comprehending the other six thirteenth-level inheritances created by 'Mo Xu Jun'.</p><p></p><p>These six thirteenth-level inheritances, standing alongside "Infinite Void", were what 'Mo Xu Jun' himself considered to be the path of a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>"'Soul Illusion Realm'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spent several days to fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level, these six inheritances representing the pinnacle of six major aspects were not very useful anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because what could be improved had mostly been improved. With Lin Yuan's infinite sand particle worlds nurturing his soul and mind, the latter had long reached its peak, with limited room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>However, even if not very useful, they still had basic reference value.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Xu Jun's path has great potential. Once one becomes a Time Lord, they would probably be considered powerful among lords," Lin Yuan evaluated.</p><p></p><p>However, to advance in all seven aspects simultaneously and cross into the lord level was also very difficult.</p><p></p><p>The seven major inheritances like "Infinite Void" and "Soul Illusion Realm" all required creating a theoretical seventh level.</p><p></p><p>But currently 'Mo Xu Jun' hadn't created even one, still incredibly far from becoming a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Mental will? Soul? Physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully comprehended, integrating the core essences from the six inheritances into his own path.</p><p></p><p>In the second source world,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as he looked at the entire source world.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, in the deal Lin Yuan reached with the Eternal Sect, one condition was the spread of a branch of his martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Although the second source world had experienced a demonic disaster, greatly reducing the number of cultivators,</p><p></p><p>It couldn't compare to the first source world and the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>But a lean camel is still bigger than a horse.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was still an entire source world.</p><p></p><p>Now after over ten thousand years of development,</p><p></p><p>Martial arts had flourished among the various holy sects.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators embarked on the path of martial arts, constantly reinforcing the 'anchor'.</p><p></p><p>"The infinite sand particle worlds of the other two true body avatars have basically all been opened up, the sixth level of 'Infinite Void' has also been fully mastered. Only the third level of the Chaos Taiji Way is left before I can attempt to break through to the thirteenth level," Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Regarding breaking through to the thirteenth level, Lin Yuan was also unable to observe the specific trials of falling into the time loop through future timelines.</p><p></p><p>The so-called time loop involved the operation of supreme rules across infinite dimensions, at least equivalent to fourteenth-level methods.</p><p></p><p>It would be obscured by the invisible operation of supreme rules.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth-level time beings could not break through this obscurement.</p><p></p><p>If thirteenth-level beings could break through this obscurement, then time beings would not be so rare and scarce.</p><p></p><p>"With my current preparations, it's stable," Lin Yuan was certain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The 'anchor' formed by countless martial arts cultivators encompassing the three top-level dimensional spaces of the chaos void, the first source world, and the second source world - Lin Yuan didn't know how 'solid' it was.</p><p></p><p>Besides the above, there were also many lower-level dimensional spaces, which were the dimensional spaces Lin Yuan first traversed and descended to at the very beginning, where martial arts had also been widely spread.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had comprehended myriad laws and ways. When one way is mastered, a hundred ways are mastered. Even if encountering trials never encountered before, he could quickly deduce ways to pass.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the application of the essence of runes, thoughts became runes. Even if trapped in a time loop, he could still use and operate them.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I'm almost certain to cross into the thirteenth level because I've made these ample preparations?" Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Outside the chaos void,</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious dimensional gap,</p><p></p><p>After hundreds of years of travel,</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Primordial Spirit finally arrived at the location of the Yin-Yang Twin Flower.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't seen timelines of time beings interfering, it's settled," Lin Yuan looked into the distance at the 'wonder'.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a majestic ice mountain standing there, with an extremely yin cold intent sweeping out, enough to completely freeze an unparalleled great saint at the peak of the chaos realm.</p><p></p><p>As for beside it, there was a crimson volcano, with vast extremely yang flame power surging, spreading and sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The extremely yin cold and extremely yang flame power constantly collided, contacted and melted, gradually forming a yin-yang coexisting area in the contact zone between the ice mountain and fire mountain.</p><p></p><p>Here, yin was yang,</p><p></p><p>And yang was yin.</p><p></p><p>"The dimensional gap is truly marvelous," Lin Yuan marveled in his heart that such a large-scale yin-yang coexisting wonder could be nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Although yin and yang both evolved from chaos, these two opposing energies were almost impossible to fuse without corresponding methods.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Taiji Way also only took initial shape after thoroughly comprehending the Supreme Solar Wuji and Supreme Lunar Wuji.</p><p></p><p>It finally transformed after traversing time and again.</p><p></p><p>And the current yin-yang coexisting wonder, although different from the Taiji Way, also had many similar parts with it.</p><p></p><p>There was great guidance.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang Twin Flower is born in the coexisting range of the ice mountain and fire mountain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the junction of the extremely yin and extremely yang forces. At this moment, a wondrous flower containing both yin and yang auras was blooming there.</p><p></p><p>And on both sides, the ice mountain and fire mountain had also nurtured many lives. These lives were innately powerful, able to be born in an environment that could freeze and kill ordinary unparalleled great saints. Slightly weaker ones simply couldn't survive.</p><p></p><p>"No problem taking action."</p><p></p><p>Before making a move, Lin Yuan cautiously watched many rounds of future timelines again to be safe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, these two ice and fire mountains had not reached the thirteenth level. Even if time beings encountered them, they wouldn't bother to take action.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the path Lin Yuan walked was quite similar to it. The ice and fire mountains were born under the dimensional gap environment, containing a trace of supreme rule operation, so they were useful to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached out a hand,</p><p></p><p>Stretching towards the distant ice and fire mountains.</p><p></p><p>Inside the ice and fire mountains,</p><p></p><p>Countless extremely yin and extremely yang beings gazed fanatically at the yin-yang junction.</p><p></p><p>"The sacred flower, the sacred flower has bloomed."</p><p></p><p>The many extremely yin and extremely yang beings couldn't help but shout loudly as they looked at the slowly blooming Yin-Yang Twin Flower.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Twin Flower also nurtured yin and yang forces. For the extremely yin and extremely yang beings, it was a sacred object that needed to be worshipped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment—</p><p></p><p>The countless extremely yin and extremely yang beings suddenly discovered that the sky of the outer dimensional gap suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>A heaven-covering giant hand slowly grasped towards the ice and fire mountains.</p><p></p><p>The ice and fire mountains constantly emitted cold and flame power, but had no resistance effect at all in front of that heaven-spanning giant hand.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his right hand, and the majestic ice and fire mountains obediently floated between his palms.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Twin Flower was obtained.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

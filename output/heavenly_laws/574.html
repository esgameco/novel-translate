            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>He and the Venerable Ancient Ming had made many conjectures about this 'Silver River', and they were basically certain that the other party was the reincarnation of a great saint.</p><p></p><p>However, even if it was the reincarnation of a great saint, whose cultivation had no bottlenecks or constraints, 'Silver River' was not even at the Chaos Realm level a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in just a thousand years, the other party had now recovered to the peak of the Chaos Realm?</p><p></p><p>"I once descended a trace of consciousness from afar, and vaguely sensed the existence that was swallowing the Chaos Qi, which felt somewhat familiar, allowing me to be familiar with it, and it happened in the nearby void domain."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming spoke.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Ones at the peak of the Chaos Realm are rare, with usually only one or two in a void domain, and the wondrous life forms of the Chaos Realm are even fewer.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming did not think it was so coincidental that there happened to be a Venerable One at the peak of the Chaos Realm nearby, swallowing Chaos Qi.</p><p></p><p>And this peak Chaos Realm Venerable One also gave him a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it carefully, it is quite likely."</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe pondered for a while and began to agree.</p><p></p><p>Although recovering to the peak of the Chaos Realm in just over a thousand years is somewhat incredible, for a powerful expert at the Great Saint level, it cannot be deduced by common logic.</p><p></p><p>The so-called common logic, the so-called logic, are all meant to be broken by the reincarnation of a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his eyes, 'Silver River' is absolutely not a simple Chaos Great Saint, but may be an extraordinary Great Saint that surpasses ordinary Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"They say the reincarnation of a Great Saint has an unbelievably fast cultivation speed, and now it seems, not just unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming sighed from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated to the Chaos Realm, not knowing how much effort and energy he had expended, and how many fortuitous encounters he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he is still some distance away from the peak of the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>To cross this distance, even if there are no significant bottlenecks in between, the time it would take would be measured in cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>"Now, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"If we didn't know, it wouldn't matter, but since we do know, we should still go pay a visit, right?" The Venerable Ancient Ming carefully considered and spoke.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void, no matter which void domain, when a Sovereign Realm expert crosses into the Chaos Realm, a grand celebration must be held.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Chaos Realm, one's status and strength will undergo a fundamental change, and it is also an opportunity to make connections with other Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has quietly recovered his Chaos Realm strength, and although outsiders don't know, the Venerable Ancient Ming feels he should make some gesture.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when it came to 'Silver River', the Great Saint reincarnation, the Venerable Ancient Ming did not dare to go pay a visit, mainly because he was worried about arousing the other party's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After all, with his own strength, he could potentially pose a threat to this Great Saint reincarnation, even if the Venerable Ancient Ming had no such intention, he still had to consider whether the other party might think so.</p><p></p><p>But now there is no such concern, as Lin Yuan has recovered to the peak of the Chaos Realm, and with the Great Saint's methods, the Venerable Ancient Ming cannot pose any threat at all.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go pay a visit now."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming had made up his mind, and he was even a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in the process of constructing his inner universe, which is also the process of cultivating the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' technique.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the 'Infinite Void' technique affects the inner universe in the infinite microscopic realm, by adjusting the basic structure of the inner universe, making it more stable and more perfect.</p><p></p><p>"It's amazing."</p><p></p><p>"So by changing this little bit of structure, the stability of the inner universe can actually increase by 60%?"</p><p></p><p>"And by replacing this part of the structure, the operation of the Dao rules within the inner universe can become much smoother."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in the cultivation of the 'Infinite Void', and with the foundation of the first layer, his cultivation of the second layer was very efficient.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of this inheritance, no wonder he was a Thirteenth Tier Time Life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly, and as his realm increased, his understanding of this inheritance became deeper, allowing him to better feel the greatness of its creator.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, Lin Yuan occasionally caught glimpses of the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, that Thirteenth Tier expert.</p><p></p><p>But he only watched from afar, never delving deeper into the Dao and Techniques of that individual.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Source World are more inclined towards bloodlines, and the 'Blazing Sun Nurturing Spirit Art' passed down by the Progenitor is essentially about condensing the Blazing Sun Seed and then using it to inherit the Progenitor's innate abilities.</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', I can suppress Venerable Ones at the peak of the Chaos Realm with just my inner universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was deeply immersed in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Ming Venerable wants to come see me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his brow, the Mighty Xuanhuang had just transmitted a message to him, saying that the Venerable Ancient Ming was coming to pay a visit.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has sensed something."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought casually, during his breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm, Lin Yuan had swallowed endless Chaos Qi, attracting the attention of many Venerables.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Lin Yuan had roughly scanned them, and found that the Venerable Ancient Ming was among those Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The other Venerables had never interacted with Lin Yuan, so they didn't know who was swallowing the Chaos Qi, only that it was not something to be provoked.</p><p></p><p>But Ancient Ming Venerable? He had interacted with Lin Yuan before, and the two had formed a karmic connection, plus Lin Yuan was now only at the Sovereign Realm, unable to completely conceal all his aura, so it was possible that the other party might have sensed something.</p><p></p><p>"Let him come in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has entered the Sovereign Realm, his combat power is on par with the peak of the Chaos Realm, as long as he does not provoke the Great Saints, he basically has nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he is not afraid to even see the Venerable Ancient Ming.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan is quite curious as to why the Venerable Ancient Ming has been so friendly towards him.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was obtaining this Star Tear 'Fragment World' or the many transactions with the Sovereign Mighty Wanqu, Lin Yuan had gained a lot of benefits, and the Venerable Ancient Ming must have secretly nodded his approval.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>Mighty Xuanhuang and a few other Mighty Ones were somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the ruler of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, the Venerable of the Chaos Realm, the Ancient Ming Venerable, actually came in person to pay a visit to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Pay a visit?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The term 'pay a visit' is usually used by a lower-ranking person to seek an audience with a higher-ranking one, or at least someone of equal status.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancient Ming Venerable? Even though Mighty Xuanhuang and the other Mighty Ones had learned of Lin Yuan's strength, which was equivalent to the Chaos Realm, they only thought of him as a newly ascended Chaos Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>And the Ancient Ming Venerable, a veteran of the Chaos Realm, if he wanted to see Lin Yuan, he would not have used the term 'pay a visit', right?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mighty Xuanhuang, Mighty Xia Qin, and the other Mighty Ones were all somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Star Tear 'Fragment World' where the human civilization is located is a part of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, and the entire human civilization, including their nine Mighty Ones, are all under the breath of the Ancient Ming Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Mighty Xuanhuang received Lin Yuan's reply.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River allows you to come in."</p><p></p><p>Mighty Xuanhuang suppressed the shock in his heart and tentatively said to the Ancient Ming Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable nodded without the slightest discomfort.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Star Tear 'Fragment World', the Ancient Ming Venerable came to the grand hall specially set up to receive guests.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A figure coalesced, which was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, only Lin Yuan and the Ancient Ming Venerable remained in the hall, as for Mighty Xuanhuang? He had already withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>Although Mighty Xuanhuang could not understand why the Ancient Ming Venerable was behaving this way, he was also clear that a Venerable of such stature coming in person must have important matters to discuss with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable immediately bowed slightly towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult for a Chaos Great Saint to completely kill a Chaos Venerable, but there is also no Chaos Venerable who would be presumptuous in front of a Great Saint, relying on this fact.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when a Venerable faces a Great Saint, they must still show enough reverence.</p><p></p><p>Unless the two are sworn enemies with irreconcilable hatred, a Chaos Venerable would not 'give up'.</p><p></p><p>But such cases are rare.</p><p></p><p>And now, in the eyes of the Ancient Ming Venerable, Lin Yuan is a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>There is no enmity between the two, and the Ancient Ming Venerable wants to befriend Lin Yuan, so he dares not be the slightest bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>"Senior?" Lin Yuan's expression did not change, and he immediately realized that the Ancient Ming Venerable might have misunderstood something.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because you think I'm the reincarnation of a Great Saint?" Lin Yuan's thought process was lightning-fast, and he immediately knew what the Ancient Ming Venerable was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the reincarnation of a Great Saint, both the Xuanhuang lineage and the Demon Jade Pavilion had mentioned it.</p><p></p><p>Even before the great destruction of his home universe, Lin Yuan had also learned from the two ultimate experts of the Calamity Clan that they believed he was the reincarnation of a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that the Calamity Clan thought he was the reincarnation of a Great Saint because his growth trajectory in the universe was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just a few thousand years, he had become an Evolver and exerted his dominance over the universe.</p><p></p><p>But why did the Venerable Ancient Ming also think he was the reincarnation of a great saint? "How did you recognize me?" Lin Yuan asked casually. As soon as he said this,</p><p></p><p>the Venerable Ancient Ming immediately replied, "Senior, I have a companion who is a marvel of life, with time bloodline flowing within."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming then explained in detail the matter of the "Precognition" of the Chaotic Dragon Beast.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was suddenly enlightened, and he looked upon the marvels of life with the time bloodline even more highly.</p><p></p><p>This ability to predict the future was simply unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"The Master of the Magic Jade Tower had joined hands with several other supreme saints, paid a heavy price, and hunted down a saint-level marvel of life with a rich time bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan highly recognized the value of this hunt.</p><p></p><p>A marvel of life at the Chaotic Saint level, in terms of combat power, might be on par with the Supreme Saints, but to hunt it down? It would be countless times more difficult than killing a Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>The opponent could foresee, could know the future, how could they be killed?</p><p></p><p>"I have come to pay my respects to the senior, to congratulate the senior on his recovery to the Chaotic Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming immediately stated his purpose, and with a wave of his hand, he produced a jade bottle, "This is a gift."</p><p></p><p>Since it was a congratulatory visit, the Venerable Ancient Ming naturally would not come empty-handed, and he must bring some gifts to express his sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, apart from him, no other venerable ones knew Lin Yuan's true identity, and the Venerable Ancient Ming was even more aware that he needed to seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>When a great saint's reincarnation had not yet recovered to the peak of his strength, establishing a good relationship with him, even if he did not demand anything in return, would be beneficial.</p><p></p><p>As long as this matter was spread out, would any other Chaotic Venerable dare to provoke him?</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the jade bottle, not being humble at all.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had just stepped into the Dominator Realm, all the accumulated resources had been exhausted, so how could he not take the resources offered to him?</p><p></p><p>"After a while, when I reveal my Chaotic Realm combat power and announce myself as a Venerable, I can then hold a celebration and collect a wave of gifts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, this was also the fastest way to accumulate wealth, much faster than plundering.</p><p></p><p>When a newly promoted Venerable held a celebration, the forces in the surrounding void domains would probably all participate, and since they participated, there would certainly be no shortage of gifts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had done this many times in his home universe, and each time, he had reaped a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, since you have already recovered your Chaotic Realm strength, are you planning to develop a Chaotic Continent?" the Venerable Ancient Ming asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>The Stardust 'Fragment World' was home to human civilizations, and the Venerable Ancient Ming knew this, so the human civilization must want to develop and interact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Develop a Chaotic Continent?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment and shook his head, "Not yet."</p><p></p><p>Developing a Chaotic Continent could form a trade center in the surrounding area, and he could then sell shop positions and collect service fees, which would be a way to make money without doing anything.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of thing would not have a significant effect in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to develop a Chaotic Continent, there would be a huge upfront investment, and Lin Yuan currently wanted to focus all his efforts on improving his strength.</p><p></p><p>When his strength reached a bottleneck, he could consider developing a Chaotic Continent then.</p><p></p><p>For now, the Stardust 'Fragment World' was already sufficient for human civilization to live for a long time, and there was no need to specially develop a Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Lin Yuan for a while, with Lin Yuan asking the questions and the Venerable Ancient Ming answering, the Venerable Ancient Ming then stood up and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>After the Venerable Ancient Ming left,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the gift the Venerable Ancient Ming had given him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused a bit of his mind to examine it.</p><p></p><p>"He has considered it quite thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined it briefly and a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The jade bottle the Venerable Ancient Ming had given contained a large amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>In the Venerable Ancient Ming's eyes, Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a great saint, so the path he would mainly take in the future would be the accumulation of energy, so these resources were mainly focused on that aspect.</p><p></p><p>After all, the most precious resources in the Chaotic Void were often those that could help break through bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming had thought it through, believing that what Lin Yuan lacked was the accumulation of energy.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, the various obstacles during his cultivation would not hinder him for long.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was the energy accumulation that was far behind his rate of improvement.</p><p></p><p>"All the precious resources and treasures combined are probably worth between 90 to 100 million Chaotic Stones."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly estimated the value, feeling quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This amount of resources would be enough for him to cultivate for a long time, at least to complete the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' without any problems.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ancient Ming."</p><p></p><p>The various behaviors of the Venerable Ancient Ming flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Venerable Ancient Ming was indeed making an effort to get on good terms with him.</p><p></p><p>Although this behavior had a strong purposefulness, Lin Yuan did not mind, as the other party had genuinely provided him with a lot of help.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if there is an opportunity, Lin Yuan would not mind reciprocating.</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation of a great saint."</p><p></p><p>A trace of a strange expression appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Demon Tribe in his home universe or the Venerable Ancient Ming, the more they knew and saw, the more they were convinced that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a great saint.</p><p></p><p>After all, who else could advance from the first realm to the twelfth realm in just a few thousand years? Who else could break through the suppression of the Primordial Will in the universe and unleash combat power surpassing the peak of the Dao Realm? And who else could possess Chaotic Realm peak combat power in just over a thousand years after entering the Chaotic Void?</p><p></p><p>These behaviors could not be explained by normal reasons, even those extraordinary marvels of life could not achieve this, as they had the time bloodline flowing within them, but they also needed time to digest and would encounter bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only the marvels of life, even the ancient royal families of the ancestral worlds, in terms of cultivation speed alone, were far inferior to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But I am not the reincarnation of a great saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Everyone thought he was the reincarnation of a great saint, but only Lin Yuan himself knew that he was just an ordinary life born within the universe.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Stardust 'Fragment World',</p><p></p><p>The powerful human experts like Xuanyuan the Strongest watched as the Venerable Ancient Ming left.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Ancient Ming, a cultivator of such a high level, has come to visit the Silver Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Silver Galaxy just recently stepped into the Dominator Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even though he is equivalent to the Chaotic Realm, the Venerable Ancient Ming is an experienced Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The powerful human experts like Summer Qin discussed in low voices, all somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>When the Venerable Ancient Ming came to visit Lin Yuan just now, they were all shocked, as the vast majority of Dao Realm cultivators simply did not have the qualifications to interact with Chaotic Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>"Dominator Realm"</p><p></p><p>The Lin Yuan in the Source World had already stepped into the Dominator Realm earlier than the true body Lin Yuan in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The true body Lin Yuan in the Chaotic Void had relied on this body in the Source World to smoothly enter the Dominator Realm, confirming that there were no accidents, before assaulting the Dominator Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This body does not have the three Chaotic Void Primordial Infusions, nor the suppression of the Chaotic Tree, so the foundation of the universe within it is not as strong as my true body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>"But the actual combat power is not much different."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chaotic Void, the biggest advantage Lin Yuan had in this Source World was the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>This physique was simply terrifying in terms of combat power and various enhancements.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan continued to ponder the Blazing Sun Divine Body and tried to condense the 33,333rd Blazing Sun Seed,</p><p></p><p>his expression suddenly changed slightly, and a surge of trembling arose from the deepest part of his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to sense the profound and mysterious imprint that had been forged and intertwined through the path of martial dao cultivation for over a thousand years, and it finally fully formed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Flesh Cultivation Technique is about to awaken."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed with excitement. This Flesh Cultivation Technique was his seventh Flesh Cultivation Technique, and it was also the one that had taken the longest time to form, from the beginning to now, it had taken over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very looking forward to this Flesh Cultivation Technique.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Strands of the fundamental power from the depths of his bloodline continuously converged towards that profound and mysterious imprint, and at a certain moment, it was fully replenished and completed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>that profoundly mysterious Technique Imprint seemed to have truly "come alive".</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 673</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Just by observing the first timeline, he saw Lin Yuan crossing into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the scene of the opening of the Seventh Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to delve deeper into the timelines, the Patriarch of the Great Fu vaguely sensed his mind and spirit trembling, and immediately stopped observing.</p><p></p><p>As the first Patriarch, the Patriarch of the Great Fu's strength was slightly stronger than that of the Patriarch of the Radiant Sun, and he could observe more timelines and see further into the future. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, his perception of the timelines was more acute, vaguely aware that the future of the Milky Way Sovereign was extremely terrifying, beyond what he could observe and peek into.</p><p></p><p>"This timeline"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu gathered his thoughts, and a single timeline did not represent anything.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was just his bad luck that he happened to see the timeline with the highest potential of the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>A single timeline cannot replace true potential. Since the opening of the Six Ancient Nations, there have been so many Sovereigns who have broken through to the 13th Realm, and theoretically each Sovereign has the potential to become a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But after such a long period of time, were there only the six of them who became Patriarchs? The future is full of too many variables, becoming a Patriarch in just a single timeline? The probability is too low, too low.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu quickly went through hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of timelines.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu found it unbelievable that in hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of timelines, the Milky Way Sovereign had all successfully crossed into the 13th Realm, which was very unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>In the future, at any given moment, countless timelines will be born, and each timeline will branch out and continue to extend into countless more timelines. Even in the chess game between the lives of time, they cannot guarantee that a certain event will happen 100%.</p><p></p><p>There will be various factors affecting the outcome, as well as the influence of other time lives.</p><p></p><p>But this Milky Way Sovereign? At least in the many timelines the Patriarch of the Great Fu saw, the other party smoothly crossed into the 13th Realm, it was just a matter of time, in simple terms, the Milky Way Sovereign crossing into the 13th Realm was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>At least in the timelines the Patriarch of the Great Fu saw, it could not be prevented.</p><p></p><p>"Is it his innate talent? Or external forces?" The Patriarch of the Great Fu's thoughts expanded, leaning more towards external forces.</p><p></p><p>How could one rely solely on innate talent to achieve the certainty of crossing into the 13th Realm? The most powerful talent the Patriarch of the Great Fu had seen was that of the 'Abyss Dragon' born at the beginning of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>This 'Abyss Dragon' indeed had the possibility of crossing into the 13th Realm, but after the Patriarch of the Great Fu crossed into the 13th Realm, the timelines of the 'Abyss Dragon' crossing into the 13th Realm were basically cut off.</p><p></p><p>Because the Patriarch of the Great Fu would definitely act against the 'Abyss Dragon', the enmity between them could not be reconciled, it was determined since the birth of heaven and earth. If the 'Abyss Dragon' crossed into the 13th Realm earlier, the Patriarch of the Great Fu would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that even with the strongest talent, it cannot be guaranteed to cross into the 13th Realm, because it will be interfered and affected by external forces, especially the suppression of a time life, which is a disaster for beings below the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>A time life that sees through countless timelines can block all your paths, and your every choice is basically seen through by the time life.</p><p></p><p>It's just that when facing Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu felt powerless.</p><p></p><p>Because he could not stop him.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly obstructing would only delay the other party's crossing into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the price of doing so would be that after the Milky Way Sovereign crossed into the 13th Realm, he would retaliate against him. At that time, the Patriarch of the Great Fu would suffer greatly, even if he escaped this dimension, he could not avoid the other party's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because my strength is not strong enough, I haven't seen enough timelines, and I can't observe the timelines that can deal with this Milky Way. But it doesn't matter anymore, this Milky Way must not be provoked."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu thought to himself, with the many timelines of the Milky Way Sovereign's development, he absolutely cannot be an enemy.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Patriarch of the Great Fu was pondering,</p><p></p><p>The top peak Sovereigns and the strongest Sovereigns of the Great Fu Ancient Nation below were extremely uncomfortable, the Patriarch's silent and unspoken manner clearly showed that he was extremely disappointed with them, his descendants, and did not even want to say more.</p><p></p><p>Well, the Patriarch had painstakingly cultivated them, but in the end they were still swept away and crushed by the Milky Way Sovereign of the Radiant Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Patriarch of the Radiant Sun basically let his descendants develop on their own without much interference, yet they were still like this, they were ashamed in front of the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Great Void spoke with a firm gaze and a solemn tone: "I will cultivate the Forbidden Supreme Inheritance, that Milky Way Sovereign, I am not a match for him now, but after cultivating the Forbidden Supreme Inheritance, my strength will greatly increase, and I will go challenge the Milky Way Sovereign again, so that our Ancient Nation will not suffer humiliation again."</p><p></p><p>The so-called Forbidden Supreme Inheritance is similar to the "Heart of the Radiant Sun" inheritance of the Radiant Sun Ancient Nation, which allows a certain part of oneself to leap towards the 13th Realm, thereby achieving a rapid increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>But the reason why this kind of inheritance is called the "Forbidden Supreme Inheritance" is that the hidden dangers of cultivation are too great. The "Heart of the Radiant Sun" requires the sacrifice of a large part of one's own rationality, and the Forbidden Supreme Inheritances of other Ancient Nations are the same, or even the price is greater.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that almost no peak Sovereigns are willing to cultivate the Forbidden Inheritances, even though the enhancement of strength by the Forbidden Supreme Inheritance far exceeds the Supreme Inheritance, no peak Sovereign is willing to pay such a huge price to enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>By the time they reach the peak Sovereign realm, they have basically stood at the top of their respective Ancient Nations, with the hope of breaking through to the Patriarch realm, and they absolutely do not need to pay such a huge price to enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>Especially some Forbidden Supreme Inheritances, once they start cultivating, the hidden dangers cannot be removed, and it will affect the breakthrough to that next step.</p><p></p><p>But now, faced with the Patriarch's disappointment and the shame of the Ancient Nation, Sovereign of the Great Void felt that he should do something.</p><p></p><p>Although this time he was crushed by the Milky Way Sovereign in the treasure land, it was not his problem at all, and if the other strongest Sovereigns of the Ancient Nation were in this position, they would have the same fate and the same outcome.</p><p></p><p>But the Sovereign of the Great Void still felt uneasy, even if he had to pay a price, he wanted to make the Patriarch feel better.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, I will also cultivate the Forbidden Supreme Inheritance, I just don't believe that with the foundation of our Great Fu Ancient Nation, we still can't match a mere Milky Way Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The strongest Sovereigns all had doubts in their hearts about whether they could withstand the Milky Way Sovereign after cultivating the Forbidden Supreme Inheritance, but at least the strength gap would be narrowed, if one couldn't do it, then two, if two couldn't do it, then three.</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancient Nation had a solid foundation, even if they had to pile up, they would bury the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The heroic spirit of the other strongest Sovereigns was also ignited, the Great Fu Ancient Nation was the earliest Ancient Nation, and the Patriarch was the first time life, so the starting point and beginning were the highest, there was no reason they would lose to the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Fu looked down at the indignant Sovereigns who were eager to challenge Lin Yuan again, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's no need." The Patriarch of the Great Fu said: "That Milky Way Sovereign's strength is indeed far beyond you, it's better to just let him be, it's not a disgrace."</p><p></p><p>In the timelines the Patriarch of the Great Fu observed, even he himself found it difficult to resist the Milky Way Sovereign after crossing into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>The many powerful Supremes were somewhat dazed. The Ancestor actually spoke so easily, not only not holding a grudge against them for losing to the Galactic Supremes, but also not even planning to take revenge?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancestor of the Great Fu Ancient Nation had always been domineering and overbearing. When had he ever been so merciful before? Just accept the loss? Not even say a word, decisively admit inferiority to the other party?</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, we..."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Fu Xu and other powerful Supremes were somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"This matter ends here." The Great Fu Ancestor shook his head and swept his gaze over all the Supremes: "Regarding the Galactic Supreme, never go provoke him again, remember, never go provoke him, in any form of provocation is not allowed, and don't even think about retaliation, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor looked around, his tone icy: "I will personally step in to punish you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the many Supremes couldn't help but tremble inwardly, and hurriedly said, "Ancestor, we understand."</p><p></p><p>As the Ancestor of the Great Fu Ancient Nation, to protect an outsider, he was willing to personally step in to punish his own descendants and heirs. This left all the Supremes incredulous, but they would not and dared not disobey the Ancestor's orders.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all may leave."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor no longer had the mood to instruct the many Supremes. His focus was now on the future timeline of the Galactic Supreme, pondering how to face this future Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Yang."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor contacted the Liang Yang Ancestor. The Galactic Supreme was the descendant of the Liang Yang Ancestor, and although through observing the timeline, the Great Fu Ancestor was clear about the rise of the Galactic Supreme, it was basically unrelated to the Liang Yang Ancestor. Even without the Liang Yang Ancestor, the future of the Galactic Supreme would not change.</p><p></p><p>But among the six Ancestors, the Liang Yang Ancestor was definitely the one closest to the Galactic Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Great Fu." The Liang Yang Ancestor responded, smiling and saying, "What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Galactic Supreme in your Liang Yang Ancient Nation?" the Great Fu Ancestor asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know." The Liang Yang Ancestor nodded. He was able to observe Lin Yuan's future timeline, and the Great Fu Ancestor could naturally observe it as well, perhaps even more detailed and specific than him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've seen such a nearly certain future." The Great Fu Ancestor's tone was slightly wistful.</p><p></p><p>Only those of the same level of time life would know how incredible this kind of certain future is.</p><p></p><p>"From the point where the Galactic Supreme appears in this source world as a node, the timelines that spread and expand will basically all be affected by this future Ancestor," the Liang Yang Ancestor nodded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I'm planning to visit the Galactic Supreme. You won't mind, will you?" The Great Fu Ancestor looked at the Liang Yang Ancestor with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the many future timelines of Lin Yuan, the Great Fu Ancestor naturally could not choose to stand against the Galactic Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Where is the strength of the Thirteenth-Tier time lives? In power? In strength? No.</p><p></p><p>It's in the choice.</p><p></p><p>Time lives, through observing future timelines, will make the most beneficial choices for themselves, and this is the mightiest means of the Thirteenth-Tier experts.</p><p></p><p>And faced with an existence like Lin Yuan, they absolutely cannot be enemies head-on, otherwise there will be no good outcome.</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor naturally knew what to do.</p><p></p><p>"I certainly won't mind." The Liang Yang Ancestor shook his head. In fact, even if he minded, it would be useless, as with Lin Yuan's strength, he would eventually interact with the other Ancestors in the future, and it could not be prevented, nor should it be prevented.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor nodded.</p><p></p><p>If the Liang Yang Ancestor had objected to him visiting the Galactic Supreme, he would have visited secretly, as with his methods, seeing the Galactic Supreme would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several months had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Five silent figures descended outside the capital of the Liang Yang Nation.</p><p></p><p>These five figures were the Ancestors of the five ancient nations, the Liang Yang Ancestor and the Great Fu Ancestor having observed Lin Yuan's timeline, and the other four Ancestors also gradually reacting and making various observations.</p><p></p><p>This was why the five Ancestors had gathered to visit the Galactic Supreme today.</p><p></p><p>As for why the five Ancestors chose today to visit, it was because in the many future timelines, this day was the most suitable for visiting the Galactic Supreme, when Lin Yuan's mood would be good, and most beneficial for them to build a closer relationship with the Galactic Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Great Fu, you're here too." The Xuan Yin Ancestor, a tall woman with flowing white hair, looked at the Great Fu Ancestor and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Yin, not just Great Fu, we've all come." The Man Huang Ancestor, a towering man, grinned and said, "I've observed the Galactic Supreme's timeline and found that he will cross into the Thirteenth-Tier at the latest within a million to ten million years."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't come visit now, by the time the Galactic Supreme crosses into the Thirteenth-Tier, the meaning will be different."</p><p></p><p>The Da Ling Ancestor nodded and said, "It's a good thing that a new Ancestor can be born in our realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple." The Lei Tong Ancestor shook his head. "I see that the Galactic Supreme, in the future, will go to the deepest depths of the Thirteenth-Tier, and he may even cross into the Time Lord realm."</p><p></p><p>The Time Lord realm was the peak of the Thirteenth-Tier, and such a life had already begun to converge its own timelines, striving towards the Fourteenth-Tier, the perfect time life.</p><p></p><p>"That's why the Galactic Supreme is still at the Supreme level now, allowing us to glimpse into the future. Once he crosses into the Thirteenth-Tier, wanting to peek will be as difficult as ascending to the heavens."</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Yin Ancestor said.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestors nodded.</p><p></p><p>Directly glimpsing the future of a time life was a very difficult thing to do, and they could only infer and guess through observing a large number of timelines.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Supreme crossed into the Thirteenth-Tier, based on the potential he had shown in the future timelines, they would basically not be able to peek at him again.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time, let's go in."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fu Ancestor looked at the distant capital of the Liang Yang Nation and said softly.</p><p></p><p>In the Galactic King's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finished his closed-door cultivation, and his understanding of the space-time fusion rules had gained new insights, putting him in a relatively good mood.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the voice of the Liang Yang Ancestor came: "Galactic, the five of them, Great Fu and the others, want to visit you. Will you see them?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Fu and the others..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled in his heart. Only the other five Ancestors could be addressed as such by the Liang Yang Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Should I see them?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"See them, it's a good thing," the Liang Yang Ancestor said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, in the imperial palace of the nation, Lin Yuan met the five Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly reserved. These were five time lives, especially the Great Fu Ancestor, who was considered a powerful figure among time lives.</p><p></p><p>"This realm has produced such a character, I've long wanted to come take a look, I just worried about disturbing you, Brother Galactic." The Man Huang Ancestor looked at Lin Yuan and grinned. "Brother Galactic, you don't need to be so polite with us, let's just talk as peers, don't be so distant."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

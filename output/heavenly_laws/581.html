        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>King Chisonge finally agreed, which surprised Lin Yuan a bit. That previous sentence "You're quite good at asking" implied that this request was indeed a bit difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already prepared to be rejected and then come up with another request.</p><p></p><p>Aside from comprehending the Grade-A war machines, Lin Yuan wanted too many precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Highness," Lin Yuan said immediately, without any modesty.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to comprehend a Grade-A war machine was rare and hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't a time of war, Lin Yuan wouldn't even have the chance to see a war machine, let alone comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you trying to comprehend the chaotic secret patterns embedded in the war machine?" King Chisonge asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this.</p><p></p><p>The most precious aspect of war machines lies in the chaotic secret patterns engraved on them. It is relying on these chaotic secret patterns that the boundless power rules of the Sovereign Realm can be perfectly integrated and then greatly amplified. Without the chaotic secret patterns, the value of war machines would be no more than some precious materials.</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic secret patterns were bestowed by the Ancestors, and then replicated onto the war machines by the few strongest Celestial Venerables of our ancient nation," King Chisonge said with some emotion. "It's a good thing that you can comprehend the chaotic secret patterns."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just taking a look," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He also learned the true origin of the chaotic secret patterns - the Ancestors of the Brilliant Yang Ancient Nation. To be able to easily condense the essence of the chaotic rules into secret patterns, their attainment in the Chaotic Dao must have surpassed the three-layer limit.</p><p></p><p>Only the lofty Ancestors who overlook the ancient nation and even the source world can easily condense such secret patterns.</p><p></p><p>"But you can only comprehend the war machine during this war period. If the war ends, whether in victory or defeat, all the war machines will be returned to the capital," King Chisonge reminded.</p><p></p><p>Allowing Lin Yuan to comprehend the war machine was somewhat irregular, but King Chisonge turned a blind eye to it.</p><p></p><p>However, when the war ends, the war machines would have to be recalled, and King Chisonge definitely wouldn't dare to forcibly keep them for Lin Yuan's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"That's understandable," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After that, King Chisonge and Lin Yuan chatted a bit, mainly about Lin Yuan's subsequent arrangements. Since Lin Yuan had revealed the strength of an old-generation Venerable, he naturally needed to be stationed in a more important defensive line area, as the Ding Seven defensive line was too peripheral.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no objections to this, as the strength he had displayed was here, and King Chisonge wouldn't send him to resist a peak Venerable.</p><p></p><p>After a while, King Chisonge had finished chatting, and the Marquis of Qingfen then led Lin Yuan to leave.</p><p></p><p>The study was left with only King Chisonge sitting there.</p><p></p><p>"Father," a young man emerged from the void, bearing a strong resemblance to King Chisonge. He looked at the direction where Lin Yuan and the Marquis of Qingfen had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The war machines are our ancient nation's precious treasures," the young man said, somewhat puzzled. "Even the lowest-grade Type-C war machines have important chaotic secret patterns engraved on them. How could you let Silver River comprehend them so easily, just because he defeated the Venerable Leigo?"</p><p></p><p>Defeating Venerable Leigo and holding the Ding Seven defensive line was indeed meritorious, but it didn't warrant such a reward.</p><p></p><p>King Chisonge looked at the young man, who was his most beloved offspring, otherwise he wouldn't have brought him along during the war.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of Silver River's strength?" King Chisonge asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Venerable's strength? Old-generation Venerable? Veteran Venerable?" the young man asked, slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Wrong," King Chisonge shook his head. "I see that Silver River's attainment in Chaotic Evolution is not strong. When he fought against Venerable Leigo, he basically didn't use that aspect of power."</p><p></p><p>"That's true," the young man said, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Venerable is only at the initial Venerable realm. That he can unleash such powerful combat strength is relying on the Brilliant Yang Divine Body," King Chisonge said.</p><p></p><p>"At the initial Venerable realm, relying on the Brilliant Yang Divine Body to unleash combat strength close to a peak Venerable, this Silver River Venerable must have a high concentration of Brilliant Yang bloodline in his body," the young man realized.</p><p></p><p>"I see," the young man understood.</p><p></p><p>"Just relying on the Brilliant Yang Divine Body, he has such combat strength. If he breaks through in Chaotic Evolution and reaches the Veteran Venerable level, wouldn't that be equivalent to a peak Venerable?" King Chisonge's face showed a smile. Mobilizing a peak Venerable was not an easy task, as many peak Venerables were unwilling to get involved in the conflict between the two ancient nations and directly refused the summons.</p><p></p><p>Now, as long as King Chisonge turned a blind eye, he could gain another peak Venerable to serve his side. This was an extremely profitable deal.</p><p></p><p>"Father is indeed thoughtful," the young man sighed inwardly. If they just let Silver River comprehend the war machines, they could gain an additional peak Venerable combat strength on their side. It was truly worth it.</p><p></p><p>"As for the risk?" King Chisonge smiled. "The chaotic secret patterns on the war machines are the ancient nation's top secrets, but the chaotic secret patterns cannot be leaked just by wanting to leak them."</p><p></p><p>"The prerequisite for leaking the chaotic secret patterns is to comprehend them thoroughly. But Silver River is only a newly ascended Venerable, what can he use to comprehend the chaotic secret patterns on the war machines?"</p><p></p><p>Each war machine has a "self-destruct" secret pattern to prevent it from falling into the enemy's hands and being comprehended and replicated.</p><p></p><p>But here, the "enemy" refers to at least Venerable-level experts. For a war machine to fall into the enemy's hands and then be sent to a Venerable-level expert for comprehension and replication, that would be the complete process of leaking the chaotic secrets.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan? At the initial Venerable realm, his attainment in Chaotic Evolution is not high, so he just wants to comprehend more chaotic secret patterns, but he is still far from thoroughly comprehending the complete chaotic secret patterns of a war machine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan will be comprehending the war machine under King Chisonge's watchful eye, so there is no chance of any leaks.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Lin Yuan has awakened the Brilliant Yang Divine Body, equivalent to being one of their own people in the Brilliant Yang Ancient Nation, so he has no reason to betray the ancient nation.</p><p></p><p>"Father's insight is remarkable," the young man was deeply convinced. On the surface, it appears that King Chisonge agreed to let Silver River comprehend the Grade-A war machine as a reward for defeating Venerable Leigo. But in reality, it was a multi-layered plan that almost completely eliminated any risks.</p><p></p><p>"With Father's strategic planning, the Spiritual Might King is bound to be defeated in this war," the young man immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"It's still too early to talk about victory or defeat," King Chisonge shook his head, a hint of worry in his tone. "I always have a lingering feeling that the Spiritual Might King has many hidden trump cards."</p><p></p><p>After leaving King Chisonge's small city dwelling, the Marquis of Qingfen looked at Lin Yuan, his tone slightly solemn, "Disciple, the fact that the Chisonge Highness agreed so readily makes me suspect that he has seen you are no ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lord Qingfen was aware of the importance of the war machines, especially the Grade A war machines. If there were not enough benefits, how could the King of Crimson Pine possibly allow Lin Yuan to comprehend them? Here, the "benefits" referred to were not just the lack of risks.</p><p></p><p>"But I only realized that you are extraordinary, never expecting your bloodline concentration to reach the level of the core imperial clan."</p><p></p><p>Lord Qingfen said.</p><p></p><p>Lord Qingfen deduced that Lin Yuan possessed the bloodline of the core imperial clan, based on the terrifying speed of Lin Yuan's growth, and the fact that he had not yet stepped into the Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Lord Qingfen did not know this for certain, at most he saw some clues from the operation of Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun Divine Body, but he could not directly think of the core imperial clan bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have had that conversation just now.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened by the side.</p><p></p><p>"There should be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Lord Qingfen thought it over repeatedly, "Prince Crimson Pine at most just thinks your imperial clan bloodline is a bit more concentrated, and with Prince Crimson Pine's personality, he probably won't even mention it."</p><p></p><p>Among the various enfeoffed kings of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, Prince Crimson Pine had the least ambition, and was also too lazy to participate in the infighting among the members of the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>After parting ways with Lord Qingfen,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was directly transferred from the original Ding Seven defense line battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He came to a relatively closer defense line battlefield near the core defense line.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan left a clone behind in the original Ding Seven defense line battlefield, to comprehend the war machines in that battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Since King Crimson Pine had agreed to let Lin Yuan comprehend the Grade A war machine, the remaining Grade B and Grade C war machines would naturally also be at Lin Yuan's disposal.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the core defense line battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's clone arrived at the core defense line battlefield.</p><p></p><p>It was shrouded in layer upon layer of killing arrays, with a multitude of war machines, and the aura of peak Great Venerables fluctuating all around.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's clone soon arrived in front of a Grade A war machine.</p><p></p><p>Since it was currently a period of confrontation, the two sides had not engaged in battle, and many of the war machines were in a state of standby.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Silver River."</p><p></p><p>The commander of the Grade A war machine saw Lin Yuan approaching and slightly bowed, "Prince Crimson Pine has already given the order, Great Venerable Silver River can comprehend this war machine at any time."</p><p></p><p>The commander of the Grade A war machine, although still only at the peak Mastery realm, was directly under the command of King Crimson Pine, and even peak Great Venerables could not order him around without King Crimson Pine's permission.</p><p></p><p>Without King Crimson Pine's approval, no one could approach the war machines without reason.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and directly entered the Grade A war machine.</p><p></p><p>"These Chaotic Arcane Patterns..." Lin Yuan was immediately awestruck upon entering.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chaotic Arcane Patterns he had encountered in the highest-level Grade B war machines,</p><p></p><p>the Chaotic Arcane Patterns contained within this Grade A war machine were not only more vast, but also more "complete". "Chaos is the origin of all things, and also the beginning of all things."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became deeply immersed as he observed the Chaotic Arcane Patterns permeating the war machine.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Principles do not exist within any complete world, which is also the reason why the Chaotic Principles cannot be directly comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Chaos gives birth to all things, only by comprehending all things can one indirectly enhance one's comprehension of the Chaotic Principles.</p><p></p><p>But these Chaotic Arcane Patterns before him were forcibly extracted and condensed from the fundamental veins of Chaos by some great existence.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, observing the unknown Arcane Patterns, your comprehension of the Chaotic Principles has been enhanced.】</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan felt the Chaotic Arcane Patterns contained within the Grade A war machine, his own comprehension of the Chaotic Principles was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided himself into thirty-three clones, going to the various defense line battlefields to comprehend the war machines.</p><p></p><p>While the main body remained stationed at the Ding Thirteen defense line battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As for the two main divine souls, they had long since retreated from the battlefield, hidden in an extremely safe place.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"They've started attacking again?"</p><p></p><p>The main body of Lin Yuan, stationed at the Ding Thirteen defense line battlefield, was also comprehending the war machines on this battlefield. Sensing the changes in the surrounding aura, he immediately flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Long Wind."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the distant Great Venerable opposing him.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Long Wind, a veteran and seasoned Great Venerable, with strength approaching that of a peak Great Venerable, which is why King Crimson Pine had arranged for Lin Yuan to come and block him.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Silver River."</p><p></p><p>Learned from the previous experience with Great Venerable Lei Ge, Great Venerable Long Wind naturally did not dare to underestimate Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>the two engaged in battle.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Venerable Long Wind..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan originally thought he would have to fight a difficult battle, but as soon as he clashed with Great Venerable Long Wind, he found the other party was just retreating and holding back, far from the desperate struggle he had with Great Venerable Lei Ge.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it again, and felt it was normal.</p><p></p><p>To be able to cultivate to the Great Venerable realm, and be a veteran and seasoned Great Venerable, who among them is not a crafty schemer? Except for a few, like Great Venerable Lei Ge, almost no Great Venerable is truly willing to fight to the death on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Since Great Venerable Long Wind was like this, Lin Yuan also cooperated covertly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the task King Crimson Pine gave him was just to hold off Great Venerable Long Wind.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void,</p><p></p><p>"It seems that only by comprehending the divine imprint of the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' technique and completely reproducing it here, can I attempt to condense the Source of the Blazing Sun and merge it with the universe within my body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The seventh bodily divine technique, 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens', also has the meaning of opening and stabilizing the heavens and earth, so Lin Yuan planned to try to form a stable Blazing Sun Source within his own universe.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating the second layer of the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan resumed his cultivation of the thirteenth-tier inheritance, the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>This inheritance could push Lin Yuan's foundation to an unimaginable height.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his inner universe,</p><p></p><p>next to the Jade Gourd, the red-robed little girl was sleeping soundly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>a clone of Lin Yuan appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>"I've already told you before, since you've passed the test, you're my master, you don't need to call me senior."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl opened her eyes, and the joy on her face was overflowing, even though she told Lin Yuan not to address her that way.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"What do you need me for?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl asked.</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to ask the senior, during my cultivation of the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' recently, has there been any problems?"</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had extraordinary comprehension, the 'Infinite Void' was a thirteenth-tier inheritance, profoundly abstruse and deep.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan was afraid he might have strayed off the path, and would check in with the red-robed little girl periodically.</p><p></p><p>"Any problems?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl rolled her eyes. She had been observing Lin Yuan since he started cultivating the second layer, hoping to find any potential problems or hidden dangers in his cultivation, so as to prove her own usefulness.</p><p></p><p>But the result? She, the mighty Jade Gourd Spirit, the great guide specially created to instruct future cultivators of the 'Infinite Void' inheritance, had actually fallen to the point where she couldn't even provide a single suggestion.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

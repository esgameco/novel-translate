            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 471: Lost (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to another immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the beast robe made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice. He had become too well-known in this immortal realm, with his life force being tracked. Whenever he made a move, other immortals would recognize him. </p><p></p><p>This would lead to the immortal cities contacting each other, and then endless pursuit would follow.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure in the beast robe did not regret his actions. Killing the heir of the North Cold Immortal City's lord had allowed him to obtain a precious treasure, greatly boosting his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had to do it again, the figure would unhesitatingly choose to kill.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Dao is inherently about contending - contending with other immortals, contending with heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>In the figure's eyes, those immortals without true strength but who control abundant cultivation resources are all his prey, his provisions on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see, which immortal realm should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>The figure pondered. The choice of immortal realm was very important, as it would affect his subsequent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? The Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm has given birth to a top-tier Pill Refining Master named Cloud True Master?"  The figure became interested.</p><p></p><p>Top-tier Pill Refining Masters are all extremely wealthy. The figure had previously attempted to assassinate one, but was blocked by the top-tier Jade Immortal they had hired.</p><p></p><p>Top-tier Pill Refining Masters, while possessing vast fortunes, are also very protective of their lives, willing to pay a heavy price to safeguard themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This Cloud True Master is a newly emerged top-tier Pill Refining Master, and has not yet hired a top-tier Jade Immortal?" The figure became increasingly interested.</p><p></p><p>The last time Cloud True Master took action was nearly a million years ago, and his combat power at that time was only slightly above average among Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>To the figure in the beast robe, this was a juicy target, even more tempting than the heir of the North Cold Immortal City's lord.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier Pill Refining Master, even a newly emerged one, possesses wealth far exceeding that of ordinary Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure I obtained from the North Cold City Lord's heir has boosted my strength by several levels. Dealing with a mere newly emerged top-tier Pill Refining Master will be no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>The figure was very confident in himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the intelligence report stating that the Cloud True Master was extremely low-key and rarely left his dwelling, this was not an issue for the figure at all.</p><p></p><p>He had dared to kill a city lord's heir within an immortal city, and escaped the encirclement of many immortal cities. He was confident in silently penetrating the killing array of Cangwu Immortal City and entering Cloud True Master's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm it is then."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the beast robe rose, merged into the heavens and earth, and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm was right next to the North Noon Immortal Realm, not far away. And with Cloud True Master as such an ideal target, as long as he succeeded in this matter, the figure would not have to worry about lacking cultivation resources for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In the dwelling.</p><p>In the cultivation area.</p><p>Lin Yuan was still sitting cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The void in front of him began to distort, and a figure appeared.</p><p>It was the Yin Spiritual Awareness.</p><p></p><p>"This is a cultivation resource."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and took out a spatial bracelet, which floated in front of the Yin Spiritual Awareness.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Lin Yuan constantly residing in this Grade-A immortal dwelling was not the true main body, but the Solar Spiritual Awareness.</p><p></p><p>The Grade-A immortal dwelling of Cangwu Immortal City had an irregular rift connecting to the origin place of the Dao Ancestor. That was where the Dao Ancestor resided, so Lin Yuan would not let his true main body stay there for long.</p><p></p><p>If an extreme situation were to occur and attract the Dao Ancestor's attention, losing the true main body would be far more serious than losing a Spiritual Awareness.</p><p></p><p>Therefore -</p><p></p><p>Even though no accidents had occurred for over 500 years, Lin Yuan still kept his true main body hidden in a secret place, while the Solar Spiritual Awareness was in Cangwu Immortal City, accumulating various cultivation resources to supply the true main body's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Yin Spiritual Awareness had come, it was to deliver the cultivation resources earned by the Solar Spiritual Awareness to the true main body.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>The Yin Spiritual Awareness took the cultivation resources and quickly disappeared from the dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p>The Yin Spiritual Awareness appeared in a vast underground palace, many billions of miles away from Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>This was where Lin Yuan's true main body was seated in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>The Yin Spiritual Awareness appeared and presented the spatial bracelet.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Lin Yuan swallowed all the resources in the spatial bracelet in one gulp, then his mind stirred as he looked towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>That was the surface above the underground palace. The void there was rippling, and strands of black energy were spreading out. Soon, seven or eight demonic beasts descended.</p><p></p><p>"In the past few decades, the invasion of the Demon Abyss into the immortal realm has become increasingly severe," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>The specific manifestation was that the appearance of demonic beasts in the immortal realm had become more and more frequent, even in this remote area that Lin Yuan had specially chosen, let alone other places.</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't the Dao Ancestor intervene?" </p><p>Lin Yuan furrowed his brows, slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dao Ancestor was supreme, these demonic beasts had clearly begun to affect the immortals. Especially in the Immortal-Demon War, countless Golden Immortals had died, and even Jade Immortals could not all be spared.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Ancestor's Twelve Realms of Attainment, not only suppressing the Demon Abyss Ancestor would be easy, but stopping these demonic beasts from invading the immortal realm would be no difficulty at all.</p><p></p><p>Yet the reality was that one Immortal-Demon War after another had occurred.</p><p>The Dao Ancestor, residing in the Origin Place, overlooking the immortals, had not shown any intention to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p>"I don't need to consider these matters now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts. Regardless of why the Dao Ancestor did not stop the invasion, it had nothing to do with him. His current goal was to comprehend the Seven Realms of Time-Space as soon as possible, as well as the legendary Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>"But this temporary appearance of demonic beasts..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Passage needed to be resolved. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the ground surface. After seven or eight demonic beasts descended, the space gradually stabilized, and a pitch-black passage dozens of meters in size began to take shape.</p><p></p><p>If this Abyss Passage was not dealt with, endless demonic beasts would continue to emerge, even if the underground palace where Lin Yuan was secluded was not discovered.</p><p></p><p>Once the Abyss Passage expanded further and attracted the attention of the Jade Immortals from the major Immortal Cities, they would send a large number of Immortals to re-seal the passage.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was a possibility that traces of the underground palace would be discovered.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts were of low intelligence, driven only by instinct. Although they were condensed from the aura of the Abyss Ancestor, they had almost no spiritual wisdom.</p><p></p><p>But the Jade Immortals were different - they had many methods. Lin Yuan did not want to create more trouble.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Yin Primordial Spirit disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When it reappeared, it was already on the surface, in front of the rapidly forming Abyss Passage.</p><p></p><p>"Aoooo! Aoooo!"</p><p>"Roar! Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>The seven or eight demonic beasts, upon first entering the Immortal Realm, were extremely excited. For the demonic beasts, the immortal qi, the flesh and souls of the Immortals, especially the physical bodies of the Jade Immortals, were extremely delicious and nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Every demonic beast that invaded the Immortal Realm, as long as it could successfully return to the Abyss, would undoubtedly become dozens or hundreds of times stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, before these seven or eight demonic beasts could even get a clear look around, their consciousness began to rapidly plummet into darkness, and their physical bodies and souls were all transformed into the most primal demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"This demonic qi, is it the aura of the Abyss Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit used its original power to completely return the physical bodies and souls of the demonic beasts to their source, forming this tiny, insignificant wisp of demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Abyss Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed it for a while, allowing this wisp of demonic qi to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Ancestor was also an ultimate Twelfth Realm being. Recklessly preserving the other party's slightest bit of demonic qi was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Especially recently, the Abyss Ancestor's consciousness was about to awaken, and it was possible that even six-tenths of its consciousness would revive. At this time, any wisp of demonic qi could become a 'beacon' for the Abyss Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"The Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the pitch-black passage in front of him, and with a thought, the space around the passage began to collapse, and the Demonic Passage also began to rapidly disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"When the mastery of space-time reaches the Seventh Realm, I can go to the Abyss for a visit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Seventh Realm of space-time mastery would give Lin Yuan the confidence to survive even at the Twelfth Realm Dao Ancestor level. The existence of the Abyss was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>If possible, Lin Yuan naturally wanted to explore it further.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the Abyss Passage in front of him completely collapsed, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, seeing this, finally turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the Abyss Passage was actually quite normal. For the many demonic beasts within the Abyss, it was a common occurrence. With this passage gone, they would just go to the next one.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten years had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the Cangwu Immortal City, in the Immortal Dwelling Area.</p><p></p><p>A beast-robed figure transformed into a diminutive Golden Immortal, appearing in front of the Flying Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"That should be the dwelling of Cloud True Lord," the beast-robed figure glanced at the Immortal Dwelling Area.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Three Immortal Realms were boundless. Even though the Northern Daylight Immortal Realm and the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm were adjacent, it had taken the beast-robed figure ten full years to reach the Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years have passed, and this Cloud True Lord still has no intention of hiring top-tier Jade Immortals to protect himself?" The beast-robed figure's face showed a hint of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ten years, he had naturally not given up on keeping track of information about Cloud True Lord, but he had never heard of which top-tier Jade Immortals had been hired by him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because he has confidence in the protective formations of the Immortal City, or has he secretly hired them without my knowledge?" The beast-robed figure couldn't be bothered to think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already come here, it meant that he was determined to succeed, even if Cloud True Lord had already hired top-tier Jade Immortals to protect him. He was confident that with the increase in his own strength after obtaining that treasure from the Northern Cold City Lord's heir, he could quickly assassinate Cloud True Lord even under the protection of Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal City formations?"</p><p></p><p>The beast-robed figure walked to the front of the Immortal Dwelling Area, smiled slightly, and his figure merged into the heavens and earth, silently infiltrating the Immortal Dwelling Area.</p><p></p><p>Passing by one Immortal Dwelling after another, the beast-robed figure finally arrived in front of a Grade-A Immortal Dwelling.</p><p></p><p>This Immortal Dwelling was where Lin Yuan resided.</p><p></p><p>"This Cloud True Lord must have a close relationship with the upper echelons of the Immortal City. I can feel the immense pressure of the formations in this area." The beast-robed figure's expression became slightly grave. "But it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>He could almost completely ignore the Immortal City formations because of his keen grasp of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Any formation could not be separated from space-time, and with a mastery of space-time, most formations in the world would become meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>The beast-robed figure's eyes faintly shone with a milky white color, and then he merged into the Grade-A Immortal Dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud True Lord should be in the cultivation area."</p><p></p><p>After infiltrating the Immortal Dwelling, the beast-robed figure quickly surveyed the surroundings and then headed towards the cultivation area.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the beast-robed figure arrived at the core area.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud True Lord."</p><p></p><p>A look of excitement appeared on the beast-robed figure's face. Having infiltrated this far without triggering any alerts, he almost had no doubts about successfully assassinating Cloud True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the beast-robed figure disappeared again, entering the cultivation area of the Immortal Dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Like a pebble falling into an endless ocean.</p><p></p><p>The beast-robed figure, who had just managed to enter the core area, was stunned to find that the heavens and earth had changed, and there was an immense world composed of endless layers of space-time, which the beast-robed figure could not see the end of.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The beast-robed figure paused, repeatedly looking around.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a preposterous thought arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Had he gotten lost?</p>

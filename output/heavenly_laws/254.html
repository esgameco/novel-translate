            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 254: A Hundred Leisurely Years (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Born for the Martial Dao?" </p><p></p><p>The several Grand Elders were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>This evaluation could not be considered low. In the Immortal Dao, it would signify a dazzlingly brilliant world-class genius, a seed of an Immortal King!</p><p></p><p>Although the Martial Dao could not compare to the Immortal Dao, this evaluation was not something just anyone could bear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't believe it?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder looked at the others and sighed lightly. </p><p></p><p>To be honest, before "instructing" Lin Yuan, he also did not think there was any Martial Dao cultivator in the world who could be evaluated like this.</p><p></p><p>But after this, the Grand Elder indeed realized that Lin Yuan was this kind of person.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until tomorrow, you will know after instructing him."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head slightly and strode away.</p><p></p><p>In the following time.</p><p></p><p>The several Grand Elders of the Martial Temple took turns wanting to "instruct" Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But the results were often a bit heartbreaking. The questions they posed to Lin Yuan, he would give answers after just pondering for a moment. </p><p></p><p>But often when Lin Yuan casually asked a question back, the Grand Elders would think for a long time, stunned and unable to come up with an explanation. In the end, it was still Lin Yuan who provided the answer.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation in the Martial Dao, Lin Yuan's progress was even more swift and fierce. Under the condition of the Martial Temple providing resources with all its strength, Lin Yuan's speed of advancement was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>In less than a year, he walked a path that ordinary Martial Dao geniuses might not traverse in decades.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what the Grand Elders didn't know was that the cultivation speed Lin Yuan displayed was completely intentional.</p><p></p><p>As for his true cultivation speed, it was far more terrifying than they imagined.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple Guest Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat there casually, while Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen had faces full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you don't know, that Patriarch of the Zhao family treated me so well, it's all because of you, Chang'er."</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping looked at his son, with an indescribable joy.</p><p></p><p>The most correct decision in his life was to send Lin Yuan to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Although to this day, he still didn't know Lin Yuan's status in the Martial Temple, or what level of disciple identity he had after entering the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, under Lin Yuan's casual instructions, the Martial Temple showed vague intentions of closeness to the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>Those major clans and forces in Xiaoyao City who previously looked down on the Lin family immediately started treating them well upon sniffing this out.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Now his status in the Martial Temple was very special.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, Lin Yuan's qualifications and seniority should be on the same level as the current generation's Temple Master.</p><p></p><p>With a word from Lin Yuan, even the Temple Master of the Martial Temple wouldn't dare refute.</p><p></p><p>The family chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>Then Shen Zhen pulled Lin Jianping to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you must protect yourself well in the Martial Temple." Shen Zhen still felt distressed for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She heard that the competition inside the Martial Temple was very brutal. Even the core disciples needed to pay a huge price in order to obtain what they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Now that her son could actually influence the Martial Temple, one could imagine the price he paid.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm doing very well inside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as Lin Yuan said this, Shen Zhen's eyes reddened even more, feeling that Lin Yuan was just putting up a strong front.</p><p></p><p>Seeing off his parents.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then returned to his cultivation cave abode.</p><p></p><p>"After hundreds of thousands of years of development, this world has also produced many directions of exploration for the Martial Dao." Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>In the more than half a year since joining the Martial Temple, besides daily cultivation to recover his strength, he had been observing the changes in the current Martial Dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was the founder of the Martial Dao, he only left behind the Martial Dao Chapters One to Seven back then.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Chapter Seven was just a beginning, and the Chapter Seven established at that time was not considered perfect. Only after Lin Yuan returned to the main world did he create a Chapter Seven that satisfied him.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, after so many years, they still haven't walked out of Chapter Eight."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's knowledge, the strongest Martial Dao experts today were just three Seventh Stage Martial Dao experts.</p><p></p><p>Among these three Seventh Stage experts, the strongest was named "Li Qing", who was a personal disciple Lin Yuan accepted in the lower realm back then.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two, they were juniors who reached the Seventh Stage after ascending to the Spirit Realm and being instructed.</p><p></p><p>Of the three Seventh Stage experts, "Li Qing" was at the peak of the Seventh Stage, while the other two lingered between the middle and late Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of Seventh Stage..." Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao path that "Li Qing" walked was the one Lin Yuan left behind back then. Although it was just the beginning of the Seventh Stage, Lin Yuan finally left behind guesses and inferences about the subsequent Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>At least it was much easier than creating the Seventh Stage Chapter from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Of course, because the Seventh Stage Chapter Lin Yuan left behind at that time was not quite perfect.</p><p></p><p>It led to "Li Qing" having almost no possibility of stepping into the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Even in the main world, the Eighth Stage was a very critical stage, and the Eighth Stage evolution path was the premise for evolutionary scholars.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Although hundreds of thousands of years have passed in this world, the Martial Dao ultimately cannot be considered a dominant path. Without enough living beings investing in it, plus the Seventh Stage Chapter taking a detour, it's not strange that the Eighth Stage Chapter hasn't been walked out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was able to cross into the Eighth Stage because the Seventh Stage was near perfect, plus his heaven-defying comprehension, as well as the many cultivation conditions of the main world, and finally the countless evolution paths from the bodies of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>With many factors boosting him, it allowed Lin Yuan to have his current achievements.</p><p></p><p>As for the Martial Dao of the Spirit Realm, if Lin Yuan's consciousness hadn't descended this time, it was estimated that even after a million more years, there still wouldn't be a Martial Dao cultivator crossing into the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"The Eighth Stage of the Martial Dao should be equivalent to the Tribulation Passing Stage in the Immortal Dao cultivation system?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the Immortal Dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Passing Stage was also known as Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Tribulation Passing Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Even looking across the three thousand Dao Prefectures of the Spirit Realm, Tribulation Passing Immortal Kings still stood at the absolute peak.</p><p></p><p>"To cross into the Tribulation Passing Stage, one needs to pass the Heart Demon Tribulation and the Physical Tribulation, only then can one break through to the Tribulation Passing Stage and rank as an Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed similar to crossing from the Seventh Stage to the Eighth Stage, needing to experience the Heart Demon Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The difference was, crossing from the Seventh Stage to the Eighth Stage only required experiencing the Heart Demon Tribulation, while the Harmonized True Immortals of the Spirit Realm also needed to additionally experience the Physical Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Tribulation Passing Immortal Kings, grasping the power of creation, overlooking the Spirit Realm, and even able to spiritually roam millions of lower realms?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recalled the introduction he had read about Tribulation Passing Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>These were all collected by the Martial Temple. Although the Martial Dao cultivation system was different from the Immortal Dao cultivation system, the latecomers still held awe for the top powerhouses of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what differences there are between Tribulation Passing Immortal Kings and Eighth Stage Evolutionary Beings." Lin Yuan was a bit curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With different cultivation systems, the abilities displayed at each stage were naturally different too.</p><p></p><p>"Power of creation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin. This power was the core power mastered by Tribulation Passing Immortal Kings and the greatest foundation for Immortal King level powerhouses to overlook the masses.</p><p></p><p>"Is it another name for the power of the world? Or is it simply another kind of power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Energy? The Tribulation Immortal King didn't even open up an inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts were surging.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful technique of an Eighth Stage Evolutionist was the world power birthed from their inner world.</p><p></p><p>As for the creative power of a Tribulation Immortal King, it was unclear what kind of power it actually was.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Temple's level was ultimately not high enough, and it still couldn't collect detailed information on Immortal King level experts.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Several Supreme Elders gathered together once again.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er's talent is too strong, we can no longer guide him."</p><p></p><p>The Second Supreme Elder was silent for a moment before speaking truthfully.</p><p></p><p>They were all Sixth Stage martial arts experts, equivalent to Xuan Xu period Ancient Sages.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, Xuan Xu period Ancient Sages were enough to dominate an area. At least in a city like Xiaoyao City, Ancient Sage level combat power was considered the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>But facing Lin Yuan, they all felt a bit apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's learning ability and cultivation speed were too fast.</p><p></p><p>So fast that it made them somewhat doubt how they had spent these years.</p><p></p><p>"Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The Third Supreme Elder asked.</p><p></p><p>"Now the only way is to request instructions from the three Patriarchs. Perhaps only the three Patriarchs are qualified to guide Chang'er."</p><p></p><p>The Great Supreme Elder spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The three Patriarchs?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining few Supreme Elders were slightly shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The three Patriarchs here naturally referred to the three Seventh Stage martial arts experts.</p><p></p><p>The three who founded the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Currently, these three Seventh Stage martial arts experts were all fighting for the Moral Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Moral Immortal Sect had been protecting Xiaoyao City for so many years, not only because a certain True Immortal big shot in the Moral Immortal Sect had negotiated an agreement with that mysterious Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>It was even more so because of the merits the three Patriarchs had established for the Moral Immortal Sect over the years.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's estimated that only the three Patriarchs can teach him."</p><p></p><p>The Third Supreme Elder sighed. In any case, the few of them didn't dare to continue teaching, otherwise there would definitely be a risk of damaging their state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't confirmed that Lin Chang's soul and body were incomparably compatible.</p><p></p><p>They would all suspect whether Lin Chang had been possessed by some old monster.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, possession was not a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>"I will contact the three Patriarchs right away."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the various Supreme Elders had no objections, the Great Supreme Elder immediately stood up and said.</p><p></p><p>The three Patriarchs were fighting external battles. If there was no major event, they were not allowed to be disturbed. But now regarding the matter of Lin Yuan, the several Supreme Elders all felt that it was a major event.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>In addition to cultivating, Lin Yuan was also perceiving the Great Dao rules of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, and wisps of extremely Yin and pure Yin power gathered deep in his pupils, merging with the Yang power to form Taiji power.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that not long after descending, I would comprehend the Yin Rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood. After nearly twenty years of secluded cultivation in the main world, he hadn't comprehended the Yin Rule. But not long after crossing over, he had comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>"However, my current strength is too weak, and I can't condense rules. Otherwise, I could take a look and see what it would be like after the Yin Rule and Yang Rule merge. Would it form a new rule? The Taiji Rule?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao rules were illusory and intangible. To condense a certain rule, the first requirement was to comprehend that rule, and the second was to have a physique and soul that could carry this rule.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan just couldn't condense the Yin Rule, but he could still use it.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending a certain rule, even if one was just a mortal, with every move, one would conform to this rule and burst forth with power far beyond the limit.</p><p></p><p>"With this crossing, I can awaken a flesh divine ability."</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Stage of the Martial Dao had absorbed the essence of the body cultivation lineage and could condense flesh divine abilities belonging to martial arts cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had condensed two flesh divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The first was "Rebirth with a Drop of Blood".</p><p></p><p>The second was "Moving Mountains".</p><p></p><p>The former had brought Lin Yuan great help, and even the opening of that mysterious gourd relied on the "Rebirth with a Drop of Blood" divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"There's also that gourd."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into the depths of his mind, gazing at that majestic and huge door of myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan was willing, he could consume a wisp of realm-breaking source power at any time to bring that mysterious gourd over.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, Lin Yuan still decided to wait for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>His current strength was still too weak, and the mysterious gourd was too precious. It was better to wait until he had sufficient self-protection power in this realm before considering it.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate, cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he began cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>Although he now had the protection of the Martial Temple and didn't need to worry about safety.</p><p></p><p>There were still many things waiting for Lin Yuan to do, and these things all required strength.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Profound King Domain.</p><p></p><p>Inside a palace.</p><p></p><p>Three figures were sitting cross-legged there, their blood and qi circulating, faintly shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Temple sent me a message."</p><p></p><p>The first figure on the left opened his eyes and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"What major event happened?"</p><p></p><p>The first figure on the right also opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>They had long told the Martial Temple that unless a major event occurred, they should not easily contact them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the figure in the middle opened his eyes and slowly said.</p><p></p><p>This figure was an extremely beautiful woman, precisely Lin Yuan's personal disciple "Li Qing" whom he had accepted back then.</p><p></p><p>"They said that the Martial Temple received a once-in-a-generation genius. When sensing the Martial Ancestor's divine radiance, it caused the seven divine statues to tremble and simultaneously emit twelve levels of radiance."</p><p></p><p>The figure on the left said.</p><p></p><p>"The seven divine statues all emitted twelve levels of radiance?"</p><p></p><p>The figure on the right had some fluctuations in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Even he, back then, had only caused one divine statue to tremble and emit twelve levels of radiance.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed a once-in-a-generation genius."</p><p></p><p>"Li Qing" nodded and said, "What does the Martial Temple want us to do?"</p><p></p><p>"They want one of us to go back and personally guide that genius." The figure on the left said.</p><p></p><p>"Go back one of us?" Li Qing slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The current battles with other major domains have reached a critical moment. We cannot leave, not even projecting our primordial spirits."</p><p></p><p>"How about this, you reply to the Martial Temple. In a hundred years, a hundred years later, I will personally go back and guide that once-in-a-generation genius."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing spoke.</p><p></p><p>She still placed great importance on martial arts talents. Perhaps influenced by Lin Yuan back then, Li Qing was willing to give every martial arts cultivator a further opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. In a hundred years, the battles will pretty much stop. At that time, the three of us can all go back and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"During these hundred years, let that once-in-a-generation genius cultivate on his own first. When we go back, we can personally instruct him."</p><p></p><p>The figure on the right said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The figure on the left nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just a hundred years. That once-in-a-generation genius might have just gained some insight into the Martial Dao. When the three of them went back, it would be just in time to point out the way at a critical moment for him.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a hundred years had passed since Lin Yuan descended to this world.</p>

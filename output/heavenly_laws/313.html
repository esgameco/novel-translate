        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 313: Curse to Kill (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"How am I worthy enough to have drawn the descent of a divine being?"</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, the soul of the Goddess of Lust trembled. The twenty-four divine beings of the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness had not taken action for countless millions of years.</p><p></p><p>The demigods secretly spreading their faiths in the mortal realm were like worms hiding in dark corners in the eyes of the divine beings, getting purged every so often.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Lust had evaded the Order Church's encirclements multiple times, not because she was extremely powerful, but because the Divine Being of Order simply did not regard her as a threat.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, luck also played a role.</p><p></p><p>"Which of the twenty-four divine beings took action?"</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Lust maintained her frantic fleeing speed, her mind barely calming down.</p><p></p><p>She felt that the divine being who struck was likely not specifically targeting her, but rather took the opportunity to eliminate the Church of Lust.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately I wasn't at the church."</p><p></p><p>Relief appeared on the Goddess of Lust's face. If she had stayed at the church to directly face that short, fat man, the Goddess of Lust felt she would have been no different from the other followers and believers.</p><p></p><p>"I can't return to the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Lust seemed like a startled bird. "Although the price was tragic this time, at least I survived."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Lust's expression became energized. "Since I managed to survive, there is hope to regroup the faith and raise the Divine Nation."</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace of Anpu City, Lin Yuan stood under the divine statue and suddenly opened his eyes: "Found you."</p><p></p><p>Through the causal connection between himself and the Goddess of Lust, Lin Yuan locked onto her approximate location across billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"Not at the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly. "Not a big problem."</p><p></p><p>As long as he could lock onto the Goddess of Lust's position by tracing the causal link, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>"Curse to kill."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave. Following the rules of causality and tracing back from effect to cause, a terrifying force instantly traversed billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>The curse to kill technique was a certain application of the rules of causality.</p><p></p><p>To curse and kill someone, a "medium" was needed. This "medium" could be an object or the causal link between the two parties themselves.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the realm of the curse caster had to be at least two great levels higher than the cursed target. The Goddess of Lust was a seventh-level demigod, while Lin Yuan's true realm was the ninth level, meeting the condition for cursing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, once the curse was successful, the caster had to withstand the backlash from the rules of causality, paying at least an equivalent price in longevity.</p><p></p><p>The curse to kill technique had many restrictions, so it did not appear frequently in the main universe. Mainly because the price was too high, and it was not a permanent kill - if the cursed target's talent was high enough, they could still be "resurrected" by supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, the Goddess of Lust was rejoicing at having survived a divine being's attack when her expression suddenly changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>In her perception, an intangible and unstoppable force that she could never resist descended instantly.</p><p></p><p>Before the Goddess of Lust could form any thoughts, her physical body and soul were both reduced to ashes, permanently disappearing from this world.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that the "causal link" between himself and the Goddess of Lust had completely vanished, confirming her death.</p><p></p><p>If the Goddess of Lust had other means of survival, their "causal link" should still exist. Determining death through this causal link was the mainstream method for powerful beings in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Here comes the backlash?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly as he vaguely felt his longevity diminish by a sliver, about a thousand years' worth.</p><p></p><p>"Cursing to kill a mere seventh-level being cost me a thousand years of longevity?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. This was indeed quite unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was some deep enmity involved... but for a ninth-level expert to kill a seventh-level one, there were too many other methods available. The curse to kill technique had the lowest cost-effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>"Just a thousand years of longevity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't care much. If this was in the main world, he might have felt pained by those thousand years. But in this world he was traversing?</p><p></p><p>Given that his known residence time was only one thousand one hundred and ten years, longevity was the most meaningless thing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had a billion years of longevity, wouldn't he still have to return to the main world once the residence time limit was up?</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that Lin Yuan did not hesitate to use the curse to kill technique on the Goddess of Lust. After all, any longevity in this traversed world was a bonus.</p><p></p><p>"But the eighth-level divinities of this world, embodying the faith of living beings, don't seem to have a concept of longevity?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Under the restrictions of the laws of this realm, fourth and fifth-level knights could hardly live past two hundred years, while sixth-level legendary knights struggled to reach a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years was the absolute upper limit of longevity for life in this world.</p><p></p><p>As for seventh-level demigods, after igniting their divine flames, the essence of their life began to change. As long as a seventh-level demigod's divine flame did not extinguish, they would not die. Normally, they could easily live for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Although still far inferior to seventh-level evolvers from the main world, compared to mortals they could be considered long-lived.</p><p></p><p>While seventh-level demigods could easily live for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, without establishing a Divine Nation, they would still eventually die.</p><p></p><p>As for eighth-level true gods and ninth-level divine beings, since ancient times, there were no records of any true gods dying of old age, except during divine wars.</p><p></p><p>"The Church of Lust has been more or less resolved."</p><p></p><p>"Time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took action against the Church of Lust for two reasons: one was the enmity between Long Shanyuan and them, and two, the area around Long Shan Ridge was the root base that Lin Yuan was developing during this traversal.</p><p></p><p>It would not do to allow such an unstable factor as the Church of Lust to remain nearby. Who knew what commotion they might cause, possibly even attracting the attention of the Order Church again.</p><p></p><p>The Order Church was the church of the divine beings. Before recovering to the ninth level, Lin Yuan did not wish to come into contact with existences at the divine level.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had the ability to eliminate them, he naturally took the opportunity to wipe out the Church of Lust.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up all those corpses."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, the corpses and bloodstains in the palace vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>If not for this underground palace being located beneath the prosperous city of Anpu, any disturbance would have affected the city above.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even considered making the entire palace disappear.</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Even if someone investigates this place later, at most they'll think the Church of Lust has relocated again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took one last look as he stood at the palace's exit.</p><p></p><p>While the Church of Lust's movements in Anpu City were secretive, they were not without a trace. Lin Yuan's actions wiped them out, which would definitely be investigated later.</p><p></p><p>But that's all that could be done - no one would guess that the entire Church of Lust and their Goddess had vanished from this world.</p><p></p><p>"The divine web..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the strands of power permeating heaven and earth, belonging to one of the twenty-four divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The "Authority" of the Web Goddess.</p><p></p><p>By constructing a web covering the entire human realm, the more lives that use the web, the more it can provide the immense power of faith for the Web Goddess. </p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's view, the purpose of the web was not just for communication, it was also the "eyes" of the Web Goddess.</p><p></p><p>This time, if it weren't for being wary of the web's perception, unable to employ too strong of power, Lin Yuan would not have needed to personally enter the underground palace. </p><p></p><p>He could have directly erased the entire Desire Church from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was chatting with his parents. </p><p></p><p>After a hundred years, Longshan Fang and his wife were still living well, without any signs of aging, naturally thanks to Lin Yuan secretly nourishing them with the power of the world.</p><p></p><p>This realm's heavens and earth suppressed longevity too fiercely, but relying on the power of the world, Lin Yuan still had confidence to let Longshan Fang and his wife live to the limit of their longevity.</p><p></p><p>As for more? According to the rules of this world, they would have to ignite the divine fire and change their form of life.</p><p></p><p>However, with Longshan Fang and his wife's aptitudes, they obviously could not achieve that. Otherwise, like Lin Yuan, they would have to cross into the seventh or eighth level of martial arts, which could also greatly extend longevity.</p><p></p><p>But this was clearly more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Yuanshen transformed into strands of sun power and returned to Lin Yuan's body. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced in the direction of Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>"Son, what's wrong?" Longshan Fang looked at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, just took care of a small matter," Lin Yuan casually said. </p><p></p><p>Having erased the Desire Church, Longshan Ridge would definitely not cause any trouble in the future, which saved him some worry.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with his parents for a while, Lin Yuan returned to the cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Yuanshen and Sun Yuanshen appeared opposite him.</p><p></p><p>Facing Lin Yuan, they sat down.</p><p></p><p>Since he had not recovered to his peak strength, Lin Yuan did not bring the mysterious gourd, and the two great Yuanshens remained in soul form, without using the secret technique "Illusory Reality" to transform into physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>"The current speed of cultivation is still too slow. I need to quickly recover to the ninth level, and then open up more spatial layers," Lin Yuan felt pressured.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he and Xi Lan were still being pursued by the Hunyi. Although they could rely on the special environment of the secret realm for safety in the short term, who knew what variables or accidents could occur?</p><p></p><p>If possible, Lin Yuan did not want his Sun Yuanshen to be extinguished. The calling sensation from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm still made him quite tempted.</p><p></p><p>"From the eighth to the ninth level, for me, is just an accumulation of energy. As long as I have sufficient energy, I can quickly return to the ninth level," Lin Yuan glanced at the eternal stars in the celestial vault above, the divine kingdoms that contained boundless energy.</p><p></p><p>But currently, it was not appropriate for Lin Yuan to directly confront the gods.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only rely on those churches," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The churches were the mouthpieces of the gods in the human realm, also propagating faith for the gods.</p><p></p><p>The true god churches had methods to connect to the true gods, and could summon divine force avatars in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>Although the divine force avatars could not wield the power of the gods' divine kingdoms, they far surpassed demigods of the seventh level and could walk unobstructed in the human realm.</p><p></p><p>However, to support the divine force avatars taking action required a great deal of energy, so every true god church stored large amounts of "divine crystals" to summon the gods' divine force avatars at any time.</p><p></p><p>In the struggle for faith, conflicts would occasionally arise between the gods, even leading to clashes between divine force avatars.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's target was the "divine crystals" stored by the major churches - this was extremely pure energy, even purer than the "Taiwei Clear Crystals" of the main world.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you two will go search for 'divine crystals'," Lin Yuan thought, and the two Yuanshen avatars immediately understood his intention, since the three were one entity sharing the same consciousness, with no need for communication.</p><p></p><p>The two Yuanshen avatars, being soul bodies, could gather and disperse at will, most suitable for this operation.</p><p></p><p>Underground palace in Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>Currently, followers of the Order Church stood at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"This palace should be one of the strongholds of the Desire Cult, but it's unknown why it was abandoned."</p><p></p><p>A high priest of the Order Church frowned. The Desire Cult had previously caused quite a stir in the imperial capital, with many nobles of the royal family indulging in the cult's extreme pleasures.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Order Church discovered the Desire Cult was secretly collecting faith behind the scenes from a demigod, and decisively surrounded and annihilated it.</p><p></p><p>The remnants of the Desire Cult retreated from the capital, and the Order Church had been searching for traces of the cult over the years. The recent movements in Anpu City caught the Order Church's attention.</p><p></p><p>When the Order Church came to investigate, they finally confirmed the Desire Cult had stayed in Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>"High Priest, it's been confirmed - there are no clues left in the palace, it seems the cult deliberately cleaned up all traces," an Order Church follower came over and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"It seems..."</p><p></p><p>"The Desire Cult really did voluntarily withdraw."</p><p></p><p>The high priest nodded slightly. The palace was just too clean - it was only from the murals on the walls and remnants of certain rituals that he determined this was the Desire Cult's stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>High Priest Lai frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all the clues pointed to the Desire Cult voluntarily withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>But High Priest Lai sensed something was amiss - why would the Desire Cult withdraw?</p><p></p><p>The Order Church had not yet discovered them, so the Desire Cult could have safely hidden here and developed slowly. Why did they suddenly withdraw?</p><p></p><p>High Priest Lai had dealt with the Desire Cult many times, even leading the encirclement and annihilation of the cult back then.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, High Priest Lai had a deep understanding of the Desire Cult - it was a cult with great influence, controlling living beings through their desires, thereby controlling the beings themselves.</p><p></p><p>In the process, it was utterly stealthy. Even those with the most resolute willpower found it difficult to resist the Desire Cult's "corruption."</p><p></p><p>As long as one was assimilated by "desire," they could provide faith for the Desire Mother Goddess behind the cult.</p><p></p><p>If the Desire Cult and Desire Mother Goddess were allowed to develop, the abyss of darkness would gain another powerful true goddess.</p><p></p><p>"It's just what?"</p><p></p><p>"A cult like the Desire Cult, a street rat - of course they'd run rather than wait for us to encircle them?"</p><p></p><p>Another high priest shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps," High Priest Lai thought for a moment. Although he didn't understand why the Desire Cult withdrew so cleanly, the minds of these cults had always been crazy, not to be viewed through common sense.</p><p></p><p>"However, since the Desire Cult has abandoned Anpu City, they must be hiding somewhere else. Next, we need to search all regions of the empire and try to find the cult's new stronghold," High Priest Lai instructed.</p>

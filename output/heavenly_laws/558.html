        <h1>Chapter 558</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Swallowed by the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Lord of the Three Woods had a bitter expression, tinged with a hint of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"How could Wu Dong have ventured into the depths of the Black Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>If he was swallowed by the Black Heavens, there would be nothing he could do.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he called upon stronger experts, they would be unable to rescue Wu Dong.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Black Heavens, the Dao Master of Radiant Light had once said that it was an unconscious cosmic phenomenon, devouring everything it came into contact with.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the Radiant Light Realm had a brilliant presence in the Divine Wood Realm, no Lord dared to descend there. Or rather, they were unable to.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would bring disaster to the Radiant Light Realm as well.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Heavens could also devour Lords.</p><p></p><p>If one died in the Black Heavens, it would be a meaningless death.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right... Given Wu Dong's strength and the time flow in the Divine Wood Realm, even if Wu Dong rushed with all his might, he should not have reached the depths of the Black Heavens yet."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Three Woods discovered something, but he saw that the Lord of Time had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Lord of Time had been in a state of cultivation for a long time and rarely awakened, so he did not disturb him further.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... How did Wu Dong die exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"Should I ask the Void Paradise?"</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Realm, the Radiant Light faction was powerful, but its distribution was far less extensive than the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>The Void Travelers could be said to be scattered throughout the various domains of the Divine Wood Realm, and they were the best at gathering information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally finished killing them."</p><p></p><p>"I almost became a soulless murder machine."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang and the other ninety-nine Devilish Gods had finally been completely exterminated and fallen, after an unknown number of deaths.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens is still quite difficult to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Although, due to the existence of the Devilish Source, the Black Heavens and the Black Earth were like the ultimate delicacy for him.</p><p></p><p>But this was because Qi Huang and the others were far weaker than him, and he could easily annihilate them, gaining experience and improving himself.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered opponents at the Lord level, it would be very difficult to slay them.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Lord-level experts could be resurrected infinitely.</p><p></p><p>"It's amazing that the Divine Wood Realm has been able to hold out for so long."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan imagined what would happen if the Black Heavens and Black Earth reached the Immortal Realm, and he reckoned the Immortal Realm would not be able to withstand them for long.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens... What exactly is it?" A complex expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A cosmic disaster, or a cosmic phenomenon?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his communication talisman flashed with light.</p><p></p><p>A message from the Handsome Immortal Cultivator arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi Yuan, I've recently taken on a task and will be coming to the Quejin Realm soon.</p><p></p><p>As a Lord, you should be able to guarantee my safety, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal Cultivator's words were tinged with playfulness.</p><p></p><p>He naturally did not believe that Qi Yuan was truly a Lord, as Lords would have already comprehended the Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me here, the Quejin Realm will be very safe." Qi Yuan was still quite considerate towards this tutorial NPC.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Imaginary Space.</p><p></p><p>The tall, slender woman stood with her arms crossed, looking quite heroic. She looked at the Handsome Immortal Cultivator and said, "Are you sure your friend can protect us completely?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my friend is extremely powerful. Even Feng Tiao, who possessed nine lives, was slain by him." The Handsome Immortal Cultivator said confidently, puffing out his chest.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the golden-haired man, Tong Chang, had a look of surprise in his eyes: "He's that strong? There's actually such a genius in the Divine Wood Realm."</p><p></p><p>He had heard of the Radiant Light faction's Feng Tiao, who was ranked among the top three in the Stepping into the Heavens Realm of the Radiant Light Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected this world to produce such a talent." The tall woman murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the soul in her mind sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I would love to take him as a disciple, with such talent."</p><p></p><p>Of course, she was merely captivated and had a fondness for talent, nothing more. Currently, she was busy breaking through to the second layer of the Yang God Realm and had no time to take on a disciple, let alone one from another universe, which would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Handsome Immortal Cultivator told her about Qi Yuan's budding comprehension of the Dao of the Universe, her thoughts might be very different.</p><p></p><p>"But the Quejin Realm has ninety-nine Devilish Gods, and there's also the existence of Qi Huang, so we still need to be careful." The tall woman added.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man nodded: "Yes, the other Devilish Gods are not a concern, but that Qi Huang... It's not clear which of his many uncles is his real father."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the golden-haired man burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>The mystery surrounding Qi Huang's parentage was often discussed in the exchange areas of the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>He had many uncles, but no father. Those uncles were kind to him, but none were certain if they were his real father, so their care was limited.</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal Cultivator also laughed: "Can the Black Heavens and Black Earth even have children? How interesting?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough with the idle chatter, the mission is the priority."</p><p></p><p>"Go to these coordinates, my good friend Qi Yuan is there."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The spatial transmission waves came, and the three people disappeared from the scene.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, they were in the Quejin Realm, in a secluded courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal Cultivator scanned the area and immediately spotted the familiar figure. His eyes shone with delight: "It's been a while, your bearing is still the same. This is Wu Chun, and the golden-haired one is Tong Chang."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also nodded to Qi Yuan, a sign of recognition.</p><p></p><p>The tall woman, Wu Chun, looked at Qi Yuan with a coquettish smile: "Handsome Immortal Cultivator, your name should be given to this brother of yours."</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man Tong Chang also expressed his agreement with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged a few casual words, and the atmosphere was relatively harmonious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "What kind of task are you here for? If there's anything I can help with, this Quejin Realm... I have a certain reputation here for now."</p><p></p><p>Turning to the task, the Handsome Immortal Cultivator became more serious: "I'm looking for someone named Guan Ku, he's a member of the Rebel Army."</p><p></p><p>"This Guan Ku is the third leader of the Rebel Army, his identity is shrouded in mystery, and he has never revealed his true self." The tall woman, Wu Chun, supplemented.</p><p></p><p>This task was of average difficulty, the key was to avoid Qi Huang and the others and find Guan Ku.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, just wait a moment." Qi Yuan smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in the Quejin Realm, all the Rebel Army members and other beings suddenly heard a voice in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Guan Ku?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was confused and became wary.</p><p></p><p>In a mountain cave, a man whose body was completely rotten had a look of terror in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is that one... looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, a satisfied expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Go three million miles to the east, and then proceed to... There is a cave, he is there. Do you want me to send you there?" Qi Yuan revealed the location of Guan Ku.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you're so fast?" Handsome Immortal Cultivator was a bit surprised, then he looked at Wu Chun and Tong Chang. "I told you my brother is highly capable. He's been in the Quejin Realm for a few years, and he has everything in this Quejin Realm under his control!"</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal Cultivator boasted.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang were also surprised, not expecting to find Guan Ku's whereabouts so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Although they were a bit skeptical about the accuracy of the address, this person was the friend of the Handsome Immortal Cultivator, and they couldn't openly doubt him, as that would be disrespectful to the Handsome Immortal Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"We have the Divine Travel Talisman, we can reach Guan Ku's location in a moment without troubling Qi Yuan. Thank you." The golden-haired Tong Chang said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll watch over Guan Ku for you. He won't leave before you arrive," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Tong Chang was a bit confused, but remembering that Xian Ling Ying Xiu often said strange things, he could understand it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Movement Symbol was used.</p><p></p><p>The three people present disappeared in a flash of golden light.</p><p></p><p>Tong Chang's face was filled with joy: "If Guan Ku is there, our mission this time will be too simple."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we just need to find him, record the aura of the Anomaly Source on him, and our mission will be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you mustn't be greedy, just record the aura of the Anomaly Source, don't bring the hidden Anomaly Source back."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if we bring the hidden Anomaly Source back, we won't be able to hide it from the scrutiny of the Void Paradise."</p><p></p><p>Their mission this time was related to the mysterious Anomaly Source.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say who has the most Anomaly Source in the Kui Jin Realm, it would undoubtedly be Qi Huang.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't dare provoke Qi Huang, after all, Qi Huang has many uncles.</p><p></p><p>The rebel Guan Ku, due to special reasons, obtained a strand of Anomaly Source and was polluted by it.</p><p></p><p>As long as they find this person and record the Anomaly Source aura on him, their mission will be completed.</p><p></p><p>"So it really is Guan Ku, Qi Yuan didn't lie to us!"</p><p></p><p>In the midst of their conversation, they had already crossed thousands of miles through the Divine Movement Symbol and arrived at Guan Ku's location.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Guan Ku was wearing a black robe, completely covered from head to toe, with a rotten back covered in dense boils.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three people, he did not appear nervous, but calmly said, "Guan Ku has been awaiting your arrival for a long time."</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired Tong Chang was surprised: "You knew we were coming?"</p><p></p><p>A bad idea flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it through, it didn't seem plausible.</p><p></p><p>"The voice of that senior just now sounded in my head, so I knew that someone might come looking for me," Guan Ku said.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what voice?" The tall woman Wu Chun also felt something strange.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man looked at Guan Ku, his eyes flashing with a sense of dread, and he said, "It's not suitable to stay here for long, we'll just record and leave."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he could sense a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>Now, it's best to just finish the recording and leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>Their recording only required taking out a copper mirror and flashing it at Guan Ku, which was very simple.</p><p></p><p>As long as they took the photo and recorded the aura of the Anomaly Source, they could leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>The others nodded.</p><p></p><p>This matter was strange, it's best to complete the mission and leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired Tong Chang took out the copper mirror and flashed it at Guan Ku.</p><p></p><p>A special aura permeated, as if recording something.</p><p></p><p>The speed was fast, and the duration was short, but the people present seemed to smell a dangerous aura and wanted to finish quickly.</p><p></p><p>However... at this moment, the originally boil-covered Guan Ku suddenly grinned, his smile chilling.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect to really catch some fish, but unfortunately... they're just small fry."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a seemingly ethereal figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>This figure looked ordinary, formless and shapeless, causing the few people present to change drastically in expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Shen!" </p><p></p><p>They didn't expect to encounter a Yang Shen in this mission.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, they hurriedly fled back to the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>"Too bad... it's too late..." The voice of this Yang Shen was particularly chilling.</p><p></p><p>The three present were horrified to find that the space seemed to be confined, and they could not leave at all.</p><p></p><p>"A conspiracy!" The golden-haired Tong Chang's face was filled with terror and a hint of anger.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this mission was so simple. </p><p></p><p>That Qi Yuan was obviously in cahoots with this black-robed Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun's eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the strand of divine soul in her mind burst forth with terrifying power, sweeping away like autumn wind and falling leaves.</p><p></p><p>This power, if unleashed in the universe, would be enough to make the stars fall.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Xiu and Tong Chang were delighted, not expecting Wu Chun to have such a trump card.</p><p></p><p>Her body actually concealed the soul of a Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a mere Yang Shen of the first layer, wanting to break my confinement? Come back in a hundred million years!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed Yang Shen's eyes flashed with a mocking look, and a strange power burst forth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Yang Shen's soul of the Great Heavenly Realm was injured, and blood seeped from the corners of Wu Chun's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"He is a Yang Shen of the second layer, the Wisdom Realm!" Wu Chun's expression was bitter, even desperate.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect this mission to encounter a Yang Shen, and not just any Yang Shen, but a terrifying existence at the second layer.</p><p></p><p>Without the Realm Lord, the Yang Shen of the second layer was already the strongest existence in the universe, worthy of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, three little bugs and one big bug... should be enough... to bring some Anomaly Source into the Void Paradise," the black-robed Yang Shen said with a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Xiu and the others were in despair, and they immediately realized what was going on.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed Yang Shen was obviously using the Anomaly Source as bait, wanting to smuggle the Anomaly Source into the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>If the Anomaly Source entered... they didn't dare imagine.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the entire universe would become the second Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now was not the time to think about these things, now the priority was to survive.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die here, aren't I?" Xian Ling Ying Xiu's voice was filled with grief, not expecting a simple mission to turn into such a disaster.</p><p></p><p>"What, you're going to die? Can I eat your share?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice came.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Xiu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Qi... Yuan?</p><p></p><p>How did he come here?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he not have the Divine Movement Symbol?</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also looked at Qi Yuan, their expressions varying.</p><p></p><p>Especially Tong Chang, he was almost grinding his teeth, because he felt that Qi Yuan was an accomplice of the black-robed Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>But... when Qi Yuan arrived, the black-robed Yang Shen saw the upright figure, and dangerous omens kept rising, his scalp tingling, feeling as if he had been targeted by some terrifying giant.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>This happened so fast that the three people and the Yang Shen present could not react at all.</p><p></p><p>But they saw Qi Yuan stretch out his hand, a look of satisfaction in his eyes: "I've been watching the show for so long, just to cut off your retreat path. If you can still leave, where's my face?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell, his pure and flawless hand descended.</p><p></p><p>The dissipated form of the black-robed Yang Shen condensed again.</p><p></p><p>Thousand changes, myriad transformations.</p><p></p><p>A turtle!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used his own technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this powerful and terrifying Yang Shen of the second layer was instantly transformed into an overturned turtle.</p><p></p><p>It lay on its back, struggling constantly, just like a real turtle unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The three people present were horrified, their faces filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying existence of the Yang Shen of the second layer... was solved with a single move, turned into a turtle? Wait, what realm was this Qi Yuan in? Xian Ling Ying Xiu's shock was the greatest, could it be... that Qi Yuan was truly the Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan patted his hands and looked at the turtle on the ground, his voice calm: "Didn't expect there to be a Gui daring to fish in the Kui Jin Realm, not knowing that the mantis catches the cicada, while the yellow bird is behind."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Qi Yuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>Could there be another yellow bird?</p><p></p><p>But his brow didn't twitch, and he let out a sigh of relief, then looked at the few people: "I told you, if I sent you, there probably wouldn't have been this kind of trouble."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

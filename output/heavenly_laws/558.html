        <h1>Chapter 558</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is this Purple Dream talking about?" </p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou furrowed his brows. "She said I've hidden a great venerable one within this city?"</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the serious expression on Purple Dream Hou's face at the end, Qingfan Hou might have directly concluded that Purple Dream Hou was just talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"A great venerable one?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou re-examined the formations within the city carefully a few times.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan City had long ago set up specialized formations to detect the depth and weight of life forces. If a powerful existence at the level of a great venerable one had infiltrated, Qingfan Hou would have sensed it immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Those puppets?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou looked at the numerous peak Sovereign realm puppets rampaging within the city, his mind stirring as he collected them all.</p><p></p><p>These puppets were specially used by the Purple Dream Domain to wreak havoc in Qingfan City, in order to conceal their true intentions. Qingfan Hou saw them and naturally dealt with them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems a significant event must have occurred in the city during the hundred breaths I was trapped in the dream."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou's eyes became deep and profound, and the Qingfan City within his vision began to "rewind" to the past.</p><p></p><p>As a great venerable level existence, his mastery over time was naturally very high, allowing him to easily "rewind" the time of an entire city.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only a "rewind", without the ability to change anything.</p><p></p><p>The time flowed backwards.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the point a hundred breaths ago.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qingfan City was completely calm.</p><p></p><p>Until the arrival of Purple Dream Hou's incarnation.</p><p></p><p>In the instant Qingfan Hou fell into the beautiful dream woven by Purple Dream Hou.</p><p></p><p>A large number of peak Sovereign realm puppets suddenly appeared in Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>"These puppets?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou paid no attention to these puppets, his gaze falling on the group of purple-haired women hiding in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Peak Sovereign realm puppets had limited destructive power, and when Qingfan Hou fell into the dream, he had already ordered his disciples to guard the core of the formations.</p><p></p><p>So Qingfan Hou did not feel these puppets would pose any threat.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after Qingfan Hou awakened, the damage these peak Sovereign puppets caused to Qingfan City was negligible.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the plan of Purple Dream? Are they the ones executing it?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou thought, those Sovereign puppets were just used to divert attention. The real plan was probably focused on this group of people.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou continued to observe.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he saw the purple-haired women and their group roam around various key formation nodes in Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled Qingfan Hou was that they only toured around once, and even when they approached the core of the formations, they did not take any action, staying for only a few breaths before quietly leaving.</p><p></p><p>"What are they trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou realized something was amiss. Purple Dream Hou had expended the incarnation containing her true self's origin power, and woven a beautiful dream that took tens of thousands of years, just to have her subordinates take a stroll around Qingfan City?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou had a vague guess.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the group of purple-haired women arrived in front of the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, this time they did not leave, but instead actively began to attack the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>"A group of Sovereigns wanting to make a move on my disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou sneered, the formations of the Fengtianyuan were specially adjusted by him, undoubtedly one of the most heavily defended areas in Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>With just over a dozen peak Sovereign realm experts?</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou had no worries at all.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the group of purple-haired women, seeing the defensive strength of the Fengtianyuan, immediately chose to give up.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a surprising scene unfolded that left Qingfan Hou astonished.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who had been staying well within the Fengtianyuan, suddenly came out on his own.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>But the next event that occurred was something that shook Qingfan Hou's heart tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually slapped a few times, killing those peak Sovereign realm experts, and even the incarnation of Purple Dream Hou that descended was slapped to death by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That was Purple Dream Hou, a great venerable level existence.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just an incarnation, it should not have been something that Sovereigns could easily handle.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of a great venerable, while it might not be able to crush the extremely powerful Sovereigns, should not have been so easily crushed in return.</p><p></p><p>Time returned to its normal flow.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Could my disciple be a great venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou felt it was unbelievable. The group of purple-haired women, and even Purple Dream Hou the great venerable, had only assumed that he, Qingfan Hou, had left a hidden great venerable in the city.</p><p></p><p>But as the master, he knew his own disciple best.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou truly had not done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was a disciple he had just recently accepted.</p><p></p><p>All of this was the truth.</p><p></p><p>He, Qingfan Hou, had no reason to lie about this.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>"My disciple is not a great venerable."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou suddenly realized, the formations in the city that detected the depth and weight of life forces had not given any warning.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was truly a great venerable, he would not have been oblivious to it.</p><p></p><p>"Not a great venerable, yet possessing such strength."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou fell into contemplation, rewinding the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>"Could he have awakened the Blazing Sun Divine Body so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou's expression changed, "Could it be the bloodline, the Blazing Sun bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, any being capable of condensing Blazing Sun Seedlings would have the Blazing Sun bloodline to varying degrees within them.</p><p></p><p>That is, the royal bloodline of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Blazing Sun bloodline in normal beings would be extremely diluted, almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>The reason the royal family of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom could rule the entire ancient kingdom was because they had a concentrated Blazing Sun bloodline that constantly maintained a certain level.</p><p></p><p>But there are always exceptions.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Blazing Sun royalty, there was a slim chance that other beings could experience a bloodline reversion.</p><p></p><p>After the reversion, the Blazing Sun bloodline would become much more potent. The specific characteristics would be the ability to more easily condense Blazing Sun Seedlings, and the ability to withstand the Blazing Sun's brilliance, with their own strength rapidly reaching the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the awakening speed of the Blazing Sun Divine Body would be terrifyingly fast, far surpassing normal beings, to the point of being unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>And the finally awakened Blazing Sun Divine Body would also be stronger than those awakened through normal means.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the above, beings with a concentrated Blazing Sun bloodline would have an extremely terrifying combat power, being unrivaled at the same realm, or even able to fight beyond their realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my disciple's bloodline has undergone a reversion? Has the Blazing Sun bloodline become extremely potent within him?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This explanation made sense, as it would explain why Lin Yuan could condense so many Blazing Sun Seedlings. As a being with an extremely concentrated Blazing Sun bloodline, condensing Blazing Sun Seedlings would be much easier for him.</p><p></p><p>As for why the detection of a great venerable level life force weight was not triggered, it was because Lin Yuan was not a great venerable, but a Sovereign realm being with a concentrated Blazing Sun bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"But to be able to display battle power almost on par with a great venerable at the Sovereign realm, the Blazing Sun bloodline in my disciple must be as potent as the core royal family of the ancient kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called fighting beyond one's realm was dependent on one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Fighting Sovereign against Sovereign was still possible, but Sovereign against great venerable? Extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Even among the Blazing Sun royal family, there were only a few who could achieve this feat.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that I, Qingfan, would be able to accept a disciple whose Blazing Sun bloodline is comparable to the core royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou felt deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a great venerable, the core royal family of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was far more important.</p><p></p><p>Each core royal family member had an extremely potent Blazing Sun bloodline, with terrifying combat power, and their growth would have almost no bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Even without cultivation, just basking in the Blazing Sun's brilliance, they could rapidly grow to the Sovereign realm, and as for the great venerable realm? It would indeed require some effort, but just a little push and they could reach it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qingfan Hou had expended countless resources and efforts to break through to the great venerable realm, but for the core royal family of the ancient kingdom? Of course, the talent and aptitude of the core royal family with their concentrated Blazing Sun bloodline was monstrous, but their limit was the great venerable realm. As for the Heavenly Venerable realm?</p><p></p><p>To become a Heavenly Venerable, relying on bloodline alone would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>However, even just reaching the great venerable realm, a core royal family member of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom would have a terrifying combat power, able to be unrivaled among great venerables, or even contend with Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"What luck I have."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Hou's thoughts were complex, having stumbled upon such a disciple destined to become unrivaled among great venerables in the future, Qingfan Hou almost felt like he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Fengtianyuan, </p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan slapped the incarnation of Purple Dream Hou to death, he saw Feng Wanxing who had just arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Feng."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan proactively greeted him, as he had gotten along well with this senior brother during his cultivation in the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing dared to respond when he heard Lin Yuan address him as senior brother. What he had just witnessed was too frightening.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Purple Dream Hou was crushed by Lin Yuan just like that? Feng Wanxing deduced that Purple Dream Hou's incarnation was likely the only one that dared to enter Qingfan City, with the true body staying outside.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was just an incarnation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is this an incarnation, also the incarnation of the Grand Ancestor, so easily shattered?</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, just now?" Feng Wanxing looked at Lin Yuan, carefully probing and asking: "Just now."</p><p></p><p>"Just now," Lin Yuan casually explained: "Some overlords of the Purple Dream Domain secretly infiltrated the Qingfan City, and they even wanted to make a move against me. The commotion inside the city should have been caused by them, so I directly took action to resolve them."</p><p></p><p>"Some overlords of the Purple Dream Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing looked around. Although he didn't know which overlords the Purple Dream Domain had sent to infiltrate, their strength was at least at the peak of the Overlord Realm if they dared to infiltrate at this time.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the Marquis of the Purple Dream also descended an incarnation and threatened me, making demands on me. How dare his incarnation be so bold?" Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of the Purple Dream?"</p><p></p><p>"So daring?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing only felt that the little junior brother in front of him had become very unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the usually quiet and low-key junior brother would have such strength.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, your strength?" Feng Wanxing swallowed.</p><p></p><p>"I just had a breakthrough." Lin Yuan had no intention of hiding it.</p><p></p><p>After the Blazing Sun Divine Body awakened, the resources Lin Yuan needed for subsequent cultivation could be said to be as vast as the mountains and seas. Even if he tried to hide his strength, he definitely couldn't hide the demand for cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it's better to openly display it.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's understanding of this Source World after staying here for so long, the existence at the Grand Ancestor level can basically dominate a region.</p><p></p><p>As long as they don't go to provoke the royal families of the major ancient countries, they can basically live a carefree life.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's current comprehensive strength has basically reached the Grand Ancestor threshold, and in some aspects, it is even stronger than ordinary Grand Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing had countless doubts in his heart, but he didn't know how to ask.</p><p></p><p>Just had a breakthrough? Able to easily slap the incarnation of a Grand Ancestor to death? Just then, a figure in a scarlet red robe appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"My lord." Feng Wanxing saw this and immediately bowed in salute.</p><p></p><p>"You can leave first." The Qingfan Lord glanced at Feng Wanxing.</p><p></p><p>In the time reversal scene, he also saw his senior disciple's concern for the little junior brother.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he didn't pursue the problem of the disciple leaving the core of the formation without permission.</p><p></p><p>"Master." Lin Yuan said to the Qingfan Lord.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Qingfan Lord, he still had great respect.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the cultivation in the Fanshen Pavilion without any distractions, Lin Yuan's growth to his current strength would have taken several times longer, and there's no guarantee that no accidents would happen.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's go in and talk." The Qingfan Lord nodded, and then walked into the Fanshen Pavilion with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect your Blazing Sun bloodline to be so rich." In the Fanshen Pavilion, the Qingfan Lord said with a sigh as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun bloodline?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred, and he immediately knew that the Qingfan Lord should have attributed his strength to the Blazing Sun bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Blazing Sun bloodline, Lin Yuan had also learned a lot about it in the countless ancient scriptures and inheritances in the Fanshen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan felt that he no longer needed to explain too much. Everything could be attributed to the Blazing Sun bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either, I just feel that the more I cultivate, the easier it becomes," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Your situation of mid-way ancestral return is naturally different from those core royal families who have been cultivated since childhood," the Qingfan Lord shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Even among the royal families of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the blood concentration reaching the core level is extremely rare. Lin Yuan's case of suddenly causing the blood concentration to surge through ancestral return is also only a few examples since the existence of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan followed the Qingfan Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>"What are your plans for the future?" The Qingfan Lord looked at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>"What does the master think I should do?" Lin Yuan immediately threw the question back.</p><p></p><p>"With your blood concentration reaching the level of the core royal families, you should go to the imperial capital as soon as possible and integrate into the royal families," the Qingfan Lord said, pausing for a moment, "but you have no foundation in the royal families, and returning there rashly is not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"Not a good thing?" Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Even within the royal families, there are disputes and factions. Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun bloodline is concentrated to the core level, but he does not belong to any main lineage of the royal families. Suddenly returning would involve too much.</p><p></p><p>It's like a commoner prince returning to the palace, wanting to inherit the throne? It definitely won't be that smooth.</p><p></p><p>"So I suggest you continue to stay in Qingfan City, and when you cross into the Grand Ancestor Realm, then return to the imperial capital," the Qingfan Lord said.</p><p></p><p>At least at that time, as a Grand Ancestor realm core royal family member, his combat power would be terrifying, and he would have the ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll listen to the master." Lin Yuan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan didn't want to integrate into the so-called royal families, because he didn't rely on the Blazing Sun bloodline to reach his current strength.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the imperial capital and integrating into the royal families would probably require a blood concentration test. At that time, Lin Yuan would definitely be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if the Qingfan Lord asked Lin Yuan to return to the imperial capital, Lin Yuan would "disappear" during the return to the imperial capital, and start cultivating again in a new place.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he can come and go freely in the surrounding major domains and ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>"As for your identity..." The Qingfan Lord fell into thought. "The core royal family identity cannot be exposed."</p><p></p><p>A core royal family member with an extremely rich Blazing Sun bloodline, if he doesn't hide in the imperial capital, he will inevitably face assassination attempts from the surrounding ancient countries, and even Venerable-level experts may take action.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just announce to the outside that you are a disciple I took in many years ago, and I only recently brought you back after you broke through to the Grand Ancestor Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Lord said. This explanation is quite reasonable. The Qingfan Lord occasionally roamed the Qingfan Domain, and when he passed by the Yu family, he sensed Lin Yuan's talent and secretly took him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>As for the time not matching up? Vu Yan is not even 500 years old? A Grand Ancestor level expert can easily create a small world and accelerate the flow of time, with the rules fluctuating close to the outside world. In the small world, many rules can be mapped from the outside world. And the vast Blazing Sun Ancient Country has some strange and dangerous places where the flow of time is also very fast.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The main thing is that he has displayed Grand Ancestor level combat power. Even if the Qingfan Lord wants to suppress it, the Purple Dream Domain will probably investigate Lin Yuan's identity. In this case, it's better to actively create an identity for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After that, the Qingfan Lord gave Lin Yuan a few more reminders and then left.</p><p></p><p>In the Fanshen Pavilion, Lin Yuan fell into thought.</p><p></p><p>"Core royal family of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It is said that beings with blood concentration reaching the core royal family level have unparalleled combat power, with the potential to reverse the Grand Ancestor in the Overlord Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the Qingfan Lord determined that Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun bloodline is extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>Except for the core royal families, who can display Grand Ancestor level combat power without reaching the Grand Ancestor Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Thirteenth-Grade bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Overlord reversing the Grand Ancestor is equivalent to standing shoulder to shoulder with the Chaos Venerable in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>At least so far, Lin Yuan has never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World, there are indeed clues.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm not an Overlord." Lin Yuan thought to himself. His true realm is the Parting the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Parting the Dao to reverse the Grand Ancestor? Even with the Thirteenth-Grade bloodline, it's impossible.</p><p></p><p>As Qingfan City gradually calmed down, news about Lin Yuan began to circulate rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Fanshen Pavilion, Lin Yuan burst forth with Grand Ancestor strength, decisively killing the invading experts from the Purple Dream Domain, exposing the Purple Dream Domain's plotting, and even shattering the incarnation of the Marquis of the Purple Dream.</p><p></p><p>This news caused a stir among the various power families of the Qingfan Domain.</p><p></p><p>"This, this, this..." The disciples of the Qingfan Lord were the first to receive this news, and they were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Their little junior brother is a Grand Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, is this news true or false?" Some disciples immediately found the senior disciple Feng Wanxing to verify.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. I saw it with my own eyes," Feng Wanxing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he still had many doubts, but after hearing the Qingfan Lord's explanation, he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Qingfan Lord would personally bring the little junior brother back. It turns out that he had already taken him as a disciple many years ago.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't call me big brother anymore," Feng Wanxing thought for a moment and immediately instructed.</p><p></p><p>Among the disciples of the Qingfan Lord, strength is respected. Originally, they didn't know, but now that they know Lin Yuan is a Grand Ancestor, Feng Wanxing no longer dares to let them call him big brother.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 465: Five Hundred Years of Wandering (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal City of Cangwu, outside the Immortal Abode District, stood a palace called the Flying Immortal Palace. This was the place in the Immortal City that specialized in the buying and selling of immortal abodes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the owners of the immortal abodes had to return to this palace every million years to exchange the jade tokens that allowed them to enter and exit their abodes. This was done to confirm the identities of the immortals residing in the abodes. </p><p></p><p>The cultivation environments of the immortal abodes in the Immortal City were too favorable, and after many abode owners passed away, their jade tokens fell into the hands of others. With these tokens, even those who were not the true owners could enter the abodes and cultivate. The exchange of the tokens every million years was to reaffirm the identities of the current residents.</p><p></p><p>The Flying Immortal Palace was divided into four floors, covering a vast area. The first floor entrance saw a large number of Daxing-level immortals coming and going, corresponding to D-grade immortal abodes that even ordinary Daxing immortals could muster the resources to purchase.</p><p></p><p>The second floor entrance saw far fewer immortals passing through, corresponding to C-grade immortal abodes that only peak Daxing immortals or Jinxian could afford. As Jinxian, they already had a certain status even within the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>As for the third and fourth floor entrances, they were eerily quiet. The third floor corresponded to B-grade abodes, which only the more powerful Jinxian could purchase. The fourth floor corresponded to A-grade abodes, the highest level allowed by the Immortal City's rules, which only Yuanxian had the means to buy. A small number of top-tier Jinxian could also take up residence there, though they were even rarer than the Yuanxian.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around and directly ascended to the fourth floor of the Flying Immortal Palace. As he entered, two alluring female immortal attendants came to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Lord," they said respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Although the fourth floor of the Flying Immortal Palace was not restricted, the immortals daring to come up here must have sufficient confidence in themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I've lost my jade token for my immortal abode and have come to have a new one issued," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The A-grade immortal abode token in the Immortal City of Cangwu had naturally fallen into the hands of demonic beasts after the death of Yunzhenzi. However, the abodes in the major immortal cities were bound to the identities of the corresponding immortals, and the specific verification method was through the aura of their true spiritual essence. Even if the jade token was lost, a replacement could be issued based on the matching spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>The female immortal attendant was inwardly startled, her attitude becoming even more reverential. Going to the fourth floor of the Flying Immortal Palace to have a jade token reissued? Didn't that mean the lost token corresponded to an A-grade immortal abode? </p><p></p><p>In other words, the young immortal lord before her not only inquired about purchasing an A-grade abode, but already possessed one?</p><p></p><p>"Cangwu A3654-37," Lin Yuan directly stated the abode's serial number.</p><p></p><p>This immortal abode was one of the few top-tier ones even for Yunzhenzi.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, Immortal Lord," the female attendant quickly checked the detailed information on all the abodes recorded in the Flying Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Lord, please infuse your true spiritual essence into this soul stone," the other female attendant said respectfully, presenting a gray stone.</p><p></p><p>The gray stone was a soul stone, specially used to replicate and record the aura of one's true spiritual essence. When Yunzhenzi had purchased the A-grade abode, he had imprinted his own spiritual essence aura onto it.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to have the jade token reissued, he needed to match the spiritual essence aura within the soul stone.</p><p></p><p>Humming softly, Lin Yuan focused his mind, and a wisp of Yunzhenzi's Yuanxian consciousness flowed into the soul stone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the female attendant holding the soul stone said respectfully, "The conditions for reissuing the token have been met. Please wait a moment, Immortal Lord."</p><p></p><p>She then reverently stepped away, only to return shortly after.</p><p></p><p>"Here is the immortal abode jade token," the female attendant said, humbly presenting the white jade token to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan nodded, taking the token and turning to leave the Flying Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the palace, Lin Yuan directly entered the Immortal Abode District. The district was shrouded in many deadly formations - any immortal who did not meet the requirements would be instantly slaughtered if they dared to trespass.</p><p></p><p>Holding the immortal abode jade token, Lin Yuan naturally had the qualifications to enter the district.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space on one of the palace's floors, a middle-aged man was in deep meditation. He was the Palace Master of the Flying Immortal Palace, one of the major figures in the Immortal City of Cangwu.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The middle-aged man suddenly opened his eyes, seeming to have sensed something. "The jade token for the Cangwu A3654-37 immortal abode has been successfully reissued?"</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master," a figure materialized beside him and nodded. "Just now, someone has entered that A-grade immortal abode."</p><p></p><p>Any A-grade immortal abode in the Immortal City of Cangwu was well-known, belonging either to a specific Yuanxian or one of the top-tier Jinxian with a strong chance of breaking through to the Yuanxian realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, that A-grade immortal abode has been dormant for nearly ten million years?" The Flying Immortal Palace Master's face took on a contemplative expression. "The owner of that abode was Yunzhenzi."</p><p></p><p>As the Palace Master, he had the authority to check the information on every immortal abode.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cloud True Lord? The rumors say he perished in the last great war between immortals and demons, yet he's still alive."</p><p></p><p>The figure beside him couldn't help but exclaim in surprise upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Cloud True Lord was renowned among the many Jade Immortals. </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for facing the encirclement of over a dozen demonic beasts, with Cloud True Lord's abilities, even if he couldn't defeat them, he could have escaped unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the pollution from the Demonic Abyss didn't completely destroy Cloud True Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Celestial Palace nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>He quickly deduced what must have happened.</p><p></p><p>Tens of millions of years ago, Cloud True Lord's true body was destroyed by numerous demonic beasts, and the resulting pollution erased most of his resurrection methods.</p><p></p><p>But with Cloud True Lord's abilities, he still had one or two deeply hidden resurrection techniques that resisted the pollution. </p><p></p><p>After tens of millions of years, those one or two resurrection methods were finally fulfilled, allowing Cloud True Lord to return.</p><p></p><p>Such occurrences were not uncommon among the Jade Immortals. </p><p></p><p>How could those who cultivated to the Jade Immortal realm die so easily? They all had various backup plans in place.</p><p></p><p>As for these resurrected Jade Immortals, the Patriarch of the Immortal Celestial Palace had no particular thoughts or intentions towards them. As the supreme leader of the Immortal City, his status far exceeded most Jade Immortals, so Cloud True Lord's wealth held no interest for him.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that Cloud True Lord didn't die. The great war between immortals and demons is about to begin again, and the number of demonic overlords has clearly increased recently."</p><p></p><p>"If Cloud True Lord can fully recover his strength before the great war, he could help alleviate some of the pressure on the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Celestial Palace muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The war between immortals and demons was undoubtedly the most cruel war in the immortal realm. </p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of immortals, it was no different from a meat grinder.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortals at least had the ability to resurrect.</p><p></p><p>But for the Gold Immortals and those of even lower realms, they were basically unable to withstand the pollution of the demonic beasts. Once they died, it was complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The resurrection methods of the Gold Immortals could hardly resist the pollution of the demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Every great war between immortals and demons, countless immortals would perish, and many Jade Immortals would also disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take over the Grade-A Immortal Abode under Cloud True Lord's identity. I don't think I can hide it from the upper echelons of the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew all of Cloud True Lord's memories and was clearly aware of the information about the Abode's owner. To the higher-ups of Cangwu Immortal City, this was no secret.</p><p></p><p>"But what does it matter? I am Cloud True Lord now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was unconcerned. Possessing Cloud True Lord's Jade Immortal consciousness was equivalent to taking Cloud True Lord hostage. </p><p></p><p>Combined with his knowledge of the latter's memories, who could question his identity?</p><p></p><p>As a Jade Immortal, even if Cloud True Lord was weakened, his Jade Immortal consciousness would be difficult for others at the same level to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Those capable of suppressing a Jade Immortal's consciousness would not bother to impersonate Cloud True Lord's identity.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current abilities, unless the Dao Ancestor intervened, no outsider could see through his true nature.</p><p></p><p>And the Dao Ancestor? What an exalted existence, high above all others. How could he possibly care about the affairs of a mere Jade Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Even if the Dao Ancestor did take notice, Lin Yuan could simply abandon this Solar Divine Consciousness without much loss.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Immortal Abode's jade token, Lin Yuan quickly entered the Grade-A Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>This was an expansive world, nearly a million miles in size, permeated with almost tangible immortal qi.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary mortals living in such an environment, even without cultivation, their physical bodies would gradually transform into those of immortals over time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not particularly interested in the swirling immortal qi.</p><p></p><p>This so-called immortal qi was merely a form of energy. With the abundant resources prepared by Cloud True Lord, Lin Yuan did not lack the means to absorb and circulate it in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared in the center of the Immortal Abode, raising his head to gaze at the sky.</p><p></p><p>There, a massive, irregular rift could be faintly discerned, and the dense, undulating waves of the Dao Principles emanating from within were visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"This rift must be the connection to the source of the Immortal Realm, opened by the Dao Ancestor himself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts surged. Even at the peak of his power, he would not be able to tear open this rift.</p><p></p><p>The source of the main universe was too powerful. Even Twelve Realms Ultimates could not approach it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal Realm? While it was close to the main universe, it was still only a proximity.</p><p></p><p>A Twelve Realms Ultimate exerting their full strength could still forcibly open a passage from the source of the Immortal Realm to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Among the various Immortal Abodes in Cangwu Immortal City, only the Grade-A Immortal Abodes could directly face this irregular rift and closely sense the undulating Dao Principle waves emanating from the source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Grade-B and Grade-C Immortal Abodes, they could only indirectly sense the Dao Principle waves manifesting from the irregular rift.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation environment here is even better than the main universe. At least in the comprehension of the Dao Principles, it is strikingly clear." Lin Yuan's mind was slightly invigorated.</p><p></p><p>While the Immortal Realm was not as powerful as the main universe, it was now virtually fully open to Lin Yuan, and in terms of Dao Principle comprehension, the main universe could not compare to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With such an environment, I cannot guarantee Chaotic Dao Principles, but as for the Seven Realms of Time and Space? The time it takes to awaken them should be far shorter than in the main universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very confident.</p><p></p><p>"I shall begin my cultivation now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly sat down in a cross-legged position and began to sense the undulating Dao Principle waves emanating from the irregular rift in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed like water, and before he knew it, five hundred years had passed.</p>

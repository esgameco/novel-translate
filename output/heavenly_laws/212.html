            <p>Chapter 212: Three Hundred Years Later! Demon Ancestor Tree? No, That's the World Tree Sheltering All Living Beings (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years is not a long time on a global scale. However, for the creatures within the world, it can be considered quite lengthy. Especially for ordinary humans, three hundred years probably span several generations.</p><p></p><p>In these three hundred years, the Tianqing World has undergone earth-shattering changes. First, the popularization of martial arts cultivation methods. The original cultivation system in Tianqing World had a high threshold, and there was a tacit understanding among the major forces to monopolize it together. This led to the lower-class people of Tianqing World being cut off from the path of ascension, unable to touch the upper-level path in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>It was only three or four hundred years ago that the martial arts cultivation system began to spread. Compared to the world's original cultivation system, the threshold for the martial arts cultivation system is shockingly low. As long as you are a person, you are eligible to cultivate martial arts. Of course, the specific level of cultivation depends on yourself. But at least it gives ordinary people a chance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the biggest change in Tianqing World in the past three hundred years is the ancient tree that has grown to who knows how many tens of thousands of zhang, like a pillar of the sky. This ancient tree is the sacred tree of Tianqing World. Every year, the powerful figures of Tianqing World personally come to the foot of the ancient tree to pay homage.</p><p></p><p>As for other creatures in Tianqing World, in principle, within a radius of several hundred thousand li around the sacred tree, no idle people are allowed to stay. But the sacred tree is merciful and does not mind creatures as insignificant as ants approaching it.</p><p></p><p>And just a few thousand li away from the sacred tree, a group of people came here to observe the sacred tree from afar. At a distance of several thousand li, no matter what you look at, it should become extremely tiny. But when this group of people looked at the sacred tree at this moment, they still felt majestic and magnificent, unable to look directly at it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the sacred tree. The reason why our Tianqing World was able to end that devastating war hundreds of years ago is by relying on the great power of the sacred tree," said the middle-aged man at the head, who should be playing the role of a "master," introducing to more than a dozen young people behind him.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard about it."</p><p>"The sacred tree is too great."</p><p></p><p>The other teenagers nodded in turn, their expressions full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"But..." At this moment, a teenager looked a little hesitant, but finally plucked up the courage to say, "I heard some people say that the sacred tree has a great relationship with the initiator of that war hundreds of years agoâ€”the Demon Ancestor Tree."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the teenager stole a glance at his master timidly. In fact, this kind of statement is not uncommon in Tianqing World. Many cultivators are still alive now, and they still remember the image of the Demon Ancestor Tree. The sacred tree that all living beings worship now looks somewhat similar to that Demon Ancestor Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Ancestor Tree? Nonsense!" The middle-aged man's tone was angry. He had also heard such statements, but he always sneered at them. "Let me ask you, what was the purpose of the foreign evil god who wanted to invade our Tianqing World back then?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man looked at the other teenagers and asked in a deep voice. "That foreign evil god wanted to destroy our world."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the foreign evil god was too hateful. It wanted to devour everything, including us."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the foreign evil god was defeated, otherwise we would be miserable."</p><p></p><p>This time, the answers of all the teenagers were surprisingly consistent. "In that case, if the sacred tree is really related to the foreign evil god, would we still have time to stand here?" The middle-aged man said with a resounding voice, "I don't care how some people defile the sacred tree, but you should at least have your own judgment."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the sacred tree, would those high-ranking people open up resources to us?"</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the sacred tree, there would be no spread of the martial arts cultivation system at all. How many of you would be able to embark on the path of cultivation in the end?"</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the sacred tree, would there be such peace and stability in our Tianqing World for the past few hundred years? Without any turmoil?"</p><p></p><p>The more the middle-aged man spoke, the more excited he became. He had many elders who had lived through that era hundreds of years ago. When he was a child, he heard the elders chatting and learned that before the war with the foreign evil god broke out, the Tianqing World was very chaotic, with the major forces fighting endlessly. The lofty Tianqing Sect looked down on all living beings, having the ability to solve the chaos but not wanting to, under the guise of "governing by doing nothing."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's words made the teenagers fall into deep thought. Indeed, these words made a lot of sense. If the sacred tree was really related to the Demon Ancestor Tree, then now, the entire Tianqing World, not to mention being destroyed by the sacred tree, should at least be enslaved by it. Would children like them still be qualified to come here and observe the sacred tree's true body?</p><p></p><p>This is completely opposite to the description of the Demon Ancestor Tree. Although the teenagers are young, they also know that the martial arts cultivation system they practice originates from the sacred tree. This is how they have the qualification to cultivate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Under the will of the sacred tree, everything in the current Tianqing World is thriving. Even the most ordinary people have the ability to survive. All living beings have the possibility to pursue a better life. How could such a sacred tree have anything to do with the cruel and violent Demon Ancestor Tree?</p><p></p><p>"I don't care why those people are desperately questioning the sacred tree, and what good it does for them to do so." The middle-aged man took a deep breath and continued, "But it's ridiculous to say that the sacred tree is the Demon Ancestor Tree."</p><p></p><p>"How could the sacred tree be the Demon Ancestor Tree? It is the world tree that shelters us living beings." The middle-aged man looked at the sacred tree in the distance again, his eyes filled with a worshipful gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Damn it, the enemy is actually hiding among us."</p><p>"From now on, whoever dares to slander the sacred tree will be against me."</p><p></p><p>The teenagers spoke one after another. They were not clear about the war of the foreign evil god's invasion hundreds of years ago. But they could feel that the life they are living now is very good, and all of this comes from the sacred tree.</p><p></p><p>It's a very simple principle. What you say is not important; what matters is what you do. The current prosperous Tianqing World is quickly crushing those rumors and gossip that question the sacred tree.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the sacred tree, this place is close to the natural barrier of the Tianqing World. If you go up a little further, you may leave the scope of the Tianqing World. At this time, on the main trunk of the sacred tree, a figure was sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"It's been three hundred years." This figure was none other than Lin Yuan. To be precise, it was the "avatar" derived from the demon seed belonging to the Demon Ancestor Tree.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the Demon Ancestor Tree, Lin Yuan obtained all the abilities of the original Demon Ancestor Tree, including the demon seed avatar. Although Lin Yuan became a demon tree this time when he crossed over, he was still essentially human. So he directly activated the demon seed avatar to form a human body and resided in it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, most of the innate abilities of the Primordial Demon Tree are endowed within the Primordial Demon Tree itself," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Demon Seed needs to be formed from the seeds of the Demon Tree. As Lin Yuan returns to the main world and reverts to his human form, he cannot condense Demon Seeds and thus cannot use methods like "Parasitism".</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan is willing to give up his human body and completely transform into the Primordial Demon Tree, it may be possible to inherit everything. </p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current understanding of the Primordial Demon Tree, he can definitely create a technique for transforming the essence of life through his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>This way, when he returns to the main world, he can activate this transformation technique and transform towards the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>And according to the Human Alliance's cognition, the definition of humans does not depend on the physical body, but on the soul.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan's soul remains unchanged, even if he becomes the Primordial Demon Tree, he still belongs to the human race.</p><p></p><p>However, the cost of doing so is too great. First of all, in terms of race, the Primordial Demon Tree cannot cultivate the martial way.</p><p></p><p>This would turn Lin Yuan's painstaking efforts from his past six crossings into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, for the Qingqing World, the Primordial Demon Tree is a behemoth that requires the power of an entire realm to resist.</p><p></p><p>But in the main world, it's not so unsolvable.</p><p></p><p>Supreme bloodline lifeforms like the Starry Sea Kun Peng, as well as those other powerful special lifeforms, are still much stronger than the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>As for the Primordial Demon Tree's many abilities, such as the most meritorious "Parasitism" method.</p><p></p><p>It may be unsolvable in the Qingqing World, but in the main world, it definitely can't be considered terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The so-called parasitism affects the will and soul. Not to mention others, the three goddesses who observe all humans at all times can analyze abnormalities through daily behavioral details.</p><p></p><p>"However, if you really want to continue using the abilities of the Primordial Demon Tree, there are still ways," Lin Yuan stroked his chin and thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The simplest way is to spend some Origin Power for Breaking Realms to bring a seed of the Primordial Demon Tree to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan himself can cultivate it. When it grows a little, he can control it through controlling methods.</p><p></p><p>For the human civilization of the main world, the Primordial Demon Tree can at most be considered a rare special lifeform.</p><p></p><p>And those high-level evolved beings of human civilization basically all control some special lifeforms for their own use.</p><p></p><p>It's extremely simple for Lin Yuan to control the Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can even train the Primordial Demon Tree into his own "avatar" for better control.</p><p></p><p>"Bringing the entire Primordial Demon Tree back would consume an unimaginable amount of Origin Power for Breaking Realms," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Realms Gate has the function of bringing items from the traversed world back to the main world, which can be achieved by consuming Origin Power for Breaking Realms.</p><p></p><p>As for how much Origin Power for Breaking Realms is needed, it depends on the size and level of the item being brought back.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tree seed is only the size of a fist, so how much cost would it take to bring it back?</p><p></p><p>In three hundred years, Lin Yuan has exclusive access to the resources of the entire Qingqing World, and his harvest can be said to be extremely amazing.</p><p></p><p>The first is the nourishment of the Origin Essence Metal.</p><p></p><p>This cosmic treasure from the main world is cherished even by the invincible Eighth Stage Scarlet Kun Peng Star Lord, who fought with several same-level alien powerhouses for it and even attracted the attention of Ninth Stage aliens.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan solved the Primordial Demon Tree, he spent a wisp of Origin Power for Breaking Realms to bring it from the main world into this realm.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the reason for doing so was to nurture the Origin Essence Metal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan did not rely on his own body to nurture it.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Primordial Demon Tree tends towards evil and chaos. If it were used to nurture the Origin Essence Metal, it would not only waste time and energy but might also affect the formation of the Origin Essence Metal.</p><p></p><p>The place where Lin Yuan nurtured the Origin Essence Metal was inside the Origin Ocean of the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Ocean of a world is extremely pure, simply the best place to nurture Origin Essence Metal.</p><p></p><p>Weapons like the World Sword are nurtured in the world's Origin Ocean.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan placing the Origin Essence Metal in the Origin Ocean of the Qingqing World to nurture would indeed have an impact on the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>But the impact is not significant, and Lin Yuan would nurture it for at most a few hundred years. Once Lin Yuan returns, the Qingqing World will have plenty of time to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down and vaguely saw a vast Origin Ocean, with a piece of metal floating and sinking within it. From afar, the shape of this metal already resembled a "bell".</p><p></p><p>"The world's Origin Ocean has no life imprint, so it can replace me in nourishing the Origin Essence Metal," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the nourishment of Origin Essence Metal can only be done by oneself.</p><p></p><p>Because if the power of others is used to nurture it, it will be tainted with their life imprint, and it will be unclear who the Origin Essence Metal ultimately belongs to.</p><p></p><p>But the world's Origin Ocean doesn't have this hidden danger. The world's consciousness is similar to instinct and doesn't have a so-called life imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Evolution System"</p><p></p><p>"Although I haven't cultivated the Martial Dao Evolution System, my realm has also been improving during the process of pioneering the Seventh Stage Chapter. Now I'm at the limit of the Seventh Stage. As long as I return to the main world and take the Scarlet Spirit Liquid, I can quickly reach the peak of the Seventh Stage King Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have the corresponding realm, Lin Yuan wouldn't have the ability to pioneer a complete Seventh Stage Chapter at all.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, there have only been stories of high-level evolution scholars taking the high ground and pioneering low-level evolution paths. There has never been a case of low-level evolvers pioneering high-level evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Because if your realm is not high enough, you simply can't perceive the essence of cultivation, let alone pioneer it.</p><p></p><p>"1,133 types of core spatial models"</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, there seemed to be a silver ocean rippling. In three hundred years, Lin Yuan had comprehended 1,133 types of core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Mind you, these are core spatial models that expound on certain aspects of the essence of spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>Even the Scarlet Kun Peng Star Lord, with the aid of his Starry Sea Kun Peng true body's perception of spatial laws, has yet to comprehend all the core spatial models to this day.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan being able to comprehend over a thousand types of core spatial models at the Seventh Stage is simply monstrous and prodigious.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder to what extent these many spatial model insights can expand my inner world," Lin Yuan's expression was somewhat expectant.</p><p></p><p>The size of the inner world, in addition to requiring a sufficiently powerful physical body to sustain it, mainly depends on one's own insight into spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>The deeper the insight into spatial laws, the larger the inner world and the more world power that can be mobilized.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue cultivating and comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, several vast consciousnesses.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly descended from the distant outer void to the outside of the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

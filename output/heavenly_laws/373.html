        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn. </p><p></p><p>According to the six-armed figure's description of the 'low-dimensional space', Lin Yuan was almost certain that the 'white paper' was the 'low-dimensional space'.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you seen the 'low-dimensional space'?" the six-armed figure asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The 'low-dimensional space' involved the exploration of even lower dimensions. Even the Xuanhuang Emperor had not obtained a complete low-dimensional space back then.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void had gone through eon after eon of universal cycles, with too many wondrous treasures vanishing into the past.</p><p></p><p>As for such a miraculous object as the 'low-dimensional space', perhaps it could only be left behind in the depths of those massive perilous grounds. </p><p></p><p>It was merely a possibility that the Xuanhuang Emperor had explored many of those massive perilous grounds back then, only obtaining some intelligence about the 'low-dimensional space'.</p><p></p><p>As for the true low-dimensional space, he had no chance to witness it.</p><p></p><p>"I not only saw it," said Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"One of my subdivided spirits even fell into it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly described what had happened. There was no need to hide anything from the six-armed figure, whom he could fully trust.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you mean that along with you falling into the low-dimensional space, there were also a massive number of other experts?" The six-armed figure's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded. "The number should exceed one billion."</p><p></p><p>The A098 Alien Battlefield was a massive alien battlefield where a large number of experts would station during normal periods. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention that before the 'white paper' descended, various major forces were about to ignite a highly intense battlefield, continuously gathering experts from all sides.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly estimated that on this battlefield alone, there were probably over three hundred experts at the eleventh level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>There were twenty million experts at the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>Adding up the experts from the eighth and ninth levels, the number approached one billion.</p><p></p><p>This was just the number of experts themselves, not including things like puppets and the like.</p><p></p><p>For example, the insect race experts were adept at cultivating large numbers of insect race warriors, but these insect warriors without independent consciousness were not counted in the number of experts.</p><p></p><p>"One billion?"</p><p></p><p>"The low-dimensional space is just a simple space, how could it instantly accommodate one billion lives?" The six-armed figure was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In the intelligence about the 'low-dimensional space' that the Xuanhuang Emperor had obtained, the number of lives that a normal low-dimensional space, whether for entertainment or gambling, could accommodate at the same time was extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>At most, it would not exceed one hundred.</p><p></p><p>As for one billion? The foundational nature of the low-dimensional space was far inferior to the normal chaotic void, it could never sustain so many lives.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's expression turned solemn. "Master, I suspect that the low-dimensional space you fell into is one of the initial low-dimensional spaces from the era of those near-perfect temporal existences, which were created at the cost of immense sacrifices and the exhaustion of infinite resources by those near-perfect temporal existences."</p><p></p><p>The low-dimensional space originated from the exploration of dimensions by those near-perfect temporal existences.</p><p></p><p>The 'low-dimensional spaces' that spread in later times were all imitations and replicas of those initial low-dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>"The initial low-dimensional spaces?" Lin Yuan's expression showed slight puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the six-armed figure continued, "The Emperor did not understand much about the initial low-dimensional spaces, only knowing that they contained opportunities bestowed by those near-perfect temporal existences."</p><p></p><p>"Lives that fall into these low-dimensional spaces, as long as they meet the conditions, can receive blessings."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure said.</p><p></p><p>"How to leave?" Lin Yuan asked the key question.</p><p></p><p>"The method of leaving should not be difficult to discover. Master, if you explore more of the low-dimensional space, you will probably find out," the six-armed figure said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the white paper world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still sitting cross-legged in that narrow room.</p><p></p><p>Through his conversations with the peak experts Xia Qinzhi, the spirit of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, and the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, he had made some basic judgments about his current situation.</p><p></p><p>First, if his Sun Element Spirit were to die in this two-dimensional world, he would lose this spirit root from the source.</p><p></p><p>Second, there should be a way to leave, but smoothly leaving would not be so easy. Leaving this low-dimensional space midway would incur severe punishment, and he might have to defeat the other lives that fell in to be able to leave.</p><p></p><p>Third, as long as he could meet certain requirements, he would be able to receive blessings from the creator of this two-dimensional world, the near-perfect temporal existence.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, the flow of time was different from the main universe, with a ratio of about one hundred to one.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, for every year that passed in the main universe, one hundred years would pass in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current focus was on leaving this two-dimensional world. As for whether he could receive blessings, that was not within his considerations.</p><p></p><p>"Being in this two-dimensional world, the methods of increasing strength in the main universe are ninety-nine percent useless," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad races of the main universe, whether it was human civilization or other races, the increase in strength was inclined towards comprehending various rules.</p><p></p><p>By borrowing the power of rules, one could easily unleash strength far exceeding one's own limits.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the comprehension of rules reached a certain level, one could open an inner world within the body, and by relying on the power of the inner world, one's strength could undergo a hundredfold or thousandfold increase.</p><p></p><p>But here?</p><p></p><p>Rules?</p><p></p><p>There were no rules.</p><p></p><p>Inner worlds?</p><p></p><p>Having lost the support of spatial dimensions, there was no such thing as opening an inner world. Lin Yuan's inner world had been compressed into a sheet of paper.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in this world, there were only two ways to increase strength.</p><p></p><p>One was the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the physical body, the stronger one's strength would be.</p><p></p><p>This was the most primitive power comparison.</p><p></p><p>The other was skill.</p><p></p><p>Under absolute power, skill was useless.</p><p></p><p>But if the power was equal, or the gap was not large, the side with higher skill would certainly have a stronger overall strength.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan did not know what the conditions for leaving this two-dimensional world were.</p><p></p><p>But increasing his strength was definitely not wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial dao evolution is adept at the physical body. It's just that in this two-dimensional world, the method of enhancing the physical body is completely different from the main universe," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the near-perfect world existences created the 'low-dimensional spaces', these kinds of 'spaces' had been widely spread and used for competitions of 'comprehension' or gambling.</p><p></p><p>This was because for lives within the 'low-dimensional spaces', their previous cultivation methods were basically useless. To increase their strength, they had to create new cultivation methods suitable for this 'low-dimensional space' from scratch.</p><p></p><p>"With my transcendent comprehension, creating a cultivation method suitable for this world does not present any difficulty," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not underestimate the ideas of the other experts who had fallen into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Especially those eleventh-level existences - at the same level, Lin Yuan believed that no one could match his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But compared to higher-level existences, from a lofty perspective, the gap between them would inevitably narrow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, having lost the empowerment of the rules, the upper limit of this two-dimensional world would certainly not be high.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly," Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Since he had fallen into this two-dimensional world, he could only take it one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what's outside the room," Lin Yuan steadied his mind, stood up, and pushed open the wooden door.</p><p></p><p>Outside was lush greenery, and in the distance there was a stream where a middle-aged man with dark skin was fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Wah kah kah," the middle-aged man exclaimed when he saw Lin Yuan come out of the room, and immediately walked over, speaking in a language Lin Yuan could not understand.</p><p></p><p>"A brand new language?" Lin Yuan carefully listened and observed the changes in the middle-aged man's expression as he spoke each tone.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he tentatively spoke a few sentences himself, continuing to observe the middle-aged man's reactions. After about three or four minutes of this, he was more or less able to communicate normally with the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>Although everything of Lin Yuan's was suppressed in this two-dimensional world, his main spirit was still in the main universe, allowing him to share memories.</p><p></p><p>With a tenth-level existence's 'speed of thought' and his transcendent comprehension, learning the language of this world was like child's play for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he were not in this two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan could have silently read all of the middle-aged man's memories, which would have been far more efficient than this language communication.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying that two days ago, countless 'meteors' fell from the sky, and one of those 'meteors' happened to fall nearby. You went to investigate and found me?" Lin Yuan conversed with the middle-aged man, his expression contemplative.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'meteors' should be the experts from the battlefield who had been drawn into the white paper world like him.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, by continuously guiding the middle-aged man, Lin Yuan roughly obtained the basic information about this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>From the middle-aged man's perspective, he lived on a vast, boundless continent.</p><p></p><p>The way of life on this continent was extremely backward.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Most lived in the form of tribes as gathering places. </p><p></p><p>Occasionally there would be some cities, and these cities already represented extremely powerful forces, rumored to be presided over by the great 'Shaman Kings'.</p><p></p><p>The 'Shaman King' was the strongest existence the middle-aged man had come to understand, capable of easily splitting mountains and rocks, terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"My luck isn't too bad," Lin Yuan glanced at the middle-aged man, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>At least when the middle-aged man discovered him, he didn't have any ill intentions towards him.  </p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence Lin Yuan had just obtained from Xia Qin and the powerful beings, many powerful ones who fell into this two-dimensional world found themselves in very difficult situations after arriving.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful ones unfortunately fell into the hands of certain 'cannibal tribes' and were directly hung on roasting racks.</p><p></p><p>It's important to know that ninth, tenth and eleventh-rank powerful beings, the moment they fell into this world, had all their powers and abilities reduced to nothing, no different from the ordinary people of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that remained unchanged was their own memories.</p><p></p><p>But memories alone were useless, especially when encountering those 'cannibal tribes' where the languages were mutually unintelligible - their fates can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Some of the powerful ones who fell into the hands of the cannibal tribes, unable to bear the humiliation, directly chose to self-destruct or erase the consciousness that fell into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Then came the discovery that 'dying in this two-dimensional world's manifestation would cause fundamental losses at the root'.</p><p></p><p>Apart from falling into the 'cannibal tribes', there were also cases of falling into the lairs of ferocious beasts and being devoured.</p><p></p><p>Some also fell into prosperous large cities, causing astonishment among the native powerful beings, who then imprisoned them for study and research.</p><p></p><p>In any case, from what Lin Yuan knew, a considerable portion of the powerful ones who fell into this two-dimensional world found themselves in difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also those in good situations, such as being regarded as heavenly 'sacred' beings by certain tribal forces, or being valued by the native powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's situation was not good, but not bad either - he was already quite satisfied with it.</p><p></p><p>"Pado, where is the nearest gathering place?" Lin Yuan looked towards the honest middle-aged man before him.  </p><p></p><p>Through their interaction, Lin Yuan learned that the other party's name was 'Pado', a fisherman and hunter who discovered Lin Yuan and brought him back.</p><p></p><p>"That direction," Pado pointed to a certain location, "But if you want to go there, it's best to wait for others. Otherwise, you might encounter ferocious beasts on the way and die."</p><p></p><p>Around Pado's dwelling were other natives, totaling a few dozen people.</p><p></p><p>On this continent, ferocious beasts were everywhere, and humans in this world could only survive by sticking together.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those powerful gathering places and cities could freely hunt those ferocious beasts without worries about safety.</p><p></p><p>But to settle in such places required paying a hefty price - something ordinary people like Pado couldn't even dream of.</p><p></p><p>That evening.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, every bone in his body was trembling, and black stains kept oozing from his skin.</p><p></p><p>As a tenth-rank evolver, even in this two-dimensional world, he could still undergo a 'tendon-changing, marrow-washing' metamorphosis by controlling his own body.</p><p></p><p>"At least now I have some self-defense capabilities," Lin Yuan breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The most dangerous period for a main universe powerful one who fell into this two-dimensional world was the first three days.</p><p></p><p>He was in a deep sleep for the first two days, and on the third day he adapted.</p><p></p><p>Once he got through these three days, he could regain some self-defense abilities based on his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Is my current physical body comparable to the 'Shamans' of this world?" Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation in this two-dimensional world was extremely simple - continuously enhancing one's physical body strength, progressing from weak to strong through the stages of:</p><p></p><p>Shaman, Shaman King, Shaman Emperor, Shaman Sovereign. </p><p></p><p>It was said that above the Shaman Sovereign level, there existed the Shaman Ancestor, but their numbers were so scarce that whenever one appeared, they would be revered by all living beings on the entire continent.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan indirectly obtained from Pado and the other natives, this world would only give birth to a Shaman Ancestor every few thousand or tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Shaman Ancestor?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, "It's merely the ultimate metamorphosis of the physical body."</p><p></p><p>"Even an eighth-rank life form could easily achieve that level given enough time."</p><p></p><p>He could foresee that as time passed and powerful ones from the main universe gradually adapted, this continent would give birth to an extremely terrifying batch of powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"The Shaman Ancestor is just the beginning," Lin Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>A level that even eighth-rank life forms could easily reach, not to mention ninth, tenth or eleventh-rank life forms.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Lin Yuan would rest during the day and secretly leave at night to hunt those terrifying ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>After his physical body underwent one metamorphosis, Lin Yuan realized that to continue unlocking his physical potential, he needed to absorb enough energy.</p><p></p><p>Where would this energy come from?</p><p></p><p>The forces of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>There was no such concept in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>All energy absorption was done in the most primitive way - by devouring other powerful ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A giant elephant over ten meters tall fell to the ground. Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in front of it, taking its core flesh and blood and eating it raw.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>A massive amount of blood energy surged into his body, which Lin Yuan quickly absorbed and refined, slowly enhancing the strength of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a month went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Shaman King."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body underwent a second metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>His strength and speed were greatly enhanced, far surpassing the previous 'Shaman' level.</p><p></p><p>According to the scant information from Pado and the others, Lin Yuan should now be considered a Shaman King.</p><p></p><p>A Shaman King level powerful one could preside over a region. Even in a city-level power, a Shaman King would have sufficient status as one of the top powerful ones.</p><p></p><p>"Huff..." Lin Yuan lightly inhaled. The price he paid to become a Shaman King was hunting and devouring all the ferocious beasts over ten meters in size within a radius of tens of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>As for those under ten meters? The energy contained was too little for Lin Yuan to bother with, and he had to leave some for Pado and the others.</p><p></p><p>If the nearby ferocious beasts were wiped out, Pado and the other natives would probably have to migrate elsewhere to live.</p><p></p><p>And migrating on this continent was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"But I can head to the nearest gathering place tomorrow," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Every two months, Pado and the others would join forces to go to a gathering place to exchange the resources they had harvested.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe's virtual world, half a month had passed in the two-dimensional world, but only a little over an hour had elapsed in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>In the personal space, Lin Yuan and Vice Pavilion Master Nalan sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>Under the descent of that white paper, one of Vice Pavilion Master Nalan's manifestations was also on Battlefield No. A098.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, this manifestation was also drawn into the two-dimensional world within the white paper.</p><p></p><p>However, Vice Pavilion Master Nalan's luck was a little better than Lin Yuan's - he fell into a city and happened to be discovered by the city lord's daughter, who immediately took Vice Pavilion Master Nalan back for treatment.</p><p></p><p>"These are the cultivation methods I collected from that two-dimensional world. Take a look," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan immediately handed over dozens of cultivation manuals to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Being valued by the city lord's daughter, Vice Pavilion Master Nalan could access very high-level materials, especially the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>In that two-dimensional world, cultivation methods were almost monopolized. Ordinary people would have to pay a huge price to access them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Through these cultivation methods, he could directly observe the essence of the power in that world.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan founded the Martial Dao Evolution System, he also studied many other evolution systems and even the cultivation systems of other dimensional worlds.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, observing the cultivation methods of the two-dimensional world would also have a significant effect on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I heard a piece of information," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan said in a low voice, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>"What information?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan's tone was concise.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate?" Lin Yuan raised his brows.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of the city I'm in, every ten thousand years, the Heavenly Gate will manifest in this world. Only Shaman Sovereign and Shaman Ancestor level powerful ones can approach the 'Heavenly Gate' at that time."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, only one person can make it to the front of the Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>"If one can push open the 'Heavenly Gate', they will leave this world and go to a higher realm."</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't sure if pushing open the Heavenly Gate and 'leaving this world' to go to a higher realm meant returning to the main universe, this was the only clearly stated method he knew of for leaving this world so far.</p>

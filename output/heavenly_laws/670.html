        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Very high?" </p><p></p><p>"How high is 'very high'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to know that it's very high." The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun said.</p><p></p><p>He was also not sure exactly how high the possibility was for Lin Yuan to break through to the 13th Realm, he only knew that in the over a hundred timelines he had observed, the other party had all broken through to the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that over a hundred timelines had broken through to the 13th Realm did not mean that all timelines could do so, and the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun could not observe all timelines either. Even for 13th Realm temporal life forms, they could only observe a portion of the timelines.</p><p></p><p>To observe all timelines would require the level of a 14th Realm perfect temporal life form.</p><p></p><p>"Before you attempt that step, you can directly come to me if you have any questions."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun looked at Lin Yuan: "To contact me, just call out the two words 'Scorching Sun'."</p><p></p><p>As a temporal life form, his title was integrated into the spatial-temporal realm, so as long as someone mentioned the two words 'Scorching Sun', the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun would sense it.</p><p></p><p>Although the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun was usually too lazy to pay attention to such things, if Lin Yuan were to call out 'Scorching Sun', the Progenitor would definitely appear immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Progenitor." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, as Lin Yuan had browsed through the many accumulated treasures of the Ancient Kingdom of the Scorching Sun, he had never heard of that supreme Celestial Monarch having the means to summon the Progenitor at any time.</p><p></p><p>Even the Emperor could not do that, needing to go through a certain 'intermediate' method to contact the Progenitor, but for someone like Lin Yuan to have direct contact? It was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun smiled as he looked at Lin Yuan: "I look forward to the day when this realm gives birth to the 7th Progenitor, and opens up the 7th great Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only felt the space-time change, and he returned to the imperial palace hall.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Kingdom of the Scorching Sun sat on the throne, his expression showing surprise at Lin Yuan's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the supreme Celestial Monarchs who went to the mysterious space to possess the Progenitor would only return after at least a few months. </p><p></p><p>The slower ones might even take decades or centuries.</p><p></p><p>But for someone like Lin Yuan, who had only been in that mysterious space for less than half an hour, the Emperor had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p></p><p>"I did not possess him." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Did not possess him?" The Emperor blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>They had gone to the mysterious space, summoned the Progenitor to descend, yet could still refuse possession midway?</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor told me not to possess him for now, to wait until before the breakthrough step to do so." Lin Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor pondered for a while, then nodded: "The Progenitor's words must have their reasons."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that your trillion merit points..." The Emperor looked at Lin Yuan, before he had entered the mysterious space, Lin Yuan had exchanged for the chance to possess the Progenitor, also paying out a trillion merit points.</p><p></p><p>This kind of merit point exchange channel was very difficult to trace back, it was determined by the Spirit of the Capital City.</p><p></p><p>"No need, the Progenitor said I can now freely obtain the inheritance guidance from the treasury." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was also something he could not hide from the Emperor, as the Ancient Kingdom's Emperor, he had the qualifications to check the treasury exchange situation, and he had known about Lin Yuan's previous exchange for the chance to possess the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>"Freely obtain the inheritance guidance from the treasury?" The Emperor of the Ancient Kingdom of the Scorching Sun looked at Lin Yuan, momentarily falling silent.</p><p></p><p>This was tantamount to the Ancient Kingdom's treasury completely opening up to Lin Yuan. It must be known that for the lofty Progenitor of the Scorching Sun, he had never interfered with the rule of the Ancient Kingdom, but now he had made an exception for Lin Yuan, naturally shocking the Emperor greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll head back first." After chatting with the Emperor for a bit, Lin Yuan stood up and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor watched Lin Yuan disappear, his expression returning to calmness.</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor treats Silver River so differently, even going so far as to make an exception." The Emperor of the Ancient Kingdom of the Scorching Sun thought a lot.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancient Kingdom's Emperor, he was very clear about the Progenitor's status. Lin Yuan's talent was indeed terrifying, becoming the first unrivaled Celestial Monarch in the history of the six great Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But so what? Without reaching the 13th Realm, he still could not enter the Progenitor's eyes, would not be placed in the Progenitor's heart.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had made the Progenitor treat him this way, causing the Emperor to have many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Under the Progenitor, all are but ants, the only ones who can make the Progenitor make an exception are those on the same level as the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Kingdom of the Scorching Sun looked towards the direction Lin Yuan had left, his heart surging with waves: "The Progenitor?"</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Silver River Manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately divided his mind and went to the treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look at the nine supreme inheritances." Lin Yuan immediately began to observe the specific contents of the nine supreme inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan had already excluded three of the nine supreme inheritances, because the cultivation of these three supreme inheritances would have many hidden dangers, which Lin Yuan could not accept, so naturally he would not exchange for them.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Knowing that he could exchange for any inheritance guidance without any restrictions, Lin Yuan naturally would not miss these three inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did not cultivate them, he could still observe and refer to them, as supreme inheritances, they were the 13th Realm inheritances of the chaotic void, even if they were full of hidden dangers, they would definitely have great reference value.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally would not miss them.</p><p></p><p>"Heart of the Scorching Sun."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly browsed through this supreme inheritance, which could condense half a step into the 13th Realm level of a heart, thereby obtaining power far surpassing the 12th Realm limit. The terrifying nature of this inheritance was even beyond Lin Yuan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"If cultivated to perfection, to completely transform one's own heart into the Heart of the Scorching Sun, the strength might not be inferior to half a Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Exalted Emperor, whose feet were just about to step across the twelve steps, paused. "Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, cultivating the "Heart of the Blazing Sun" to perfection is extremely difficult, requiring an exceptionally potent ancestral bloodline, and even at a critical moment, one must absorb a drop of the ancestor's essence to transform one's own heart.</p><p></p><p>But obtaining a drop of the ancestor's essence is no easy feat. As the essence of time and life, even if the killing intent within it is erased, how many lives below the Thirteenth Realm can withstand it? "Although I cannot cultivate this legacy, some of its principles can still be learned, especially the way of utilizing the power of the Thirteenth Realm," Lin Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirits were high as he finished reviewing the other eight supreme legacies, gaining a great harvest, with many enlightened insights emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Ancestor said my chances of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm are very high, I cannot be careless." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, knowing how rare it was for a time life to be so highly praised by the Ancestor. But the more this was the case, the more vigilant Lin Yuan became.</p><p></p><p>The so-called high chance of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm does not mean it is foolproof. The greater the hope, the more devastating the failure would be if it ultimately failed. Lin Yuan naturally did not want to end up in such a situation.</p><p></p><p>"I must proceed as usual."</p><p></p><p>"I cannot relax just because of the Ancestor's evaluation."</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial dao evolution must still be propagated."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly thought to himself. Even if he had a very good chance of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm, perfecting everything else was not a bad thing at all.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Space.</p><p></p><p>After returning, the Blazing Sun Ancestor did not disappear as usual.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to focus on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"In the one thousand three hundred and sixty-eight timelines, did they all reach the Thirteenth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor was not idle, but continued to observe Lin Yuan's timelines.</p><p></p><p>The more he observed, the more astonished the Blazing Sun Ancestor became.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't continue to explore more timelines, but delve deeper into a certain timeline."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor thought to himself. The more than a thousand timelines he had seen so far had all stopped just as Lin Yuan crossed into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because once a timeline involved the Thirteenth Realm, the difficulty of observation increased exponentially.</p><p></p><p>So the Blazing Sun Ancestor had not rashly observed further.</p><p></p><p>After observing more than a thousand timelines with no change in the outcome, he decided to see how far Lin Yuan could grow.</p><p></p><p>Crossing into the Thirteenth Realm was not the key point. Even Thirteenth Realm time lives have varying degrees of strength. Powerful time lives can see more future timelines and exert far-reaching influence in a subtle manner.</p><p></p><p>For time lives, their confrontation is not limited to power, but depends on how much they can see. The more timelines one can see, the more possibilities of the future one grasps, and the stronger one becomes.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor focused his thoughts and immediately followed a timeline, delving deeper into it.</p><p></p><p>The timeline unfolded, and it quickly reached the point where Lin Yuan crossed into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>A series of scenes appeared before the Blazing Sun Ancestor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was a dark, desolate space.</p><p></p><p>A young man sat cross-legged, with a huge black and white Taiji diagram above him, permeating time and space, encompassing the past, present, and future, converging many possible futures towards the young man's desired future.</p><p></p><p>And beneath the Taiji diagram, there was an existence filled with endless spiritual light, angrily roaring.</p><p></p><p>The existence of endless spiritual light seemed to be the source of all life, its presence constantly influencing the surrounding space-time, but now it was being suppressed by the young man.</p><p></p><p>"Silver, I give up the layout 180 million billion years from now, that dimensional creation is yours." The existence of endless spiritual light submitted.</p><p></p><p>The "Great Spirit Ancestor" Blazing Sun Ancestor saw this scene and his heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The existence of endless spiritual light was the Great Spirit Ancestor, and also the second strongest time life among the current six Ancestors, only inferior to the Great Progenitor Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But in the future scene, the Great Spirit Ancestor was suppressed to the point of being forced to abandon his future planning and layout by the young man.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor paused for a moment and continued to observe the even more distant future.</p><p></p><p>A majestic man filled with the primordial aura of heaven and earth, whose terrifying power could shake the entire Source World with a mere gesture, was now fleeing, even forced to break through the dimensional rift and escape to an unknown other dimension.</p><p></p><p>But immediately afterwards, a vast black and white Taiji diagram enveloped, influencing countless timelines.</p><p></p><p>"Great Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>The young man looked down from above at the majestic man below.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Progenitor is also fleeing?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor was shocked. Among the six Ancestors, the Great Progenitor Ancestor was undisputedly the strongest, but in the future scene, even the mighty Great Progenitor Ancestor was fleeing in panic from Lin Yuan's pursuit, and ultimately failed to escape?</p><p></p><p>"At the Thirteenth Realm, the growth speed can be so fast?" </p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor found it hard to believe. The cultivation of the Thirteenth Realm is completely different from the Twelfth Realm. Lin Yuan's rapid progress in the Twelfth Realm does not mean he can maintain the same pace in the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could still make rapid progress, there are limits. The Great Progenitor Ancestor, who was being pursued, fled in panic? This was beyond just rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to watch."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor couldn't help but continue observing the even more distant future.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the Blazing Sun Ancestor was observing the more distant future, he sensed a deep gaze directed at him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The Blazing Sun Ancestor felt his mental state shaken, and his consciousness began to blur out of control.</p>

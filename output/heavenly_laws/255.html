            <p>Chapter 255 Lin Yuan's Strength (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In an underground world spanning hundreds of thousands of miles, only Lin Yuan sat cross-legged alone. The terrifying aura emanating from his body caused even space to slightly distort.</p><p></p><p>"The second stage of the Eighth Realm Martial Dao has been reached." Lin Yuan retracted his aura, nodding with satisfaction. "The immortal cultivation techniques have played a significant role in perfecting the Eighth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, starting from the second stage of the Eighth Realm, the difficulty of advancement begins to soar. But with heaven-defying comprehension, it's just a matter of time and effort."</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, the Eighth Realm Martial Dao consisted of four stages, similar to most Eighth Realm evolution paths in the main world. </p><p></p><p>But in terms of specific cultivation content, Lin Yuan had done his utmost at his current level. If it was just to establish an ordinary Eighth Realm evolution path, there would be no need to expend so much effort.</p><p></p><p>However, the Eighth Realm Martial Dao was a critical stage in Lin Yuan's cultivation, so naturally he could not treat it perfunctorily.</p><p></p><p>"My current realm has also stepped into the second stage of the Eighth Realm."</p><p></p><p>If not for coming into contact with the immortal cultivation system of the Spirit Realm and other cultivation systems, allowing Lin Yuan to reshape the Martial Dao evolution path multiple times, he estimated it would have taken several more decades to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>"But when I returned to the Eighth Realm, I did not experience the Heart Demon Tribulation again, nor did I face the Physical Body Tribulation that Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings need to go through at this stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin, falling into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>As for why the Physical Body Tribulation did not descend, Lin Yuan had guessed the reason. This tribulation was aimed at immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had borrowed many essences from immortal cultivation systems, his foundation was still the Martial Dao evolution path, so he did not need to face the Physical Body Tribulation that only immortal cultivators would experience.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heart Demon Tribulation, Lin Yuan felt that his mind and will had long undergone transformation and similarly did not need to experience it again.</p><p></p><p>"I've stayed here for over 900 years, and only a hundred years have passed so far. I still have ample time to perfect the next three stages of the Eighth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite confident about this.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Eighth Realm is perfected, the Martial Dao evolution path will become an Eighth Realm evolution path. It will likely rank among the top of all Eighth Realm evolution paths in human history."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up and walked out of the underground world, arriving on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Space!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step and followed the spatial fluctuations. In an instant, he arrived outside Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>The underground world where Lin Yuan cultivated was at least several million miles away from Xiaoyao City. But by grasping the laws of space, it was just a step away.</p><p></p><p>In the past hundred years, besides recovering his strength and perfecting the Eighth Realm Martial Dao, Lin Yuan had never given up on comprehending the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the core spatial models Lin Yuan had comprehended exceeded 4,000, and his inner world had expanded to a size of 4 million miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The 4 million miles here referred to the pure size of the inner world, completely supported by spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>It had not undergone the amplification from that mysterious gourd in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Based on the five-fold basic amplification before crossing over, Lin Yuan's current inner world size should have been 20 million miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>A 20 million mile inner world far surpassed the upper limit of 10 million miles for human evolvers' inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>The world force born from such a vast inner world could likely contend against the Eighth Realm Invincible for a few moves.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, Lin Yuan's strength was not enough, so he did not bring that mysterious gourd over, worried that some accident might occur.</p><p></p><p>But now? Even a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King overlooking the Spirit Realm would not faze Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the reforged Physical Body Divine Ability..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned. The Sixth Realm Martial Dao would condense a Physical Body Divine Ability from one's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Different physiques and bloodlines naturally condensed different Physical Body Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>In the Midland Divine Continent world, the Physical Body Divine Ability Lin Yuan condensed was "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood".</p><p></p><p>On the true body in the main world, the Physical Body Divine Ability Lin Yuan condensed was "Moving Mountains".</p><p></p><p>And now, on the Spirit Realm body of the eighth crossing, the Physical Body Divine Ability Lin Yuan condensed was "Enhancement".</p><p></p><p>Once activated, the "Enhancement" divine ability would increase Lin Yuan's physical body, qi, blood, soul, mind, will, and everything else by tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Even the world force of his inner world would gain a tenfold amplification.</p><p></p><p>Although the duration of the "Enhancement" divine ability was not long, only ten breaths, and after the ability ended, Lin Yuan's strength would temporarily weaken by about 20-30%.</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, this divine ability definitely belonged to the category of trump cards.</p><p></p><p>In battles between experts, an instant could determine victory or defeat, let alone ten breaths?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with physical body, qi, blood, soul, mind, will and so on all amplified tenfold simultaneously, the impact on strength was definitely far more than just a tenfold increase.</p><p></p><p>Possessing this kind of divine ability, even an ordinary peak Eighth Realm evolver could contend against the Eighth Realm Invincible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only contending against the Eighth Realm Invincible during the duration of the divine ability, but it was already quite incredible, comparable to a substitute for the power of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that the "Enhancement" divine ability would become more useful as strength increased. A peak Eighth Realm activating this ability could rival the Eighth Realm Invincible for ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>Then what about a Ninth Realm evolver?</p><p></p><p>"In the coming time, besides perfecting the Martial Dao evolution path, the primary task is to comprehend this divine ability and condense its imprint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Only by condensing the divine ability imprint could he bring this ability back to the main world. Lin Yuan remembered that back then, in order to comprehend the "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood" divine ability imprint, he had spent a full fifty years.</p><p></p><p>As for the "Moving Mountains" divine ability, the time experienced in the main world was too short, and Lin Yuan had yet to comprehend its imprint.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>"Elder." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, the Grand Elders of the Martial Temple had indeed treated Lin Yuan well, almost cultivating him as the future of the temple.</p><p></p><p>Without the early support of the Martial Temple, Lin Yuan would have definitely still reached this point today, but it would have certainly taken much more time.</p><p></p><p>Immortal cultivators needed resources.</p><p></p><p>Martial cultivators also needed resources.</p><p></p><p>Especially at the Sixth and Seventh Realms, when opening the inner world, the consumption of resources was like mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>"Changr, these are the immortal cultivation techniques you wanted." The Grand Elder took out several jade slips, his gaze towards Lin Yuan uncontrollably revealing a hint of trembling.</p><p></p><p>As early as seventy to eighty years ago, the few Grand Elders could no longer see through Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The countless martial arts classics collected by the entire Martial Temple had already been browsed through by Lin Yuan. Although they had not directly exchanged blows in terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>Every time they came into close contact with Lin Yuan, the few of them felt an inexplicable palpitation.</p><p></p><p>This feeling sixty years ago...</p><p></p><p>The excerpt is translated as follows:</p><p></p><p>They disappeared, but they didn't mean to look down upon him at all.</p><p></p><p>They just felt that Lin Yuan might have already reached the level of returning to simplicity? The few Martial Dao Seventh Stage Ancestors were like this.</p><p></p><p>Unless they deliberately revealed their aura, there was no difference from ordinary people in appearance.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Jade Pure Immortal Scripture, is this the ultimate secret technique of the Supreme Immortal Sect?" Lin Yuan became interested.</p><p></p><p>In the past few decades, Lin Yuan had asked the Supreme Elders to collect the Immortal Dao techniques as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Although the Supreme Elders didn't know what Lin Yuan, a Martial Dao cultivator, intended to do with collecting Immortal Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>But the talent and aptitude Lin Yuan currently displayed was too terrifying, they had no doubts at all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly browsed through the 'Supreme Jade Pure Immortal Scripture' once, and finally nodded slightly and said, "Although it's broken after the Deity Transformation stage, but as the unparalleled Immortal King who shook the Three Thousand Dao Realms, the Immortal Scripture he created does have its merits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said in a slightly admiring tone.</p><p></p><p>Even Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings are divided into high and low levels. Among them, the Unparalleled Immortal Kings are the ultimate powerhouses in the Tribulation Transcending realm. Lin Yuan speculated that the Unparalleled Immortal Kings might correspond to the Eighth Stage Invincible in the main world.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Immortal Sect once intended to spread the Supreme Jade Pure Immortal Scripture and allowed other Immortal Dao cultivators to cultivate this scripture, otherwise we wouldn't be able to get it either."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>It was also easy to guess the intention of the Supreme Immortal Sect in doing so. It was nothing more than to search the Three Thousand Dao Realms for Immortal Dao geniuses suitable for cultivating the Supreme Jade Pure Immortal Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were really idle Immortal Dao cultivators who were lucky enough to enter the sect, the only way to continue to go deeper was to go to the Supreme Pure Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er,"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder hesitated for a moment, but finally asked.</p><p></p><p>"What realm are you at now, Martial Dao Seventh Stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>In just a hundred years, cultivating to the Martial Dao Seventh Stage, in the past, the Supreme Elder would never have believed it no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's performance in the past hundred years made the Supreme Elders have this idea.</p><p></p><p>The few Supreme Elders themselves were at the Martial Dao Sixth Stage. To be able to give them a sense of oppression, it was most likely the Martial Dao Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>"My current realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other Supreme Elders also subconsciously pricked up their ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>They were also curious about what Lin Yuan's current strength was.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>As early as sixty years ago, he was no longer at the Martial Dao Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Martial Dao Seventh Stage?" The Supreme Elder breathed a sigh of relief, and a complex and indescribable emotion surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that Lin Yuan was at the Martial Dao Seventh Stage, because in that case, the Martial Dao evolution path would give birth to another Seventh Stage Ancestor, and the influence of the Martial Temple would further expand.</p><p></p><p>But rationally, the Supreme Elder did not believe that in just a hundred years, Lin Yuan could enter the Seventh Stage. This was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Now that he got Lin Yuan's confirmation, the few Supreme Elders had no more doubts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Supreme Elder.</p><p></p><p>Or the other Supreme Elders, none of them had ever thought that Lin Yuan would be at the Martial Dao Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Because this was simply a fantasy. Since the birth of the Martial Dao evolution path, the strongest was at the Seventh Stage, stopping at the Immortal Dao True Immortal level.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Eighth Stage? Even the legendary Martial Ancestor had never been involved, let alone a little guy like Lin Yuan who had only cultivated for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"In a hundred years, entering the Sixth Stage, since the establishment of our Martial Temple, this cultivation speed can be said to be the first." The Supreme Elder thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In hundreds of thousands of years, countless Martial Dao geniuses had passed through the sky, but there had never been a Martial Dao cultivator who entered the Sixth Stage in a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Sixth Stage corresponded to the Immortal Dao Refining Void Ancient Saint. Only those Immortal Dao monsters and Immortal King seeds could hope to achieve the Refining Void Ancient Saint realm in a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>After the few Supreme Elders left.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>"My current Dao strength," Lin Yuan began to examine himself. With the help of many means, even without the amplification of the inner world within a radius of more than ten million miles, Lin Yuan's combat power was already close to the Eighth Stage Invincible.</p><p></p><p>If he used the divine ability "Enhancement", within ten breaths, Lin Yuan's combat power would probably exceed the Eighth Stage Invincible by quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what the creative power mastered by the Immortal King level powerhouses is like." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After understanding over these years, Lin Yuan roughly determined that Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings probably didn't have inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>What they relied on was the creative power they mastered. Ordinary Immortals mastered part of the power of creation, while Unparalleled Immortal Kings mastered the complete power of creation.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are no Immortal King level powerhouses in the East Cloud Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Even in the Three Thousand Dao Realms, Immortal King level powerhouses were extremely rare. At least the East Cloud Dao Realm had no such powerhouses stationed there.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Lin Yuan would probably find one or two Immortal Kings to test his skills.</p><p></p><p>As for outside the East Cloud Dao Realm, the distance was too far. Even with Lin Yuan's mastery of spatial laws, able to travel millions or tens of millions of miles in one step, it would still take a lot of time to reach the next Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>With this time spent on the journey, Lin Yuan might as well go into seclusion for a while.</p><p></p><p>As for Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings, even if he went to other Dao Realms, whether he could find a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King was another matter.</p><p></p><p>"That gourd can be brought over now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Now his strength was sufficient. At least within the East Cloud Dao Realm, he was at the invincible level. Even if there were hidden Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings, they probably couldn't defeat Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So at present, he had the strength to keep that mysterious gourd safe.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind began to sink into the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Looking at that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing dimensions, crossing latitudes, unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>When he first became an Evolver, Lin Yuan looked at the Gate of Myriad Realms and only felt its vastness and magnificence, but now, he discovered that this gate seemed to be a behemoth spanning countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>"In the past hundred years, the main world has been normal, and nothing has happened."</p><p></p><p>Through the Gate of Myriad Realms, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the environment on the side of his true body in the main world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, consuming a wisp of realm-breaking origin force, and began to transmit that mysterious gourd from the main world to this place.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Gate of Myriad Realms, spatial fluctuations faintly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These spatial fluctuations were deep and distant, as if emanating endless mystery.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed that this method of transmitting items across dimensional latitudes far exceeded his current knowledge. If he sensed it for a while longer, with his heaven-defying comprehension, he might be able to comprehend something.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>A grayish-yellow gourd slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It fell into Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

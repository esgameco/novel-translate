        <h1>Chapter 552</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Ancient Mingxun Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Who's spying on me?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Ancient Ming opened his eyes, his expression uncertain and surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It must be some passing Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Ancient Ming quickly realized the spying gaze had retreated, and speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To be able to see through the layers of formations in the Chaos Continent and spy on his secluded location,</p><p></p><p>The other party must be at least at the Eighth Level of Space-Time mastery.</p><p></p><p>"Having just arrived in this void, it aroused the curiosity of nearby Venerable Ones who came to check it out?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Ancient Ming speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Level of Space-Time comprehension already belonged to the realm of senior Chaos Venerables. </p><p></p><p>Ordinary newly ascended Chaos Venerables still remained at the peak of the Seventh Level in terms of Space-Time attainment.</p><p></p><p>In the "Fragment World" of Star Tears.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was constantly observing the surrounding space-time through his Eighth Level Space-Time comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the distance of void traversal or the mastery of space-time, it has improved by leaps and bounds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly. The main point was that from now on, when facing enemies at the Venerable level, Lin Yuan would at least not be suppressed in the space-time domain.</p><p></p><p>Attainment in the space-time realm was like having the initiative, allowing one to advance or retreat.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the Ninth Level of Space-Time is like."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Level of Space-Time belonged to the realm that only Chaos Venerables could access, while the Ninth Level was the domain of Chaos Great Saints and even Peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty the Mystic Emperor, as a Peerless Great Saint, could casually create 33,333 Mystic Yellow Secret Realms scattered across different universes, mainly relying on his peak Ninth Level Space-Time comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"This period of seclusion can be considered over."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts. Although his Space-Time attainment had reached the Eighth Level, he still didn't feel the slightest bit smug. The Eighth Level of Space-Time comprehension only allowed him to feel relaxed and at ease when facing Chaos Venerables.</p><p></p><p>But what about Chaos Great Saints?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still remembered how his home universe was destroyed in the aftermath of the battle between the Shadow Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he never even saw the shadows of those two Great Saints. The residual power fluctuations from their battle destroyed everything, giving Lin Yuan a sense of being unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>"With my current foundation, if I break through to the Sovereign realm, even if I'm still no match for a Great Saint, at least I'll have some degree of self-preservation ability? Not an ant that a Great Saint can casually destroy?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The leap from the Path-Breaking realm to the Sovereign realm was a major realm breakthrough within the Twelve Levels, and one's strength and combat power would undergo qualitative changes.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, it was the same. At that time, he could continue cultivating subsequent techniques like "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>"The Sovereign realm is coming soon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought as he sensed how close his physical body and soul were to the ultimate state.</p><p></p><p>"This seclusion, comprehending the Eighth Level of Space-Time, can be considered an unexpected joy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind flashed through the many martial dao branches he had just developed and perfected. "A total of 73 martial dao branches. Theoretically, all 73 of these martial dao branches can give birth to Twelve Level beings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The more martial dao branches there were, the more it demonstrated the breadth of the great dao of martial arts. If not for this, how could so many branches be developed? No matter how much a muddy little path is expanded, it cannot extend into a grand heavenly road.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan and the others asked me to go buy some Twelve Level evolution paths, but why buy them when they're ready-made here?"</p><p></p><p>A smile spread across Lin Yuan's face. Seventy-three martial dao branches leading directly to the Twelve Levels were enough for human civilization to use for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if I continued to seclude myself, I could completely develop and open up even more martial dao branches, but there's no need for that now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the fundamental dao of martial arts evolution paths here, once the ideas for various branches were opened up, all kinds of branches would continue to appear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only needed to guide them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Wan Qu is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, and he immediately split off an avatar to leave the Star Tears "Fragment World" and head to the Ancient Mingxun Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>In a pavilion in Mingchuan City, Lin Yuan and Sovereign Wan Qu sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe, I have not failed in my mission."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wan Qu said with a smile as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Ancient Ming Venerable personally issued the order last time to give that Star Tears "Fragment World" to Lin Yuan in an almost gifting manner, Sovereign Wan Qu realized that Lin Yuan's background might be terrifyingly great.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Sovereign Wan Qu had also sought an audience with Ancient Ming Venerable, wanting to inquire about Lin Yuan's affairs. As a result, Ancient Ming Venerable only gave him one cautionary sentence.</p><p></p><p>"If Yinhe is offended, the entire Chaos Continent will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wan Qu still remembered the expression on Ancient Ming Venerable's face when he said those words. It was one of extreme wariness and fear.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that during this period, Sovereign Wan Qu had basically been granting Lin Yuan's every request.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, thank you." Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he had asked Sovereign Wan Qu for a favor,</p><p></p><p>Wanting to sell the eighteen Sovereign-level extraordinary trees he had obtained from Senior "Cang Wei Yang" in exchange for specific cultivation resources or Chaos Stones.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen extraordinary trees would bear spirit fruits at regular intervals, equivalent to money trees for factions, which could be passed down indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, they were somewhat useless.</p><p></p><p>These eighteen extraordinary trees had a fruiting cycle of at least a million years. And in a million years, at Lin Yuan's rate of growth, he would likely have already entered the Chaos realm in the next million years.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of Chaos Venerables, eighteen extraordinary trees didn't amount to much, let alone the spirit fruits they bore.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen extraordinary trees were not World Trees nurtured within Lin Yuan's internal universe, which had the effect of stabilizing his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their upper limit and potential were quite high, able to grow into Chaos Trees.</p><p></p><p>That's why Lin Yuan had kept them until now.</p><p></p><p>The greatest use of these eighteen extraordinary trees for Lin Yuan was to use them to comprehend the knack of absorbing and expelling Chaos Qi.</p><p></p><p>"These are the resources and materials Brother Yinhe needs. I just happened to exchange them."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wan Qu waved his hand, and a purple cloth bag appeared before him, obviously a storage treasure containing the resources and materials Lin Yuan needed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he didn't make any profit from this transaction, and even incurred a slight loss,</p><p></p><p>But as long as he could befriend Lin Yuan, according to Ancient Ming Venerable's meaning, it was worth paying any price.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the purple cloth bag, probed it with his divine sense, and satisfiedly put it away.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I want to ask you about something."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What's there to ask about? Brother Yinhe can just say it directly."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wan Qu immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"What's the background of the Myriad Dao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>In the intelligence information left by Senior "Cang Wei Yang", the descriptions of the Myriad Dao Pavilion were all somewhat unclear, after all, Senior "Cang Wei Yang" was only at the peak of the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Sovereign Wan Qu was also at the peak of the Sovereign realm, he was a disciple of a Chaos Venerable and had been in charge of the "Fragment World" affairs of the Ancient Mingxun Chaos Continent for so many years.</p><p></p><p>In terms of access to news and intelligence, he was definitely incomparable to a loner like "Cang Wei Yang".</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Mystic Emperor's lineage also had some understanding of the Myriad Dao Pavilion, but it was too long ago, and the news and intelligence might not necessarily be comparable to that of a Venerable's disciple.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion?" The Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies was slightly stunned. "Brother Yinhe, are you curious about the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"I am, a bit," Lin Yuan admitted frankly. Such a powerful organization that trades in evolution paths must have a significant background, but Lin Yuan still wanted to understand its specific origins.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion, fully named 'Ten Thousand Laws and Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion', makes its living by trading evolution paths. Whether you want to buy or sell evolution paths, you can do it through the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion." </p><p></p><p>At this point, the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies's tone became much more serious, "However, there's one thing - never cause trouble inside the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion. Otherwise, even the Venerable Master might not be able to save you."</p><p></p><p>"Even a Venerable can't save someone?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>This Chaos Continent was the territory of Venerable Gu Ming. Venerable Gu Ming was the only 'Heaven' here. Even Venerable Gu Ming couldn't save someone who caused trouble in the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What we see are all branch pavilions of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion. As for the main pavilion, no one knows where it is. It's located in a mysterious place in the Chaos Void, and only 'honored guests' who receive invitations can enter."</p><p></p><p>"In each branch pavilion of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion, there exists a projection of the Eye of Ten Thousand Laws. The Eye of Ten Thousand Laws is the true ruler of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion. It is absolutely fair and just, and shows no favoritism. Usually, the projection of the Eye of Ten Thousand Laws doesn't appear. It's only awakened when there's a need to appraise an uncertain evolution path."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies looked at Lin Yuan and lowered his voice, "Even just a projection of the Eye of Ten Thousand Laws is enough to make a Chaos Grand Saint wary."</p><p></p><p>"A projection?" Lin Yuan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Just a projection had such power. Emperor Xuanhuang's speculation about the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion - that it might be a contingency left behind by a 13th-level Time Life - probably had some basis.</p><p></p><p>"I was thinking of spreading evolution paths. Can that be done through the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stated his true purpose.</p><p></p><p>After developing numerous branches of the Martial Dao evolution path, Lin Yuan had once again put the matter of spreading the Martial Dao evolution path on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the inheritance of the Martial Dao evolution path would not be limited to spreading within human civilization. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was more eager for the Martial Dao evolution path to be passed down in the Chaos Void, on continent after continent of Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"As long as your evolution path meets the requirements of the Eye of Ten Thousand Laws, it can be spread through the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion," </p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies shook his head and said, "However, this is very difficult to achieve. Evolution paths that the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion actively spreads are extremely rare."</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies for a few more sentences, Lin Yuan stood up to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>In the 'fragment world' of Star Tears, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged with a purple cloth bag floating in front of him, containing the resource materials he had exchanged for selling thirteen miraculous trees.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cang Weiyang," </p><p>A round figure appeared in Lin Yuan's mind, which was the imprint he had seen in the cave dwelling left by Cang Weiyang.</p><p></p><p>"Stone People Tribe of the Myriad Phenomena Void Domain."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Senior Cang Weiyang's imprint had given all the treasures to Lin Yuan without asking for anything in return, leaving only one request.</p><p></p><p>That was, if Lin Yuan had the ability in the future, he could go to the Myriad Phenomena Void Domain and take a disciple from the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>This request was optional for Lin Yuan to fulfill, and Cang Weiyang hadn't left any constraints. It depended on Lin Yuan's mood whether to do it or not.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Phenomena Void Domain should be in that direction," Lin Yuan thought, looking in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Void was filled with endless Chaos qi. This Chaos qi could be either dense or thin.</p><p></p><p>Areas where Chaos qi was dense were suitable for cultivation and were called void domains.</p><p></p><p>As for areas where Chaos qi was thin, there were far fewer permanent inhabitants, and these were collectively called barren regions.</p><p></p><p>The void domain where Lin Yuan was currently located was called the Divine Wind Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Phenomena Void Domain was not far from the Divine Wind Void Domain, separated by only two or three void domains.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a Sovereign realm powerhouse could cross one void domain by flying continuously for several decades.</p><p></p><p>"Stone People Tribe?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Stone People Tribe was Senior Cang Weiyang's clan.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Senior Cang Weiyang had left his clan and roamed various void domains, eventually stepping into the Sovereign realm and cultivating to the peak of the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason Cang Weiyang made this request was probably because he was worried that after his death, the Stone People Tribe might face the danger of extinction.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Cang Weiyang's description, the Stone People Tribe was quite weak. The entire tribe had only four or five Path-breaking realm cultivators apart from him, their only Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, I'll send an avatar to visit the Myriad Phenomena Void Domain."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, outside the Gu Ming Chaos Continent, Chaos qi drifted and condensed into a figure, which immediately flew towards the Myriad Phenomena Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the eighth level of space-time attainment, Lin Yuan's ability to maintain avatars at a distance had increased unprecedentedly. Not to mention that the Myriad Phenomena Void Domain was only separated from the Divine Wind Void Domain by two or three void domains, even if it were twenty or thirty, he could easily cover the distance.</p><p></p><p>The eighth level of space-time comprehension was a level that only senior Venerables could reach.</p><p></p><p>Sending out an avatar to fulfill Senior Cang Weiyang's request was a casual act for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Cang Weiyang hadn't set any constraints, Lin Yuan didn't want to take advantage of this.</p><p></p><p>After all, the many treasures and weapons left by Senior Cang Weiyang at that time became Lin Yuan's "first bucket of gold" for exploring the Chaos Void, which was quite helpful.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that Senior Cang Weiyang's request was very easy to fulfill. It was just to take a disciple from the Stone People Tribe, not to protect the Stone People Tribe for many years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sent an avatar over, and with the speed of space-time level eight, it wouldn't take much time.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan and the others have already arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed as he noticed that Xuanyuan Supreme and the other eight Supreme beings were waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the purple cloth bag, Lin Yuan stood up and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme and the other eight Supreme beings looked at Lin Yuan with excitement, "You called us here, is it because you've already bought suitable evolution paths?"</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Xuanyuan Supreme had asked Lin Yuan to purchase some 12th-level evolution paths in preparation for future new 12th-level beings in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"That's not the case," Lin Yuan shook his head, "But it's close."</p><p></p><p>"Not the case?"</p><p></p><p>"Close?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme looked confused, these were two completely opposite meanings.</p><p></p><p>"Let me show you something."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan transmitted the Martial Dao evolution path with its many newly developed branches to the nine Supreme beings through the virtual world network.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme looked somewhat expectant. Something that Lin Yuan would specifically mention like this must not be ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme beings received the Martial Dao evolution path that Lin Yuan had transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe, isn't this the Martial Dao evolution path you created-"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Guli beside him had just glanced over it and was about to speak, but then his expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Guli carefully and seriously looked at it for a while, then looked at Lin Yuan with a solemn expression, his tone revealing disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Martial Dao evolution path?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

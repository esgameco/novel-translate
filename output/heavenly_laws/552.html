        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the inner city area.</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger was seated on the seat.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, there were many aristocrats who were half-human, half-strange, and half-animal like him.</p><p></p><p>Some had ox heads, some had pig faces, numbering in the hundreds and thousands, gathered together, as if they had come to a myriad of strange gardens.</p><p></p><p>These bizarre aristocrats were in a frenzy, staring at the arena below.</p><p></p><p>On the arena, half-naked men and women holding knives and swords were fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>These aristocrats were red-eyed and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Waste, twist his neck!"</p><p>"Bite, don't you have a mouth!"</p><p>"If you make me lose money, you'll see what's coming!"</p><p>"Fuck your mother!"</p><p>"Fuck your father!"</p><p></p><p>All kinds of filthy language fell on their ears.</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger shook his huge tiger head, eating garlic-flavored meat paste, opening his mouth with a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the communication talisman, his expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"A resurrected cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The other side, the leader of the Blood Tiger Gang, seeing Blood Tiger's response, immediately said humbly:</p><p></p><p>"This guy has disregarded the reputation of Lord Blood Tiger, and has killed members of the Blood Tiger Gang. Now he has come to the inner city area to seek refuge. Please, Lord Blood Tiger, lend a hand to stop him, and this humble one will offer thirty thousand taels of silver!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger narrowed his eyes: "Forget the polite talk, since I'm free, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger then stood up directly.</p><p></p><p>On the communication talisman, the leader of the Blood Tiger Gang had already sent the approximate location of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was not very far from Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Blood Tiger patted the thigh of a female servant in the arena, with a mocking expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The thigh meat of those two beasts upstairs, keep it for me."</p><p></p><p>He was referring to the two slaves fighting on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Even if they managed to win the battle on the stage, it did not mean they had a chance to live.</p><p></p><p>The female servant had a fawning expression on her face: "Don't worry, master, the freshest part will be saved for you."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger strode down the streets of the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the outer city, the inner city was much more prosperous, and the roads were much cleaner.</p><p></p><p>Human slaves with lowered heads, wearing clean clothes, were diligently sweeping the roads.</p><p></p><p>"A resurrected cultivator, the Thorn Blood has confirmed, and he has actually come back to life. It seems he has a secret.</p><p></p><p>This time he came to the inner city, probably to seek refuge with an elder, and offer that secret."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger was very intelligent and good at making associations.</p><p></p><p>He immediately understood Qi Yuan's true intention.</p><p></p><p>"The plan is ringing loud, but unfortunately he has encountered me." Blood Tiger had the upper hand, with a murderous intent on his tiger-like face.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he suddenly looked up at the sky, his face showing surprise and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He saw a golden flash passing quickly across the sky.</p><p></p><p>That golden flash was very familiar to Blood Tiger, it was the great figure of the Golden Crane, the Thorn Blood's powerful cultivator. This great figure was a sky-level expert, whose mere footsteps could shake the entire Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Blood Tiger's knowledge, this great figure had been in seclusion for years, rarely showing himself.</p><p></p><p>Why did he suddenly appear today?</p><p></p><p>"This matter is strange, but it has nothing to do with me, my current task is to kill Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"And that waste Zhi Qi, he even lost track of the surveillance talisman, it seems I have to take action myself."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Blood Tiger's speed suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up at the sky again, and saw several more light shadows flashing across the sky, each with a terrifying aura, clearly sky-level experts!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, the Elder Council has all mobilized?" Blood Tiger had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he had sensed more than ten sky-level experts taking action.</p><p></p><p>Something big must have happened.</p><p></p><p>"If the sky falls, there are tall people to hold it up, this has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger calmed himself down.</p><p></p><p>Now, finding Qi Yuan was the priority.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the sky above, the Golden Crane, dressed in golden robes, had a terrifying and gloomy expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The princess has actually been killed by a human slave!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Spirit Realm, any princess title was extremely powerful. They were either the daughters or sisters of the Mysterious Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Spirit hovered high in the sky or deep in the earth and sea, almost never revealing themselves to the world.</p><p></p><p>The daughters or sisters of the Mysterious Spirit had a status even higher than the elders of the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>The one who had come to the Cloud Blood City for a visit was the daughter of the Dark-Eyed Mysterious Spirit, Yin Ling.</p><p></p><p>This princess loved to hide her identity and cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>After Yin Ling came to the Cloud Blood City, Golden Crane learned of this news and was extremely nervous. He specially arranged for sky-level experts to follow and protect her.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that just now, he saw the soul token of one of those sky-level experts shatter.</p><p></p><p>As members of the Thorn Blood, they would all leave a wisp of their soul in their soul tokens.</p><p></p><p>The shattering of the soul token meant that the expert had perished.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this news, how could Golden Crane not be alarmed?</p><p></p><p>The other sky-level experts were also rushing towards the place where that sky-level expert had died.</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation?" Golden Crane's voice was gloomy and terrible.</p><p></p><p>The princess's death, they all could not escape responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Probably they would not die, but at least have to peel off a layer of skin.</p><p></p><p>As for that person, he wished he could eat his flesh and drink his bones.</p><p></p><p>The Tenth Elder's expression was also very ugly: "The princess was collecting road tolls at the city gate, and a mortal... not only did he not pay, but he also slapped the princess to death with one hand! Even Dragon Food, who was protecting the princess, was also slapped to death with one hand!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Food was the sky-level expert protecting the princess, although his strength was not outstanding, he was still a sky-level expert! But he was killed with a single slap? How could Golden Crane not be shocked? Now, the powerful experts of the Cloud Blood City had gathered, their momentum fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Slapping Dragon Food to death with one hand, his strength must be extremely powerful, but no matter what, for killing the princess, he must die today!" Golden Crane said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Li Zha is currently contacting him, trying to probe his depth!" the Tenth Elder said.</p><p></p><p>Li Zha was also a sky-level expert, best at speed and escaping, so he was the one to probe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the other powerful experts of the Thorn Blood, they were now gathered in a group, hiding in the dark, preparing to strike with thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>If they did not strike, it would be fine, but once they did, it would be earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the street, Li Zha looked at the man in front of him, his expression angry.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you've done?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily, his expression as casual as ever: "I just wanted to come into the city to have breakfast, but someone was blocking the city gate, collecting a hundred taels of silver for passage! </p><p></p><p>How many steamed buns could that buy? I complained to the city guards, but they didn't listen to me!</p><p></p><p>The head of the city guards was standing behind that thief, nodding and fawning like a lackey! Where is the justice, where is the righteousness? Since no one upheld justice for me, as an honest person, I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His original intention was very simple, to go find the Thorn Blood and tell them, I want to become mortal, don't disturb me, otherwise the consequences will be dire.</p><p></p><p>He was still very good at talking, persuading with reason.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if reason didn't work, he would flexibly change his approach and use force to prevail! Hearing this, Li Zha felt only ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Killing a princess just for a few hundred taels of silver? This person is sick!</p><p></p><p>"You're done for, killing the princess, you have no chance of survival, you will surely die today!" Li Zha said in a deep voice, "Soon someone will come for you, and that will be your death!"</p><p></p><p>Li Zha finished speaking, without any hesitation, he flew away.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's strength was too powerful, he didn't dare to confront the other party, and could only leave after uttering a stern warning.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't run away!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Were these people too slack?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he now had to become mortal, unable to use divine sense, otherwise he could have easily found the hidden enemies around and slaughtered them.</p><p></p><p>For now, he could only proceed step by step towards the enemy's lair.</p><p></p><p>After about tens of breaths, a disdainful voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"You have guts to dare come to the inner city!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger had his arms crossed, with a fierce tiger head, exuding an overbearing aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Blood Tiger, with a look of hesitation and seriousness.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the backup they were looking for?"</p><p></p><p>"Now that you've seen the master, you should kneel down!" Blood Tiger said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>His voice was loud and hoarse.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was extremely vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his eyes were deceiving him? Was the other party a true powerhouse? Otherwise, how dare he block him with such cultivation? Or was it that the people of Cloud Blood City had gone mad and sent a small weakling tiger to stop him?</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, you are my opponent, and I will respect you." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His heart was also extremely alert.</p><p></p><p>"You also dare to be my opponent?" Blood Tiger sneered.</p><p></p><p>This overbearing manner, this self-confidence, a true supreme expert, made Qi Yuan wary.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are strong, you shouldn't use foul language!" Qi Yuan said dissatisfiedly, as his entire body's strength was gathering.</p><p></p><p>He was looking at Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Tiger was full of openings, he had a thousand ways to kill the other party with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare, he was hesitant.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was not a fool to dare come, he must have some skills.</p><p></p><p>Although his brows didn't indicate any danger.</p><p></p><p>But what if... the other party was a true powerhouse, deceiving his eyes and his brows?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you should commit suicide to atone, and I'll leave you a whole corpse." Blood Tiger said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I have to go all out!" Qi Yuan's expression became extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"I can crush you with just a finger!" Blood Tiger was insulting.</p><p></p><p>This was the bullying of the strong over the weak!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>You're too arrogant! Just because you're strong, you can insult my character!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's veins popped up, and the blood flow in his body also became abnormal, his face flushed red, like a red fever.</p><p></p><p>He was gathering power!</p><p></p><p>Gathering power!</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger sneered with disdain, his expression lazy: "Hurry up and attack, I'm in a hurry!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>This voice was like a thunderclap on a clear day.</p><p></p><p>However, after the thunderclap, something more terrifying happened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's right foot suddenly stomped the ground! "Break!"</p><p></p><p>Endless power burst forth at this moment. At this moment, he held nothing back. All the power was fully unleashed and vented.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The sound of the ground cracking!</p><p></p><p>The sound of the howling wind! The sound of the roof being blown away!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a tornado had passed through, no, even more terrifying than a tornado.</p><p></p><p>The huge power, like a nuclear bomb sweeping the ground, swept through the inner city area.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, countless houses collapsed, stone pillars were blown away! In an instant, it was a scene of devastation!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, more than a dozen terrifying figures fell from the sky, disheveled and miserable.</p><p></p><p>These dozen or so figures were all Heavenly Realm experts! They had been hiding in the sky, secretly observing Qi Yuan, preparing to ambush him.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that Qi Yuan's one-foot stomp would shock them down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan didn't even look at these dozen or so Heavenly Realm experts, his gaze fell on Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"You are very strong, unfathomable!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise, "Even if my attack speed is very slow, with your strength, you should be able to easily dodge it, yet you remain motionless, obviously not caring about my attack at all."</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't care, his attack would be nothing to Blood Tiger, so he had to avoid Blood Tiger, otherwise, what if Blood Tiger absorbed the power of this attack?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the dozen or so Heavenly Realm experts had fallen to the ground, their faces full of terror.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that they were also frightened by Qi Yuan's one strike. A foot stomping the ground to crack the earth, is this the power of a human?</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Blood Tiger's body was stiff, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>What did he see? That ordinary human, stomping his foot, as if it was a joke.</p><p></p><p>The result... Heaven and earth collapsed! Then... the Heavenly Realm experts fell down like dumplings! What should he do? What should he do? Damn! He was panicked, anxious, afraid, his legs were trembling terribly, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>He now had some understanding.</p><p></p><p>Why those Heavenly Realm experts were mobilized, it was just to deal with this human monster.</p><p></p><p>But... he dared to block the path?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the communication talisman transmitted the voice of Blood Tiger's Sect Leader.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Tiger Lord, there was a huge tremor in the inner city just now, did something big happen?</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger Lord, can you capture that little human? Now that this strange sound has appeared, this humble one is really worried about Blood Tiger Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger saw this message, and was so angry that he wanted to curse the Sect Leader's mother!</p><p></p><p>Little human? </p><p></p><p>The one who shook the inner city with a single foot is a little human?</p><p></p><p>Am I safe now?</p><p></p><p>Safe your ass!</p><p></p><p>He had a belly full of words, just wanting to greet the Sect Leader's mother after death!</p><p></p><p>"Your leg muscles are constantly trembling, are you releasing power? What a terrifying power release method!" At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Blood Tiger and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, his gaze swept towards these Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"Before I fight with you, let me clean up these little bugs first, otherwise... it will affect our battle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face revealed a murderous intent as he looked at those Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Those Heavenly Realm experts heard this and their spirits were shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crane Pill Cultivator turned into a golden flash and frantically flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"He can't fly, go up to the sky!" Li Jia shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Qi Yuan met them, he had always said that he had innate divine power and did not cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Now Li Jia believed it.</p><p></p><p>This is true divine power!</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't cultivate, they didn't feel the aura of a cultivator on Qi Yuan, so they probably couldn't fly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, these dozen or so Heavenly Realm experts quickly flew towards the sky, flying higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they were stunned unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>Now that they are in the sky, they are prepared, they feel that as long as Qi Yuan cannot fly, he cannot hurt them.</p><p></p><p>And they... can attack from the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, even though they were flying very fast, there were still two unlucky ones who were kicked out by Qi Yuan with two stones, crushing them to death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Heavenly Realm experts in the sky, his face revealing a dissatisfied expression: "Are you bullying me for not having a mount?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan missed Shen Lingxuan a bit, if he rode her, he could fly up and slay all of them.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you don't know... that I use technology, which is not considered supernatural, right?"</p><p></p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>With these words, two mechanical wings extended from his back, full of technological sense.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

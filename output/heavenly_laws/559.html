        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan and the Marquis of Qingfeng went to the Domain City, the days of the Yu family have been very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>How could it not be comfortable? The Venerable Qingfeng himself came and took Lin Yuan away, what an honor! How many people in the entire Qingfeng Domain can boast of this? "The Domain City is too big, full of scheming and intrigue, I don't know if our son Xiao Yan will get used to it there."</p><p></p><p>Yuchi Ling sighed, worried about his son.</p><p></p><p>"To achieve great accomplishments, one must go to greater places." Yu Chaolong said beside him: "If Xiao Yan stays in the Yu family, no matter how talented he is, he will be buried. At most, he will only be on par with our elders in the future."</p><p></p><p>"But by going to the Domain City and staying by the Marquis of Qingfeng's side, Xiao Yan has a great chance of breaking through to the Sovereign realm, or even..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong had an unspoken thought in his heart - Xiao Yan might even have a slim chance of touching the realm of the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>There were not a few disciples under the Marquis of Qingfeng who had reached the Sovereign realm, but none of them had received any special attention from this Venerable-level expert.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a bit worried." Yuchi Ling said: "Worried that Xiao Yan will be bullied in the Domain City, after all, his strength is still so weak now."</p><p></p><p>"Bullied?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong fell silent for a moment. Openly, no one would dare to bully Xiao Yan with the Marquis of Qingfeng's favor, but what about in the dark or more subtle ways?</p><p></p><p>A tree that stands out in the forest is bound to be blown down by the wind.</p><p></p><p>With the Marquis of Qingfeng's obvious favoritism towards Xiao Yan, how would the other senior disciples think? It might not matter in the short term, but in the long run, having only love without strength is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong couldn't help but start worrying as well.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Outside, there was a spatial disturbance, and a figure descended, rushing into the Yu family immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, there is a major event happening in the Domain City." This figure was a powerful expert of the Yu family, responsible for collecting information from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Domain City? Major event?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong's heart tightened, his son was currently in the Domain City, could it be related to Xiao Yan?</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Yuchi Ling also had a similar thought, his expression becoming tense as well.</p><p></p><p>"What major event has happened in the Domain City?" </p><p></p><p>Several Yu family elders appeared, their expressions grave.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yan, Young Master Yan..." The Yu family expert who had stopped paused, his expression filled with disbelief, obviously also shocked by the news he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to Xiao Yan?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong's brow furrowed, even if Xiao Yan had caused some major trouble in the Domain City, there was no need to be so evasive about it.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yan has become a Venerable."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone, including the Yu family elders, was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Venerable?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan?</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense are you spouting?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, this is absolutely true, the Marquis of Qingfeng said so himself." The Yu family expert immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He also thought it was false when he first heard the news, but after multiple confirmations, especially regarding the chaos in the Purple Dream Domain and the attack on Qingfeng City, he finally confirmed that their young master had indeed become a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Let me inquire about this."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders looked at each other and immediately contacted their friends to gather information about the situation in the Domain City.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong did the same.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders opened their eyes, their expressions filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if they didn't inquire, at this moment, many forces would have actively contacted the Yu family to inform them of this matter, trying to establish a good relationship with the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"It's true, Xiao Yan has indeed become a Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"According to the Marquis of Qingfeng, a long time ago, he happened to pass by the Yu family and discovered Xiao Yan's extraordinary talent, so he took Xiao Yan as his disciple."</p><p></p><p>"However, this matter was not made public until Xiao Yan broke through to the Venerable realm, and the Marquis of Qingfeng, upon learning of this, personally came to take Xiao Yan away."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Xiao Yan actually broke through to the Venerable realm while in our Yu family? Such a well-kept secret, and I, as an elder, was completely unaware of it?"</p><p></p><p>"And that Eastern Yang family? They dared to attack Xiao Yan? Attack a Venerable? Haha, it's a wonder that Xiao Yan didn't bother to retaliate at the time."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders were overwhelmed with excitement and emotion.</p><p></p><p>They had no doubt about this statement, after all, without the Marquis of Qingfeng's secret guidance and cultivation, how could Lin Yuan have broken through to the Venerable realm?</p><p></p><p>"My son, has become a Venerable?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong was also deeply shocked. Originally, he thought Xiao Yan would only have a slim chance of touching the threshold of the Venerable realm after countless years, but now he has already achieved it?</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yan" Yuchi Ling was also overjoyed. At least as a Venerable, Xiao Yan would not be bullied by anyone in the entire Domain City.</p><p></p><p>"Many forces have already expressed a desire to visit our Yu family." One of the Yu family elders said.</p><p></p><p>Visiting the Yu family was essentially visiting Xiao Yan, the newly ascended Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, I think the most urgent task right now is to purify the atmosphere within our Yu family." Yu Chaolong said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when Lin Yuan was taken by the Marquis of Qingfeng to the Domain City, the Yu family became a top-tier family, and Yu Chaolong had vaguely sensed that the members of the Yu family were starting to become arrogant and overbearing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong had some opinions about this and planned to rectify it after some time.</p><p></p><p>Now that the news of Xiao Yan becoming a Venerable has arrived, Yu Chaolong felt that he could no longer wait.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, those Yu family members, taking advantage of Lin Yuan's reputation, might do something bad or disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong was very self-aware, he couldn't help Lin Yuan, but he absolutely wouldn't allow anyone to drag Lin Yuan down.</p><p></p><p>"This is natural."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders nodded in agreement upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>If the clan members were arrogant and unrestrained, it definitely wouldn't be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng City, Fenzhen Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Marquis of Qingfeng sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"So that Purple Dream, was actually plotting this!"</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Qingfeng looked at the Myriad Formation Crystal in Lin Yuan's hand, suddenly feeling a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Marquis of Puple Dream had consumed a portion of his true body's origin power to hold back the Marquis of Qingfeng, and then used hundreds of peak Sovereign realm puppets to wreak havoc in Qingfeng City.</p><p></p><p>Secretly, he had his disciples wield the Myriad Formation Crystal to replicate many of the major formations within the city.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, even if the Marquis of Qingfeng had some suspicions, it would be too late. As long as this Myriad Formation Crystal, which could replicate the city's major formations, fell into the Marquis of Purple Dream's hands, it would be equivalent to rendering all of Qingfeng City's defensive formations useless.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of this were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Purple Dream only needed to gather a few Venerable-level experts, and he could easily invade Qingfeng City. At that time, the entire Qingfeng Domain would fall.</p><p></p><p>"I was lucky." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the purple-haired woman's Myriad Formation Crystal, Lin Yuan also roughly understood their plot.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, fortunately you were there."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Qingfeng's tone carried a hint of relief. If it wasn't for Lin Yuan, allowing the purple-haired woman and her group to leave Qingfeng City with the Myriad Formation Crystal, how could he be sitting here so calmly? It might not even be the case, because the Marquis of Qingfeng was not sure where the true crux of the Purple Dream Domain's plan lay. Even if he had some guesses, he couldn't be certain.</p><p></p><p>"This time, that Purple Dream has really suffered a loss. This Myriad Formation Crystal should have been bestowed by the upper echelons of the ancient kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"She lost it, so she will definitely be punished."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder when I broke free from the woven dream, her expression was like that."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Marquis of Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, the Marquis of Purple Dream had undoubtedly suffered a heavy loss.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how valuable this Myriad Formation Crystal is?" Lin Yuan asked, caressing the crystal in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Formation Crystal has great strategic value for a force, but its significance to Lin Yuan is not that great.</p><p></p><p>As for the many major formations contained within it? Lin Yuan had already comprehended their essence during the time he had the Myriad Formation Crystal.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, Lin Yuan has now grasped the essence of this Myriad Formation Crystal, and he can replicate the major formations contained within it at any time. Lin Yuan himself is a Myriad Formation Crystal.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to sell this Myriad Formation Crystal?" The Marquis of Qingfeng looked at Lin Yuan, slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now, the resources he needs for his daily cultivation and further advancement are truly massive. Relying on the Marquis of Qingfeng alone? Lin Yuan feels a bit uncomfortable, and the Marquis of Qingfeng won't be able to support him for long either.</p><p></p><p>Although the ability of the Blazing Sun Divine Body to burn and devour is one of its capabilities, and any external object can become a cultivation resource for Lin Yuan, the impact caused is too great. Occasionally devouring a few things is no problem, but using it as a daily cultivation method? It would easily attract the attention of the true powerhouses of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Formation Crystal is very valuable and easy to sell." </p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Qingfeng thought for a moment and said, "Leave this matter to me. I'll contact some buyers who have a need for the Myriad Formation Crystal."</p><p></p><p>As a well-known peak Venerable expert, the Marquis of Qingfeng naturally knows many friends.</p><p></p><p>And with the Marquis of Qingfeng's backing, selling the Myriad Formation Crystal would be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fenshao took the lead, and this Myriad Formation Crystal could be sold at the highest price. If Lin Yuan went to sell it himself, he would easily fall into a trap.</p><p></p><p>The details of selling the Myriad Formation Crystal were finalized.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Qingfan Marquis then turned the topic to the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of the Purple Dream has laid out such a plan, surely he will not give up easily," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>From stalling Qingfan Marquis to using the Myriad Formation Crystal to replicate the formations within the city, it was one scheme after another, demonstrating the Marquis of the Purple Dream's determination to seize Qingfan City and even the entire Qingfan Domain.</p><p></p><p>Now that the plan has failed, would the Marquis of the Purple Dream really give up? And the actions against Qingfan City might not necessarily come from the Marquis of the Purple Dream, the Myriad Formation Crystal was most likely bestowed by the upper echelons of the Ancient Country, and the one truly wanting to make a move against Qingfan City was likely a high-ranking official of the Ancient Country where the Purple Dream Domain is located.</p><p></p><p>"I naturally know this," Qingfan Marquis nodded, with his speed of thought, he had naturally deduced many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be leaving now, a few of my good friends are quite interested in your Myriad Formation Crystal."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis stood up and left.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Fenzhen Courtyard became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned to the "Purple Dream Domain." He soon stopped thinking about it further. Given his understanding of the Purple Dream Domain and the opposing Ancient Country, Qingfan Marquis must be far superior to him. As for how to deal with the Purple Dream Domain next, Qingfan Marquis knows what to do.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan needs to do now is to continue cultivating and continue to improve his strength. No matter when or where, improving one's strength is always the right thing to do, as the strong are respected in any world.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Seeds I have now condensed have reached more than 30,001, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue condensing new Blazing Sun Seeds," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after reaching 30,000 Blazing Sun Seeds, the difficulty of condensation increased dozens of times, and after reaching 30,001, it increased dozens of times again.</p><p></p><p>"At the current rate of condensing Blazing Sun Seeds, it will take an estimated 600 to 700 years to condense 33,333 Blazing Sun Seeds," Lin Yuan estimated.</p><p></p><p>This is based on the premise that each subsequent Blazing Sun Seed is more difficult to condense than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still have a gap compared to those core imperial clans of the Ancient Countries."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the increasing difficulty of cultivation, at least in the aspect of condensing Blazing Sun Seeds, he still envies those core imperial clans who can condense Blazing Sun Seeds even while sleeping.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan didn't know was that even for the core imperial clans of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country with the most abundant bloodline, condensing Blazing Sun Seeds is not an easy task, especially after exceeding 20,000 Blazing Sun Seeds, they also struggle greatly.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline advantage? Blazing Sun Radiance? They can only drive the condensation of Blazing Sun Seeds. Even for the core imperial clans of the Ancient Country, after condensing 30,000 Blazing Sun Seeds, the time required to condense each additional one is calculated in tens of thousands to millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Condensing while sleeping? Sleeping for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of years is normal.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly. I'm in no hurry," Lin Yuan collected his thoughts. In this Source World, he has no time limit, so there's no need to be so urgent in his cultivation, he'll just take it step by step.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Blazing Sun Seeds, there's also my Seventh Bodily Divine Ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the root source power interweaving and tempering deep within his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"The Bodily Divine Ability I've condensed now is likely related to the Blazing Sun Ancestor, or perhaps it's a certain talent of this Thirteenth Tier Time Life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, all beings capable of condensing Blazing Sun Seeds have the bloodline of the Blazing Sun Ancestor, albeit extremely diluted.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how diluted, as long as it exists, it can be condensed through the path of martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Dream Domain, in the depths of the domain capital, stood a grand palace. The Marquis of the Purple Dream, dressed in a purple robe, stood quietly there.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and a series of figures descended, appearing in the palace. These figures were clearly incarnations, but to dare stand alongside the Marquis of the Purple Dream, they must all be Supremacy-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Dream, not only did your scheme fail, but you also lost the Myriad Formation Crystal bestowed by the Prince?" a deep voice sounded, and the other appearing figures turned their gaze towards the Marquis of the Purple Dream.</p><p></p><p>"I will personally explain this matter to the Prince," the Marquis of the Purple Dream said after a moment of silence. "However, there was another Supremacy-level expert hidden within Qingfan City, the disciple secretly cultivated by Qingfan Marquis, this intelligence I did not know."</p><p></p><p>If she had known earlier that there was a Supremacy-level expert hidden in Qingfan City, her scheme would certainly not have been like that, at least she would have arranged for a Supremacy-level expert to infiltrate the city.</p><p></p><p>"Failure is failure, what's there to explain," another figure said coldly, looking at the Marquis of the Purple Dream.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not argue," another figure then spoke, "The Prince is here."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the figures in the palace immediately fell silent and stood still.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a vast consciousness descended, coalescing into a towering figure.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Prince," the figures bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the towering figure, known as the Might King, a Crowned King-level expert, looked around.</p><p></p><p>The Might King had become a Crowned King either by reaching the Celestial Venerable realm and receiving the country's enfeoffment, or by being of the imperial clan, with bloodline purity close to the core imperial clan and at least Supremacy-level cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This Might King had become a Crowned King through the latter method, with the ancestral bloodline flowing strongly within him.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, how should we now take Qingfan Domain," the Might King said lazily, his gaze lingering on the Marquis of the Purple Dream for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the matter of Qingfan City, he had also figured out the origins, knowing that it was not entirely the Marquis of the Purple Dream's fault. Who could have predicted that there was also a Supremacy-level expert hidden in Qingfan City? In fact, before taking action, the Marquis of the Purple Dream had already rehearsed this possibility, confirming the whereabouts of Qingfan Marquis's Supremacy-level friends and the Supremacy-level experts in the dozens of surrounding major domains.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any Supremacy-level friends of Qingfan Marquis from visiting during the planning period.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, they did not anticipate that Qingfan Marquis had secretly cultivated a Supremacy-level disciple? A Supremacy-level existence, hidden for so long? Could Qingfan Marquis really hold back?</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, now that Qingfan Marquis is on guard, it will be difficult to take Qingfan City at the lowest cost," one figure spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>This was the truth.</p><p></p><p>If the plan had gone smoothly, the Marquis of the Purple Dream would have replicated all the formations in Qingfan City, and then the Might King would have invited the formation masters of the Ancient Country to decipher them.</p><p></p><p>With the ability to completely control the formations inside and outside Qingfan City in the shortest time, the group of Supremacy-level experts could have infiltrated Qingfan City stealthily and launched a sudden attack.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if Qingfan Marquis survived, he would have had to flee in panic, and Qingfan City, or even the entire Qingfan Domain, would certainly not be saved.</p><p></p><p>But now? </p><p></p><p>They had almost completely lost the possibility of taking Qingfan City at the lowest cost.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, Qingfan Marquis would certainly report the matter to the upper echelons of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, and there might even be experts from the Ancient Country's capital hidden in Qingfan City at this very moment.</p><p></p><p>Even if the formations of Qingfan City were open, they would not dare to enter.</p><p></p><p>"Since we cannot take it at the lowest cost, then let's just take it normally," the Might King said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>As a newly crowned king, with only Supremacy-level cultivation, his prestige and strength were not enough, so he needed a war to establish his position.</p><p></p><p>To beings below Supremacy and Celestial Venerable in the major Ancient Countries, the imperial clan is highly respected and cannot be disobeyed.</p><p></p><p>But to Supremacy and Celestial Venerable experts? The so-called imperial clan is nothing more than having a bit more luck and a slightly more concentrated bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has the ancestral bloodline flowing within them, and if you have the bloodline concentration but not the strength and prestige, why should they listen to you?</p><p></p><p>Especially for Celestial Venerable experts, their strength has reached the pinnacle, and even those Supremacy-level core imperial clan members can only barely match them.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Venerable experts actually don't care much about the imperial clan of the Ancient Countries, they are willing to accept the country's enfeoffment mainly out of respect for the ancestral founder.</p><p></p><p>"Take it normally?" The Supremacy-level experts like the Marquis of the Purple Dream had a slight change in expression, this meant that a war between the two major Ancient Countries was about to break out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would only be a local war, involving at most dozens of major domains.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

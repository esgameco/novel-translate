        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his finger, and the turtle-like creature struggling with its limbs in the air was stupid and sluggish. It tried to grab and bite the finger, but its limbs were too short and its strength too weak to flip over.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying existence of the second layer of the Yang God, at this moment, was no different from a stupid and ordinary turtle. How could this not shock people?</p><p></p><p>The four people of Xian Ling, Ying Jun, and others looked at Qi Yuan, and the shock in their hearts was imaginable.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God hidden in Wu Chun's consciousness also revealed his figure at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, trembling her body and respectfully saluting.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior."</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also quickly snapped out of their daze and saluted respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's previous move had indeed stunned them.</p><p></p><p>The majestic existence of the second realm of the Yang God was easily grasped by the person in front of them.</p><p></p><p>What kind of realm was this?</p><p></p><p>Was it the legendary Great Principle?</p><p></p><p>As for the higher Realm Lords, they didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lords were to them as the Yang Gods were to mortals, the gap was too vast.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jun blinked his eyes, his expression twisted: "You... really became a Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>He remembered the message Qi Yuan had sent before.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Later, he convinced himself that if his brother could drive a Range Rover, he could accept it.</p><p></p><p>But now, his brother was actually driving a space battleship.</p><p></p><p>The rest were also shocked. Realm Lord? The cosmic overlord Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>This young man in front of them was a Realm Lord? "Yes, a Realm Lord, didn't I tell you already? Could it be that you also have amnesia and forgot?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jun's mood was up and down, he stared at Qi Yuan, his thoughts endless.</p><p></p><p>As for the expressions of the other three, they were even more spectacular.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord, it was the legendary Realm Lord!</p><p></p><p>In the universe of Zhou, the Realm Lords were high above, almost never appearing in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Gods might not have the qualifications to see a Realm Lord in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>But they actually saw... a living Realm Lord? However, in the next breath, Xian Ling Ying Jun's reaction made them unable to hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Hey... Brother Qi Yuan, cough cough, don't you owe me some favors?" Xian Ling Ying Jun was very bold, his expression fawning and ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>The other three were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>To directly address the Realm Lord by name, weren't they afraid of not even having a true spirit left? And directly telling the Realm Lord that he owed them a favor, that was also too lacking in emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Weren't they afraid that the Realm Lord would get angry and kill them all in a fit of rage?</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded, his reaction calm.</p><p></p><p>"How about this... I'll call you... Grandpa?" Xian Ling Ying Jun shamelessly said.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to be an adoptive father or godfather, after all, the Realm Lord was too far above him.</p><p></p><p>The three around him felt that Xian Ling Ying Jun was audacious and shameless, but they didn't dare to show any expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not familiar with this Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>If... this Realm Lord killed them, no one could save them.</p><p></p><p>They also didn't dare to speculate on the Realm Lord's thoughts, after all, the existence of that realm was like ants trying to fathom the gods.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The Ominous Source, the division of the Black Sky Origin, has unlimited energy and a polluting nature... Where the Ominous Source is, the Black Sky is present.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Ominous Source in his hand, a curious expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>From this Yang God, Qi Yuan had extracted a strand of the Ominous Source.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ominous Source on Kai Huang, since it had been activated, it could not be extracted.</p><p></p><p>The Ominous Source in front of him was about the size of a long grain of rice, crystal clear, and dazzling to the mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Ominous God of the Black Sky and Black Earth wants to invade the universe of Zhou through the Ominous Source..."</p><p></p><p>Through the Ominous Source and the turtle-like Yang God, Qi Yuan learned a lot.</p><p></p><p>This Yang God of the Black Sky and Black Earth was using the Ominous Source to pollute and fish.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Garden, there were many tasks to record the aura of the Ominous Source.</p><p></p><p>Many Void Travelers came to the Shen Mu Universe to record the aura of the Ominous Source.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the Yang God of the Black Sky and Black Earth would take action, control these Void Travelers, and implant the Ominous Source in their true spirits, and then have them bring it into the Void Garden.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Ominous Source would take root in the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>To the Black Sky and Black Earth, the universe of Zhou was the second Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Black Sky and Black Earth so confident?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The universe of Zhou was not the Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe of Zhou had the existence of the Opening Heaven Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength alone, a hundred or even a thousand Shen Mu Universes would not be a match for the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky and Black Earth actually had the confidence to make a move on the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sky... what exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I really want to see the Black Sky once."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>If he could see the Black Sky with his own eyes, he would know the roots of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see what this so-called Black Sky was.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Yuexian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng, dressed in black, looked like an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingmiao was drinking a little wine, with a hint of a lost expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qingmiao, the matter has come to this, there is no use in being sad." Shangguan Qingteng comforted.</p><p></p><p>They two had followed Yan's orders and rushed from the Tai Star Domain to the Chaotic Star Domain to rescue the talented Qi Yuan who had the potential to break through to the Ancestor God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before they left, the Qingyu Army, Zhanxing Army, Tuoxing Army, and a total of seventeen major armies from the Tai Star Domain rushed to the front lines to block the Black Sky and Black Earth's main forces.</p><p></p><p>These major armies, when added together, numbered over a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>They marched in a hurry, without a moment's rest, rushing forward one after another, undaunted by wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>It took them three years to march, and as soon as they arrived at the battlefield, they rushed to the very front lines. In less than three months... they were all wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Sweat and flesh and blood filled the front lines.</p><p></p><p>But the result... the front lines still fell.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving this news, Shangguan Qingmiao's mood was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Deeply grieved.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, you say... were their deaths worth it? Can the later generations... protect this great land?" Shangguan Qingmiao had a look of deep sorrow.</p><p></p><p>This was not the only such example.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the number of heroic souls buried on the front lines of the Shen Mu Universe was countless, perhaps in the hundreds of millions.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea was like a large-scale meat grinder.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's eyes were filled with a sense of helplessness as he sighed, "Do our best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>Surrendering meant certain death, and resisting also meant death, but at least... it would be dying on their feet.</p><p></p><p>"I say, it's better to join the Guangyao Association. Maybe we'll have a slim chance of survival!" Shangguan Qingmiao said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's eyes flashed with a profound look: "In this universe, there can be those who compromise, but there also need to be those who dare to fight, and we happen to be the ones who dare to fight."</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyao Association, the highest leader on the Shenmuwuzhou side was Wan, the brother of Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Yuan chose the path of enlightening the people.</p><p></p><p>Wan chose the path of enlightening the gods.</p><p></p><p>If the enlightenment of the people fails, the enlightenment of the gods can carry the torch of Shenmuwuzhou to the Yaoguang Universe and rekindle it.</p><p></p><p>Of course... will the Yaoguang Universe, being the good guys, just let you live? That is something no one can predict.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I've always been arrogant and overbearing. I can't be a lackey in the Guangyao Association." Shangguan Qingmiao muttered as he drained his cup of wine.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng tapped the table, his mood also somewhat melancholy: "Once we take Qi Yuan to the Taixing Domain, if he can break through to the Ancestor God Realm, it will also be an enhancement of our combat power."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the elder said that Qi Yuan's talent is very high, and in the future, he may have the chance to break through to the second realm of the Ancestor God." Shangguan Qingmiao said with an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered good news.</p><p></p><p>What the Taixing Domain lacks the most now is high-end combat power.</p><p></p><p>The plans of enlightening the people and enlightening the gods have been unfolding for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The number of forging masters who have died for this is countless.</p><p></p><p>The treasures of the enlightenment of the people now have seven pieces.</p><p></p><p>Facing the invasion of Hei Tian and Hei Di, Shenmuwuzhou is no longer powerless, no longer like the time when Yuan went alone to the Void Sea to deal with enemies many times stronger.</p><p></p><p>Now, what is most lacking is high-level combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, now that Hei Tian and Hei Di are invading, we can also bite off a piece of their bone." Shangguan Qingmiao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>As for the final outcome, they knew it, but does knowing it mean they won't resist? "Hmph, even though they have the Divinities Source that can be infinitely resurrected, we can still exhaust them!" Shangguan Qingteng said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he also knew that the Divinities Source was endless and could not be exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Didn't they see that the Lord of the Void Realm in the Zhou Universe didn't even want to provoke Hei Tian and Hei Di?</p><p></p><p>But being able to bite off a piece of Hei Tian's flesh was also a good thing for them.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it's not good!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a divine-level Armored Soldier came over with an anxious expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Shangguan Qingteng had a foreboding feeling.</p><p></p><p>"The recent transportation formations may not be usable." The divine-level Armored Soldier said.</p><p></p><p>Transporting Ancestor God-level experts requires a huge amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>So Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao were waiting here, waiting for the person from the Enlightenment Association to open the passage, and then transport them to the Guijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" Shangguan Qingmiao asked quickly.</p><p></p><p>"I heard... that 15 Yang Gods have gone to the Guijin Realm, and the surrounding worlds... have all been put under martial law. No one knows what big event has happened in the Guijin Realm." The divine-level Armored Soldier said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's expression changed slightly: "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>He had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yuan had once said that the 99 Divinities Gods in the Guijin Realm were hunting Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightener of the Guijin Realm was a famous Second Generation Ancestor, who had many treasures that could surround and kill Mythical Experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, dozens of Yang Gods are rushing to the Guijin Realm, which means... the Enlightener has most likely been slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It is very likely that Qi Yuan has broken through to the Yang God Realm in the battle.</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Dozens of Yang Gods... Qi Yuan will definitely die."</p><p></p><p>With dozens of Yang Gods attacking, not to mention Qi Yuan who has just broken through to the Ancestor God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the two of them joined forces, they would probably have a hard time dealing with it.</p><p></p><p>"No, we can only do it forcefully now, break into the transportation formation, and take Qi Yuan to flee to the Taixing Domain, that's the only chance!" Shangguan Qingteng said.</p><p></p><p>This is the only opportunity, they must seize every second and cannot hesitate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Shangguan Qingmiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this action, if not careful, would lead to their own deaths in the chaotic star domain, but there was no better way.</p><p></p><p>They could die, but those who could wield the enlightenment of the people... must not die.</p><p></p><p>They were the hope of Shenmuwuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two terrifying auras burst into the sky and rushed towards the transportation formation.</p><p></p><p>When the two of them acted, their auras were shocking.</p><p></p><p>The Divinities Gods who tried to block them didn't even have a moment's time before they perished.</p><p></p><p>Since they have taken action, it also means exposing themselves, and what awaits them next will be endless pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Guijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a lazy mood.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, no one has disturbed me, the progress of my Transcendence has sped up a lot."</p><p></p><p>Now, the progress of his Transcendence has reached 10%.</p><p></p><p>There is still some distance to reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>"If I can just lie here peacefully for another three or four years, I estimate I can complete the Transcendence."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to sense something, and an expression of helplessness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, gold will shine wherever it is."</p><p></p><p>"With my handsome looks, even if I stay at home every day, those Divinities Gods can still find me and stop my Transcendence."</p><p></p><p>"So... should I just slaughter all the Divinities Gods in the Chaotic Star Domain? Maybe then I can peacefully complete my Transcendence?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>No one can stop his Transcendence! Just then, two terrifying auras suddenly transmitted from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Those two terrifying auras were enough to make the Divinities Gods uneasy.</p><p></p><p>A majestic voice also spread in all directions at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Qi Yuan? We are the Ancestor Gods of the Enlightenment Association, sent by Yuan to bring you to the Taixing Domain.</p><p></p><p>Now, dozens of Yang God-level Divinities Gods are chasing after us, we must leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>These two Ancestor Gods did not hesitate at all, directly and quickly stating their purpose.</p><p></p><p>Because they had already sensed that those dozens of Yang Gods were also rushing over, and would arrive very soon.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't leave now, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightenment Association?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Yuan to actually send people to pick him up.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Sect Master, it should be him who arranged this.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, now that my divine skills are perfected and I have become a Realm Lord, the enemies that come are nothing I can't easily slay." Qi Yuan responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, when Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao heard Qi Yuan's response, the joy on their faces turned to bewilderment the next moment.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan... didn't he just make his brain stupid? How could he be a Realm Lord? That's impossible.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, their figures appeared in Qi Yuan's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to explain, let's hurry, the Taixing Domain is safe."</p><p></p><p>The Guijin Realm is located in the war-torn area, this place is the territory of the Divinities Gods, they cannot stay here for long.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's safe here, I'm a Realm Lord, who dares to provoke me? And I'm now busy with my Transcendence to break through to the Yang God Realm, I don't have time to go to the Taixing Domain with you." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shangguan Qingmiao was speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan really has damaged his brain, his words are all over the place.</p><p></p><p>Just now he said he was a Realm Lord, and now he's talking about Transcending to the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

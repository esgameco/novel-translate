            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 451 Doubts of the Strongest Humans (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Four seconds ago.</p><p>There were still tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm experts fighting.</p><p></p><p>Four seconds later.</p><p>There were less than a hundred of the mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts left, struggling to resist.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly, and a large number of supreme weapons and scattered treasures were all absorbed into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Treasures that could withstand the crushing power of the four successive worlds were essentially priceless.</p><p>The slightly inferior ones had already been crushed and turned into resources for cultivating the "Mysterious Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>On the human civilization alliance side.</p><p>Xuanyuan You and the other perfected Eleventh-Realm evolutions stared blankly at the unfolding events on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Originally, under the threat of the Nightmare Realm's insect race mother nest, Xuanyuan You had planned to use the backup bestowed by the Xuanyuan Supremes to resist the influence of the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p>He hadn't even used it yet, and the many Eleventh-Realm experts of the insect race alliance had been reduced to just five or six struggling insect race mother nests, with the rest annihilated, countless insect race warriors turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Xuanyuan You's thoughts were almost at a standstill, the scene before his eyes was so clear, but his instincts still found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm experts from other races, just gone like that?</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galactic Overlord!"</p><p>Xuanyuan You looked towards the distant Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Under the enveloping of the outer world, all the Eleventh-Realm experts from other races were suppressed, but the Eleventh-Realm experts of the human civilization alliance were not subjected to this treatment.</p><p></p><p>But with Xuanyuan You's strength, he immediately noticed the changes in the surrounding space-time, and the source of the change was that distant Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"They're dead, all dead."</p><p>A nearby perfected Eleventh-Realm evolution muttered, the sight before him clearly had a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>When did Eleventh-Realm experts die in such large numbers like ants?</p><p>This was the Eleventh Realm!</p><p>Not just some random cabbage by the roadside.</p><p></p><p>Even for Supremes, they wouldn't attack so many Eleventh-Realm experts, because this would easily provoke retaliation from other Supremes.</p><p>You slaughter our Eleventh-Realm experts, then we'll slaughter yours.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord!!"</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm Tian Yao turned, and the holy angel crown she wore cast a heavy light curtain, blocking the crushing power of the four successive worlds.</p><p>As the Tian Yao clan's ancestral weapon, the holy angel crown was versatile, excelling in both defense and suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord? How can the Galactic Overlord be so strong?"</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm expert of the Jie clan was also disbelieving. In the first second of the world's crushing, he sensed something was wrong and immediately fled towards the distance.</p><p>But under the world's suppression, he hadn't even gone far before he was subjected to the crushing of the four worlds.</p><p>The crushing power of the four successive worlds, even for the mighty Eleventh-Realm Jie clan expert, was somewhat overwhelming, causing injuries to his physical body and soul.</p><p>This was with the protection of the life-saving methods bestowed by the Jie clan Supremes, if he didn't have those, he might have already died.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a powerful life form below the Twelfth Realm?"</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm Jie clan expert was incredulous, as the one with the greatest hope of breaking through to the Twelfth Realm among the Jie clan, he understood many secrets about cultivation.</p><p>He was very clear about the limits of the Eleventh Realm.</p><p>In a sense, he was already at the pinnacle of the Eleventh Realm.</p><p>But now, in the face of Lin Yuan, the so-called Eleventh Realm limit was simply a joke.</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts of the Tian Yao clan and the Jie clan could not comprehend Lin Yuan's terrifying strength.</p><p>But one thing was clear to all the experts, and that was to flee.</p><p>Flee as far away as possible.</p><p>If they stayed any longer, they would die.</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts of the various peak clans were already struggling under the first wave of the crushing world power.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment.</p><p>The fifth second quietly arrived.</p><p>The fifth wave of the crushing world power began to descend.</p><p>This wave of world power crushing caused another third of the remaining mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts to be eliminated.</p><p>Experts like 'Qu Li Xiao' who did not have ancestral weapons to protect them had their physical bodies and souls shattered one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Can't wait any longer."</p><p>The mightiest Eleventh-Realm Jie clan expert roared, his eyes like two universes, weaving mysterious powers to directly tear open a black spatial rift, then instantly fled the range of the outer world's envelopment.</p><p>Immediately after, Tian Meng and the other mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts wielding ancestral weapons also did the same, unleashing attacks with tens of thousands of battle power indices contained in the Supremes' backup methods, forcibly tearing open space and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"They actually escaped from the domain of my 'World' divine ability?"</p><p>Lin Yuan, through causal perception, roughly pinpointed the locations of those mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts, instantly appearing at the edge of the battlefield, and his causal and other aspects were quickly weakened, apparently completely concealing himself.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the true power of the Twelfth Realm?"</p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the distance, quickly thinking.</p><p></p><p>Soon after the fifth wave of the crushing world power descended, more than twenty of the mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts used their last resort methods to tear open space and leave the core battlefield area.</p><p></p><p>"No choice."</p><p>"Even if I detonated the outer world in the first second, I couldn't kill them. In the instant of being on the verge of death, those Supreme methods would automatically activate, taking them far away."</p><p>Lin Yuan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, dealing with Eleventh-Realm experts, even those wielding Supreme weapons, was easy. But if the Twelfth Realm ultimate existences intervened, he would not be able to subdue them.</p><p>Although those Twelfth Realm ultimate existences did not directly intervene on the battlefield, the backup methods left in the ancestral weapons were also a form of indirect interference.</p><p></p><p>"Well then."</p><p>"Only twenty-plus escaped."</p><p>Lin Yuan looked back at the remaining mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Not every mightiest Eleventh-Realm expert carried ancestral weapons, those without ancestral weapons would find it difficult to tear open the space enveloped by the outer world, and basically impossible to escape.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining Eleventh-Realm experts can't withstand the sixth wave of world crushing, no need to detonate the world."</p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>If the mightiest Eleventh-Realm Jie clan expert was still there, for the sake of safety, Lin Yuan would detonate the world.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Those mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts had all fled, so there was no need to reveal the strongest aspect of the 'World' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The sixth wave of world crushing descended.</p><p></p><p>The remaining mightiest Eleventh-Realm experts from the various peak clans were one by one shattered in body and soul under the world crushing, leaving only numerous treasures floating in the air, which were finally absorbed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whew!!!</p><p>The fluctuations of the 'World' divine ability slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Six seconds later, on the once vast and expansive battlefield, only the Eleventh-Realm experts of the human civilization alliance remained, as for the other Eleventh-Realm experts from the other races? They were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The main city was destroyed, with only around twenty people managing to escape.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied with this outcome. All the Eleventh-Realm experts sent by the various peak civilizations were completely wiped out, which was probably unprecedented in the long history of this universe.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some peak civilizations had lost half of their Eleventh-Realm experts before, but for all the peak civilizations, including the Qie Clan, to suffer such a complete defeat had never happened.</p><p></p><p>"This is really something."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly scanned the world within his body. Numerous top-tier weapons were placed in the corners, as if they were worthless. Apart from the top-tier weapons, there were also many other rare treasures of the Twelve Realms, as well as backup plans left behind by the Twelfth-Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>By traversing the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had become the final victor. Excluding the treasures he had returned to human civilization, he had harvested nearly a hundred rare items, with about thirty of them being top-tier weapons.</p><p></p><p>But now? The number of top-tier weapons stored in Lin Yuan's inner world far exceeded thirty, perhaps even ten times that amount.</p><p></p><p>"With these resources, even if I can't cultivate my 'Mysterious Yellow Body' to the perfect Eleventh Realm, I can still take a big step towards that goal."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a joyful mood. The number of top-tier weapons he possessed now was probably even greater than the total amount of top-tier weapons collected and forged by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity... I couldn't get a single Clan-Pacifying Weapon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. However, upon further reflection, he accepted it. Even if a Clan-Pacifying Weapon was placed in front of him now, he might not dare to take it.</p><p></p><p>Due to their inherent nature, Clan-Pacifying Weapons could withstand the ultimate power of the Twelfth Realm. If Lin Yuan rashly took one into his inner world, he might end up inviting trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuanyuan You, leading a group of human Eleventh-Realm Perfected Evolutions, flew towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan glanced at Xuanyuan You, but his mind was still mostly focused on assessing the spoils in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped. The harvest was too bountiful, and Lin Yuan had yet to fully understand the uses of many of the treasures, so he could only ponder over them slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Now... what should we do now?" Xuanyuan You asked the question on his mind. Logically, with the large-scale war having begun, the Eleventh-Realm experts of the human civilization alliance should be engaged in fierce battles with the Eleventh-Realm experts of the alien civilizations.</p><p></p><p>But now, all the Eleventh-Realm alien experts had been dealt with by Lin Yuan alone.</p><p></p><p>This had left the Eleventh-Realm experts of the human civilization alliance unsure of what to do next.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for the response from the Twelfth-Realm Ultimates," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Everything that had happened on the massive battlefield was surely under the observation of the Twelfth-Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Now, they just needed to see what the other ten peak civilizations would do - whether they would surrender and cede the first battle control, or try to invest more Eleventh-Realm Evolutions.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Xuanyuan You nodded.</p><p></p><p>He should have thought of this earlier, but Lin Yuan's actions had left his mind in a daze, slowing down his thought processes, and he had been unable to calm his inner turmoil for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Outside the massive battlefield, the Twelfth-Realm Ultimates were also silent.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan had just arrived on the battlefield and was about to sweep away the Insect Clan Alliance with a stomp, some of the Twelfth-Realm Ultimates had sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>However, none of the Twelfth-Realm Ultimates had anticipated the result would be like this - in just six seconds, only the human civilization alliance remained out of the ten peak civilizations.</p><p></p><p>During that time, some Twelfth-Realm Ultimates had wanted to intervene, but the massive battlefield had been jointly forged by many Ultimates, and some of the control rights were in the hands of the human civilization's Supremes.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's Supremes were unwilling to allow interference, and the other Twelfth-Realm Ultimates found it difficult to break through the restrictions of the massive battlefield in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this applied not only to the alien Twelfth-Realm Ultimates, but also to the human civilization's Supremes. If they wanted to interfere with the events on the battlefield, without the consent of the other peak civilization Twelfth-Realm Ultimates, they would also have a hard time doing so in a short time.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutual restriction.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Xuanyuan, your human civilization's Galactic Overlord is really good, really good."</p><p></p><p>"The final trump card used by the Galactic Overlord, was it the ultimate foundation of your human civilization? To gain the first battle control, your human civilization was willing to use its ultimate foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"We've been defeated. This time, all ten peak civilizations have been defeated by the human civilization."</p><p></p><p>One Twelfth-Realm Ultimate after another looked towards the nine Supremes of the human civilization, their tones displeased and their expressions cold.</p><p></p><p>Although the Eleventh-Realm experts who had fallen on the battlefield were mostly just projections, the many top-tier weapons had all ended up in the hands of the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Those top-tier weapons were the accumulated results of the peak civilizations over many years, but they had all been taken by the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the restrictions of the massive battlefield, some Twelfth-Realm Ultimates might not have been able to resist the urge to intervene just now.</p><p></p><p>At least the Insect Clan's Empress Mothers and the Tian Yu Clan's Ancestors would probably have lost control, especially the Insect Clan, whose Insect Hives were already scarce. Their so-called "Insect Sea" tactic relied on the countless Insect Clan warriors born from the Hives, while the Hives themselves were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Xuanyuan's face broke into a smile, completely ignoring the dissatisfaction of the many Twelfth-Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>What were the peak civilizations? They were the ones standing at the pinnacle of the universe, with virtually no chance of falling.</p><p></p><p>Even if the human civilization went to war with the other ten peak civilizations at once, the human civilization would not be destroyed, and the ten peak civilizations also did not dare to push the human civilization too hard.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>The performance of Lin Yuan on the battlefield, even if it had provoked the unanimous dissatisfaction of the other ten peak civilizations, the nine Supremes of the human civilization were not the least bit concerned.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the massive war had been set long ago.</p><p></p><p>If your civilization's Eleventh-Realm experts were slaughtered, that was because you were too weak.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Xia Qin was also standing nearby, maintaining a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the voice of Supreme Xuanyuan sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, was the final trump card used by the Galactic Overlord one of the ultimate foundations of our human civilization?" Supreme Xuanyuan asked with a puzzled tone.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan was familiar with the ultimate foundations of the human civilization, and none of them matched the kind of method that had crushed tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm alien experts.</p><p></p><p>But apart from the ultimate foundations, what else could explain that scene of overwhelming domination?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," Xia Qin immediately transmitted his response.</p><p></p><p>He was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin had indeed considered giving Lin Yuan some backup trump cards before.</p><p></p><p>But they had nothing to do with the ultimate foundations of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know either?" Xuanyuan fell silent. Could it be that the method the Galactic Overlord used to crush tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm alien experts was something he had accomplished on his own?</p>

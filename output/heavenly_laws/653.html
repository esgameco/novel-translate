        <h1>Chapter 653</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Capital of the Blazing Sun Country, an independent space.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames looked at Lin Yuan with a slightly dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Apex Heavenly Sovereigns also had the same look, their gazes towards Lin Yuan filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Reclaim the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar?</p><p></p><p>The Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar had already been occupied and refined by the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void. This Sovereign, who was at the pinnacle of the Six Great Ancient Countries, could descend with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, beside the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar, there were definitely the main combat bodies of other Apex Heavenly Sovereigns from the Great Profound Ancient Country guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Blazing Sun Ancient Country disregarded everything and fought to the death with the Great Profound Ancient Country, utilizing all the ancient country's profound killer techniques, the possibility of seizing that Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar was still extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Lin Yuan going alone.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you must not act rashly." The Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames immediately said, "The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void's strength is unfathomable, he is, he is capable of killing top-tier Apex Heavenly Sovereigns."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan was able to survive in the hands of the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void because this strongest Sovereign had most of his attention focused on refining the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar, and did not bother with Lin Yuan, just slapping him away without following up.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan dared to go to that Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar alone, the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void would definitely not hesitate to act.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Blazing Sun Ancient Country was also a threat to the Great Profound Ancient Country. Being able to eliminate a top-tier Apex Heavenly Sovereign in advance would be very beneficial for the Great Profound Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"I know the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void is very strong," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The strongest Heavenly Sovereigns of the Six Great Ancient Countries were on par with the invincible Great Saints of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>At this level of strength, they either possess an absolute crushing advantage, like a Great Saint who has cultivated the 5th layer of the "Infinite Void", whose cosmic body is countless times stronger than other peak Great Saints of the same level. Or they have mastered special rule techniques, like the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void's chaotic time manipulation, against which ordinary top-tier Apex Heavenly Sovereigns can only passively endure the attacks.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured, since I dare to go, I must have the confidence." Lin Yuan looked at the many Apex Heavenly Sovereigns: "My strength has broken through a little, and I should not be weaker than the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames and the other Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Not weaker than the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void? That would mean the pinnacle Heavenly Sovereign level? Has the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign already reached this realm? The Apex Heavenly Sovereigns found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>If the ancestral bloodline of the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign could be cultivated to the Heavenly Sovereign level, in a distant future, there would be hope for it to grow to the pinnacle Heavenly Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>But it had only been a short time since Lin Yuan had just crossed into the Heavenly Sovereign realm. Although the Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames and the others found it somewhat incredible, they still chose to believe, looking at Lin Yuan's expression and tone.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, why don't you wait a bit? Let me go with you? My strength may not be as good as the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void, but I have many profound killer techniques that can contend and resist that Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void," the Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames immediately said.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's strength was truly not weaker than the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Void, with the Blazing Sun Ancient Country mobilizing all their forces, they would have a good chance of seizing that Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Lin Yuan immediately refused.</p><p></p><p>With this latest breakthrough in strength, he indeed had the desire to wipe away the past humiliation and reclaim the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need to risk all the Blazing Sun Ancient Country's ultimate trump cards and profound techniques, which were meant to be used in the battle for the sacred land over the next hundreds or even tens of years.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the Heavenly Sovereign of Crimson Flames nodded, not insisting further.</p><p></p><p>He believed Lin Yuan must have his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar, the heaven and earth aura was like a muddy swamp, the black and white energies swirling. If one were to look down from millions of miles high in the sky, they would see a vast Yin-Yang Taiji diagram slowly forming, centered on the Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Profound Ancient Country couldn't help but feel suffocated. Their gazes towards Lin Yuan were extremely solemn, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>As the instinct of the strong, they sensed that the young man in the distance was terrifying. Just by standing there, without emanating any aura, he made them, a group of Apex Heavenly Sovereigns, tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>What kind of strength was this? "The Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Profound Ancient Country recognized Lin Yuan, and in fact the others had also recognized him, but they had no time to ponder further.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, you should quickly leave, this is the territory of our Great Profound Ancient Country," the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather said in a deep voice, focusing most of his mental energy on the surroundings. He felt that since the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign dared to appear here, he must have some backing, perhaps the other top-tier Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country were ambushing nearby.</p><p></p><p>That oppressive aura that made their hearts tremble might be coming from them.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Lin Yuan looked at the majestic Gigantic Core Celestial Pillar in the distance and smiled, "Now, you all step aside and let go of this celestial pillar, and you can live."</p><p></p><p>"Let go of the celestial pillar?" The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It had always been the Great Profound Ancient Country treating other ancient countries this way. When did the Blazing Sun Ancient Country dare to do this to the Great Profound Ancient Country? "Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, let me welcome you."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud strode out, his gaze icy cold as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud was a peak Apex Heavenly Sovereign of the Great Profound Ancient Country. In terms of strength, he was in no way inferior to Lin Yuan before his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The space around the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud transformed into layers of clouds, quickly enveloping towards Lin Yuan. This was the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud's attack method, using clouds to erode the enemy. Even top-tier Apex Heavenly Sovereigns would be suppressed by these layers of clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather and the other Apex Heavenly Sovereigns merely watched coldly, not joining the attack.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Profound Ancient Country, since the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign dared to appear here, he must have some backing and trump cards, most likely coming from the other Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country hiding in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud alone would be enough. The attention of the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather and the others was focused on the other numerous Apex Heavenly Sovereigns of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country lurking in ambush around them.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because Crimson Flames and the others have used their profound killer techniques?" The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather thought inwardly, becoming more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the profound killer techniques of a great ancient country would be reserved for the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that these were the true killing moves to be used at the key juncture.</p><p></p><p>The other reason was that the profound killer techniques were extremely precious, using even a bit would diminish them.</p><p></p><p>Keeping the profound killer techniques until the end was to see the final situation and decide whether to use them or not.</p><p></p><p>If there was a chance to seize the sacred land, they could use the profound killer techniques. If seizing the sacred land was hopeless, there would be no need to continue investing.</p><p></p><p>But who knows how the Blazing Sun Ancient Country was thinking? What if they planned to use the profound killer techniques now? The Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Feather had to consider this extreme scenario as well.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, I've long wanted to see you," the Heavenly Sovereign of Profound Cloud controlled the vast clouds, about to crush down on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was a killing move specially designed for opponents at the same level. First suppressing with the clouds, then eroding.</p><p></p><p>But—</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan looked on with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Venerable Fuyu Tian realized that the vision before him had become empty, with only the intertwining and colliding of the two colors of black and white yin and yang, sweeping towards him. The terrifying power of the black and white yin and yang made him feel hopeless.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Fuyu Tian didn't even have time to react before his physical body, soul, and will rapidly collapsed and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his hand and collected the weapons left behind by Fuyu Tian.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The fall of Fuyu Tian had completely silenced all the other supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation.</p><p></p><p>Even though Fuyu Tian's fall was only the destruction of his main physical body and not his complete death, it still made the many supreme Venerable Beings feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>After collecting Fuyu Tian's weapons, Lin Yuan glanced at the spot where the other party had last stood: "Daring to be distracted while fighting me?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Lin Yuan could clearly feel that even though Fuyu Tian was attacking him, he still had half of his attention on the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Feiyu Tian think there were supreme Venerable Beings from the Lieyang Ancient Nation lying in ambush nearby, Fuyu Tian also felt the same way, so his mind was naturally not fully focused on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Even though Fuyu Tian was distracted, he was still a supreme Venerable Being, and to be instantly killed in front of Lin Yuan was still somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Is the power of my Chaotic Taiji Dao so strong even at just the first level?" Lin Yuan thought to himself. Facing the many supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation, he naturally did not dare to hold back and directly used the power of the Chaotic Taiji.</p><p></p><p>"This power?" Feiyu Tian's mind trembled. The path of Chaotic power he had cultivated was very special, and he could vaguely "see" the cause of Fuyu Tian's death - it was the constant interweaving and colliding of two forces, one black and one white, one yin and one yang, which ultimately crushed Fuyu Tian's everything.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be distracted, go all out against the Yinhe Venerable Being," Feiyu Tian immediately ordered the other supreme Venerable Beings. At this moment, he vaguely realized that Yinhe Venerable Being's confidence did not come from external forces, but from his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Fuyu was a supreme Venerable Being, but he was directly killed by the Yinhe Venerable Being? How strong is this Yinhe Venerable Being?" The many supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation were uneasy, but they didn't think of fleeing either. The giant core celestial pillar was behind them, who dared to run? Moreover, the fact that the Yinhe Venerable Being could destroy Fuyu Tian did not mean he could also destroy them, especially with the many supreme Venerable Beings now on high alert.</p><p></p><p>"How has this Yinhe Venerable Being's strength increased so much?" Among the supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation, Fudang Tian also stared intently at Lin Yuan, his expression horrified.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the treasure land, Fudang Tian had once tried to seize the core celestial pillar discovered by the Scarlet Lotus Venerable Being, but later Lin Yuan arrived and completely destroyed one of Fudang Tian's main physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the pressure Lin Yuan exerted on Fudang Tian was great, but not to the point of being utterly unmatched as it was now.</p><p></p><p>"Form a battle formation!" As soon as Feiyu Tian's words fell, the remaining ten supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation began to connect their auras, with strands of Chaotic Qi swirling, integrating all the supreme Venerable Beings' power into a large circulation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan observed.</p><p></p><p>Earlier on the battlefields of the Qingfen Domain and the Zimen Domain, Lin Yuan had discovered that the war machines of the various ancient nations could completely fuse the powers of thousands or even tens of thousands of different experts together.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason was the domination of the Chaotic rules over all powers.</p><p></p><p>And now, the ten supreme Venerable Beings, including five top-tier supreme Venerable Beings, had completely merged their powers into a grand circulation, majestic and overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>This was also aided by the Chaotic rules, or even the Chaotic essential power that surpassed the Chaotic Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>After all, integrating the powers of ten supreme Venerable Beings into a whole was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe Venerable Being, take my strike." Fudang Tian felt unprecedented power, as his aura had merged with the other four supreme Venerable Beings, making his strength even greater than a typical top-tier supreme Venerable Being. Furthermore, he had also formed a circulation with the other four top-tier supreme Venerable Beings, feeling that nothing in the world could stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Empty power." Lin Yuan calmly watched Fudang Tian.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he raised a finger, and strands of black and white yin-yang Taiji power began to spread from the fingertip towards Fudang Tian.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Fudang Tian's body suddenly formed an invisible spatial barrier, which was the protection of the other nine Venerable Beings' powers. However, Lin Yuan's single finger had torn through everything, and the universe was filled with black and white.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the black and white yin-yang Taiji power had pierced through the spatial barrier and instantly annihilated Fudang Tian's physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the remnants of the black and white yin-yang Taiji power also spread along the hidden connections to the other nine supreme Venerable Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Not good." Feiyu Tian's expression changed drastically, and he immediately severed the connections with the other supreme Venerable Beings.</p><p></p><p>The four top-tier supreme Venerable Beings also cut off the connections in time, but the remaining four supreme Venerable Beings reacted a bit slower and were affected by the black and white yin-yang Taiji power, their physical bodies and souls immediately beginning to collapse and vanish.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there were eleven supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation, but now only five remained.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe Venerable Being, what is your true strength now?" Feiyu Tian felt a chill, staring intently at Lin Yuan, as if he had some speculation, but did not dare to say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Those who block me will die." Lin Yuan didn't bother with more words and strode towards the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Feiyu Tian and the other top-tier supreme Venerable Beings looked at each other, and their auras merged together again.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him." Feiyu Tian gritted his teeth, and his inner aura began to boil, obviously using many desperate techniques.</p><p></p><p>The other four top-tier supreme Venerable Beings did the same. The giant core celestial pillar behind them was something the Great Fugu Nation had occupied and refined. Its importance to the Great Fugu Venerable Beings was not just the pillar itself, but also their pride and dignity.</p><p></p><p>If they, with their many supreme Venerable Beings guarding it, still allowed an outsider to occupy and plunder it, it would be an extremely heavy blow to the exceptionally proud Great Fugu Venerable Beings.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! The five top-tier supreme Venerable Beings of the Great Fugu Nation launched their attacks towards Lin Yuan with all their might.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the five top-tier supreme Venerable Beings had a crazed expression, using all their desperate techniques. The great Dao of heaven and earth were rapidly retreating and vanishing, and the surrounding space had become a black hole, with no rules remaining.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned slightly, stopping in his tracks. The desperate attacks of the top-tier supreme Venerable Beings could not be ignored by him, especially the terrifying desperate techniques they were using, which originated from the ancient Great Fugu Nation.</p><p></p><p>After one breath.</p><p></p><p>One top-tier supreme Venerable Being was crushed by a palm strike from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Half a breath later.</p><p></p><p>Another top-tier supreme Venerable Being was stomped and destroyed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In just three or four breaths.</p><p></p><p>All five top-tier supreme Venerable Beings were one by one crushed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Lin Yuan had just reached the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Before that—</p><p></p><p>Those who block the Yinhe, their forms and spirits will be shattered.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Can't push it open?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The force he used to push the Heavenly Gate was not his full power, but Lin Yuan's strength - what realm was he in? The 50th level of the Primordial realm! And he had perfectly mastered every level up to the 50th Primordial realm!</p><p></p><p>Even if he only used one-tenth or one-hundredth of his power, it would be enough to crush and defeat the Four Celestial Kings and other peak legendary 11th level beings.</p><p></p><p>Yet now he couldn't push open the Heavenly Gate?</p><p></p><p>"There's a problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his hands and carefully observed the Heavenly Gate in front of him. The force he had just used was countless times more powerful than even the strongest Primordial Emperors and Primordials of the indigenous people, yet it didn't budge the Heavenly Gate at all.</p><p></p><p>So how did the indigenous Primordial Emperors and Primordials open the Heavenly Gate and enter it in the past?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered as he pondered for a moment, then decided to try pushing the Heavenly Gate again.</p><p></p><p>Placing both palms flat on the gate, Lin Yuan calmed his mind and gently closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Open for me."</p><p></p><p>The previously tranquil Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, his terrifying aura exploding forth in an instant. The air around him nearly froze, his rich blood energy surging like an ocean. The entire mountain peak seemed to sway, as if it could collapse at any moment under Lin Yuan's explosive force.</p><p></p><p>Full power.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in two hundred years that Lin Yuan had used his full power.</p><p></p><p>Ever since crossing into the 20th level of the Primordial realm, Lin Yuan had never needed to go all out, as there were simply no opponents worth his full attention.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying blood energy seethed like scorching magma.</p><p></p><p>Below the mountain peak, the countless powerful experts from the various races who were watching trembled uncontrollably in their souls.</p><p></p><p>The aura Lin Yuan was releasing now was worlds apart from when he was suppressing the Four Celestial Kings earlier - it was incomparably more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of power is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The human 'Blood Rain' wasn't even using his full strength when he suppressed the Four Celestial Kings and the others."</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings and five other peak 11th level beings were not only crushed by this human expert, but didn't even force him to reveal his true abilities?"</p><p></p><p>The shock in the hearts of the powerful experts from the various races was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't witnessed it themselves, they would never have believed that in this two-dimensional world that suppressed and reduced all power, there could be an expert who had raised their strength to this level.</p><p></p><p>And it was even a human evolutionary!</p><p></p><p>"Still can't push it open?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the Heavenly Gate, Lin Yuan had used his full power, but the gate before him remained completely motionless.</p><p></p><p>"With the force I'm exerting now, I could pierce through this Heavenly Mountain beneath my feet, yet I can't push open this Heavenly Gate?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt it was preposterous.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Gate was truly this difficult to open, how did those indigenous Primordial Emperors and Primordials who entered it in the past manage to do so?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Heavenly Gate treated him differently?</p><p></p><p>Were the standards for experts from the various races pushing the gate different from the indigenous experts?</p><p></p><p>But even if the standards differed, with his current strength, he should have reached the threshold, right?</p><p></p><p>"I refuse to believe that with my current power, I can't push open this measly Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn. At his full power, he had nearly exhausted all his conventional abilities.</p><p></p><p>To further increase his strength, he would have to use his trump cards and final resorts - the desperate measures only to be used at the very end.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and everything happening in this two-dimensional world was no different from what his true self experienced.</p><p></p><p>"Esoteric art...Augmentation!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan murmured softly. In an instant, the esoteric symbol of the 'Augmentation' art deep within his flesh began to spread and pervade, enveloping his flesh, blood, soul and everything.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world that suppressed all transcendent abilities, even fleshly esoteric arts were restricted.</p><p></p><p>So the Solar Primordial Soul in this two-dimensional world could not activate any fleshly esoteric arts.</p><p></p><p>But while the Solar Primordial Soul could not activate them, Lin Yuan's true self outside the two-dimensional world could still activate them.</p><p></p><p>Once activated, the 'Augmentation' art would enhance Lin Yuan's entire being tenfold - his flesh, soul, mind, will and all would be augmented tenfold.</p><p></p><p>And while the Solar Primordial Soul's flesh and soul were isolated in this two-dimensional world, its mind and will were universal.</p><p></p><p>In other words, once Lin Yuan's true self activated the 'Augmentation' art, the mind and will of his Solar Primordial Soul in this two-dimensional world would be enhanced tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Mind and will could not directly increase strength, but they could allow one to control one's power more perfectly, thereby unleashing even greater might.</p><p></p><p>Why did 11th level experts rise and grow in strength so much faster than 9th and 10th level experts among the various races?</p><p></p><p>Their personal realm was one reason, but their powerful minds and wills were another crucial factor.</p><p></p><p>Therefore -</p><p></p><p>The explosive tenfold increase in Lin Yuan's mind and will also led to a very significant boost in his strength.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's mind and will increased tenfold, the fiery blood energy flickering around him in front of the Heavenly Gate took on an even more terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from the various races watching from the mountainside were so horrified they could no longer speak.</p><p></p><p>The feeling Lin Yuan gave them now was as if he towered even more vastly than the Heavenly Mountain itself, as if he would break through all the restrictions and shackles of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The aura Lin Yuan was emanating gradually receded back into his body.</p><p></p><p>Even after using the 'Augmentation' fleshly esoteric art, he still could not budge the Heavenly Gate at all, let alone push it open.</p><p></p><p>Using the 'Augmentation' art would leave Lin Yuan temporarily weakened for a short period.</p><p></p><p>But to the powerful experts watching from the mountainside, this so-called weakness was merely a temporary drop from the 50th level of the Primordial realm to around the 45th level.</p><p></p><p>And there was no difference between those two realms to those experts.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's true self and Yin Primordial Soul outside this two-dimensional world, since they were not in a dangerous environment, it was of no consequence either.</p><p></p><p>"Still can't open it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn as he stared at the Heavenly Gate before him, frowning in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't push open the gate even with all his abilities unleashed, then which of the powerful experts from the various races in this two-dimensional world could open it?</p><p></p><p>"I'm at the 50th level of the Primordial realm, equivalent to around the 60th to 70th level for experts of other races. Combined with the amplification from the 'Augmentation' art, my strength is likely comparable to the 90th to 100th level of the Primordial realm for a short time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the Heavenly Gate before him, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Below the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The countless powerful experts from the various races finally recovered from their shock.</p><p></p><p>Soon, some of them realized something.</p><p></p><p>That the Heavenly Gate before Lin Yuan still had not been pushed open.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The human 'Blood Rain' cannot push open the Heavenly Gate with his strength?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, if even 'Blood Rain' can't push it open, how did those Primordial Emperors and Primordials enter the gate in the past?"</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts were in an uproar. Although most of them had no relation to entering the Heavenly Gate, seeing the gate they had viewed for over three hundred years as their only hope of leaving this two-dimensional world rendered nearly impossible to open filled their hearts with desolation.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Gate could not be opened, then what was the point of their frenzied cultivation and desperate efforts to increase their strength over these past three hundred years?</p><p></p><p>What was the point of their actions scouring every corner hunting for rare treasures?</p><p></p><p>Even if they gathered every single rare treasure in this two-dimensional world, if they couldn't take them out, weren't they all just worthless junk?</p><p></p><p>"If the human 'Blood Rain' cannot even push open the Heavenly Gate, I might as well abandon this avatar."</p><p></p><p>One powerful expert after another let their avatars dissipate, abandoning their manifestations in this two-dimensional world - an act equivalent to a fundamental loss that no expert was willing to accept.</p><p></p><p>But if there really was no hope of leaving, it was better to abandon their avatars sooner for liberation.</p><p></p><p>At least then they wouldn't have to continue living in fear in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Outside the painting.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the paramount experts turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate can't be opened?"</p><p></p><p>"In this situation, doesn't that mean there's no hope of leaving?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? The gate could be opened in the past, why not now?"</p><p></p><p>The paramount experts discussed among themselves. Originally, they had deduced that the Heavenly Gate in this two-dimensional world would serve as the passage connecting the inside and outside.</p><p></p><p>But they had never imagined that the gate would be impossible to open.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin." The paramount experts of the Stellar Grand Alliance, Cosmos Race and others turned solemn looks towards the paramount expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, in order to spare the lives of the Four Celestial Kings, Skinny Old Man and four other peak 11th level experts, they had paid no small price to Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>But now, if the Heavenly Gate could not be opened, didn't that mean those payments had been wasted?</p><p></p><p>Because if they could not leave through the gate, the outcome for the Four Celestial Kings and the others would still be death - just a difference between being killed or dying of old age.</p><p></p><p>"The deal is done, what do you mean by trying to back out now?" Xia Qin glanced at the paramount experts of the other races looking his way, his heart devoid of any feeling of ill-gotten gain.</p><p></p><p>Because if the Heavenly Gate could not be opened, it not only meant the fates of the Four Celestial Kings and the others, but Lin Yuan's fate would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Unable to leave through the Heavenly Gate and trapped in this two-dimensional world, with no way to control the flow of time, at most they would live another 100,000 or 200,000 years before dying eventually.</p><p></p><p>And 100,000 or 200,000 years in this two-dimensional world was merely equivalent to 1,000 or 2,000 years in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the fundamental loss Lin Yuan would face, Xia Qin would rather have gained nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the reason the Heavenly Gate cannot be opened is probably related to the experts from the various races being drawn into this place, causing some changes within the two-dimensional world of white paper," said a Unicorn paramount expert, voicing his speculation.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other paramount experts nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>They had similar thoughts - otherwise, why could the Primordial Emperors open the gate before the experts of the various races descended, but now even the human civilization's 'Blood Rain', whose strength far exceeded theirs, was blocked outside?</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see for now."</p><p></p><p>"There may be other changes yet."</p><p></p><p>The many paramount experts continued observing the massive 'painting' in the distance.</p><p></p><p>While the paramount experts of the Stellar Grand Alliance and others wanted to cancel their deal with Xia Qin, they had already handed over their treasures, so it was too late for regrets now.</p><p></p><p>With the human civilization's strength, the only way to take those treasures back would be to wage total war - otherwise, they had virtually no chance.</p><p></p><p>And even if they did wage total war, it would just be a case of killing eight hundred enemies while losing a thousand of their own - utterly meaningless.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the Heavenly Gate, choosing not to attempt pushing it again.</p><p></p><p>If even activating the 'Augmentation' fleshly esoteric art could not budge the gate, any further attempts would be futile.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Heavenly Gate is specifically targeting me?"</p><p></p><p>A sudden thought occurred to Lin Yuan. This speculation seemed inconceivable, but at this point, it had to be considered.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the human evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Du and the other 11th level evolutionary experts were equally puzzled as to why the Heavenly Gate had not been opened.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly rang in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Du, come over here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Xuanyuan Du immediately realized it was Lin Yuan calling her.</p><p></p><p>She promptly headed towards the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain," Xuanyuan Du respectfully bowed slightly before Lin Yuan in front of the gate, a hint of restraint in her manner.</p><p></p><p>Prior to today, while Xuanyuan Du had respected Lin Yuan, it was only respect - in her view, as a fellow 11th level being at the fifth rank, the gap between them should not be too great, even if Lin Yuan was stronger.</p><p></p><p>But now, after witnessing Lin Yuan effortlessly defeat the Four Celestial Kings and other peak 11th level experts, and the terrifying aura he had unleashed moments ago, Xuanyuan Du's attitude towards him had changed. It was no longer just respect, but reverence, almost treating him like a demigod paramount expert.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanyuan Du's view, Lin Yuan's strength in this two-dimensional world had far surpassed the pinnacle attainable by ordinary 11th level beings.</p><p></p><p>"You try pushing the Heavenly Gate," Lin Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>To confirm the possibility that the gate was specifically targeting him, it was simple - just have other experts try pushing it as well.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Xuanyuan Du did not doubt him and walked up to the gate, pushing against it with all her might.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain, I can't push it open," Xuanyuan Du said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"You can't open it either?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned contemplative.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan randomly selected a few other powerful experts from the various races and had them all try pushing the Heavenly Gate one by one.</p><p></p><p>The result was the same.</p><p></p><p>None of them could push it open.</p><p></p><p>"Try having one of the indigenous people of this two-dimensional world attempt it."</p><p></p><p>After dozens of attempts confirmed that not only he but the other experts from the various races could not open the Heavenly Gate, Lin Yuan decided to have the native inhabitants of this world give it a try.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu, who had just entered the Primordial realm, was trembling uncontrollably under the unintentionally released auras of the countless powerful experts around him.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Yan Fu absolutely did not regret coming here, for he had witnessed terrifying battles that had never occurred in history.</p><p></p><p>Especially the young man standing before the Heavenly Gate - his every move and gesture made Yan Fu feel an urge to kneel and kowtow before this vast celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful...too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you combined all the Primordials born throughout history, they still wouldn't match a single hair of that expert," Yan Fu's heart was filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You, come over here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu was slightly startled and instinctively looked up towards the mountain peak where Lin Yuan stood before the Heavenly Gate, realizing the latter was looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"Me?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu could hardly believe it. That an insignificant gnat like himself could actually draw the attention of such a peerless expert as Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Very well." For some reason, apart from fear, a hint of excitement welled up in Yan Fu's heart.</p><p></p><p>To be able to stand before an expert as unprecedented in all of history as Lin Yuan - what an honor this was!</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the watchful eyes of the countless powerful experts from the various races, Yan Fu made his way before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord," Yan Fu bowed deeply with utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Bi Jing bowed deeply towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's aura was restrained, not exerting any oppressive feeling on him, but Yan Fu still did not dare act rashly. </p><p></p><p>The scene just now, like the sky collapsing and the earth splitting apart, was still lingering in their minds. To him, Lin Yuan had already become an insurmountable, even unattainable high mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Go and try to push open the Heavenly Gate, see if you can open it," Lin Yuan spoke briefly.</p><p></p><p>As long as Yan Fu, a native shaman from this two-dimensional world, could push open the Heavenly Gate, it would mean that the threshold for the powerful beings of all races and the native lifeforms to open it was different.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Yan Fu calmed his mind and also walked to the front of the Heavenly Gate, pushing it with force.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I can't push it open," Yan Fu said carefully.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also drew a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference between the powerful beings of all races and the native lifeforms in terms of opening the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of our descent that caused the difficulty of opening the Heavenly Gate to soar?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At present, this was the only possibility that could explain it.</p><p></p><p>"To what extent has the difficulty of opening the Heavenly Gate soared? What level of strength is needed to open it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart, and at this moment, he had a feeling similar to the other powerful beings of all races. Without knowing where the goal was, he suddenly felt a lack of interest.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with my mental state?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately realized his change.</p><p></p><p>The originally rippling mental state had suddenly become calm.</p><p></p><p>"It's only been over three hundred years, and I've already reached the Shaman Ancestor Fifty Realm. When the Heavenly Gate appears again next time, my strength will far surpass what it is now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze revealed a sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't make it next time the Heavenly Gate opens, then the time after that, or the time after that, my comprehension is heaven-defying. As long as I'm given time, there are infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mental state was more determined than ever before.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p></p><p>The manifested Heavenly Gate began to slowly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is dissipating again?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems even the powerful 'Blood Rain' couldn't enter the Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, what should we do now? Is there still a need to stay in this two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>Many powerful beings of all races felt extremely desperate.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is about to disappear."</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the Heavenly Gate, Lin Yuan also noticed the changes in the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not stop it, but silently watched the Heavenly Gate disappear completely.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"Set a goal, in ten thousand years, when the Heavenly Gate opens again next time, I must at least cultivate to the Shaman Ancestor One Hundred Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned around without hesitation and left the peak of Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan did not know was that the reason he could not push open the Heavenly Gate had nothing to do with his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was because a mysterious existence deep within the two-dimensional world wanted to observe his growth rate over the next ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this time the opened Heavenly Gate was directly locked, and no lifeform could push it open to enter.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan possessed extremely powerful strength, unless he could completely break through the restrictions and suppression of the two-dimensional world, he would not be able to push open the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>And completely breaking through the restrictions and suppression of the two-dimensional world was something even the most powerful beings could not achieve.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-stage supreme beings could indeed withstand the absorption of the 'White Paper', but once they fell into it, they would also be suppressed. At most, they could only reveal some supernatural powers like those strange objects.</p><p></p><p>But that was all.</p><p></p><p>The distance to breaking through the restrictions and suppression of the two-dimensional world was still extremely far away.</p><p></p><p>Luochuan Gathering Place.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan left the peak of Heavenly Mountain, he returned here.</p><p></p><p>"After the Shaman Ancestor Fifty Realm, the difficulty of making further progress is far greater than before the Fifty Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also why he set the goal of only cultivating to the Shaman Ancestor One Hundred Realm before the next opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>It took over three hundred years to reach the Shaman Ancestor Fifty Realm, but the next ten thousand years would only advance to the One Hundred Realm, because the room for improvement after the Fifty Realm was too small.</p><p></p><p>From the Fifty Realm to the Fifty-First Realm, the difficulty would probably exceed that from the First to the Fiftieth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Conventional seclusion has no significant effect," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, even if I can't open the Heavenly Gate, I still have a chance to escape from this two-dimensional world," Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme beings could not retrieve people through the 'White Paper', but Lin Yuan, relying on the 'Gate of All Realms', or more precisely, the physical traversal of the Gate of All Realms, could leave this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>It would only cost fifty strands of Realm-Breaking Primal Force.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still a problem with doing so.</p><p></p><p>That was, after the traversal ended and the Solar Primordial Spirit returned to the main universe, would it still appear in the two-dimensional world?</p><p></p><p>If it still appeared, then the so-called physical traversal would be meaningless, because it would still be restricted and suppressed by the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the traversal method of the spiritual descent of the Gate of All Realms would also face this problem, which was whether it would still appear in the two-dimensional world after returning.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue observing," Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, Lin Yuan would not easily use this method.</p><p></p><p>To directly disappear from the two-dimensional world? Based on various signs, that 'White Paper' that squeezed into the universe was highly likely to have an independent will.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it was similar to the Realm Spirit of the Yellow Prime Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could one explain the change in the difficulty of opening the Heavenly Gate after the powerful beings of all races descended?</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Directly using the Gate of All Realms to escape from the two-dimensional world, even if only temporarily, would inevitably draw the attention of the existence within the two-dimensional world itself.</p><p></p><p>Easily escaping the restrictions and suppression of the two-dimensional world was something even the twelfth-stage supreme beings could not achieve. If Lin Yuan did so, it would be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the worst plan would be to abandon this Solar Primordial Spirit, even if it caused defects in the path of martial dao evolution, but with his heaven-defying comprehension, he might still be able to make up for the defects.</p><p></p><p>And even if he couldn't make up for them, since Lin Yuan could pioneer the path of martial dao evolution, he could also pioneer other evolutionary paths that were no weaker than the martial dao path. It would simply mean switching to cultivate other evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current status in human civilization, starting over would be much easier than before.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind and soul once again shifted to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"When I activate the divine ability 'Reinforcement', my willpower greatly increases, leading to a surge in my control over power, allowing me to glimpse more of the essence of this world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"If there is an opportunity in the future, I can frequently activate the physical divine ability 'Reinforcement' as a means of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The biggest drawback of the physical divine ability 'Reinforcement' was that after activating it, it would cause a temporary period of weakness.</p><p></p><p>But if he could ensure a sufficiently safe environment, it could also be used as a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the mind and will not only greatly benefited Lin Yuan's perception of the essence of power in this two-dimensional world he was in.</p><p></p><p>It would also significantly increase the efficiency of his true self's comprehension of various rules in the outside world. In short, it would enhance everything.</p><p></p><p>As for falling into a period of weakness afterwards, it was only a period of weakened strength. It had no impact on his comprehension of rules and power.</p><p></p><p>Summer Palace Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>The supreme being Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan with concern and asked, "The Heavenly Gate really can't be opened?"</p><p></p><p>It was already an acknowledged fact among the powerful beings of all races that the Heavenly Gate could not be opened. Even the human 'Blood Rain', who defeated beings like the Four Celestial Kings, could not open it, essentially sealing the death sentence for all the powerful beings in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But Xia Qin still wanted to understand the specifics.</p><p></p><p>"Can't open it," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to lie or conceal the truth in front of a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome," the supreme being Xia Qin said with some distress.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Gate could not be opened, it meant that Lin Yuan could not leave the two-dimensional world on his own.</p><p></p><p>And outside the painting, they, as supreme beings, had no way to influence the inside of the two-dimensional world. This was equivalent to being trapped in a dead loop.</p><p></p><p>Although some supreme beings suggested waiting and seeing if there would be any changes when the Heavenly Gate opened next time.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin was still very worried.</p><p></p><p>"What are your plans now?" the supreme being Xia Qin asked.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating and wait for the next opening of the Heavenly Gate," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Good," Xia Qin nodded. He could sense that Lin Yuan's mental state had not been affected at all, which was rare.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful beings could persevere in the face of difficulties.</p><p></p><p>But persevering in the face of dire straits or even the brink of death was exceptionally difficult.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the three hundred years after the powerful beings of all races descended into the two-dimensional world were the three hundred years of greatest strength improvement, having already reached the world's bottleneck and shackles.</p><p></p><p>Even if another ten thousand years passed, the improvement in their strength would probably not be as great as the previous three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It was not easy to make further progress at the highest level.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've already discussed it with the other supreme beings," Xia Qin said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work in the end, we'll use our reserve power to try and forcibly break through that 'White Paper'."</p><p></p><p>Ever since that 'White Paper' squeezed into the universe, Xia Qin and the other existences had been cautiously probing, without using any extreme methods.</p><p></p><p>This was done firstly because they were worried about causing more changes to that 'White Paper'.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, they wanted to avoid damaging that 'White Paper' as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>But now, with all the probing methods proving useless, the only option left was to forcibly break through.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supreme Being," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The reserve power of human civilization could not be easily used, especially against that 'White Paper' of unknown origins.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was too important to human civilization. Xia Qin and the other nine supreme beings did not want to see Lin Yuan's spiritual clone perish in the two-dimensional world, resulting in a fundamental loss.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Xia Qin's personal world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self continued to sense the fluctuations of rules.</p><p></p><p>"On the black planet, I've already occupied ten of the twelve guiding spaces," Lin Yuan thought. In the past two or three years, he had comprehended three more pillar-level fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level, comprehending pillar-level fusion rules was simple. The difficult part was cultivating the pillar-level fusion rules to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>The law of life and death reincarnation that Lin Yuan comprehended first was still stuck at the second realm, even with the assistance of the guiding spaces on the black planet. It was still a short distance away from the third realm.</p><p></p><p>"I was too greedy," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He had forgotten that he was only at the tenth stage now.</p><p></p><p>For a tenth-stage powerful being, the ultimate goal was probably to comprehend a single pillar-level fusion rule and be ranked as top-grade.</p><p></p><p>But now, these so-called pillar-level fusion rules, Lin Yuan could comprehend them as soon as he tried. And the pillar-level rules he comprehended were all powerful fusion rules formed by the fusion of three or more pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan found Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, you really should have gone to Heavenly Mountain to take a look," Nalan said, unable to hold back.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Heavenly Mountain when the Heavenly Gate opened, Deputy Tower Master Nalan had searched among the many powerful beings of all races but still could not find Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So he thought Lin Yuan probably did not go to Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This was also very normal.</p><p></p><p>Not all powerful beings of all races would go to Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>For example, almost none of the powerful beings from the Feather Race went to Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>There were also some powerful beings of all races who knew they had no hope of entering the Heavenly Gate, so they would not go to Heavenly Mountain either.</p><p></p><p>In Nalan's view, Lin Yuan probably belonged to the latter group. As the strongest genius in the history of human civilization, if the Galactic Sovereign appeared at Heavenly Mountain, he would probably draw the attention of other powerful beings of all races, causing unnecessary trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The human civilization's 'Blood Rain' went on a killing spree at the peak of Heavenly Mountain, crushing special existences as powerful as the Four Celestial Kings into the ground. Tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan spoke in an amazed tone. Even until now, the scenes that happened at the peak of Heavenly Mountain kept flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was truly too domineering.</p><p></p><p>Could the cultivators of human civilization really be so powerful in front of those unique special existences?</p><p></p><p>"Hm," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He did not give much explanation.</p><p></p><p>With a tenth-stage body, being able to defeat eleventh-stage perfected special existences like the Four Celestial Kings, if this spread out, it would definitely make the ultimate beings of races like the Insect Race and Feather Race sleepless.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better to keep it hidden, which was also the suggestion given by the supreme being Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>Without sufficient strength, it was best to lie low.</p><p></p><p>It was not that human civilization could not provide protection, but it could avoid a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization had also experienced a long period of lying low before finally rising up.</p><p></p><p>"I also don't know which cultivator of my human civilization the 'Blood Rain' is. I wonder if I'm qualified to meet him."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan's tone was slightly admiring. He was also an eleventh-stage cultivator, but in front of that 'Blood Rain', he did not dare have any arrogant thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Meet 'Blood Rain'?" Lin Yuan glanced at Deputy Tower Master Nalan but did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Two-Dimensional World.</p><p></p><p>After a short period of seclusion, Lin Yuan took the initiative to leave the Luochuan Gathering Place and began traveling to various corners of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>After the Shaman Ancestor Fifty Realm, pure seclusion had no significant effect on improving his strength.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan needed to do was to travel to every place in the two-dimensional world and observe the two-dimensional world itself from different angles, in order to comprehend more of the essence of power, continuously breaking through the world's restrictions and shackles, and continue enhancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Years passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Lin Yuan never showed himself again. He traveled through every stage of the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms, and finally left the territory of the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms, heading towards the even vaster desolate regions to explore.</p><p></p><p>Mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>Wilderness depths. </p><p></p><p>Ocean floors.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan passed through and left, as if an observer independent from the world.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed like water, and before he knew it, ten thousand years had passed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

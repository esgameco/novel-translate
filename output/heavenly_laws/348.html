        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 348: Giving You a Push (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Tower Master, why don't we have someone else do it?" </p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan glanced at Lin Yuan standing aside, hesitated for a moment, and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He still found it hard to take action against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Vice Tower Master Nalan felt that the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi didn't need to deliberately create setbacks for the Galactic Lord. </p><p></p><p>As the most talented genius in human civilization, he should forge ahead relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>"It has to be you."</p><p>"No one else is suitable."</p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could not defy the will of the Paramount Lord, even if he thought the Paramount Lord's decision was questionable. </p><p>But when obedience was required, he had to obey.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, if you cannot persist later, remember to admit defeat," Vice Tower Master Nalan kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>Although the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had restricted their sparring to only the time domain rules, Vice Tower Master Nalan believed he was just one step away from comprehending all time models.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Lord was only at the ninth level, and could hardly sense time fluctuations, so how skilled could he be in the time domain rules?</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of rules, it would be better for the Galactic Lord to admit defeat in time to suffer less torment.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly solemn. </p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan's words put quite some pressure on Lin Yuan.</p><p>After all, this was the first time Lin Yuan had seen Vice Tower Master Nalan in action, back when Lin Yuan was at the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Vice Tower Master Nalan stood outside the Black Abyss Secret Realm, and with his own power alone, he suppressed the entire Black Abyss Clan from rebelling.</p><p></p><p>If the powerful insects had not arrived in time, the entire Black Abyss Clan might have been slaughtered by Vice Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi waved his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Vice Tower Master Nalan felt the world around them shift.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the two appeared in a desolate starry space. </p><p></p><p>With the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi's authority, moving the two to a virtual "arena" world was just a thought away.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, you can attack first," Vice Tower Master Nalan said modestly.</p><p></p><p>If it were a battle against an alien race, he would naturally attack first without any carelessness.</p><p></p><p>But against Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Vice Tower Master Nalan was confident of his victory.</p><p></p><p>How could a tenth level lose to a ninth level? Moreover, he was an elite among the tenth level experts.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge gap in strength, if Vice Tower Master Nalan still seized the initiative to attack first, he would feel a bit embarrassed himself.</p><p></p><p>"Bullying the weak" was one thing, but he should at least give his opponent a chance to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, use your full power."</p><p>"This may be your only chance to attack," Vice Tower Master Nalan reminded calmly.</p><p></p><p>Clashes in the time domain rules often happened in the blink of an eye. When different time rules collided, the weaker side usually had no chance to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in actual combat there were many variables, such as using other means besides time rules.</p><p></p><p>Inferior time rules did not necessarily mean inferiority in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>But the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had stipulated that they could only compare their comprehension of time rules.</p><p></p><p>This meant the battle would definitely not last too long. A pure clash in the time domain would unlikely reach a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>The reason Vice Tower Master Nalan felt the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi deliberately wanted to let the Galactic Lord suffer a setback was precisely this.</p><p></p><p>The rules were too restrictive, as if tailored specifically for him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan nodded. "I will use my full power."</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Vice Tower Master Nalan's expression showed satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Only after the Galactic Lord used his full power and realized that no matter what, he was no match for Vice Tower Master Nalan in the time rules, being toyed with like a plaything, would it serve to temper him.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, I may not be as good as you in spatial domains, but in the time domain?" Vice Tower Master Nalan thought leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, Vice Tower Master Nalan realized that Lin Yuan, who was far away, had disappeared without him noticing.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan immediately sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time...has changed?" Vice Tower Master Nalan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan pressed his hand down, releasing a huge amount of time fluctuations to constantly disrupt the time fluctuations around him.</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan vaguely realized something and fully activated his comprehension of time rules, trying to break through the time quagmires enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Outside, Lin Yuan stood still, with a half-meter time fluctuation crystal ball floating in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the crystal ball, Vice Tower Master Nalan struggled incessantly but was eventually enveloped by various time quagmires, unable to break free in the time domain.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending all time models, Lin Yuan combined numerous time models to comprehend many secret techniques in the time domain rules.</p><p></p><p>The Time Prison was one of Lin Yuan's proudest creations, weaving 1,337 time models into a time corridor.</p><p></p><p>Numerous time corridors then formed a Time Prison.</p><p></p><p>Any life trapped in the Time Prison, unless their comprehension of time rules surpassed Lin Yuan's, would be unable to sense their own flow of time, completely becoming a plaything.</p><p></p><p>After all, how much time a life experienced inside the Time Prison was entirely up to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan could make the opponent experience one day while the outside experienced one year, or make the opponent experience one year while the outside experienced one day.</p><p></p><p>If this wasn't toying with someone, what was?</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were ways to forcibly break out of this technique.</p><p></p><p>Although Vice Tower Master Nalan's time comprehension was inferior to Lin Yuan's, if he used his full power and means beyond just time rules, he could still break free.</p><p></p><p>Time rules were not invincible rules; one's overall foundation still mattered.</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, the higher one's comprehension of time rules, the more control one would have. Take Lin Yuan for example - if he truly fought Vice Tower Master Nalan with full power, without limiting it to just the time domain, even if he couldn't defeat his opponent, he could still retreat safely by relying on his time rules.</p><p></p><p>"The Time Prison?"</p><p></p><p>On the high ground of the virtual "arena" world, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi was also observing the time crystal ball floating in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the ball, Vice Tower Master Nalan struggled desperately, trying to shake the prison, but from start to finish, the time crystal ball remained as steady as a rock, without the slightest wobble.</p><p></p><p>"This time secret technique combines over a thousand time models, possessing the profound effects of restraining and stabilizing enemies. Even at the tenth level realm, it would be considered an abstruse technique."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi silently thought, while also roughly gauging Lin Yuan's comprehension level in the time domain rules.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Vice Tower Master Nalan, with Lin Yuan only demonstrating this time secret technique, he wouldn't be able to see Lin Yuan's true attainments in the time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Enough."</p><p>"Stop now."</p><p>After watching for a while longer, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the world shifted again, and Lin Yuan returned to the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi's personal world.</p><p></p><p>The time crystal ball floated in front of him, with Vice Tower Master Nalan inside having stopped struggling, probably realizing that relying solely on his comprehension of time rules would not allow him to break free.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>With a subtle thought from Lin Yuan, the time crystal ball instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan's figure grew larger and larger, finally reappearing in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Out now?"</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan felt like he had been through another world, even though the battle had only lasted a few dozen breaths.</p><p></p><p>But in those more than ten minutes inside the Time Prison, Vice Tower Master Nalan had completely realized that he had fallen into the great Time Prison, likely created by the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had asked him to spar with the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>So during their sparring, his only opponent could be the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard it was for Vice Tower Master Nalan to believe, he could not question the Paramount Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord," Vice Tower Master Nalan looked at Lin Yuan, his gaze somewhat complicated.</p><p></p><p>In those more than ten minutes trapped in the Time Prison, Vice Tower Master Nalan had fully witnessed Lin Yuan's skills in the time domain rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had absolutely surpassed him. If not comprehending the time rules thoroughly, he had at least comprehended all the time model rules summarized by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This Galactic Lord, who was only at the ninth level, had already exceeded him, a veteran elite at the tenth level, in the time domain rules.</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan glanced at the Paramount Lord, and now he vaguely realized that the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had deliberately let him spar with Lin Yuan...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The sparring with the Galactic Lord was not to temper the Galactic Lord himself, but to use himself as a test subject to probe the general level of the Galactic Lord's comprehension in the domain of temporal laws. </p><p></p><p>He did not know that the Vice Patriarch Nalan had not even comprehended the temporal law models. In Lin Yuan's mind, the Vice Patriarch Nalan had a "very strong" filter.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, before their exchange, the Vice Patriarch Nalan repeatedly urged him to go all out. </p><p></p><p>This led Lin Yuan to not give the Vice Patriarch Nalan any opportunity to resist, directly suppressing him with the temporal prison.</p><p></p><p>"With the Galactic Lord's nine-stage cultivation base, to have such a high comprehension of the temporal laws, I admit defeat wholeheartedly," sighed the Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Patriarch Nalan understood that with Lin Yuan's speed of growth, his current comprehension of temporal laws surpassed his own, and the gap would only grow larger in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"Vice Patriarch Nalan, you can withdraw."</p><p></p><p>From the throne, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi spoke, glancing at the Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Patriarch Nalan immediately bowed, his figure disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Losing to his junior Lin Yuan, even if the Vice Patriarch Nalan could face the power gap between himself and the Galactic Lord, he felt somewhat embarrassed to remain.</p><p></p><p>With the Vice Patriarch Nalan's departure, only Lin Yuan and the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi remained on the field.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Lord," Lin Yuan slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"You monster," the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the temporal laws meant little to him.</p><p></p><p>But this depended on whose body it manifested in. For an eleventh-stage life form, it was a normal level - half of the eleventh-stage evolutionary beings in human civilization had comprehended all the temporal law models.</p><p></p><p>For a tenth-stage life form, it was exceptionally rare - at least the Vice Patriarch Nalan, a top-grade tenth-stage, had not achieved it.</p><p></p><p>But for a ninth-stage life form? The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had never heard of such a thing before. Moreover, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the temporal laws was not just as simple as comprehending all the temporal models.</p><p></p><p>"A monster?" Lin Yuan blinked. To be called a monster by a Paramount Lord could be considered an "honor"?</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Lord, did you ask me to comprehend the temporal law models and then come because there is some hidden secret?" Lin Yuan directly asked his doubt.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to beat around the bush when facing a Paramount Lord - just ask directly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed there is a hidden secret," the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi would not say much more.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lin Yuan's performance allowed the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi to see hope -</p><p></p><p>The hope that Lin Yuan could thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that the earlier you thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws and allow your inner world to become 'independent', the greater the benefits you will gain."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I know this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. In the history of human civilization, monstrous geniuses who thoroughly comprehended the temporal laws at the tenth stage would occasionally appear.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan knew that thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws at the tenth stage and then advancing to the eleventh stage would bring far greater benefits than not thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws - the inner worlds would undergo a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>As for thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws at the ninth stage, there were no corresponding cases in the history of human civilization. But this did not prevent Lin Yuan from speculating.</p><p></p><p>If thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws at the tenth stage could allow the inner world an additional opportunity for metamorphosis, then thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws at the ninth stage meant two additional opportunities for metamorphosis when advancing to the tenth and eleventh stages in the future.</p><p></p><p>The benefits would be immense.</p><p></p><p>"But do you know the specific benefits? Why would the inner world undergo a metamorphosis?" The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't know," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He only knew there were benefits but was unaware of what they were specifically.</p><p></p><p>The information he had seen did not record the details, which likely involved some confidential matters of human civilization that were not publicly disclosed, inaccessible even with eighth-level citizen privileges.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me explain the difference when a tenth-stage evolutionary being makes a major breakthrough and crosses into the eleventh stage, whether their inner world is 'independent' or not," said the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then continued, "If a tenth-stage evolutionary being has not thoroughly comprehended the temporal laws, their inner world lacks a temporal pillar and can only be attached to the main universe as a subordinate world."</p><p></p><p>"When a subordinate world undergoes a major realm breakthrough, it communicates with the primordial ocean of the main universe. At that time, the main universe will actively open the entrance to the primordial ocean, pouring in a large amount of primordial power to help the inner world grow rapidly."</p><p></p><p>"However, if the inner world has already become 'independent' with a temporal pillar and a spatial pillar, it can be considered an 'independent' world."</p><p></p><p>"Even if this 'independent' world is insignificant compared to the main universe, it is still an 'independent' world, theoretically on the same level as the main universe."  </p><p></p><p>"So when such an 'independent' world undergoes a major realm breakthrough, it will receive primordial power not from the main universe, but from the primordial chaos."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I see, so that's how it is," Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>The primordial chaos was certainly vastly more immense than the universe, so the primordial power from the primordial chaos was naturally more precious than the primordial power of the universe.</p><p></p><p>If ranked from high to low, it would be: primordial chaos > universe > subordinate world.</p><p></p><p>Once a subordinate world became independent in space and time, it would be on par with the universe, jointly receiving the bestowal of the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>Normally, most experts could only receive the bestowal of the primordial chaos and undergo metamorphosis when challenging to become an Paramount Existence after reaching the eleventh stage, as thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws typically happened at that level.</p><p></p><p>Only those challenging to become Paramount Lords could enjoy such a bestowal and metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>But as a result, Lin Yuan would enjoy it as early as the tenth stage, and the assistance it brought would be immense.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if Lin Yuan thoroughly comprehended the temporal laws at the ninth stage, he would receive the bestowal from the primordial chaos as early as the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>"The primordial power infused from the primordial chaos will greatly stabilize the inner world and enhance its essence, transforming it towards an inner universe."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, even if you thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws and make your inner world independent, when breaking through to the eleventh stage, you will not be able to transform your inner world into an inner universe all at once due to the limitations of your own realm."</p><p></p><p>"But the foundation will be laid, and in the future when you break through to become a Paramount Existence, the difficulty you need to overcome in terms of your inner world will definitely be much lower."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi said slowly.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to dispersing the pressure of breaking through to become a Paramount Existence in the future to the present, increasing the possibility of crossing into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had only heard of two methods that could increase the chances of breaking through to become a Paramount Existence:</p><p></p><p>One was to spread his own evolutionary path.  </p><p></p><p>The other was to comprehend the laws of chaos.</p><p></p><p>As for the fusion of temporal laws and spatial laws, that was a prerequisite for challenging to become a Paramount Existence.</p><p></p><p>Without achieving the fusion of space and time, one could not even cross the threshold to challenge becoming a Paramount Existence.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi, I may not necessarily be able to thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws at the ninth stage," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension abilities and treasures like the Miniature Universe to aid his comprehension, Lin Yuan had some confidence in thoroughly comprehending the temporal laws at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>But as for certainty? He did not have much.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had already prepared himself to thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws at the tenth stage instead.</p><p></p><p>Many eleventh-stage evolutionary beings had not thoroughly comprehended the temporal laws.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws at the ninth stage was not something he could guarantee.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to do so, wouldn't that be a slap in his own face?</p><p></p><p>"I know you're not certain you can thoroughly comprehend them," the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi did not find it strange at all.</p><p></p><p>Unless they were innate beings of time, who would dare guarantee they could thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws?</p><p></p><p>"So I had you comprehend all the temporal law models first, and then come find me. Apart from seeing your general comprehension level in the temporal laws, I also wanted to give you a push."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Give me a push?" Lin Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the temporal laws was an extremely personal matter.  </p><p></p><p>Everyone's understanding of the temporal laws was different, and it could not be forcibly imparted.</p><p></p><p>Even a wondrous treasure like the Miniature Universe could only lower the difficulty for Lin Yuan to comprehend the temporal laws.</p><p></p><p>But to give him a push? Lin Yuan had never considered that possibility.</p><p></p><p>The many treasures and methods left behind by the Lord of the Demonic Jade Pavilion and the Celestial Emperor had never mentioned pushing someone to thoroughly comprehend the temporal laws.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Next, I will take you to behold..."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi's tone was calm as he said slowly:</p><p></p><p>"The full expanse of the river of time."</p>

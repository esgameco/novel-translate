        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 457: Entering the Twelfth Realm (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>After activating the 'World' divine ability, it could only be maintained for six seconds.</p><p></p><p>Within these six seconds, Lin Yuan decided to try to kill the strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the hatred between human civilization and the Insect Race was too great. </p><p></p><p>In the past, when Lin Yuan had not yet grown strong, he had experienced several assassination attempts, most of which were plotted by the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, naturally the priority target to eliminate would be from the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Overlord!"</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert let out a shrill cry, and invisible soul fluctuations swept out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>However, all these soul fluctuations seemed to sink into mud when they reached Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert, Lin Yuan's right hand pressing down on her grew larger and larger, and the terrifying pressure made her feel like she was facing an ultimate expert.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hazy glow suddenly emanated from the top of the strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert's head, where the Nightmare Realm was located.</p><p></p><p>This hazy glow was completely different from the light emitted when the strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert activated her abilities. It was filled with an illusion that all things were illusory and dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan's mind was briefly captivated by this momentary illusion, but the next moment, relying on his powerful mental will, he broke free.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful mental will?" </p><p></p><p>A slightly surprised voice came, and Lin Yuan looked up to see a vague figure slowly emerging from the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>This figure was extremely illusory, but it gave Lin Yuan a sense of absolute reality, similar to that of an ultimate expert.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Twelfth Realm Apex?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared and reappeared in the air above the altar.</p><p></p><p>Although he had long known that killing the strongest Eleventh Realm expert would trigger the backup left behind by the Twelfth Realm Apex in the Tribal Weapon, Lin Yuan didn't expect it to be a Twelfth Realm Apex avatar.</p><p></p><p>Even though this avatar was just an incarnation of the Apex, it was not something Lin Yuan could currently deal with.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Tribal Weapon was still in the hands of that Insect Race Apex, and if the Apex avatar activated the Tribal Weapon, the destructive power it could unleash, even if it didn't reach a million points, would likely be extremely close.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Wanhua, as the mighty Apex, you dare to bully a little guy? That's unacceptable," from within the altar, a ring on Xuanyuan Yu's right hand also began to glow.</p><p></p><p>A male figure coalesced, gazing towards the Apex that had emerged from the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Xuanyuan Strongest Expert," Lin Yuan thought, looking at the male figure.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine Strongest Experts of human civilization, Lin Yuan had the most contact with the Xia Qin Strongest Expert, as he was affiliated with Xia Yu's Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xuanyuan Strongest Expert, although Lin Yuan hadn't interacted with him much, he knew that Xuanyuan was the first Strongest Expert born in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>He was also the Strongest Expert who had borne the greatest pressure and paid the highest price among the nine.</p><p></p><p>After all, human civilization had obtained that ultimate opportunity from the heavens, with countless inherited treasures descending from the cosmic universe, at a time when human civilization had not yet risen.</p><p></p><p>But when the first Strongest Expert of human civilization emerged, those Twelfth Realm Apexes naturally turned their attention to human civilization, leading to the exposure of that ultimate opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization and the then newly ascended Twelfth Realm Xuanyuan Strongest Expert became the focus of the cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>One Twelfth Realm Apex after another lay in wait, ready to attack human civilization at any time and plunder that ultimate opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Strongest Expert paid an unimaginable price to lead human civilization through that period, and it was only after the second, third, and fourth Strongest Experts were born that the situation for human civilization improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua Empress Mother."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned to the figure that had emerged from the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the Empress Mothers of the Insect Race, Wanhua Empress Mother was also the oldest and most powerful. It was she who had personally refined the Tribal Weapon, the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Empress Mother."</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert bowed to Wanhua Empress Mother. Normally, the backup within the Nightmare Realm would only be triggered when she was truly facing a life-or-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>Now that Wanhua Empress Mother had appeared, it meant that she had just been on the verge of being killed by the Silver Galaxy Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Silver Galaxy Overlord really have killed me across the Tribal Weapon?" The strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert found it hard to believe, but Wanhua Empress Mother's appearance could only mean that.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, you've also made a move?" Wanhua Empress Mother smiled slightly, and her invisible soul fluctuations affected all living beings. All the Eleventh Realm experts of the human civilization alliance in the altar began to involuntarily fall into a trance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Strongest Expert snorted coldly, his voice resonating in the minds of all the Eleventh Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"And besides, you say I'm bullying the Silver Galaxy Overlord, that's fine, but calling him a little guy? You're underestimating him way too much, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>Wanhua Empress Mother looked at the Silver Galaxy Overlord with a meaningful expression and said, "The Silver Galaxy Overlord's mental will has probably already reached the Twelfth Realm level, hasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Still a little guy?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression did not change upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had quickly shaken off Wanhua Empress Mother's soul influence relying on his powerful mental will.</p><p></p><p>Wanhua Empress Mother seemed to have also noticed this clue.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Silver Galaxy Overlord's mental will has already reached the Twelfth Realm level?" The strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Race expert looked at Lin Yuan in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the advancement of the physical body and soul, the advancement of mental will was the most difficult, especially after reaching hundreds of millions of points, where each increment required an enormous price.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord? Realm of Spiritual Will at the 12th Stage?</p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th stage Insect Race members could not comprehend it. How long has the Galactic Overlord lived? How could the Realm of Spiritual Will reach the 12th stage without being weathered by the passage of time?</p><p></p><p>"Realm of Spiritual Will at the 12th stage?" The other surrounding strongest 11th stage beings were also extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>After the Insect Race's Progenitor Queen manifested, the duration of her divine ability 'World' had essentially ended, and they could leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>But since the Progenitor Queen was here, these strongest 11th stage beings suddenly did not want to leave.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had only planned to witness the confrontation between the Insect Race's Progenitor Queen and the mightiest of human civilization. But they did not expect to hear such information.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord has a 12th stage Realm of Spiritual Will?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I felt like I was facing the ultimate when I faced him," the strongest 11th stage Calamity Tribe member thought to himself silently.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Calamity Tribe, after enduring countless tribulations, they had never managed to raise their Realm of Spiritual Will to the 12th stage at the 11th stage, it was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I, the peerless genius of human civilization, what's wrong with my Realm of Spiritual Will reaching the 12th stage?" </p><p></p><p>The Mightiest of the Xuanyuan said indifferently. Reaching the 12th stage of the Realm of Spiritual Will meant the level of mental memory pollution of the Mightiest, and it was now completely ineffective against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan had already grown completely. The most the other 12th stage ultimates could do was to kill Lin Yuan's avatar, but they could not affect his true body.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the Galactic Overlord doesn't seem to be carrying any ultimate essence at all, right?" The Progenitor Queen continued:</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor Tribe wanted to balance the heavenly scales and weaken the Galactic Overlord's life essence, but it didn't have any effect at all. The Galactic Overlord's life essence is far beyond the limit of the 11th stage."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Queen paused for a moment, "With such a thick life essence, if he were to truly unleash his ultimate essence, the power it would explode with, even the strongest 11th stage of each tribe, wielding tribal weapons, would not be able to block it."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding strongest 11th stage beings were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord did not unleash his ultimate essence? Ten years ago, the Galactic Overlord overthrew and destroyed tens of thousands of 11th stage beings, relying on his own strength?</p><p></p><p>And just now, more than a dozen of the strongest 11th stage beings could only cling to life by relying on tribal weapons in front of the Galactic Overlord, was it also due to the Galactic Overlord's own strength?</p><p></p><p>"Without relying on external forces, the Galactic Overlord can kill me through the tribal weapons?" </p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th stage Insect Race member was frightened. She instinctively wanted to refute this claim, but the one saying this was the supreme Progenitor Queen of the Insect Race. Even if this strongest 11th stage being had great courage, she dared not question the Progenitor Queen's words.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood on the altar, silently listening to the Progenitor Queen's words.</p><p></p><p>"Although the 12th stage ultimate cannot directly probe the world within my physical soul body, just through indirect observation and inference, they can still see many of my secrets."</p><p></p><p>This was inevitable, unless Lin Yuan did not take action, otherwise being seen through by the 12th stage ultimates of the various peak tribal powers was almost certain.</p><p></p><p>Still, the same old saying.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already grown completely, even if some of his own secrets were exposed, it didn't matter. What could those peak tribal power's mightiest do to him?</p><p></p><p>"I, the peerless genius of human civilization, what's wrong with having such talents?" </p><p></p><p>The Mightiest of the Xuanyuan remained unmoved, but he was secretly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He also learned later that the Progenitor Tribe used the Heavenly Scales to weaken Lin Yuan's life essence.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Lin Yuan's strength was hardly affected at all, he also speculated that the Galactic Overlord might be relying on himself.</p><p></p><p>The Mightiest of the Xuanyuan's words made the Progenitor Queen somewhat silent.</p><p></p><p>Those strongest 11th stage beings also had complex thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Was this a matter of talent? Just what kind of freak is the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>With the Galactic Overlord here, it made them, the 11th stage beings, look like trash.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor, you don't need to say more."</p><p></p><p>"Now, what's the plan? Is it to enter the final battle prematurely, or continue to let the little ones fight it out?"</p><p></p><p>The Mightiest of the Xuanyuan directly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The so-called premature entry into the final battle meant that 12th stage level treasures or methods would formally enter the fray.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the treasures and methods here did not refer to the infighting between the 12th stage ultimates, but the addition of more foundational treasures, causing the war to be fully upgraded.</p><p></p><p>The large-scale battle spatial rifts that existed in the past were caused by the attacks of those with battle power reaching hundreds of thousands of points, which were the result of the final battle.</p><p></p><p>However, the final battle usually occurred in the last stage of a large-scale war, and normally the intensity would not be high in the first ten or twenty years before that.</p><p></p><p>But due to the appearance of the Galactic Overlord, the development direction of the war became somewhat strange, with the various tribes joining forces prematurely, and because the Galactic Overlord had the ability to kill the strongest 11th stage Insect Race members, it triggered the measures the Progenitor Queen had left in the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Premature final battle?" </p><p></p><p>The Progenitor Queen smiled slightly, "There's no need for that, my Insect Race has decided to withdraw from this war."</p><p></p><p>If the fighting continued, the 12th stage level beings would certainly be blocked by the mightiest of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As for those below the 12th stage? Given the strength the Galactic Overlord has now displayed, the strongest 11th stage beings wielding tribal weapons or even ultimate essences are clearly not his match.</p><p></p><p>If he really went berserk and let the Galactic Overlord unleash his ultimate essence, wouldn't the mightiest 11th stage beings of the various peak tribal powers be crushed into the ground?</p>

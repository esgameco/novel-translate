            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can I take away all the treasures in the human civilization's treasure trove?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but hold his breath.</p><p></p><p>The 'take away' from the mouth of the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse probably didn't require any merit points.</p><p></p><p>It's just that if there's a need, you can take it away.</p><p></p><p>After all, human civilization is a peak ethnic group.</p><p></p><p>The treasure trove of human civilization has collected many rare treasures of the Twelve Constellations.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, as long as you feel the need, you can directly take them away," the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supremacy Powerhouse," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although most of the treasures in the human civilization's treasure trove are of no use to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The resources to cultivate the "Xuanhuang Body" to the twelfth level of perfection? Even if all the resources in the entire universe were drained, it would still be far from enough, the entire treasures and rarities of human civilization are just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse didn't know this.</p><p></p><p>Since the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse said so, he must have prepared for a massive reduction in the rare treasures of the human civilization's treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can successfully cross into the twelfth level, any price that human civilization pays will be worth it," the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm preparing to make the final assault soon," Lin Yuan nodded, he could feel the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse's expectations for him.</p><p></p><p>"Before the final assault, remember to use those auxiliary treasures in the treasure trove," the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse reminded.</p><p></p><p>In the treasure trove of human civilization, there are some rare treasures that can help with the final assault, such as the Cosmic Source that Lin Yuan obtained earlier, which can increase the time foundation in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are some other rare treasures similar to the Cosmic Source, and the ancient gods who have reached the eleventh level of perfection in the depths of the cosmic starry sky, don't know how much they crave these rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the ancient god Tuoba was willing to offend Lin Yuan, this peerless genius of human civilization, just to try to get one of these rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After being promoted to an eleventh-level citizen, Lin Yuan's personal authority has reached the highest level of human civilization, and he can view the information of any treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Also, when you're preparing for the final assault, be sure to say that we're doing this to guard against those alien twelfth-level beings," the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse said.</p><p></p><p>The leap from the eleventh level to the twelfth level, after the final assault, the essence of life and everything about oneself will transcend the long river of time, and cannot be hindered or influenced, even the Supremacy Powerhouse cannot interfere.</p><p></p><p>But before that, bearing the infusion of the chaotic void origin, if the twelfth-level final assault is discovered in time, there is still a chance to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's just a possibility.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is of utmost importance to human civilization, so the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse naturally wants to eliminate all possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to the tenth and eleventh levels, there were Supremacy Powerhouses guarding him, and the assault on the twelfth level would be no exception.</p><p></p><p>"Then you keep cultivating, and if you have any requests, just tell me or Xia Qin directly," the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse said, then cut off the video call.</p><p></p><p>"Assault the final level?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged and began to browse through the many treasures in the human civilization's treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary rare treasures, even at the twelfth-star level, have little effect on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's main focus is on the rare treasures that the Xuanyuan Supremacy Powerhouse mentioned, which can assist in the final assault.</p><p></p><p>"These rare treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave them a brief glance and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The rare treasures in the human civilization's treasure trove that can assist in the final assault are absolutely a godsend for ordinary eleventh-level perfected experts.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, they basically have no effect.</p><p></p><p>The rare treasures that can assist in the final assault are also graded, with the Time-Space Heart left by the Demon Jade Pavilion Master being the highest grade, while the Cosmic Source and the like belong to the middle grade.</p><p></p><p>The probability of an ordinary eleventh-level expert breaking through to the final level is about one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>In such a case, even the lowest-grade treasure to assist in the final assault can have a great effect.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan? The probability of breaking through to the final level is estimated to be 95% or even 97% or 98%.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's accumulated foundation, even a high-grade treasure like the Time-Space Heart would have a very limited effect on him, and the auxiliary rare treasures in the human civilization's treasure trove would basically be of no help.</p><p></p><p>Raising the probability from one in ten thousand to two in ten thousand is not that difficult, but raising it from 98% to 99% is as difficult as climbing to the sky.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even those eleventh-level lives with towering backgrounds in the chaotic void, the probability of breaking through to the final level would not exceed 20%.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's ability to reach 95% is entirely due to his mastery of the chaotic rules and the seven-layer realm of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"These auxiliary rare treasures can be left for the future evolution practitioners who will break through to the twelfth level," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted with his parents and sister Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, have you heard? The Martial Dao evolution path is now ranked fifth among the evolution paths of human civilization? It turns out that the origin planet of the Martial Dao evolution path is Canglan Star."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The hottest event in human civilization now is the Martial Dao evolution path. Just the eleventh-level evolution path has been ranked fifth among humans, surpassing the five major Supremacy evolution paths?</p><p></p><p>Even the most ordinary citizens are aware of what this means.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was the same. Initially, Lin Yuan had asked her if she wanted to cultivate the martial arts evolution path, but Lin Yi did not like the close-quarters combat evolution path, so she ultimately chose the long-range psychic evolution path.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Lin Yi's judgment was still not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did Canglan Star produce a brother who is an unparalleled evolution genius, it also has the martial arts evolution path. Tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's tone was somewhat surprised, feeling that it was too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>"It is a bit coincidental," Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he had already predicted that perhaps someone had associated him with the founder of the martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Normally speaking, as an unparalleled evolution genius, Lin Yuan had reached the Eleventh Realm in less than a thousand years, and he was an invincible Eleventh Realm expert who had swept and crushed the other peak faction forces.</p><p></p><p>His identity as the founder of an evolution path simply did not match up.</p><p></p><p>The creation of an evolution path requires the expenditure of a great deal of time and effort. Even an Eleventh Realm expert who had only reached that level in less than a thousand years could be described as unprecedented, but the identity of the founder of the martial arts evolution path? Even though they both came from Canglan Star, at first no one had associated the two together.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, the martial arts evolution path continued to rise in the rankings, and Lin Yuan continued to advance. Evolvers within human civilization began to associate Lin Yuan with the founder of the martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>Now that the martial arts evolution path has become the fifth evolution path of human civilization, combined with Lin Yuan's performance on the super-large battlefields, even if Lin Yuan did not go out of his way to investigate, he knew that the rumors about his connection to the martial arts path founder were becoming more and more widespread.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not care much about these things. At his current level, even if he revealed his identity as the martial arts path founder, what could it change? His strength was no weaker than that of a normal Dao Splitting Realm expert, and within this universe, he was basically unkillable.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what are you looking at?" Lin Yi couldn't help but ask curiously when she saw Lin Yuan gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at what?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly. "I'm looking at what's outside the universe."</p><p></p><p>"Outside the universe?" Lin Yi blinked her eyes. Even now, there were many places within the human civilization domain that she did not know about, let alone what was outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Outside the universe.</p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's incarnation formed from the condensation of Chaotic Qi came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken free from the influence of the universe." Lin Yuan looked back, and at this moment, his home universe had become the size of a fist. Unknowingly, Lin Yuan had already distanced himself from his home universe.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Chaotic Void, the universe is a massive celestial body, and each universe influences a vast surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lin Yuan could feel that he had completely broken free from the influence of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time has changed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it. By comparing with his true body's spirit, the place he was in now had a slower flow of time compared to the flow of time in the universe, approximately at a ratio of 1 to 300.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>While 300 years had passed in the main universe, only 1 year had passed in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time... The flow of time in the Chaotic Void is about the same as that of the first Source World I explored."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. After reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, thirty-three world coordinates had appeared in the depths of the Myriad Realms Gate, connecting to thirty-three vast Source Worlds.</p><p></p><p>The first Source World Lin Yuan had explored also had a time flow ratio of about 1 to 300 compared to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Void and that Source World are roughly at the same level?" Based on the time flow ratio, Lin Yuan could draw some conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were just conclusions, not necessarily facts. The time flow speed could only reflect the level of a world to a certain extent, and was not absolute.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue exploring."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose a direction, his figure disappearing and reappearing tens of millions of light-years away in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void was boundless, and even tens of millions of light-years away, the scenery around Lin Yuan had not changed much, and the main universe behind him also showed no significant changes.</p><p></p><p>"The rules in the Chaotic Void are more complete, and the pressure to manipulate the rules will be greater." Lin Yuan explored while carefully perceiving.</p><p></p><p>If the many rules of the main universe were like an iron rod, then the rules of the Chaotic Void were like a celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Wielding an iron rod is vastly different from wielding a celestial pillar in terms of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>So in the Chaotic Void, the destructive power of experts from the main universe would drop significantly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Chaotic Void with its more complete and vast rules would have a higher ceiling for any expert. At least in the Chaotic Void, the difficulty of entering the Mastery Realm would be slightly easier than in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure kept disappearing and reappearing, crossing vast distances. The external Chaotic rules of the Seventh Realm of Time and Space allowed Lin Yuan to be as comfortable as a fish in water in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's figure stopped, gazing in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>A "shooting star" was rapidly falling from high above, and it was predicted to pass through the location where Lin Yuan was currently situated.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the "shooting star". "There is a fluctuation of precious treasure aura, containing many Twelve Star Rare Treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"Could my luck be this good?" Lin Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just by casually sending out an incarnation to explore, he had encountered the opportunity to obtain heavenly treasures falling from the sky?</p>

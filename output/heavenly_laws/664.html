        <h1>Chapter 664</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Lieyang Kingdom, the true body of Lin Yuanzhen went to the newly born sacred land, while the Taiyin Primordial Spirit and the Taiyang Primordial Spirit respectively guarded the other two top-tier sacred lands.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the one left in the royal palace of the kingdom was just an incarnation, but even this incarnation was on par with the Peerless Supreme Celestial Venerable, given Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, is it true that you swept through the Void Celestial Venerables and other top-tier Celestial Venerables in the sacred land?" A message came, from the Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Although the Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom had already received accurate intelligence, and had even seen the relevant video footage, he still found it hard to believe, so he came to ask in person.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has just had a breakthrough," Lin Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the core royal clan of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom, his growing strength would only strengthen the foundation of the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As for causing any jealousy? With his current strength, Lin Yuan could completely ignore such things.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good." The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom was overjoyed. The Silver River Celestial Venerable's strength, which could crush the mightiest Celestial Venerables, was not just about the contention for a sacred land.</p><p></p><p>It would also have a profound impact on the situation of the Six Ancient Kingdoms in the long run.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of Lin Yuan, who far surpassed the mightiest Celestial Venerables, which of the other five ancient kingdoms, including the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom, would dare to engage in a high-intensity war with the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom? Without daring to start a war, they could only yield and retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Venerable, you have surprised me too much." The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan with deep emotion.</p><p></p><p>He did not ask Lin Yuan why he had such strong strength, as every powerful expert had their own secrets, and the ancient kingdoms had always not interfered with this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the group of the mightiest Celestial Venerables of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom call you?" The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Lin Yuan was quite curious.</p><p></p><p>In the sacred land, he had not held back at all against the group of Peerless Celestial Venerables of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom, and had even subdued the Void Celestial Venerable, the mightiest of them all.</p><p></p><p>"The Undefeatable Celestial Venerable." The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even the proud group of the mightiest Celestial Venerables of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom used such a title to describe Lin Yuan, which meant that they had completely given up the idea of contending with him.</p><p></p><p>The Undefeatable Celestial Venerable, what did that mean? That was absolute crushing and sweeping.</p><p></p><p>"The Undefeatable Celestial Venerable?" Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void had the concept of the Undefeatable Great Saint, where a certain peerless Great Saint swept away all other peerless Great Saints, and made them submit wholeheartedly, so he could claim the title of the Undefeatable Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>But in the Six Ancient Kingdoms? The so-called Undefeatable Great Saint was equivalent to the mightiest Celestial Venerables of the Six Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>The Undefeatable Great Saint was unstoppable in the Chaotic Void, but in the Six Ancient Kingdoms, it was not a matter of being undefeatable, as there were still opponents, with the various ancestral founders nurturing a group of Celestial Venerables that were on par with the Undefeatable Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>And now, Lin Yuan's strength had made the group of the mightiest Celestial Venerables of the Six Ancient Kingdoms despair, so the title of the Undefeatable Celestial Venerable was well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you have redefined the limit of Celestial Venerables." The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom said, not only the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom, but the other four ancient kingdoms had also engaged in heated discussions about the Silver River Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"The limit of Celestial Venerables?" Lin Yuan thought to himself: "In fact, I am still far from reaching the limit."</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had reached the perfect Chaotic Realm in terms of cultivation, but in other aspects, he still had a lot of room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>For example, the "Infinite Void" inheritance, Lin Yuan was still at the third layer, and he did not dare to expect the theoretical seventh layer, but he was quite confident in the sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>And the distance between the third layer and the sixth layer was the fourth layer and the fifth layer.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was the evolving Chaotic Taiji Dao, which was currently at the first level, and according to the understanding of the many Celestial Venerables of the Six Ancient Kingdoms on the path of Chaotic evolution, the upper limit should be the third level.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there were the many thirteenth-tier inheritances in the treasure trove of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom, which Lin Yuan could also cultivate to enhance his strength, etc.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the thirteenth-tier inheritances required a lot of merit, but after this contention for the sacred land, Lin Yuan estimated that he would gain a huge amount of ancient kingdom merit.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's cultivating the thirteenth-tier inheritances or improving the Chaotic evolution Dao, it's all for the sake of breaking through to the thirteenth tier." Lin Yuan was very clear about his goal.</p><p></p><p>Secret techniques and methods were just branches.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation realm was the root.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the thirteenth-tier inheritances was also to experience the power of the thirteenth-tier realm.</p><p></p><p>In order to better break through the time loop.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, what's the situation in the sacred land?" The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's all under control." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The many Peerless Celestial Venerables of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom and the other four ancient kingdoms had either died or fled, and dared not stay in the sacred land any longer.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan needed to do next was to refine the core celestial pillars one by one, and when the two-thousand-year contention for the sacred land ended, the owner of the sacred land would be officially determined.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Flame Celestial Venerable told me about the situation in the sacred land. If it weren't for you, Silver River, the chances of my Ancient Lieyang Kingdom seizing this sacred land would not be great. Even if we could seize it, we would have been severely punished by Xuanyin and Daling."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Lieyang Kingdom sighed deeply: "In this contention for the sacred land, Silver River, you have made great contributions. It can be said that without you, the situation would not be as it is now."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I feel that just rewarding your merits is not enough to explain the importance of Silver River to me." The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country looked at Lin Yuan and said, "So I have decided that after the ownership of the treasure land is determined, Silver River, you will be the one to guard this treasure land. During the time you guard it, all the rare treasures produced within the treasure land will belong to you, and you don't need to hand them over to the Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you are here, this treasure land will be yours. No matter who becomes the emperor in the future, this will not change."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The treasure land completely belongs to him? It must be known that this treasure land is a top-tier treasure land among the first-class treasure lands, and for the many treasure lands controlled by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, even the most ordinary treasure land, the guardian would have to hand over eighty to ninety percent of the rare treasures produced to the Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>This is the rule set by the Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>No one can defy it.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country has almost given this treasure land to him for free?</p><p></p><p>"This is too precious." Lin Yuan shook his head. To casually give him a first-class treasure land, which is equivalent to a money tree, is this really happening?</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan almost single-handedly seized this treasure land, he was very clear that all of this was made possible with the help of the might of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Without the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, those supreme Transcendent Saints from the other ancient countries would not be able to fight him on equal terms, and at most they would go seek help from their own ancestral founders.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of the existence of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country that the competition is limited to below the ancestral founders, and they will not reach the point of seeking the ancestral founders.</p><p></p><p>If the supreme Transcendent Saints from the Great Fu Ancient Country were really forced to seek the ancestral founder, that would be an embarrassment to the ancestral founder.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you have underestimated your influence too much." The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country smiled and said, "With you here, it's not just about this one treasure land. In the future, which of the other five ancient countries dares to compete with my Blazing Sun Ancient Country? Your existence will bring countless benefits to my Blazing Sun Ancient Country. What's just one treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, thought about it, and since the free benefits couldn't be refused, and his deterrence was indeed very strong, he nodded and said, "Okay, I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>The rare treasures nurtured by this first-class treasure land involve the time dimension, and research on them may bring him no small use.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he can't use them, as the only one who controls this treasure land, Lin Yuan is equivalent to monopolizing these rare treasures, and he can sell as many as he wants to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, as for the merits of seizing this treasure land, we'll talk about it after the competition is over." The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The final distribution of merits involves not only Lin Yuan, but also the other supreme Transcendent Saints of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country who participated in the competition.</p><p></p><p>Although these supreme Transcendent Saints are far less useful than Lin Yuan, since they participated, they will still get some merits.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now, there are less than two hundred years left before the two-thousand-year deadline for the competition over the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"However, if you break through to the Ancestral Founder Realm in the future, this treasure land can also be guarded by your descendants, but you'll have to follow the normal rules for treasure lands and hand over eighty percent of the rare treasures produced to the Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country seemed to have thought of something and immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"That's natural."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Handing over the rare treasures produced in the treasure land to the Ancient Country is not only a division of benefits, but also a means of obtaining protection.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength is absolutely invincible, and even if he monopolizes all the rare treasures produced in the treasure land, there won't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>But what about the future? When Lin Yuan breaks through to the Thirteenth Realm, and his descendants guard the treasure land, they don't have Lin Yuan's strength. Monopolizing all the rare treasures produced in the treasure land is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Handing over eighty percent of the rare treasures to the Ancient Country is equivalent to binding the Ancient Country to his side, which is actually safer.</p><p></p><p>At least with eighty percent of the rare treasures shared, the Blazing Sun Ancient Country will definitely do its utmost to ensure that this treasure land is not invaded by other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Inside the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to chat with the Crimson Flame Transcendent Saint and other supreme Transcendent Saints of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country for a while, and then began to continue refining the core celestial pillars in the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning of the push to the present, Lin Yuan had only refined more than a hundred core celestial pillars, and there were still more than half of the core celestial pillars yet to be refined.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Accompanied by the refinement of one core celestial pillar after another.</p><p></p><p>An increasingly profound and extraordinary sense of control surged into his heart.</p><p></p><p>Refining the core celestial pillars of the treasure land can achieve a certain degree of control over the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, refining all the core celestial pillars is equivalent to refining this newly born treasure land.</p><p></p><p>However, this treasure land, from its birth to the present, has had its various core celestial pillars refined by the supreme Transcendent Saints of the six ancient countries, and has never been unified and refined before.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The three giant core celestial pillars and more than three hundred ordinary core celestial pillars were all refined by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan's spiritual sense began to rise infinitely, descending to the deepest part of the treasure land, which was an area that the many supreme Transcendent Saints had never involved themselves in before, and could only be reached by refining all the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, his pupils slightly contracting.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 266 - Battle to Ascend the Heavens (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Stage of Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The only reason the Martial Dao cultivation system was so powerful was because of him, the Martial Ancestor. </p><p></p><p>Essentially, the foundation of Martial Dao was still too shallow.</p><p></p><p>Although it had a history of hundreds of thousands of years, apart from the three to four hundred years when Lin Yuan presided, there were basically no major achievements in other times.</p><p></p><p>Relying on just a few hundred years to cultivate an Eighth Stage Martial Dao practitioner from scratch was no different from a fool's dream.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan exhausted his own origin to cultivate them, when they broke through from the Seventh Stage to the Eighth Stage and experienced the Heart Demon Tribulation, if their state of mind was slightly inferior, it would be equivalent to cultivating them in vain.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can cultivate an Eighth Stage Martial Dao practitioner before my time limit for staying, the Martial Dao cultivation system can be completely stabilized."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's mind, the few Martial Dao cultivators who might be promoted to the Eighth Stage in the end were naturally the three old Seventh Stage experts: Li Qing, Shan Yang, and Nie Yun.</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivators who had only embarked on the path of Martial Dao in the recent hundreds of years, their accumulation was far from enough.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Including Lin Yuan, more than twenty Supreme Immortal Kings gathered in one place, and their terrifying auras shook the surrounding billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era, in the past millions of years, the number of Supreme Immortal King powerhouses that had been born added up to no more than thirty, and they were now basically all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Kaitian Immortal King was majestic, with a black giant axe on his back. His eyes were sharp as he looked towards the entrance of the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It was shrouded in clouds and mist, and there seemed to be terrifying auras circulating, which were obviously the means left by those Supreme Immortal Kings of the Prehistoric Era.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the later generations from entering the Eighth Heaven and sharing the opportunity of the Ninth Heaven with them.</p><p></p><p>"In the last Battle to Ascend the Heavens, my strength had not yet broken through. This time I will definitely be able to." The Kaitian Immortal King swept his eyes over the other Supreme Immortal Kings, his tone full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Kaitian power he mastered was a high-grade Creation Power, and it was also a high-grade Creation Power that specialized in attacking. Every time they attacked the Eighth Heaven, he would be the main force.</p><p></p><p>And attacking the Eighth Heaven was also called the "Battle to Ascend the Heavens" by the Kaitian Immortal King and other Supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Kaitian, we believe in you."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, those old fellows from the Prehistoric Era are too greedy, wanting to monopolize the opportunity of the Ninth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Later, I will deal with that Misty Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>After multiple Battles to Ascend the Heavens, the Supreme Immortal Kings present were quite familiar with those old fellows in the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As Supreme Immortal Kings, even if they failed to ascend to heaven, at most they would be seriously injured and it was almost impossible for them to perish. Therefore, those Supreme Immortal Kings in the Eighth Heaven had never descended to the Seventh Heaven to hunt them down.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if they did hunt them down, it would be very difficult to completely kill a certain Supreme Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood on the side, quietly listening to the exchanges between the Supreme Immortal Kings beside him.</p><p></p><p>Among the more than twenty Supreme Immortal Kings present, only Lin Yuan was a newcomer who had never participated in the Battle to Ascend the Heavens, so at this moment, he would rather not speak if he could.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly raised his head and looked towards the entrance of the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>With his perception, he had already noticed that the auras at the level of Supreme Immortal Kings were constantly gathering. It was obvious that the Supreme Immortal King powerhouses of the Eighth Heaven also knew that the Kaitian Immortal King and other Supreme Immortal Kings were about to launch the Battle to Ascend the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also became curious about the Ninth Heaven. What exactly was it that made the Supreme Immortal Kings of the Prehistoric Era gather in the Eighth Heaven and join forces to block the Supreme Immortal Kings of later generations from joining?</p><p></p><p>"I will know very soon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless, terrifying auras appeared one after another at the exit connecting to the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Those little fellows below want to fight their way up again. With their strength, even if they do fight their way up, what's the use?"</p><p></p><p>A figure shrouded in clouds and mist sneered. As a Supreme Immortal King of the Prehistoric Era, he had every right to call the Kaitian Immortal King and Taishang Immortal King and other Supreme Immortal Kings "little fellows".</p><p></p><p>"We can't underestimate them. That Kaitian Immortal King has mastered the Kaitian power, and the Taishang Immortal King has mastered the Limitless power. Once they comprehend it to the Three Heavens Realm, it will be troublesome for us as well."</p><p></p><p>Another figure said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Kaitian power.</p><p></p><p>Limitless power.</p><p></p><p>They were both high-grade Creation Powers.</p><p></p><p>In the previous Battles to Ascend the Heavens, the Kaitian Immortal King and Taishang Immortal King had only comprehended this kind of high-grade Creation Power to the Two Heavens Realm.</p><p></p><p>That's why they were easily repelled by them.</p><p></p><p>"It's just trouble."</p><p></p><p>The third figure said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Even if they really comprehended the high-grade Creation Power to the Three Heavens Realm, so what?</p><p></p><p>These Supreme Immortal Kings who had lived through long years basically all had similar means.</p><p></p><p>In terms of talent, as Supreme Immortal Kings of the Prehistoric Era, they were not inferior to the Supreme Immortal Kings of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era at all.</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation time, spanning almost two eras, they surpassed the Kaitian Immortal King and other Supreme Immortal Kings by who knows how much.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that the longer the cultivation time, it does not mean the stronger the strength.</p><p></p><p>"Leave that Kaitian Immortal King to me. It just so happens that I also cultivate the Kaitian power." A figure with an equally majestic stature said.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Powers of the Spirit Realm were not unique and could be comprehended by multiple Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>The Kaitian power, as a high-grade Creation Power, and one that specialized in killing power, naturally attracted the attention of many Supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Supreme Immortal Kings were talking.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying axe light chopped from the Seventh Heaven, tearing apart the void and smashing towards the hazy clouds at the entrance of the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of clouds and mist were split apart, and although they quickly recovered, they were immediately followed by more axe lights.</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow Kaitian."</p><p></p><p>The figure shrouded in mist frowned, "Let's make a move, don't let them really attack their way up..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Kaitian's Kaitian power must have broken through again." The Taishang Immortal King said in a low voice, looking at the axe lights Kaitian Immortal King had split apart.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Immortal Kings heard this and agreed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the strength of the Kaitian Immortal King was simply terrifying. Each axe light exceeded the full-strength attack of a normal Supreme Immortal King. Chopping out like this endlessly, even the Taishang Immortal King did not dare to take it head-on.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Figures walked out one after another.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a majestic figure also held a giant axe, but this giant axe was cyan in color and shrouded in axe light, directly blocking the offensive of the Kaitian Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"Little fellows, are you going to roll down directly, or do you want us to beat you down?"</p><p></p><p>The leading figure spoke, his voice resounding throughout the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"It's Lingxu Immortal King, that old undying..." The Taishang Immortal King's tone revealed a hint of dread.</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King had mastered a high-grade Creation Power and six ordinary Creation Powers, and all the Creation Powers were cultivated to the Three Heavens Realm. His strength was terrifyingly extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, on the other hand, looked at the Lingxu Immortal King with slightly burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>Among the Creation Power auras emanating from the Lingxu Immortal King, there were three that Lin Yuan had never encountered before, one of which was also a high-grade Creation Power.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go together."</p><p></p><p>The Taishang Immortal King soared into the sky, and the other Supreme Immortal Kings followed.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dozens of Supreme Immortal Kings were fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath of each Supreme Immortal King's attack affected millions of miles. If the battlefield was not in the Nine Heavens, but in the Three Thousand Dao Realms.</p><p></p><p>Just the aftermath of the battle between these dozens of Supreme Immortal Kings would be enough to destroy the Three Thousand Dao Realms several times over.</p><p></p><p>Countless True Immortals and Half-Step Immortal Kings would basically die out.</p><p></p><p>But in the Nine Heavens, especially in the Seventh Heaven, these aftermaths did not cause much impact.</p><p></p><p>Or to put it another way, the impact they caused, such as the torn space, would quickly recover.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed at the back and had time to take a look at the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Kaitian Immortal King was held back by a Supreme Immortal King who had also comprehended the Kaitian power. The two fought in basically the same way, chopping at each other directly with their axes, but the Kaitian power involved between each axe made ordinary Supreme Immortal Kings tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Immortal King was fighting against two Peerless Immortal Kings. The Supreme Immortal King possessed immeasurable power, and every strike was vast and mighty. Even when fighting against two opponents, he still suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only took a glance around and sensed that someone was watching him.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've made a move."</p><p></p><p>"Little fellow, as your senior, I'll allow you to strike first. Otherwise, you won't have a chance later," a thin man stood in the distance, smiling and staring at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let me strike first?" Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He was considering how much strength to use. Although the power of the Taiji Avatar was far inferior to his true self, it grasped the high-level Taiji Creative Power, as well as four other high-level Creative Powers and dozens of ordinary Creative Powers.</p><p></p><p>Even if the dozens of Creative Powers at the end were only at the first level, combined with the internal world spanning millions of miles, Lin Yuan believed his strength was not weaker than a Peerless Immortal King who had mastered a high-level Creative Power at the third level. In fact, he might even be a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." The thin Immortal King nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that Lin Yuan had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This disappearance was not movement or teleportation, but a true disappearance from this world.</p><p></p><p>"Not good." The thin Immortal King's face greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively began to retreat backwards.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late. Lin Yuan's figure had appeared beside him at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>Then, he lightly threw out a punch.</p><p></p><p>This punch did not leak any power, but in the eyes of the thin Immortal King, it made his scalp explode, and he vaguely sensed the position of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Shatter."</p><p></p><p>A large amount of blood qi burst out from the thin Immortal King's skin. The next moment, his body exploded.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's punch, his physical body was shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>An illusory soul appeared.</p><p></p><p>It frantically rushed towards the entrance of the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This soul's speed was so fast that even Lin Yuan felt he couldn't stop it, so he simply didn't make a move.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had already comprehended the Creative Powers that the thin Immortal King had mastered. Killing him didn't bring any actual benefits.</p><p></p><p>The shattering of the thin Immortal King's body immediately attracted the attention of the other Peerless Immortal Kings around.</p><p></p><p>Those Peerless Immortal Kings from the Prehistoric Era looked at Lin Yuan with incredulous gazes.</p><p></p><p>Although the thin Immortal King's strength wasn't particularly powerful, he wasn't that weak either. With just a single punch, his physical body was shattered. Could it be that a certain high-level Creative Power had been comprehended to the third level?</p><p></p><p>And it was an offensive Creative Power similar to the Kaitianzhi Power?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Martial Ancestor, I didn't expect you to have such strength." The Kaitian Immortal King laughed loudly. Although that thin Immortal King didn't perish, his physical body was shattered. Even if he relied on his soul to re-condense his body, he wouldn't be able to exert much strength and definitely wouldn't make a move again in this battle to ascend to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Eighth Heaven, the Lingxu Immortal King did not participate in the battle. His task was to guard the entrance and prevent those Peerless Immortal Kings below from taking advantage of any loopholes to sneak into the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"When did such a powerful figure appear in this era?" The Lingxu Immortal King's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>His attention was always focused on the battlefield. The battle between Lin Yuan and the thin Immortal King was all under his watch. He vaguely felt that Lin Yuan's strength was probably even above the Kaitian Immortal King and the Supreme Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. The balance has been broken."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor cannot be allowed to remain."</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that in this battle to ascend to the heavens, there would be such an anomaly like the Martial Ancestor. With such strength, it was actually his first time participating in the battle to ascend to the heavens. It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, in the upcoming war, no one would be able to escape from the Martial Ancestor. The situation might turn unfavorable for them.</p><p></p><p>"I must take action."</p><p></p><p>"At least heavily injure the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King looked towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, several Peerless Immortal Kings from the Prehistoric Era joined hands, wanting to stop the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But under Lin Yuan's simple actions, those few Peerless Immortal Kings obviously couldn't hold on for long.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Although the Lingxu Immortal King still stood there, his true body was hidden deep in the void, approaching Lin Yuan's direction.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest Peerless Immortal King on the scene, the Lingxu Immortal King believed that with his methods, through a sneak attack, even if that Martial Ancestor didn't die, he would be heavily injured.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak."</p><p></p><p>"Too weak, and the Creative Powers you've mastered are also very ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the few Peerless Immortal Kings surrounding him. With every strike, the auras of these Peerless Immortal Kings dropped a level.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Destruction."</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King raised his right hand, and a hazy gray qi enveloped Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>High-level Creative Power.</p><p></p><p>The Great Destruction Power.</p><p></p><p>This was a killing Creative Power on par with the Kaitianzhi Power.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two was that the Kaitianzhi Power attacked a point or a line, while the Great Destruction Power attacked a plane.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, as long as one was in front of it, everything would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Great Destruction Power was the bane of energy, soul, and life.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to disperse this avatar body.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, a restraining power pressed down.</p><p></p><p>"I've cultivated the Great Destruction Power to the third level, and I've also cultivated six ordinary Creative Powers to the third level."</p><p></p><p>"The six third-level ordinary Creative Powers cooperate with each other, almost not inferior to a third-level high-grade Creative Power."</p><p></p><p>"It's equivalent to me mastering two third-level high-grade Creative Powers."</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King was very confident in himself. Even the Kaitian Immortal King could only defend against him.</p><p></p><p>By lowering himself to sneak attack this Martial Ancestor, he might be able to shatter his physical body and make him completely lose the ability to continue fighting.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Martial Ancestor!" The Kaitian Immortal King in the distance also noticed this scene and became a bit anxious. He continuously chopped out several axes, wanting to restrain the Lingxu Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>But he was immediately entangled by the opponent in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Immortal King was the same. His immeasurable power was vast and mighty, but he was helpless as two Peerless Immortal Kings of the same level desperately stopped him.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Under the restraint of six third-level Creative Powers, it was difficult for him to move in a short time. He could only directly face the pouring down Great Destruction Power.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Great Destruction Power fell, and Lin Yuan's avatar body quickly collapsed, finally forcibly turning into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"So smooth?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King was a bit surprised. He originally thought that the Martial Ancestor's soul could escape.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor!!!" The Kaitian Immortal King was furious. He never thought that the Martial Ancestor would die. In the battle to ascend to the heavens, it was extremely rare for a Peerless Immortal King to perish.</p><p></p><p>"Despicable Lingxu Immortal King." The Supreme Immortal King's gaze was ice-cold as he stared at the Lingxu Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly seen the scene of the Lingxu Immortal King hiding in the dark to sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King coldly snorted, not caring at all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King seemed to sense something, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That is?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King lowered his head and looked towards the Sixth Heaven, Fifth Heaven, and Fourth Heaven below.</p><p></p><p>Within his perception, he vaguely sensed a series of trembling dull sounds coming from the lower heavens, as if some enormous creature was continuously trampling on various wondrous scenes, and at an unimaginable speed, it pierced through the heavens one after another, coming towards the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King could almost imagine that the numerous suppressions and restrictions of the Nine Heavens were as fragile as thin paper in front of that enormous creature.</p><p></p><p>Even the barriers between the heavens were easily torn apart by that enormous creature.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The ground of the Seventh Heaven collapsed, and a figure emitting boundless blood qi appeared above the Lingxu Immortal King, towering from above, indifferently looking down.</p><p></p><p>A sense of oppression as if the world was collapsing made the Lingxu Immortal King suffocate, almost kneeling down.</p>
